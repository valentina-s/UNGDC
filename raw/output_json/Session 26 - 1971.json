        "file_text": "Mr. President, the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago extends to you warmest congratulation on your election to the presidency of this twenty-sixth regular session of the General Assembly. We are especially happy that on this occasion that important office is occupied by a distinguished son of Asia who has proved himself internationally and who commands the respect and affection of all our countries. We take the opportunity also to express our deep appreciation to Mr. Edvard Hambro, who so skilfully presided over our deliberations last year.\n163.\tThe Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General, U Thant, who, for 10 particularly trying and difficult years of office, has discharged his onerous duties as Secretary- General at great personal sacrifice, with devotion and dedication. In his unique style he has succeeded in enhancing the role of the office of Secretary-General. The most fitting tribute which we, the international community, can pay him is to ensure that the United Nations achieves the goals and objectives for which he has so diligently labored. He takes with him our very best wishes for a long and happy retirement. We in Trinidad and Tobago recall with pleasure his visit to our country in 1966. Nothing would give us greater pleasure than to be able to welcome him as our official guest once again. This invitation is sincerely extended on behalf of the Prime Minister, the Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago.\n164.\tMy Government was very pleased to support the admission of the new States of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar to membership in the family of nations; and in welcoming them to our Organization we wish them every success in the attainment of the goals and ideals to which their Governments and peoples aspire.\n165.\tThe Trinidad and Tobago delegation wishes to re-emphasize its support for the principle of universality upon which the Charter was founded, and welcomes the progress made towards its full application. Our delegation recognizes the great contribution that the United Nations has made in hastening the process of political decolonization. We insist, however, that this process must be accelerated in those regions of the world still under the colonial yoke in any form whatsoever. Furthermore, we insist that the achievements of the United Nations in terms of political decolonization mu.! be matched by its contributions in the field of economic decolonization. We look to the United Nations for the promotion of economic decolonization through the intensification of its programs directed at assisting the less developed countries in their goal of economic and social development. We commend the adoption, last year, of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. It is our view that this Strategy would be futile unless it effectively ensured the sovereignty of the people over their natural wealth and resources.\n166.\tWithin the International Development Strategy for the Second Development Decade we wish to emphasize three points:\n(a)\tThe primary responsibility for development rests upon the countries themselves;\n(b)\tHowever great the efforts for development, based on this principle, the desired goals will not be achieved unless they are supported by increased multilateral financial resources and more favorable economic and commercial policies on the part of developed countries;\n(c)\tEconomic and social progress is the common responsibility of the entire international community.\nThose three points of the new global development strategy constitute the bed-rock of the strategy of development for Trinidad and Tobago.\n167.\tAllow me therefore to indicate the areas in which our own efforts towards development based on self-reliance may be complemented by appropriate policies on the part of the developed countries.\n168.\tIn our experience, development planning aimed merely at increasing per capita national income does not necessarily generate self-sustained growth. The United Nations must be prepared to promote global development policies to ensure that countries like Trinidad and Tobago generate growth from within their own economies. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago considers that such growth must also involve economic diversification, an equitable distribution of income, and a reduction in the levels of unemployment, underemployment and unemployability. Of particular relevance to this is the fact that Trinidad and Tobago, like most developing countries, is plagued by the pressing problem of population explosion. To meet this, we have, with the valuable assistance of the United Nations and the World Bank, instituted a family planning program. Another important feature of our national planning concerns the revision of the education system to ensure that the training and education of our population more adequately satisfy our manpower needs.\n169.\tInternational development policies must promote greater national control of the economy and of our national wealth and resources. This is necessary to guarantee that such resources are exploited in the interest of all the people of Trinidad and Tobago. We consider it desirable that foreign investment and external assistance be accommodated within the policy of greater national participation and control. One objective of greater national control is to maximize the positive effects of foreign investment and external assistance. Our policies, which have been clearly enunciated, have been designed to achieve this objective.\n170.\tThe global Development Strategy must ensure that the transfer and adaptation of technology satisfy the needs of developing countries. The widening technological gap between the poor nations and the rich nations contributes greatly to international instability, and this gap must be narrowed. In implementing the transfer of modern technology, however, developing countries must guard against the dehumanizing and other destructive effects of technological development.\n171.\tThe new International Development Strategy mi. involve the accelerated implementation of the policies of the first two sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. In the first place, we wish to draw attention to the question of tariffs and non-tariff barriers. As a small developing country with a limited national and regional market, the success of our development efforts depends heavily upon access to markets of developed countries as outlets for the expanding range of our manufactures. In this regard we cannot overemphasize the need for the developed countries to lower their tariffs and to eliminate other restrictive barriers.\n172.\tIn so far as the generalized scheme of preferences is concerned, we wish to emphasize that:\n(a)\tWithout exception, all developing countries should benefit from the scheme from the outset;\n(b)\tSpecial account should be taken of small developing countries in their initial stages of industrialization;\n(c) Sympathetic consideration should be given to those developing countries which now rely upon special preference for their economic survival.\n173.\tMention must also be made of the problem of freight rates, the spiraling increases of which adversely affect our development efforts.\n174.\tThe third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ is to be held in Santiago, Chile, in 1972. That session must accord to UNCTAD a greater role in promoting the objectives of the new International Development Strategy and must face the problems of access of exports of developing countries to the markets of the developed countries. My delegation feels that the developing countries are now thrust into new situations where their interests, internationally recognized, are in danger once more of being overridden and dismissed.\n175.\tI pause here to place on record the appreciation of Trinidad and Tobago for the assistance so far received from all the specialized agencies and institutions of the United Nations. We are particularly appreciative of the assistance we have received from the United Nations Development Program through the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in the promotion and development of a fishing industry in the Caribbean region, as we are island countries that are particularly dependent on the exploitation of our marine resources.\n176.\tWe expect further action within the United Nations to cope with the serious social problems affecting youth all over the world. Perhaps foremost among these is the increase in the use of addictive drugs. We require planned programs of preventive and corrective measures. In addition, we appeal for stricter international control and surveillance to combat the illicit international traffic in narcotics.\n177. Trinidad and Tobago is in favor of an international development strategy which would give our people greater control over the ownership and exploitation of its marine resources. This must, of necessity, involve the establishment of an indigenous technological capability in this sector. Trinidad and Tobago has repeatedly called on the United Nations and specialized agencies to expedite and intensify training programs for developing countries in marine science and technology. So far our expectations in this regard have not met with the desired response. We hope that within the next year regional oceanographic institutions will be established in some of the developing countries as part of the United Nations development programs. Trinidad and Tobago is prepared to provide a site for one of these oceanographic institutions in the internationally known Chaguaramas peninsula.\n178. In addition, we take this opportunity to reiterate the principle that the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, are the common heritage of mankind. This is the cardinal principle upon which the proposed international regime for the area must be founded. In precise terms, we envisage the establishment of a system in which all countries in this common heritage would participate directly, through appropriate international machinery, in the management of the sea-bed and the exploitation of its resources. \n\n179.\tTrinidad and Tobago has always considered that regional economic integration is a first essential step towards greater international economic co-operation. The formation of the Caribbean Free Trade Association [CARIFTA] has been that first step in implementing such a regional approach to development in the Caribbean area. The member Governments of CARIFTA are studying the feasibility of adopting a common external tariff and the harmonization of fiscal incentives to industry and ownership and control of regional resources with a view to ensuring special attention to the needs of the less developed countries within the region. The Caribbean Development Bank is playing a major role in these integration efforts. The member Governments are, however, concerned about integrationist movements in other parts of the world which might adopt policies inimical to the legitimate trading interests of the developing nations.\n180.\tWe have given our firm support to the initiatives in the United Nations on the problems relating to the natural environment. We consider that the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held at Stockholm in 1972, would be a useful forum for making a concerted attack on these problems. Trinidad and Tobago has already taken initiatives to institute new measures for the protection of the natural environment and the control of marine and air pollution. We are certain that the United Nations, in this new field of international endeavor, will take due account of the special needs and interests of developing countries.\n181.\tThe world today is agonized by dissension and conflict and divided by inequality. Today the world faces turmoil on every continent. Today the world faces the challenge of a revolution of ideas by our youth, who demand new values and new institutions. Today the world faces a return to economic power politics which could precipitate a new trade war that would benefit none and damage all. Today the world faces a change in international monetary bases that could adversely affect world trade and world stability. Today the world faces a new wave of protectionism that threatens to wipe out overnight all the progress that has been made in international trade negotiations by hard and unstinting labor over many long years. Today the world faces a resurgence of addiction to hallucinative drugs. Today the world faces a continued defiance of world opinion in matters of racial equality and treatment, clearly exemplified by those countries that will not grant to a man his basic right to be treated like a man. Today the world faces hunger and disease while billions of dollars are wasted on the creation of weapons that deal only death and destruction. Today the world faces the pollution of the natural environment, which threatens the very survival of the human race.\n182. How can these problems be solved? I venture to suggest, by international co-operation and consultation. Where can such co-operation and consultation take place? In the United Nations, where all the countries can sit and consult together. The bases are there. Let us devote ourselves seriously in the name of the generations to come to building a better world.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t  When I had the honor of coming to this rostrum of the first meeting of this session [1934th meeting] to address this Assembly for the first time, my first words naturally were words of congratulation to you, Mr. President, on your unanimous election to this high post, and to express also to this eminent Assembly our deepest gratitude at the very generous welcome which was extended to us unanimously on the occasion of our admission to this great United Nations family. Now that I am privileged to return to this rostrum and to participate in the general debate, I would like again to tell you, as the representative of an Asian State which has the closest ties of friendship and co-operation with your great country just how happy we are at your brilliant election to the presidency of the Assembly. We feel that your high qualities of wisdom, devotion and competence will be the surest warranty of the success of your task and of our work.\n2.\tIt is also a very agreeable opportunity for me to repeat our warmest words of thanks for the kind and courteous thoughts and words expressed to us by many distinguished delegations during the first meetings of this session, and for the outstanding statements which were made subsequently during the participation in the general debate.\n3.\tIt is with immense joy that I would like to greet the admission to the United Nations of the Arab State of Oman, to which we are attached through national identity based on the most fraternal bonds. We are happier to see it admitted to this international Organization because we feel convinced that the very close co-operation, which already exists between our two nations in order to contribute to their progress and prosperity and to that of other countries in the region to which we belong, will no longer be limited merely to this regional framework, but in the future will have as its aim the uniting of our devoted efforts with those of the United Nations in order to attain the highest objectives of the United Nations namely, the preservation and furtherance of the progress and prosperity of the entire international community-on the basis of the noble principles of our Charter, principles for which our Arab world has the deepest respect and the greatest attachment. On this glorious and historic occasion for the sister-State of Oman I should like to address our warmest congratulations to His Highness the Sultan of Oman, his Government and his people.\n4.\tMay I also take this opportunity to express our sincerest appreciation to our eminent Secretary-General for the altruism which he has demonstrated for the past 10 years in the service of mankind? The most objective and tireless efforts which he has unceasingly made during this long period a period which has been fraught with enormous difficulties for the realization of the ideals of our Organization-are deserving of our highest esteem. We deeply regret his decision not to prolong his term of office beyond this year, and we hope that this decision is not his final word in the matter.\n5.\tFor a new Member of the Organization, a study of the evolution of the United Nations over the 26 years of its existence is essential. Such colossal study, however, is greatly facilitated by the successive annual reports of the Secretaries-General, whose services the Organization has been so fortunate to have for all these years. The last report [A/8401/Add.lJ, which was submitted to this session by our present Secretary-General, UThant, has particularly attracted our attention. That survey of the main facts which characterize the life of our Organization inspires mixed feelings in us, however.\n6.\tIn the economic and social fields, our Organization can be proud of the work it has accomplished, which is studded with so many basic documents, from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of 10 December 1948 [resolution 217 (III)], to the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights of 16 December 1966 [resolution 2200 (XXI)].\n7.\tMoreover, the countries of the third world have reason to be satisfied. We can note in particular that the interests of those countries are being taken into consideration by the various United Nations bodies and are fin ling a useful forum within the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.\n8.\tUnited Nations activities in the technical assistance field, in all its forms, are constantly expanding and are producing many practical results. \n9.\tGeneral recognition of the principle of the right of States to their natural resources has made progress. At the same time the practical utilization of these resources has profited from the advice and assistance lavished on us by United Nations Committees and experts.\n10.\tIn this context, special mention must be made of the activities of the Committee on Natural Resources, the Special Fund of the United Nations Development Pro gramme, and the Resources and Transport Division of the Secretariat. We may expect an equally favorable development in the field of the peaceful uses of the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. During this session we shall be examining the report of the Committee set up by the General Assembly to study that problem,   the report on its summer session, held last July in Geneva [A/8421], Because of its geographic location and its special interests in the field of natural resources, Qatar will be most happy to contribute to the various United Nations agencies dealing with this problem the fruits of its modest experience and will be pleased to make use of the studies, recommendations and advice made available by the United Nations.\n11.\tQatar will adopt the same positive attitude towards the other United Nations activities devoted to economic and social development. We are duly appreciative of the efforts undertaken by the Economic and Social Council, its subsidiary bodies and specialized agencies, in the field of the mobilization of financial resources, foreign investment, economic and social planning, housing, transport and health.\n12.\tWe realize, of course, that in many of those fields we are still only half way along the road towards achieving the goals which seem to be indispensable if we are to create a world fit for all people to live in. We know, in particular, that relations between countries which have been industrialized for some time and those which are now developing are not yet free from the evil of colonialism and the desire for economic domination on the part of some. But we also know that we are working in the right direction, and we can hope that with each passing session of the General Assembly we shall be recording substantial progress.\n13.\tHowever, this method of gradual reforms can be allowed only in the economic and social fields. When it comes to the main lines of international politics, the United Nations does not have the right to adopt the same wait-and-see attitude. Thus we find that the reports of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples show that developments here are still far from being in keeping with the tasks which have been given to this Organization. Many peoples who are deserving of independence are still being kept in a state of subjection to foreign domination.\n14.\tThe perpetuation of a system of apartheid in some countries in Africa, in spite of the numerous decisions and recommendations of United Nations bodies, constitutes a real crime against mankind.\n15.\tAnd what must we say then about the shocking and unprecedented drama of the Palestinian people who have been fraudulently dispossessed of their homeland, who have been forcibly expelled from their homes, upon whom the aggressor has inflicted the most unspeakable miseries and most inhuman suffering, and whose right to self-determination has been recognized in all forums of the United Nations? What can we say to those people who continue to be deprived of the practical application of this right. This unspeakable drama whose perpetuation constitutes the most serious anomaly of our present international life-we might even say the most serious violation of moral and legal standards which govern this international life-is one which continues vainly to provoke the indignation of the international community which is quite aware that the idea of establishing a long-lasting peace in the Middle East cannot be considered without previously restoring to the people of Palestine their legitimate and inalienable rights.\n16.\tThere is no need whatsoever to say that as long as the movement towards independence of all peoples that are still under a foreign yoke is not completed, the United Nations will be unable to claim that it has concluded its development towards universalization. To be sure we are on the eve of decisive progress in this area. Indeed, the settlement of the Chinese question and the problem of the admission to the Organization of the so-called \\\"divided nations\\\" will bring the United Nations closer to the concept of universality. However, this universality cannot be fully achieved until all people that have a well-determined individuality are admitted, as independent members, to the family of the United Nations, a family which as the vocation of being an organization grouping together all peace-loving and justice- loving peoples of the world. If this ideal is not achieved there will continue to exist tensions and threats in the world which will endanger peace. But peace and security cannot be achieved without raising the question of the very existence of the world community and the United Nations which is the incarnation of that community.\n17.\tThese are not purely philosophical considerations. In the Middle East we are in fact witnessing a continuing conflict which is pitting the principles of peace and the prohibition of territorial acquisition through violence, the inviolability of borders and the rights of peoples to determine their own destiny, against a spirit of aggression, expansion and domination on the part of a certain State Member of this Organization. The illegal, aggressive and destructive action of Israel which has extended to Jerusalem, Gaza, Sinai, Golan and the West Bank of Jordan has been condemned unanimously by the other Members of the United Nations as a flagrant violation of international conventions and United Nations resolutions, resolutions which were dictated by the principles of our Charter. However, this condemnation has remained a platonic one because the United Nations, while firm in its attitude of principle, has adopted a passive attitude on the question of carrying out these unanimous decisions.\n18.\tThis session gives newly admitted States an opportunity to make known their views on current events and problems. Among these problems there is none more serious and urgent than the problem-which sums up all other problems-of the maintenance of peace and security.\n19.\tThis is a problem which has been especially highlighted by the adoption at our last session, on 16 December 1970, of resolution 2734 (XXV), the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security. In the preamble of the Declaration, the Assembly solemnly reaffirmed the universal and unconditional validity of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as the basis of relations among States. In the same resolution, which has 27 paragraphs, the Assembly basically calls on all States to observe the purposes and principles of the Charter in their respective relations and reaffirms that each State has a duty to refrain from resorting to threat or the use oF force against the territorial integrity or the political independence of any other State. It also recommends that the Security Council intensify its efforts in order to maintain international peace and security. This was not an academic intention but a resolution which is supposed to be a guideline for the Organization in its subsequent actions, with particular reference to those conflicts which continue to cause bloodshed in various parts of the world and which are a threat to the maintenance of international peace and . security.\n20.\tIn this connexion it is impossible to ignore the cruel inconsistency which exists in the Middle East between words and deeds. In spite of the repeated positions taken by various United Nations bodies and, in particular, by the General Assembly and the Security Council, the occupation of Arab territories by the aggressor State continues.\n21.\tThis is an extremely serious state of affairs to which, it is true, our Organization has not been insensitive. Just a few days ago on 25 September the Security Council adopted, by 14 votes to none, with 1 abstention, resolution 298 (1971) in which it urgently called upon the aggressor State to rescind all measures which it had taken during the last four years to change the status of Jerusalem. After it had reaffirmed its previous positions-resolutions 252 (1968) and 267 (i969)-and recalled once again \\\"the principle that acquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\\\", the Council deplored the violation by the aggressor State of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and requested the Secretary-General to report to it on the implementation of this new resolution.\n22.\tBut do we really have to point out that the time for these reports has now passed and that because of this persistent violation of law we must now expect something else from the United Nations? Hardly had this resolution of 25 September been adopted by the Security Council than it was rejected by the aggressor State, as if it was up to a State which is breaking the law to apply a resolution or not to apply it as it liked, and in this way to defy the conscience of the world.\n23.\tThe examples of Israel's scorn for the resolutions of the United Nations, which are governed by the principles of the Charter, as well as for the most elementary rules of international law and international morality, are unfortunately only too numerous. This attitude of a lack of respect has been adopted by Israel, stubbornly and unvaryingly, for 25 years. The facts and the evidence showing this to be true are incontestable. I shall not go into the background of this sombre affair before this Assembly, which is fully aware of it. However, it is important for us to note that the situation in the Middle East has become so serious that we might even legitimately consider that Israel's attitude, which brought it about, is one of the basic causes for the crisis which our Organization is presently going through.\n24.\tHow can we fail to see clearly the gravity of such a situation? It brings to mind the bitterest of memories, memories of the war in Ethiopia, which in its time sounded the death-knell of the League of Nations. If the United Nations were to accommodate itself to this Israeli challenge, it would be unable to prevent Members from experiencing feelings of insecurity, the final outcome of which would be the disintegration of the Organization as such. Each one of us, then, should repeat to himself in a paraphrase those prophetic words uttered many years ago by the Emperor of Ethiopia before the League of Nations, and say that each one of us should fear one day becoming someone else's Palestine.\n25.\tHow then could the scales be tipped by the achievements of the United Nations in the economic and social fields? We have seen and we all know that if w& are to continue to move towards progress in these areas the United Nations needs time. But at the same time we should make it clear that the time which the United Nations needs to develop its activities for the progress of mankind should be a time of peace. If the Organization shows itself to be incapable of ensuring this time of peace, then all of its past activities and its chances for the future will be reduced to nil. However, we all have the greatest need and the greatest desire that this activity should go on and that those chances should be preserved. But if this is to happen, then the United Nations must do everything in its power to restore peace, a true peace, and States and in this case the State which is opposed to this-must be required to heed the decisions which are regularly being taken by this Organization. The Charter gives us the means of attaining this end. It is only necessary for the Organization to have the will to use those means.\n26.\tIs there any need to point out that the piling up of resolutions which condemn the illegal activities and the attitude of Israel can be of no further use? It is quite clear and obvious that this type of resolution, unless bolstered up by effective measures, is, on the contrary, a type which may further weaken the authority of this international Organization, since Israel regularly opposes them with its traditional arrogant rejection and is systematically frustrating them.\n27.\tThe Foreign Minister of Israel, before this Assembly on Thursday, 30 September last, declared: \\\"This Organization, for all its imperfections, is still the only organized expression of the planetary spirit\\\" [1946th meeting, para. Ill). Well, if this is the case, how can he expect us to accept his proposal which discredits the various resolutions of this Organization which were intended to show the road towards a just and lasting peace in the Middle East? How can we follow the road which he is suggesting? Those resolutions, which reflect the planetary spirit and which are inspiring the international life of our age, an age which is governed by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, condemn the policy of aggression of Israel and enjoin Israel urgently to respect the legitimate rights of the Arab States which have been the victims of aggression, and to restore to them their territories which have been invaded through armed force.\n28.\tHence the only solution which is indicated here would be for Israel to heed the resolutions of this Organization and for the competent organs of this Organization to ensure respect for its resolutions by all means at their disposal. Any other proposal of the type suggested by the Foreign Minister of Israel is only intended to maintain the illegality of a fait accompli which has been brought about through military force and which has been condemned by the United Nations. It is true that all those interpretations of the resolutions of the Organization in this matter, which do not contain a categorical affirmation of the urgent need for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab territories which they occupied after 5 June 1967, would be purely and simply the equivalent of deliberate support for the sinister desire to perpetuate the fait accompli to which I have just referred.\n29.\tIsrael's refusal to heed the decisions of the Organization in an area which affects the maintenance of world peace has lasted for a long time now without the Organization having taken any effective measures intended to cause this State to mend its ways. Nevertheless-and we cannot repeat this too often-it has a whole arsenal of measures of this type: we have economic sanctions, the other measures in Chapter VII of the Charter and the procedure for expelling a State. It is urgent that the United Nations should frankly take a decision to use every avenue open to it under the Charter and to compel Israel to submit to international order. If the United Nations vacillates any longer in taking this road, then it will be in danger of admitting its inability to carry out its essential mission cf maintaining peace or, if necessary, of restoring peace, which is the supreme asset and the permanent justification of the Organization.\n30.\tHowever, in spite of everything, the world continues to hope that our Organization will not tolerate this anarchy created by the acts of a Member State and that it will, at however late a stage, eventually hasten to discharge its main responsibility which is the source of a J its other responsibilities that of ensuring respect for the rule of law and for the purposes and principles of our Charter. That is the frank and direct path towards international peace and security. The others, which are uncertain and tortuous, can lead only to the wrecking of that international order which cannot exist outside the rule of law.\n31.\tMay the sense of responsibility towards the present and the future of the world on the one hand and the great hopes which mankind has in the Organization on the other hand inspire all of us, in particular those among us who shoulder the greatest responsibilities and the most direct powers, with a determination to act in concert in order to avoid the road of disaster, a road which leads to destruction of the international order; and may they take the right road, the road which leads to the building of a just peace and lasting security, to which the international community aspires.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, I am glad to have the opportunity today of congratulating you on your election to the office of President of the General Assembly, one which my delegation is sure you will fill with great distinction.\n2.\tI should like at the same time to pay a tribute to your predecessor, who guided our deliberations so successfully during the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly and the special commemorative session,\n3.\tWhen I addressed the General Assembly last year [1857th meeting], I referred in some detail to the progress made by the South African Government in implementing and promoting the ideal of self-determination for all the different nations which comprise the population of South Africa. Since then I have been encouraged by the display of interest in these developments in many quarters, including countries in Africa. I have, therefore, decided to expand on my remarks of a year ago.\n4.\tLast year I outlined to this Assembly our program in the political field. I stressed that for a number of years my Government had been develop*- j, the political institutions of the various nations in South Africa. As early as in 1951 and again in 1959, legislation was passed to provide for various types of Bantu authorities on the regional and territorial level. A number of such authorities was established, and provided valuable experience in the art of government. In the Transkei, self-government was conferred as far back as 1963. Since then the Transkei has held two general elections. During 1969 and 1970 eight additional territorial governments were established. I said, therefore, that each of the nations living in South Africa had acquired some form of self-government.\n5.\tDuring the past year we continued on this road, seeking to accelerate the progress towards self-determination, moving forward step by step in consultation with the nations concerned. Ministers and officials were constantly engaged in discussion with the Bantu, the Colored and the Indian peoples.\n6.\tArising from these consultations, legislation was passed enabling the Government to proceed with the constitutional development of the various homelands in the light of prevailing circumstances.\n7.\tLegislative assembly status was granted to the Tswana, Lebowa, Ciskei, Venda, Machangana and Basotho homelands. Some of these territories will shortly advance to the stage of full self-government. They will attain the same political status as the Transkei and will be that much closer to the eventual goal of full and sovereign independence.\n8.\tThe South African Prime Minister himself very recently held discussions with the members of the Colored People's Representative Council, representing the Colored population group, and the governing bodies of the Ciskei, the Tswanas, the Basothos, the Zulus and the Tsongas. In company, inter alia, with the Minister of Finance, he also recently visited the Venda, Lebowa, Tswana and Machangana homelands, with a population of some 4.5 million, in order to confer with their representatives and to gauge at fust-hand the extent of their progress towards self- determination.\n9.\tThese visits are an integral part of our policy of consultation with the different population groups and have been warmly welcomed as such by all concerned. Indeed, as the Sunday Times, a South African newspaper, which opposes my Government's policies, wrote on 1 August of this year;\n\\\"From all accounts* Mr. Vorster's tour has been a great success in the sense of fostering dialog with homeland leaders and making personal contact with the various populations which turned out in their thousands at each function...\\\".\n10.\tThe Rand Daily Mail, another South African paper, which is also opposed to our policies, commented in similar vein. It reported that the Prime Minister's visits had improved the relationship between black and white in. South Africa.\nA/PV.1946\n11.\tThe road to self-determination is not always an easy one. However, the South African Government is doing all it can to assist the peoples on this road. It is still too early to say exactly when the Bantu peoples will attain their full independence, when they will become sovereign and be able to play their part in the world at large and also in this Organization. It depends in large measure upon themselves \nand the progress that they make. But they have the right to negotiate at any time with us for the attainment of independence. We do not impose conditions on their right to approach us. We shall listen to them at any time that they feel the moment has arrived to ask for independence.\n12.\tIn this way we shall achieve our ultimate aim of making it possible for the various nations to be associated with one another in mutual harmony and acceptance of each other in a South African constellation of independent nations where no nation would be governed by another.\n13.\tConsultation fosters co-operation, and without co-operation there can be no real progress on either the internal or the international level. Internally it is necessary for the smooth realization of self-determination and for the material as well as the moral well-being of the various nations. Internationally it is necessary for the greater prosperity and peace of nations, especially for those of us on the African continent.\n14.\tI have have already outlined how this co-operation is being achieved through consultations within South Africa itself. The political development of the various homelands to which I have referred is not something imposed arbitrarily upon those nations. Each one plays an active part in this development.\n15- I have emphasized the importance of consultation in our efforts to co-operate smoothly within the borders of South Africa because there are those who condemn our policy of dialog and contact with other African States on the alleged ground that my Government should rather first conduct a dialog with its own peoples. As I have indicated, that is precisely what we are doing.\n16.\tIt is our firm policy to co-operate to the fullest extent possible also with all other countries, including those of Africa. For South Africa is as much a part of Africa as any other African State and we have a vital interest in our continent's peace and prosperity.\n17.\tDuring recent years the emphasis in Africa has been placed more and more on the need for development. The developing States have had to contend with various problems in the economic, health, educational, technical and agricultural fields. And where South Africa has in some instances been able to co-operate in the solution of those problems, it has been happy to do so.\n18.\tWe have, for example, assisted various other African States by way of famine relief, we co-operate with them in respect of the supply of electricity, health and welfare services, the marketing of agricultural produce, the provision of low-interest loans and the planning and construction of various long-term development projects.- The private sector in South Africa has also played its part by assisting African countries in the field of tourism, for instance, with the opening of hotels and, in the field of industrial development and transport, with the establishment of factories, plants and works and the construction of railways.\n19.\tThere are no strings attached to our co-operation; we have tried to help others to help themselves. We believe that progress and economic, growth lead to greater stability at home and hence throughout the continent.\n20.\tWe welcome discussions with any State in Africa which desires to talk to us. We have much to discuss and discussion could well be the first step towards co-operation in many fields of mutual interest. My Prime Minister has' said that he is prepared even to discuss our internal policies with those genuinely interested in conducting a dialog with us.\n21.\tThroughout our history we have firmly believed in living in friendship and harmony with our neighbors and with those further afield. We do not interfere in their internal affairs. We pose no threat to anyone. We are willing at any time to conclude solemn treaties for the preservation of peace with any African country. We believe in communication with our own peoples and with the peoples of Africa. Without communication we cannot hope to solve our problems. Proof of our sincerity in this respect is to be found in our action in the past year. Thus we have continued to make contact with other African States. My Prime Minister, for instance, last year visited Malawi at the invitation of its President, Dr. Banda.\n22.\tIn November last I led a delegation to another neighboring State to discuss with the Government concerned matters of mutual economic and technical interest and to conclude agreements in connexion with development projects. During this year an official delegation from the same country in turn visited South Africa. In addition, discussions were held .with heads of government and ministers of other neighboring States.\n23.\tLess than two months ago we were proud to welcome to South Africa the Life President of the Republic of Malawi, H.E. H. Kamuzu Banda. The occasion was a historic and significant one, for it marked the first official visit of an African Head of State to my country.\n24.\tPresident Banda has made it clear that there are aspects of our domestic policies which he cannot support. Nevertheless, he came to talk to us. As he said:\n\\\"I came here because I sincerely believe in co-operation not only in material things but also in spiritual things ... co-operation of the spirit, co-operation of ideas.... The main reason why we should meet is because if we do not agree and we do not meet, how are we going to resolve our problems? \\\"\n25.\tThe visit of President Banda was an unqualified success. He received a most enthusiastic-indeed, tumultuous-reception from all the South African peoples. President Banda himself remarked on the warmth of the welcome accorded him by the entire population. That, he saiJ, contrasted sharply with what he had been told in certain circles, namely that the black peoples of southern Africa disliked the idea of an African statesman cooperating with the South African Government. In other words the policy of contact and communication between the South African Government and other African Governments is welcome also to the black peoples of South Africa, contrary to what has been alleged.\n26.\tPresident Banda saw his visit as a mission to build a bridge between the peoples of our respective countries. His mission captured the imagination of black, Indian, Colored and white alike. In welcoming him we were honored to receive a great and far-sighted son of Africa.\n27.\tOur domestic and foreign policies are founded on the principles of mutual respect and tolerance for the other man's point of view. We believe that South Africa has a considerable contribution to make to Africa's development and prosperity. By the same token, we realize that we have much to learn from other States of Africa. Although our social, political and economic systems may differ, experience has proved that there need be no barriers to co-operation between parties with a common interest in Africa's welfare. Lack of knowledge and policies of isolation inevitably magnify difference. And we are glad to hear more and more of the voices of Africa calling for a departure from the sterile pattern of the past and for a new approach to the issues which seemingly divide us.\n28.\tIn the words of the South African Prime Minister:\n\\\"I know of nothing ... that stands in the way of better understanding between South Africa and other nations who seek peace and prosperity for the peoples of the world and especially for Africa.\\\"\n29.\tSurely, policies of communication, co-operation and accommodation such as I have outlined are appropriate to the spirit of detente and reconciliation which is meeting with increasing acceptance by the international community. Surely, those policies are essential for Africa, if Africa as a whole is to prosper and inherit the greatness which should be its destiny. Surely, those policies are the policies of peace which inspired the Charter, which are the essence of the Charter and which should continue to inspire us all.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, I should like first of all to associate myself with the previous speakers who have congratulated you on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The United States is confident that you will pursue the ideals of the Charter with the same dedication as your distinguished predecessors.\n\n2.\tThe United Nations is an important instrument of peace. It is also the repository of many of the world's hopes. We must ensure that it is true to those hopes; that we here assembled-the representatives of 130 nations- meet our high responsibilities not only to our own world but to the world of the future.\n3.\tBuilding a structure of peace-a structure that will stand-requires patience, dedication and realism. Working at peace working at it seriously means more than long hours of careful deliberation. It means putting aside preconceptions; it means weighing carefully what our real interests are, not only as citizens of our own countries, but also as citizens of the world. It means proceeding with urgency, but without impatience; steadfastly, but not stubbornly. And it means recognizing that differences exist, and will continue to exist-differences of view, differences of interests, different systems and different values-and that one of the functions of a structure of peace is to protect and accommodate those differences, not to destroy them.\n4.\tIt is appropriate, I think, to take note of the fact that, by any objective standard, the world is a more peaceful place than it was just a few years ago.\n5.\tIn Africa;, the conflict in Nigeria is now long over. Because of recent developments, prospects in the Far East seem more hopeful. Fighting in Indo-China, though it continues, has been substantially reduced. The cease-fire still holds in the Middle East. The division of Europe is less\n\n\nthreatening because the first stage of agreement has been reached on Berlin. Concrete agreements have been achieved on the periphery of the arms race, and encouraging progress is being made at its center.\n6.\tYet there are areas-above all, in South Asia where political instability has tipped the balance toward greater tension. There, man's ancient, enemies-poverty, hunger and disease-gain headway, nurturing within themselves seeds of further unrest. And even in areas where recent progress has been made, tensions remain, and the threat of renewed or increased hostilities continues.\n7.\tThat is why we must accelerate our efforts for peace. The achievement of a peaceful world will depend, not just, on the efforts of a handful of powers, but on the efforts of all Governments.\n8.\tIn recent years we have seen a new diversification of power and influence among the nations of the world. Most colonial States have won their independence and now exert a marked impact on world affairs. Japan has found remarkable new strength. The movement towards cohesion in Western Europe has quickened. This diversified and interdependent world is clearly preferable to the bipolar world which emerged from the Second World War. Nevertheless, relations between the Soviet Union and the United States-both large, continental States, both nuclear States and both dynamic States-are of fundamental importance.\n9.\tNothing could better serve the cause of peace than a further relaxation of tension between our two countries and the elimination of its by-product-the arms race.\n10.\tThe foreseeable future cannot, of course, be expected to bring an end to the differences between the Soviet and United States political systems or to the competition between us. But it can bring important and beneficial changes in our relations. Many agreements have been achieved in recent years between us. The success of those agreements has stimulated the effort to negotiate still others. Collectively they could promote not just \\\"coexistence\\\" but-if we proceed to build on durable foundations \\\"co-operation\\\" as well.\n11.\tOur desire to lay the foundations for such cooperation is in no way lessened by our policy of seeking to improve relations with the People's Republic of China. And we have taken due note of the Soviet Foreign Minister's statement that the Soviet Union regards the normalization or our relations with the People's Republic of China as a \\\"natural development\\\".\n12.\tThough efforts at improvement in Soviet-United States and in Soviet-European relations have assumed many \nforms, the two most important have been the negotiations on strategic arms and on Berlin.\n13.\tA Berlin agreement will be a milestone along the road to a more peaceful and co-operative Europe. Pivotal in the portion already agreed to is the firm commitment to unrestricted transit traffic of civilian persons and goods between the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin. Particularly significant is the obligation the Soviet Union has undertaken to ensure that this traffic will be unimpeded, that it will be facilitated and that it will receive preferential treatment.\n14.\tThe value of this agreement will depend, not on how the obligations have been formulated on paper, but on how they will be carried out on the ground. Truly unhindered movement to and from Berlin would greatly reduce tensions and remove one of Europe's most dangerous flash-points. Half-hearted or grudging implementation of the agreement would only perpetuate fears and suspicions, The willingness of the German Democratic Republic, in its discussions with the Federal Republic of Germany, to translate general obligations into specific commitments and subsequently to put those commitments into actual practice will be the crucial test.\n15.\tThe achievement of a final Berlin agreement and its effective implementation could lead to broader progress. It would, for example, make more realistic the prospects of a European conference with United States and Canadian participation. It would accelerate the movement desired by the people of Eastern as well as of Western Europe-- towards the reduction of tensions on the continent.\n16.\tIt is to this end that the United States is pursuing the possibilities of negotiation on a mutual and balanced reduction of military forces in Europe.\n17.\tTwo years ago President Nixon pledged to the General Assembly that the United States was determined to limit, and then reverse, the build-up of strategic arms. He said we intended to conduct our negotiations with the Soviet Union \\\"soberly and seriously... seeking to reach agreements rather than to make propaganda\\\" [1755th meeting, para. 69J.\n18.\tIn May of this year the United States and the Soviet Union announced their intention to achieve agreement on both defensive and offensive strategic arms, initiating a new stage of intensive work. As a result, although no agreement has yet been reached, we have come closer together on the concepts and details of an agreement to limit anti-ballistic missile systems. On 20 May we made an announcement that contemplates that agreements to limit defensive and offensive weapons will be reached \\\"together\\\". When talks resume in Vienna next month it is therefore agreed that discussions in greater detail will be undertaken on the limitation of offensive weapons.\n19.\tMeanwhile, these negotiations have already produced two valuable agreements, one on preventing nuclear accidents from leading to war and the other on improving \\\"hot line\\\" communications between Washington and Moscow by use of satellites,\n20.\tThere has also been encouraging movement in multi-lateral negotiations. Here, too, the United States intends to work constructively for further concrete results. In particular, we urge this session of the General Assembly to seek broad ratification of the draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and their destruction [A/8457-DC/234, annex A],\n21.\tThe Soviet Union has suggested the creation of a periodic world disarmament conference to be established outside the United Nations [1942nd meeting, paras. 158' 159J. Frankly, we are skeptical that such a generalized approach would produce specific accomplishments. All post-war experience indicates that a concrete, step-by-step approach offers better prospects for success than more grandiose schemes, which tend to generate many words but few results.\n22.\tAt a time when the prospects are promising for participation in the United Nations by the People's Republic of China, and perhaps others as well, there would seem to be no reason for establishing still more world disarmament machinery outside the United Nations framework.\n23.\tAccommodations among the stronger nations of the World are vital elements of a lasting peace. But the road to enduring peace is no short cut, passing only through the capitals of the strong. The road to peace must traverse every region where there are human beings who aspire to a better condition of life.\n24.\tIn Africa, where the right to a freer existence is still denied to many, we are constant in our support of practical and peaceful means to achieve self-determination and end racial discrimination. That is the policy which President Nixon and I were pleased to confirm to the President of Mauritania and the distinguished delegation from the Organization of African Unity in Washington last week. Consistent with that objective ve have decided to accept the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences for States of South Africa's continuing occupation of Namibia. .\n25.\tIn South-East Asia, as we proceed with an orderly military withdrawal from Viet-Nam, we will continue to make substantial efforts to aid the region's economic progress.\n26.\tIn this hemisphere, we are moving towards a relation-ship of equal partnership in which rights and responsibilities are shared. We are conscious that such a relationship requires economic growth, greater opportunities for trade, and closer economic co-operation among us.\n27.\tI especially wish to emphasize our undiminished concern for the economic health of the nations of Latin America and other nations of the developing world at a time when the new economic policy of the United States may have raised certain questions,\n28.\tOur objectives have not changed. We are not adopting a policy of economic nationalism. We have not abandoned our efforts to assist developing countries-through trade, through aid and through investment. Our faith in a free and open system of economic relations among States has not diminished.\n29.\tWe seek a stronger economy at home. We seek also a more equitable international economic system which meets present-day conditions and thus gives even greater encouragement to the flow of goods and capital across borders. Such a system would contribute to the prosperity of all the world's people, in developing and developed countries alike.\n30.\tThis Organization, during this session, faces a decision on the China question-a decision with major consequences for the United Nations.\n31.\tIn our interdependent world, no significant segment of the world's population and of the world's power should be isolated. It was this consideration which led President Nixon to alter the China policy of the United States. To pursue a policy which did not respond to present realities would risk the future for the sake of the past . On the other hand, to seek to improve relations with the People's Republic of China, and to contribute to its greater contact with the international community, could foster prospects for a stable peace in years to come.\n32.\tThus, President Nixon began over two years ago, unilaterally and at first without response, to improve bilateral relations. Recently, he resolved to move decisively into a new era of relations by accepting an invitation to visit Peking before 1 May 1972. And he decided to support the seating of the People's Republic of China in the General Assembly and as a permanent member of the Security Council.\n33.\tThe United States wants to see the People's Republic of China come to the Assembly, take its seat, and participate. We want to see it assume, as a permanent member of the Security Council, the rights and responsibilities which go with that status. On the seating of the People's Republic of China there is widespread agreement in this body.\n34.\tThis Assembly does, however, face a related and momentous issue. It could become the first Assembly in United Nations history to take action to expel a Member -an action which would have the effect of expelling 14 million people from its councils. The path of expulsion is perilous. To open it for one would be to open it for many.\n35.\tSo the United States and 16 other countries have introduced a draft resolution [A/L.633] which would seat the People's Republic of China as a permanent member of the Security Council, while providing representation both for it and for the Republic of China in the General Assembly. That resolution is based on political reality and on basic equity.\n36.\tIt is only realistic to recognize a factual situation which has persisted for more than 20 years: that two Governments now exercise authority over territory and over people who were given representation in the United Nations when China ratified the Charter in 1945 as an original Member.\n37.\tIt is only realistic that all the Chinese people who were once represented there should again be represented and represented by those who actually govern them.\n38.\tIt is only realistic that the Security Council seat should be filled by the People's Republic of China, which exercises control over the largest number of people of all the world's Governments.\n39.\tIt would be unrealistic to expel from this body the Republic of China, which governs a population of Taiwan larger than the populations of two 'thirds of the 130 United Nations Members.\n40.\tFurther, it would be unjust to expel a Member which has participated for over 25 years in the world of this Organization with unfailing devotion to the principles set forth in the Charter.\n41.\tThe proposal that both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China should be represented in the United Nations should commend itself to Member States of varying national policies.\n42.\tIt would assure that the long-prevailing de facto situation in China is reflected in United Nations representation; but it does not ask Member States to alter their recognition policies or their bilateral relations.\n43.\tIt would provide representation for the people concerned by those who actually govern them; but it does not divide China into two separate States; after all, we all know that Byelorussia and the Ukraine are not separate States.\n44.\tThe dual representation draft resolution is founded on the reality of the current situation; but it does not seek to freeze that situation for the future, as it expressly provides that the present decision is without prejudice to a future settlement.\n45.\tIn short, the dual representation draft resolution asks simply, and only, that the United Nations take account of the situation as it exists today, and give all the people of China representation in this Organization. As the Charter has accommodated practical solutions of other unusual situations in the past,, so it is flexible enough to accommodate the realities of this one.\n46.\tThe other proposal before this Assembly the draft resolution advanced by A'bania and others [AjL.630 and Add. 1 ] -is punitive in substance and in intent. It does not seek to deal with facts, but to excoriate and condemn. Its essence is not to admit the People's Republic of China, but to expel the Republic of China and to expel it \\\"forthwith\\\". That draft resolution would exacerbate, not harmonize, relations in Asia. And it would weaken, not strengthen, the moral and political fiber of this Organization.\n47.\tThe issue, then, before this body is the issue of expulsion. That is why we have proposed a draft resolution, which we refer to as the \\\"important question draft resolution\\\" but which more properly should be referred to as the \\\"non-expulsion draft resolution\\\" [AjL.632]. This draft resolution requires a two-thirds vote to expel a present Member of the United Nations. It is consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Charter,\n48.\tSome Members have argued that, whatever the equities and realism of our proposal to maintain the representation of the Republic of China, it should not be supported because they feel that the People's Republic of China would refuse to take its seat. Such predictions are hazardous. Certainly the People's Republic of China may be expected to oppose the proposal so long as there is any possibility for a draft resolution that meets its maximum demands. But just as certainly, after a General Assembly decision providing the People's Republic of China with the status of a permanent member of, and with a seat on, the Security Council but not expelling the Republic of China, a new situation would exist. In any event, I submit, in deciding how to vote we should look more to what the United Nations should do.\n49.\tIt is ironic that, just as the sentiment for universality in the Assembly is growing, many of those who have long extolled it now seek to violate it. If the United Nations is to. embrace universality-as some have suggested then surely the admission of one Member should not be accompanied by the expulsion of another.\n50.\tOur task here, it seems to me, must be to make a decision that is reasonable, that accepts the realities of the existing situation, that does not prejudice the ultimate outcome and that provides for representation of all the people concerned. Thereafter, our efforts should be to convince those directly involved to take advantage of the decision we have made. The cause of peace has been greatly benefited in recent years by greater pragmatism in many capitals. It would be served by the same pragmatism on this issue.\n51.\tAs the United Nations becomes a more universal body it will be better able to deal with the lengthening list of global issues confronting it: in conciliating political differences, in reducing the world's armaments, in curbing the epidemic spread of narcotics addiction, in protecting the environment, in assuring the exploitation of the oceans for the benefit of mankind.\n52.\tIn meeting those responsibilities the United Nations must during this session deal with two important matters.\n53.\tIt must choose an outstanding successor to our most able and distinguished Secretary-General, UThant, to whose dedication and idealism we all pay a tribute. And, as I pay respects to the Secretary-General, I am sure my colleagues will understand if I also single out for special attention two United States citizens who are now retiring -Paul Hoffman, the Administrator of the United Nations Development Program, who has devoted himself so effectively to the economic welfare of the developing countries, and Ralph Bunche, Under-Secretary-General for Special Political Affairs, and a Nobel Prize winner, who has contributed so markedly to the cause of peace.\n54.\tThe Assembly must also arrest the continuing deterioration of the United Nations financial position, which, as the Secretary-General has pointed out [A/8401/Add.lJ, has eroded its fiscal credit and undermined confidence in its potential. Responsibility for halting that decline rests primarily on those who fail to pay their share. Given assurances of adequate contributions by others, the United States will be prepared to assist towards an over-all solution. Meanwhile we find it hard to understand why the membership should continue to recommend and approve budget increases beyond those necessary to meet inescapable cost increases.\n55.\tIn two parts of the world in which the United Nations has been particularly active-South Asia and the Middle East urgent progress is needed.\n56.\tIn South Asia, renewed and more widespread violence is an ever-present possibility. The events in East Pakistan are internal events with which the Government and people of Pakistan must deal. But their consequences the flight of refugees into India, the danger of famine, the threat to peace in South Asia-are of grave concern to all nations.\n57.\tTo restore peaceful conditions and to save human lives it is clear that restraint must be exercised in the subcontinent; that the international assistance Program must be expanded to avert famine and to create conditions to encourage the return of refugees; and that efforts towards an effective political settlement in East Pakistan must be actively pursued. We are working to those ends.\n58.\tThe United States strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations to organize an effective international relief Program. We have made available over $200 million for relief in bast Pakistan and for emergency assistance for the refugees in India-well over 50 per cent of the total contributions from all foreign contributors, public and private. Last week, President Nixon asked Congress to appropriate an additional $250 million to sustain a high level of relief assistance. A much wider response from other countries is clearly required. We urge the major powers and others with substantial financial resources to contribute generously.\n59.\tThe other place where progress is urgently required is the Middle East. Over several years the United Nations has made determined and persistent efforts to achieve a lasting peace in that critical area. None the less the opportunities for success and the risks of failure remain in precarious balance.\n60.\tSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967), establishing the principles for a durable peace, was the first major step towards reason after 18 years of belligerency and a fragile, often violated, armistice.\n61.\tThe cease-fire along the Suez Canal, now nearing its fifteenth month, was the second major step away from war.\n62.\tIt is time for a third major step towards peace.\n63.\tFor four years Ambassador Jarring has worked diligently to secure the agreement called for in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We support his efforts. We believe his mission remains the best path to an over-all settlement and to lasting peace. Our views on such a final peace settlement remain those expressed in President Nixon's foreign policy report earlier this year and in my statement of 9 December 1969,\n64.\tBoth sides to the conflict are committed to the fundamental and reciprocal principles to which the Jarring mission is dedicated: living in peace with each other and withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 conflict as set forth in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Despite those commitments a deep gulf ot suspicion and distrust remains.\n65.\tEach side is convinced of the justice of its cause. Each is concerned about its future security. A political settlement based on mutual accommodation could assure both. An attempt to achieve these ends by force will destroy all possibilities for either.\n66.\tThat is why we believe a third major step towards peace is essential -a step that can be taken now; a step that is practical; a step that could help create the confidence and trust which are now lacking; a step towards full and complete implementation of resolution 242 (1967).\n67.\tThat step is an interim Suez Canal agreement. That is why the United States has welcomed the interest of both Egypt and Israel in such an agreement. That is why, at the request of the parties, the United States has undertaken to play a constructive role in the process of arriving at an agreement.\n68.\tIn order to explore the positions of each side, we have discussed concrete and specific ideas designed to meet the legitimate needs and concerns of both sides. Those ideas, given willingness and good intentions on both sides, could become the basis for a breakthrough. They require further quiet discussions with the parties, an undertaking we now hope can be expedited along the following lines.\n69.\tA first point is the relationship between an interim agreement and an over-all settlement. A fair approach should be founded on two basic principles:\n-That a Suez Canal agreement is merely a step towards complete and full implementation of resolution 242 (1967) within a reasonable period of time, and not an end in itself-that has to be clearly established in any agreement; also\n-That neither side can realistically expect \\to achieve, as part of an interim agreement, complete agreement on the terms and conditions of an over-all settlement -if it could, there would be no necessity for an interim agreement.\nThose final terms and conditions will have to be worked out through negotiations under Ambassador Jarring's auspices. And we would hope that if an interim agreement was reached, active negotiations under Ambassador Jarring's auspices could be renewed.\n70.\tA second point is the matter of the cease-fire. Its maintenance is in the interest of all of us, of everyone concerned, of everyone in this room, in fact in the interest of the whole world. The ultimate objective, of course, is a permanent end to belligerency, as part of a final, binding peace agreement. But such a commitment is not realizable in the context of an interim agreement. Neither would a cease-fire of short duration be realistic. With goodwill on both sides, it should be possible to find common under-standing between the parties on this issue.\n71.\tThird is the zone of withdrawal. There are, of course, very important strategic considerations involved in this key point. However, based on our discussions, we believe it should be possible to meet the principal concerns of both sides. Without going into the details, I would merely say that I believe that in the long run the most significant aspect of an interim agreement might prove to be that it established the principle of withdrawal looking to an over-all settlement as a fact rather than as a theory.\n72.\tFourth is the nature of the supervisory arrangements. Both sides must have confidence that the agreement will not be violated and that adequate machinery will be provided for prompt detection of any infractions. We are confident that ways reassuring to both Israel and Egypt can be found for altering and strengthening the supervisory mechanisms that have existed in the area for the past two decades.\n73.\tFifth is the question of an Egyptian presence east of the Suez Canal. The reopening and operation of the Suez Canal would require Egyptian personnel east of the Canal. It is understandable, too, that normal activities should be pursued in as much of the zone evacuated as possible. The question of an Egyptian military presence east of the Canal is one on which the parties hold opposite views. But here too, based on our discussion, we believe that there are possibilities for compromise on this issue.\n74.\tSixth is the use of the Suez Canal. The United States has long held that the Canal should be open to passage for all nations, without discrimination. This principle is clear in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). What is at present at issue in considering an interim agreement is principally the timing at which this right could be exercised. We believe an accommodation on this point is quite possible.\n75.\tWith those six points in mind, let me say this: because the parties have asked us, we intend to continue our determined effort to assist them in arriving at an interim agreement. This effort, we believe, is imperative because  and I think it is important to keep this in mind there is no more realistic and hopeful alternative to pursue.\n76.\tThere are risks to peace: but the greater risk is inaction, unwillingness to face up to the hard decisions. A practical step now-an interim agreement-would make the next step toward peace less difficult for all the parties to take. It would restore the use of the Suez Canal as a waterway for international shipping. It would re-establish Egypt's authority over a major national asset. It would separate the combatants. It would produce the first Israeli withdrawal. It would extend the cease-fire. It would diminish the risk of major-power involvement. It would be an important step toward the complete implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n77.\tI submit that the logic for such an agreement is overwhelming. If the leaders of the area would grasp this opportunity, they would give new hope to their peoples for tranquility, for progress and for peace.\n78.\tIn all of our efforts, both in the United Nations and elsewhere, we should recall that nothing we do matters so much as the legacy we leave to those who follow, the bridge that we build between the past and the future. There is a tendency, especially when tensions are high and tempers short, to regard the present as the focal point of all of man's history. But ours is only the latest generation, not the last generation; and nothing we leave to future generations will matter so much as a structure of enduring peace.\n79.\tPeace must be achieved and maintained, not by the decree of a few, but by accommodation among many. Each Government, in upholding its people's particular interests, must also advance the world interest in a peace which will endure.\n80.\tTo that interest the United Nations, from its creation, has been dedicated.\n81.\tTo that interest the United States pledges anew its best efforts.\n\n\n\n"

The popular election was won by the current President, General Arana Osorio, supported by the then opposition parties.

The people of Guatemala have exercised their right to self-determination, selecting their Government through suffrage and thus strengthening our democratic and institutional vocation.\n91.\tMy Government accepted the responsibility of encouraging serious and planned action at the highest national level to ensure the economic, social, cultural and all other types of development of the country without party discrimination. Our achievements are open for all to see, and all the problems confronted by the Country have been tackled systematically by the organs of the State to ensure their solution within the process of over-all and comprehensive development. That action, which is so necessary for progress, has faced certain setbacks which have hampered greater success.\n92.\tIn fact, Guatemala, like so many democratic countries of the world, suffered from an intensive divisive campaign, inspired and supported from outside the country, which afflicted the country with waves of violence and subversion by extremists and clandestine factions. In its international coexistence, as far as the sovereignty and independence of other States is concerned Guatemala has respected and complied with its commitments; and, therefore, in return we insist that the same respect be shown to our own sovereignty and we reject any intervention in our domestic affairs. In order to carry out joint measures to control the danger represented by violence and subversion, which are spreading in the democratic countries, we have supported the American regional draft conventions to prevent and take sanctions against acts of terrorism, kidnapping and violence, although thus far the measures adopted have not been as efficacious as we have hoped, It is obvious that this situation threatens international peace and security and that this United Nations, whose primordial function is specifically to maintain international peace and security, should adopt measures leading to the elimination of an international conspiracy of this nature,\n93.\tGuatemala wishes to reassert its faith in the United Nations for its search for solutions to world problems through planned and channeled operations of international co-operation to ensure economic, social and cultural development, as well as to encourage the feeding of peoples, ensuring their health, social justice and equity in international relations. But we feel that much of this is lost if large areas of Member States are afflicted by the threat of international violence which endangers security and peace. We believe sincerely that it is possible to achieve an understanding that will safeguard the fundamental right of all to enjoy respect for their sovereignty.\n94.\tThe Central American Republics celebrated this month the 150th anniversary of their political independence, which took place on 15 September 3821, L is known that these Republics set up the United Provinces of Central America in the form of a federation, Some years later each State decided to go it alone and seek its own destiny. From that time on, however, the feeling has been gaining ground that the five Central American Republics should come under one single nationality, because of their geographical propinquity, historical tradition, identity of human background and interests, common spiritual awareness and conscience.\n95.\tPerhaps a very important step towards political, social, economic and cultural integration was taken when the Organization of Central American States was established in 1951, First considered a subregional organization, permanently given to the search for adequate solutions to all problems common to the five countries, it would also encourage the union of our States through progress and peaceful co-operation.\n96.\tAt the same time, during its fourth session, the Economic Commission for Latin America [ECLA] - a United Nations body-at the request of the Central American Governments created machinery which has fostered the irreversible process of the integration of Central America. No one can deny that the years of trial and the circumstances that have prevailed have shown positive results which have encouraged the economic, agricultural, industrial and commercial development of all Central America. Surely the eloquent statistics on production, export and diversification, which rose from $30 million in 1961 to $300 million in, 1971, speak for themselves. Thus they show that trade transactions have increased their rhythm even at times of conflict.\n97.\tThe century in which we live presents us with a series of problems which call for a movement towards integration which has spread all over the world as an imperative for survival, and Central America considers that this integration is fundamental because of the stage of development in which we find ourselves, for it represents the best way of achieving economic independence. We believe that integration has to be re-established, and my Government has spared no effort in laying the groundwork which will confirm our faith and hopes in a common market for, and integration of, Latin America.\n98.\tOn the strength of experience gathered in the application of the new community law, the Government of Guatemala this year proposed a draft convention for a Central American Community for consideration by the other four Governments.\n99.\tIn this process of economic and political integration inspired by the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the independence of the Central American Republics, a meeting was held in the city of Guatemala from 13 to 15 September tills year of the legislative organs of those Republics, which then became the Central American Parliament, with a manifest interest shown in adopting decisions or resolutions which, objectively and basically, tend towards the achievement of the ideal of re-establishing the Central American Republic.\n100.\tThe Central American Parliament adopted a number of resolutions at its first session and, among them, approved the draft convention of the Central American Community based on the principle that the States composing it shall retain their sovereignty and independence in directing their own affairs excepting those that fall within the purview of the Community, pursuant to the provisions of the convention itself.\n101.\tThe Community will actively promote common interests. It should prevent any differences or conflicts among its members, but ii such differences or conflicts arise, it would assure their peaceful settlement within the framework of institutions established in the convention. The organs of the Community are the Executive Council, the Central American Congress and the Central American Court of Justice. The States members will forever renounce the use of force in the settlement of their differences and it will be their joint task to defend the community against any outside aggression and to co-operate in the maintenance of subregional and international peace and security. The Community will function under the postulate of Central American coexistence and respect for the dignity, worth, freedom and integrity of the human person, without any kind of discrimination. The convention will be open for adherence by the sister Republic of Panama.\n102.\tWhen approving this convention, the Central American Parliament gave great moral weight to it and has advised the respective Governments that they can count on the approval of the national legislative bodies when they decide to subscribe to the treaty, in accordance with the constitutional requirements. My Government strongly hopes that the other Governments will express their desire to formalize the convention of the Central American Community, which will revive our faith in, and the beneficial action of, integration into a unified nation of 18 million Latin Americans living in the very heart of the American continent.\n103.\tIn another unanimous resolution, the Central American Parliament declared that, historically and geographically, the territory of Belice is an integral part of Guatemala and, therefore, of Central America, and that by the same token the future of that territory is of concern to the entire Central American community; and, in the exercise of the sovereignty with which that Parliament has been vested, it reiterated the support of all the peoples of Central America for the Guatemalan position with regard to Belice. Finally  the Parliament urged Governments to refuse to recognize any change in the juridical and political status of Belice until the claim has been settled.\n104.\tGuatemala has a very old dispute concerning the territory with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, for its part, has made every effort to come to an agreement peacefully settling the controversy and taking account of the undeniable grounds for its complaint and, at the same time, the basic interests of the population of Belice, a people of Central America.\n105.\tMy Government wishes to state that we shall continue to seek an adequate and just solution that will satisfy all parties to this dispute; but we wish also to state that, although we are determined to assist the people of Belice in its struggle to get free itself of colonial domination, we shall oppose any change in the juridical or political status of the territory unless the problem of Guatemala's rights thereto is first completely resolved.\n106.\tApart from the process of Central American integration, we also envisage one of Latin American integration, at least in the economic sphere.\n107.\tImportant contacts have taken place among Latin American Governments on trade exchange and other economic, social and cultural aspects of life, contacts which might be termed the broadest basis for economic development, the groundwork for Latin American integration.\n108.\tIn these undeniable steps towards development we see the resolve to go forward in our economies toward the achievement of greater national income, greater per capita income, and a better standard of living for our peoples.\n109.\tOn the domestic level we have also achieved progress, broadening our infrastructure for the purpose of improving public services and adopting development plans aimed at improving the general economy of the country and, hence, the standard of living of the various sectors of the population.\n110.\tThe Government of Guatemala is carefully following the progress of the Second United Nations Development Decade. Together with all those present from Latin America, we consider indispensable a reform in the international monetary system leading to machinery that will adequately reflect the concerns, the needs and the aspirations of the third world. With regard to such reform, some sort of link must be created between special rights of transfer of capital and additional financial assistance for development.\n111.\tIn our view, for the entire process to be as affective as is hoped, and in the shortest possible time, the developing countries must carry out economic and social reforms aimed at raising the standard of living of their peoples; and for that reason I am glad to point out that my Government has adopted and is now implementing the Five Year Integral Development Plan; that it is continuing and intensifying agrarian reform; and that it has introduced institutional and fiscal changes intended to raise the standard of living of the Guatemalan people, However, the customs barriers of the developed countries and the low prices they pay for our raw-material products, because of their arbitrary character, have decidedly negative effects on our development. It is our hope that the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which is to be held in 1972 in Santiago de Chile, will take important decisions to eradicate these harmful practices and to alleviate the misery rampant throughout the world, as well as to reduce the enormous economic and social differences separating the peoples of the highly industrialized countries from the peoples of the developing nations.\n112.\tInternationally speaking, we are seeking fair terms of trade and the abolition of certain tariffs that, in some developed countries, weigh heavily on the importation of our raw-material products.\n113.\tIn our view, the world must direct its efforts to the achievement of better living conditions for all peoples, and specifically for the economically weak areas. There are situations in different parts of the world where this need is very obvious. There are also just claims oil the part of the needy sectors which we must take into account in fixing our goals for economic improvement.\n114.\tIn the field of international policy, with which the General Assembly will be dealing during this present session, with regard to the case of China, we wish once again to repeat our attachment to the principle of universality that was formally stated when the United Nations was created in 1945. We believe that honest and sincere participation by all States, great and small, will more effectively strengthen international peace and security to the benefit of all mankind.\n115.\tBut we also believe that, while the admission of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations flows logically from a full application of the principle of universality, it must in no way be accomplished through the sacrifice of Nationalist China, the genuine and historical existence of which as an active Member for over 26 years cannot justifiably be disregarded. On these matters, my delegation will vote in logical accordance with these two facts.\n116.\tBecause it is a complex problem, the question of the Middle East should be so handled that peace is maintained and the countries in conflict, through the peaceful means laid down in the Charter of the Organization, are enabled to find a just and lasting solution to the complex problem confronting them.\n117.\tIn conclusion, the Government of Guatemala expresses its confidence in the United Nations Organization as the most effective instrument available to the international juridical community for making it possible for all mankind, in the sine qua non of peace and security, to enjoy a better future, and for each Member State to fulfill its own mission. As for Guatemala, our own aim is to develop within the democratic system, in which we firmly believe, to preserve political freedom, and to achieve in full the economic independence for which we are striving.\n"

        "file_text": "161.\tYour election to this office, Mi. President, is a tribute to your distinguished self, a man of purpose and integrity; to your great country, a country to which mine is related by faith and heritage; and to the whole of the non-aligned family. The Sudan wishes you success in discharging your onerous task and steering this session of the Assembly to a happy completion of its agenda in the best tradition of your predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, an erudite scholar and a finished diplomat.\n162.\tThe Macedonians earned Plutarch's description: .. rude and uncivil\\\", because, in his words, \\\"they call a\nspade a spade\\\". All societies have their established sense of decency. A departure from the beaten track offends that sense. But tradition need not be preserved to the point of polite sterility. So, in departing from the beaten track in this general debate, I hope that I will not place myself in the category of the uncivic.\n163.\tLast year we came here to celebrate, in solemnity and dignity, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. Hie gathering was impressive. The deliberations were serious and dignified. The mood of the world was one of stock-taking and self-examination. The United Nations, to the world, was meant to achieve a new heaven and a new earth. It failed to do so. The imperatives of the new era were peace, freedom and progress. But in many parts of the world, our part of the world, peace is still remote, freedom denied, and progress unattainable.\n164.\tThat session ended with a happy tone. The President of the General Assembly chose to call it a session \\\"... of hope and of commitment to the ideals of the United Nations from all geographical groups, across political, philosophical and ideological boundaries\\\" [1933rd meeting, para. 381].\n165.\tWe have solemnly handed down to the world two historic documents that were painstakingly elaborated: the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], and the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)]. A year has elapsed since those solemn declarations on peace and friendly relations and on development were adopted. It will be an indulgence in self-delusion if we say that the world today is better off because of adherence to them.\n166.\tOn peace and friendly relations, satisfaction was expressed here, and by many a speaker, over recent achievements in the direction of peace. The satisfaction is indeed justifiable and we share it: satisfaction over achievements in Europe, in the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and its East European neighbors: the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, signed at Berlin, on 3 September 1971, and the preparation for an all-European Conference; satisfaction over the glimpses of hope in Asia, discerned in the peace proposals of Hanoi, which might lead to a breakthrough, if. only foreign aggression abates. All those are hot-beds of trouble where nasty and brutish confrontation rages or its danger looms large.\n167.\tBut m our effusive expressions of satisfaction, we failed to underline also the cardinal fact within our context here at the United Nations: the fact that in all those agreements, in all those cases, the United Nations remains on the periphery.\n168.\tIn the field of development we outlined a Strategy based on certain trends of international trade and development and adopted it. We emphasized, individually and collectively our will and commitment to implement those policy measures.\n169.\tTo us, in the developing world, who want to hurtle into the twentieth century, the task is impossible. United Nations statistics reveal to us grim facts: that only half of the children between 5 and 14 are at school, that 790 million people are illiterate, that 50 per cent of our labor force is under-utilized, that water supply is not available to 90 per cent of the people in our rural areas. My country, like many others in the third world, is suffering from these problems and deprivations.\n170.\tI wish to dwell on one of those problems, the development of water resources, a problem which has reached disastrous proportions in my country. The figures are alarming. Our statistics tell us that the minimum water requirement for man and animal is calculated at 240 million cubic meters. Under our present scheme of things, only 60 million cubic meters are available. With an annual population increase of 2.8 per cent and an annual animal increase of 6 per cent, the basic total amount required in 25 years would be 670 million cubic meters. Given our present resources and ability, we need 69 years to meet basic needs for humans and animals. But if we have to irrigate and develop our arable land of 200 million acres with our present capabilities, we would need 1,000 years.\n171.\tIt is for this reason that my Government has launched a World Anti-Thirst Campaign, which was inaugurated in Khartoum on 20 February 1970 by Josip Broz Tito, President of Yugoslavia.\n172.\tInternational assistance came from many countries, and to all of them we express gratitude. However, I wish to single out three of them as examples of solidarity with the less privileged nations: Sweden, which has shown and continues to show an ever-increasing interest in this serious human problem, Yugoslavia and Nigeria.\n173.\tGoing back to the world situation, grimmer statistics were also revealed: 7.2 per cent of the world's gross national product goes into military expenditure exactly the same amount that is spent for health and education in the whole world 5 per cent for education and 2 per cent for health.\n174.\tThe world cannot, of course, be changed overnight. Efforts, both national and international, should not relent and solemn pledges should be respected. However, it has taken only a decision of one State to disrupt the operation of the international monetary system, which has had serious repercussions on the pattern of international trade, the flow of technical and financial assistance, the balance of payments and the development efforts of all States.\n175.\tAddressing this Assembly last year at the commemorative session [1859th meeting], we said that the United Nations remains on the periphery of events, be it in the field of peace-making or development. We said that, as long as the United Nations remains marginal in the great Powers' concept of foreign policy, the Organization will continue to be hindered from effectively discharging its basic responsibilities.\n176.\tThe attitude of the major Powers, both within and without the Organization, continues to be the most important though not the only erosive factor. The self- imposed policeman-ship, the imperial outposts, the subversion of established Governments, the pre-eminence of national and strategic interests over international obligations, are all situations which are not concomitant with a world order.\n177.\tIn so saying, it is our intention neither to deny nor to undermine the power of the major nations inherent in the Charter. All that we call for is the realization on their part that power has its own compulsions and that it has to be exercised alongside a correlative sense of responsibility. One of the great masters of power politics of this country in which we are meeting, Theodore Roosevelt, said in one of his better moments: \\\"I believe in power; but I believe also that responsibility should go with it.\\\"\n178.\tAnd we smaller nations where do we stand in the face of all that? Should we allow the strategic and national interests of the major Powers to continue to actuate their policies to the detriment of world order, the interests of the rest of the world, and, sometimes, the norms of inter-national morality? Should we leave the destiny of our own peoples and continents to be determined by others? Should we allow ourselves to be passive pawns in an international game?\n179.\tThe non-aligned group of which my country and yours, Mr. President, are founding members was created because of our concern with the right of all our peoples to freedom and independence, their right to a free choice of forms and ways of internal development, their right to sovereignty, their right to territorial integrity, and their refusal to mortgage their independence at any cost.\n180.\tThe Conferences of Bandung, Belgrade, Cairo and Lusaka have asserted those principles. They have also marked our will to resist hegemony and designs to drag us into zones of influence and dubious alliances.\n181.\tWithin the United Nations, the non-aligned group this year more than at any time before is asserting its role and its place. Our family has been enhanced by the participation of the first Latin American country, Chile, with its great tradition of liberty and independence. And it is only through the unrelenting efforts to put an end to hegemony made by the non-aligned nations, together with many of their friends of the third world which, for one reason or another, did not join our family, that a more balanced world order can be established. This effort must also take the form of completing the unfinished national revolution and I believe that there is more to nationalism than just a patriotic sense deriving from the possession of real estate.\n182.\tPolitically, the unfinished revolution has to be achieved by aiding our brothers and sisters still fighting for the attainment of their independence and basic human rights. It has to be achieved by stimulating national integration, often disrupted by the maneuvers of some of the erstwhile colonial. Powers. It has to be achieved by the completion of the transfer of the real centers of decision from the \\\"metropol\\\" to the homeland.\n183.\tCulturally, the unfinished revolution has to be achieved by ending the alienation of our elite. It has to be achieved by acculturating our social and technical development. It has to be achieved through educating our illiterate masses. It is only through self-realization and the affirmation of cultural identity that we can contribute to the civilization of the universal. In many instances today we are only appendages, we are not an enriching complement.\n184.\tEconomically, the unfinished revolution in the third world has to be achieved through the inculcation of the principles of self-help in our people and in our systems, in accelerating the process of economic co-operation and integration in our regions and subregions, in diverting all our energies into the main task of development, and in reinforcing and furthering the principles of the Charter of Algiers and the second session of UNCTAD at New Delhi.\n185.\tGeneral Edgardo Mercado Jarrin, the Foreign Minister of Peru, had an important message to convey to us the other day when he said:\n\\\"\tthe true freedom of the peoples of the third world\ncan only be achieved when they are able to free themselves not only from the economic and political control of others, but also from the cultural and ideological control of the great centers of power...\\\" [1947th meeting, para. 9],\nand General Jarrin could not have been more apt when he added that the emergence of the third world is one of the great revolutionary conditions of the day, both at home and internationally. It is internationally where the new image has to be more clearly reflected and amplified.\n186.\tThe polarization of the 1950s, within and without the United Nations, might well become a matter of the past on the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations. We have noted with satisfaction the positive, though hesitant, steps taken by the United States of America this year towards a normalization of relations with that great country. But we have followed with concern the efforts oi the United States in this Organization to introduce a new element that threatens to wreck all that Was hitherto achieved.\n187.\tAs far as the Sudan is concerned, we wish to affirm that we shall fight every attempt through procedural maneuvers or constitutional artifice that would stop the People's Republic of China from joining our ranks here in this Organization. And we are determined to see to it that the question of the representation of China this year ; 1 cease to be unfinished business on the agenda of me General Assembly.\n188.\tTo the third world the United Nations is essential. We do not want to erode its influence through actions that shake carefully established balances. But we do not want others, the major Powers, to corrode its influence, either through cynicism or through the undisciplined exercise of power. The late Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, addressing the General Assembly on the occasion of its fifteenth session, had this to say:\n\\\"The structure of the United Nations when it started was weighted in favor of Europe and the Americas. It did not seem to us to be fair to the countries of Asia and Africa, but we appreciated the difficulties of the situation and did not press for any changes. With the growth of the United Nations and with more countries coming into it, that structure today is still more unbalanced. Even so, we wish to proceed slowly and with agreement and not to press for any change which would involve an immediate amendment of the Charter and the raising of heated controversies. Unfortunately, we live in a split world which is constantly coming up against the basic assumptions of the United Nations. We have to bear with this and try to move ever more forward to that conception of full co-operation between nations. That co-operation does not and must not mean any domination of one country by another, any coercion or compulsion forcing any country to line up with another country. Each country has something to give and something to take from others. The moment coercion is exercised, that country's freedom is not only impaired but also its growth suffers.\\\" [882nd meeting, para. 111.]\n189.\tEleven years have since passed, during which the United Nations has grown, but the problems of the world have grown even more. But actions on the part of the major Powers often the super Powers continue to derogate from the authority of the Organization. Such a derogation is seen in the exclusion of the Organization from major policy decisions. It is seen in actions detracting from the initiative of its Secretary-General, an initiative inherent in Article 99 of the Charter. It is seen in pretexts for tax evasion, resulting in impoverishing the Organization's coffers, be they pretexts of bilateral commitments or the inadmissibility of responsibility for past ills.\n190.\tThis tragic financial situation cannot fail to have its political implications, as was aptly depicted by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"It would cause me deep personal sorrow and regret if my service as Secretary-General were to end on this note. Unfortunately the tragedy far transcends any personal aspect: what is at stake is the Organization, for which we have all held, and continue to hold, such high hopes despite the fact that its credit standing and reputation have already been seriously impaired by its financial plight[A/8401/Add.l, para. 122.]\n191.\tAnd in this connexion, I wish to place on record the complete trust and confidence the Sudan has in U Thant. I wish also to express our sincere hope that he will, despite what he has said in the past, enable this Organization to continue to draw from his inexhaustible reserve of sagacity and patience.\n192.\tI said that, where we in the United Nations are directly involved in peace-making, our credit side of the ledger is pitifully meager. I would like to refer specifically to two areas of conflict: Africa and the Middle East. And I am not doing this only because the problems in those areas are nearer home.\n193.\tIn Africa, the unholy trinity of South Africa, Portugal and Rhodesia continues to persist in its crimes against humanity. This Assembly listened last year to the speech of President Julius Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania (1867th meeting]. It has listened this year [1938th meeting] to the moving appeal of President Moktar Ould Daddah of Mauritania. Both Presidents came here to mark the concern of Africa with this problem- President Nyerere came here to request that elementary justice to be done to fellow men. President Ould Daddah came here to appeal for a sacrifice, by the great Powers of the West, of short-term solidarity for a wider engagement in humanity.\n194.\tFor three weeks five African Ministers, speaking on behalf of the Organization of African Unity-Mr. Makonnen of Ethiopia, Mr. Grimes of Liberia, Mr. Arikpo of Nigeria, Mr. Hassane of Chad, and myself have been here at the United Nations to deal with one episode of the southern African drama, the case of Namibia. And it is distressing to note that some people have given us the impression of being exhausted by what seems to be an interminable problem. The record of this Assembly's resolutions upholding the rule of law in South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia is impressive. The constant urgings and advice of the Secretary-General often unheeded are gratifying. But it is regrettable that the only absentee from this honorable endeavor is the major law-enforcing organ of the United Nations, the Security Council. It is all the more regrettable that this inaction is generally prompted by considerations of strategic interests, inherited patterns of aid and trade, or, in some cases, the sheer reactionary lust of some private concerns which are powerful back home. Those who covet gold do not often sin by coveting honor.\n195.\tIn coming here we intend neither to engage in a sterile debate nor to force unrealistic decisions. At the same time, we do not intend to pace the carpets of the Assembly halls awaiting futile resolutions. Africa is impatient, and its impatience is legitimate.\n196.\tIn addressing themselves to us, some have chosen to urge moderation and dialog. But in a state of desperation all calls for moderation are meaningless. And those who listened to South Africas in the Security Council, exulting over its reactionary and racial policies, can well ask themselves how one can engage in dialog with that country. South Africa is persisting in upholding the most pernicious and obsolete concept of the social order. Portugal is determined to fight to the last NATO gun to maintain a decaying empire. Africa appeals for action on thi part of the United Nations, especially the Security Council. But Africa also wishes to tell the world that African land south of the Zambezi represents the front line of its struggle for freedom and justice and it is a struggle that Africa is determined to continue with unabated vigor.\n197.\tIn the Middle East a combustible situation continues to exist, with all the imponderables of sudden eruption. I wish here to say that the term \\\"Middle East\\\" is euphemistic; the problem at issue is Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people and the word is \\\"people\\\", not \\\"refugees\\\".\n198.\tThe incurable optimists were telling us that happy tidings were coming from the direction of Tel Aviv. It was for that reason that we listened with interest the other day [1946th meeting] to Mr. Abba Eban, the Israeli Foreign Minister. But Mr. Eban came here with an eloquent speech to embellish an old theme. He tried tr' words and wit to paint a picture of a new world or reconciliation and dialog as evidenced by the European detente and normalization, as if Palestine were Upper Silesia. He also tried to chart what he described as a new road for peace. But Mr. Ebar's endeavor was and the words I am quoting are from The New York Times of 4 October 1971 \\\"... an excursion into familiar byways\\\" when stalled peace talks are desperately in need of new directions.\n199.\tThe problem, as I said, is plain: aggressive occupation of the territories of Member States, which is condemned by all the world, including the United Nations. And occupation is occupation, and no stylist rhetoric can refine it.\n200.\tRestoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and calls on international charity may eclipse the facts in the eyes of the half-educated but will never extinguish the reality.\n201.\tEven The New York Times was not impressed with Mr. Eban's vision of this problem. To the Times, Mr. Eban's statement on the Palestinian issue was \\\"a detour leading nowhere as long as practically every country involved insists on treating the Palestinians merely as refugees and not as a nation stillborn, now already clamoring for life\\\".\n202.\tMr. Eban is understandably not happy that the whole world does not share his vision of the problem. He has therefore chosen to engage in a dangerous role of disdain for the Assembly and its decisions. To him, our decisions on the Arab-Israeli problem represent a pre-ordained triumph of automatic majorities. This was indeed his mood even before addressing us. Ths Christian Science Monitor tells us, in its 9 September issue, that Mr. Eban, before leaving Jerusalem, had this to say:\n\\\"If the Arab States decide that the earth is fiat and not round, they will immediately have some 50 votes in the United Nations to support such a decision.\\\"\nBut Mr. Eban knows more than anyone else that it was one of those so-called automatic majorities that gave birth to the State of Israel itself.\n203.\tMr. Eban also reserved a certain measure of contempt for the Security Council, where, according to him, decisions are based on sentimental or ethnic predilections. The contemptuous and arrogant rejection by Israel of Security Council resolution 298 (1971) on Jerusalem is in consonance with this line of thinking. It would indeed be a sad world if decisions were to be taken in our Council on the basis of ethnic affinities or affiliation by pigmentation.\n204.\tMr. Eban, perhaps conveniently, saw fit not to pose a simple question to himself: why is the majority of the world condemning Israel? -the majority of the world, including some of Israel's traditional friends. A victory that leaves the victor lonely is a desolate victory, particularly if we look at it within i broader historical context.\n205.\tThe issues in the Middle East question are simple: withdrawal of foreign troops of occupation, and restoration of the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine.\n206.\tMr. Eban has taken us on an excursion of wit, as far as metaphysical wit can fly. He does not answer the basic questions. The questions, as expounded in Ambassador Jarring's aide-memoir of 8 February 1971 [A/8541, annex I] are still open for an answer. Witty equivocation does not help; indeed, it can be an added stimulus to mistrust.\n207.\tLet me close by saying that, to us in the third world, the United Nations, despite all its imperfections, will continue to offer the unique possibility for enlightened international action. Despite disappointments, our hopes for a better world order, though idealistic, shall not dwindle. For, in the words of Chesterton, to say that a man is an idealist is merely to say that he is a man.\n\n"

We have no doubt that under your wise and enlightened direction our work will be conducted in the best conditions, which will enable us to attain fruitful results, To this end my delegation offers you its closest co-operation,\n41.\tI also take this opportunity of paying a particular tribute to your eminent predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro, who made a most valuable contribution to the work of the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the Assembly, which distinguished itself by an important contribution to the cause of peace and international co-operation.\n42.\tMay I also be permitted, on behalf of my delegation, to express again the esteem and admiration we bear the Secretary-General for the sustained and positive efforts he has constantly deployed throughout his term of office for the respect and strengthening of our Organization, as well as for the maintenance of peace and tranquility throughout the world.\n43.\tMy delegation is also deeply gratified at the entry into the United Nations of three new Members: Bahrain, Qatar and Bhutan. We offer them on this occasion our sincere congratulations and wish their peoples, now that they are free and independent, much happiness and prosperity. My delegation is convinced that these three countries will make their full contribution to the peaceful and constructive work of the United Nations family.\n44.\tDuring the session commemorating the founding of our Organization we adopted a number of fundamental recommendations whose essential purpose was peace, justice and progress. Today, we must ask ourselves whether during the past year we have really done everything necessary for the attainment of these objectives. One need not review all the activities of the Organization to conclude that the results obtained have unfortunately not been everywhere satisfactory, and it cannot be said that we have been wholly successful.\n45.\tOf course, we must not overlook some of the various steps along the road towards improved detente among the great Powers. We all have in our minds the recent Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin,  which opens great hopes for the final elimination of this hot spot on our globe.\n46.\tSimilarly, we noted with the greatest satisfaction the advent of better days in the relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China. We have seen in this the augury of a final normalization of relations between that great State and a number of States Members of the United Nations, so that the representatives of the\nPeople's Republic of China may at last occupy its rightful place in this Assembly and in the Security Council as the sole representatives of that great people.\n47.\tLastly, another step leads us to see the future in an optimistic light; I refer to the recent agreement in the field of strategic arms, which is an encouraging way of putting the brake on what seemed to be an uncontrollable race.\n48.\tThese are perhaps only portents, but for our part we hope that this may indeed be the beginning of the final elimination of the aftermath of the grave crises we have lived with since the end of the Second World War.\n49.\tNevertheless, despite these signs of detente, we cannot forget that in many parts of the world the international community still faces dramatic situations with no end in sight. The use of violence in international disputes is still too frequent. The arms race has not yet eased in a manner and to an extent commensurate with our hopes. There is also the illegal and unjust military occupation of the territories of others in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations and of all our Organization's appeals to reason. Then there is still the open war in Indo-China against the will of martyred peoples which wish above all to be able to settle their own affairs after the departure of all foreign troops, There is still colonialism in its most archaic or pernicious forms; finally, there is the poverty and suffering which underdevelopment and the incomprehension of the developed countries still impose upon the destitute peoples of the third world.\n50.\tThose are the disturbing aspects which we believe characterize our community today to which my delegation wishes to draw the attention of the Assembly by expressing its deepest misgivings and fears.\n51.\tThe situation in the Middle East appears to us most alarming, fraught with threats to international peace and, above all, most dangerously deadlocked.\n52.\tIt is not necessary today to go into the history of this drama, nor to trace the complex path this question has fallowed in the various organs of the United Nations. Suffice it to say that our Organization has at various times taken appropriate positions and outlined the wisest course for the rapid elimination of the causes of the conflict, thereby opening the way to just and humane solutions. These international initiatives were in accordance with the broadest consensus among the Members of this Organization.\n53.\tNevertheless, we have seen Israel consistently defy the international will by refusing all co-operation with the competent organs of the United Nations, with the avowed purpose of illegally appropriating the fruits of its aggression of June 1967 anjl continuing to ignore the rights of the people of Palestine.\n54.\tMoreover, the Zionist leaders are taking new steps daily in the unlawful course they have set themselves, multiplying the acts of arrogance and provocation, both vis-a-vis the populations of the territories which they occupy and vis-a-vis the Arab world, of hundreds of millions of Moslems and Christians and of the whole\ninternational community. All proposals for a peaceful solution, no matter how comprehensive, have been con-temptously rejected, for the purpose of maintaining the Israeli fait accompli, which is the manifestation of an unbridled expansionist appetite.\n55.\tI am in duty bound to draw the attention of this Assembly to the special fate of the city of Jerusalem, which not only continues to endure an endless foreign military occupation but also must face an out-and-out campaign to subvert human values and desecrate the Islamic and Christian Holy Places, with a view to a complete Judaization of the City,\n56.\tThe summit conference of the Moslem Heads of State, held at Rabat in December 1969, and the subsequent Islamic conferences at Djedda and Karachi gave the world a clear idea of the depth of apprehension and anguish of 600 million Moslems faced with a criminal enterprise that offends their religious convictions and their dignity. There can be no question of their accepting in any context whatsoever any solution that does not restore to the Arab city of Jerusalem the status it enjoyed before the aggression of 1967.\n57.\tAnd then there is the people of Palestine, expelled several times from its land and its homes, wandering among refugee camps in indescribable misery, living on charity that is increasingly grudging and pushed into dangerous despair. When and how will so hateful an injustice be redressed? How and by what means will this people, plundered and thwarted, be able to return home and obtain just reparation from the harm done it for more than 20 years?\n58.\tIt is for the entire international community to answer. It is for the Security Council and the great Powers to assume their responsibilities, to adopt the necessary measures and see that they are applied.\n59.\tFinally, there are the Arab territories occupied since the aggression of June 1967 despite efforts made both through the United Nations and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Gunnar Jarring, and through initiatives taken directly by a number of Member States, jointly or separately; despite the offers and numerous formulas for peaceful arrangements that have been proposed, not once has Israel agreed even in principle to the evacuation of the occupied territories. Not once has Israel announced its acceptance of the rule of the non-acquisition of territories through military conquest.\n60.\tMr. Jarring's most recent proposals have gone unanswered, despite the clearly demonstrated goodwill of the Egyptian Arab Republic, which on that account enjoys the sympathy, consideration and esteem of the majority of States Members of the United Nations.\n61.\tInstead, we have seen Israel strengthen its hold on the occupied territories by carrying cut transfers of population and setting up improved military works in all the sectors, and this while devoting the bulk of its resources, and of the ample external aid it receives, to the acquisition of ever more sophisticated and deadly weaponry.\n62.\tWe urgently appeal to the suppliers of Israel to refrain from supporting an aggressor that continues illegally to occupy  the territories of others by giving it the increased aid for which it constantly clamors and frequently obtains in the name of some alleged balance of forces that is largely favorable to it and which it in any case does not deserve so long as it has not returned the conquered regions. \n\n63.\tThe withdrawal of their military support from Israel would not only accord with the principles of peace and justice to which we all subscribe but would in the final analysis be more effective than all the diplomatic activity that has been carried on in vain for more than four years.\n\n64.\tSome 10 years ago we thought that the colonial era was gone for ever and that the last vestiges of an epoch that did no honor to mankind were about to disappear, opening the way to cultural, technical and economic progress for hundreds of millions of human beings who had until then been excluded from the advancement of the world.\n65.\tValiant Africa had emerged triumphant from this ordeal in a spectacular mass movement towards freedom and independence, and there was a powerful thrust towards co-operation, harmonization and unity in every field, both regionally and in the continent as a whole. In particular, the Organization of African Unity was created and continues to be the vehicle of our hopes and our determination to attain the objectives and the ideals of Africa, which are also those of the United Nations.\n66.\tBut in a reflex of self-preservation and survival, colonialism has pulled itself together, and is still fighting stubbornly to defend itself in its last bastions. Our brothers of Mozambique, Angola and so-called Portuguese Guinea, in particular, have been waging a heroic struggle for years, with success, of course, which arouses our admiration-but also with sacrifices and suffering, which will long be their lot unless the international community goes to their n xue.\n67.\tIndeed, Portugal, which is pursuing a blind and costly policy, given the means available to that country, could nc>t so long continue to ignore the rights of the peoples it has enslaved if it did not enjoy the effective support of forces which in the name of defense are aiding the work of colonialism and continuous aggression in Africa.\n68.\tIn Rhodesia, the Zimbabwe people is still subject to the law of the racist minority, and even the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, frequently by-passed as they are, have proven discouragingly ineffective. There again, our Organization, and the United Kingdom in particular, will have to use energetic measures of the only kind that will be understood by the unlawful regime of Ian Smith, which is based on violence and the fait accompli.\n69.\tWe shall never tire of denouncing the discrimination and racial segregation practiced on our brothers in South Africa. No glimmer of hope has ever come from that part of our continent to suggest that there is even the beginning of any move to put an end to a policy unanimously rejected by the international community. On the contrary, the repression is growing harsher and the refusal to engage in dialog with the African majority is total. Moreover, the Pretoria Government is unlawfully extending its nefarious policies to Namibia, in defiance of our Organization and its decisions on the subject. There again, the indulgence and understanding-indeed, the co-operation and military support-enjoyed by South Africa from many countries enable it to continue with ease a course of action we have so often unanimously condemned.\n70.\tAs for the Sahara under Spanish administration, I should like to recall that the General Assembly has repeatedly reaffirmed that the populations must be consulted by referendum as soon as possible so that they may freely decide their future. The Government of His Majesty the King considers that to be the most appropriate way of speeding up the decolonization of the region and thereby enabling the local populations, and the Governments concerned, including the Spanish Government, at last to go beyond a largely outmoded phase of their common history. We believe this anachronism must be eliminated as soon as possible so as to open wider still the road to more intelligent and more extensive co-operation with Spain, a country with which Morocco already has many common traditions and interests.\n71.\tWithout an improvement in international relations and liberation from the increasing burden of armaments the world community cannot genuinely devote itself to economic and social development. My Government is profoundly convinced that without genuine general and complete disarmament and the consequent release of substantial resources and their transfer to development, this last field will always be beset by great problems. Without mentioning the recent monetary crisis and the extent of its unfortunate consequences, one need only glance at the international scene r.o note that the picture is far from reassuring: a great gap between industrialized and developing countries, exploding populations, deteriorating terms of trade, insufficiency and rigidity of financial, technical and scientific assistance.\n72.\tIt is true that our Organization has attempted to react against this acceleration of underdevelopment and to set targets for a program of economic and social progress. Unfortunately, the efforts in this common enterprise have not met with the encouragement and support hoped for on the part of the affluent countries. However, despite the disappointments and doubts caused by the revision of commitments, our Organization took the occasion of its twenty-fifth anniversary solemnly to adopt the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. That Strategy, which has been called a charter for development, illustrates the awareness and resolve of the world community to achieve the objectives of the Second Decade.\n73.\tMy Government, which has fully subscribed to all the options of the Strategy, can only hope that this awareness and resolve will be given practical effect without delay, and that all the commitments will be honored. We do not at all forget that it is first and foremost the developing countries themselves that bear the principal responsibility for ensuring their own development. But what we want and ask is that the efforts undertaken by those countries should not, as is unfortunately often the case, be continuously limited or set at naught by restrictive measures taken by the industrialized countries.\n74.\tOn the eve of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which is to take place in Santiago, Chile, in April and May 1972 and on the eve of other similar conferences, we repeat our appeal that all development problems should be studied and approached with the sole objective of relating them to the targets of the Strategy.\n75.\tMeanwhile-and here we have in mind the forthcoming conference in Lima the countries of the third world will have to get together and reach agreement first, so that they may make their voice heard and demand that their rights and interests be taken into consideration. It seems to as useful on this occasion to point to the example of the oil-producing countries whose solidarity won better terms for the sale of their products. It is certain that any move towards the conclusion of similar compromises in other fields will be likely to safeguard the interests of all.\n76.\tIn any case, it remains our hope that it will be recognized and agreed that the job of development is an urgent and general one incumbent on all countries, whatever their situation or level of development. This, in our view, is the principal course to be followed if we wish to attain the gods of harmonious and generalized development throughout the international community.\n77.\tI should have liked to deal today with other important problems on our agenda, for example those concerning the sea-bed and the ocean floor, the environment, and outer space, but I shall leave that task to the members of my delegation who will be taking part in the work of the various Committees of the Assembly.\n78.\tIt has been suggested that the world has passed from an era of confrontation into one of negotiation and decisive change. Wisdom and realism dictate that we continue to see the international community as it is, not as we would like to see it. Great efforts and great sacrifices are still required, and the contribution of all, large and small, is essential if we genuinely want decisive change.\n79.\tMy delegation will, for its part, spare no effort in that direction, so that for all peoples of the world the United Nations Charter may have meaning and purpose,\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "48.\t  May I first offer you, Sir, the fiM support and cooperation of the Canadian delegation in the performance of the great responsibility you have accepted as President of the General Assembly. Canada welcomes your presence In the Chair and offers Its good wishes to the people of Indonesia, whom you have served with such distinction In this Organization, It Is Indicative of the scope and variety of our Organization that the presidency should move from the representative of one of the northernmost countries of Europe to one of the southernmost countries of Asia without any disruption In our continuing work,\n49.\tI should like at this time to thank the previous President, Mr. Edvard Hambro, for the skill and judgment he showed as our presiding officer at the last session,\n50.\tIt is a matter of deep regret in Canada that this should be the last session at which U Thant will occupy the Secretary General's chair, U Thant has carried out his heavy responsibilities and fulfilled  his arduous obligations with a serenity and steadfastness that have been an example to us all and have won the respect and admiration of all everywhere, 1 am sure his quiet and authoritative voice will continue to be heard In the councils of the nations, and on behalf of the people of Canada I wish him well In his future endeavors.\n51.\tThis twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly opens a new quarter-century In the life of our Organization, and I suggest that It may mark a turning-point In our history, and the opportunity for a new beginning, if this Assembly moves promptly and effectively to seat the People's Republic of China In the seat of China, China Is a charter Member of this Organization and a permanent member of the Security Council, The only question before us, I suggest, is who should occupy to existing seat of China, The Canadian position is clear: the Government that has responsibility for the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people must now take its proper place here-the Government of the People's Republic of China. The searing of the Peking Government in this Assembly and in the Security Council will bring the effective Government of a quarter of mankind into our councils.\n52.\tCanada endorses the principle of universality of membership and looks forward to a time when the divided States, too, can be properly represented here. But principles must always be conditioned by facts, and before this ideal can be reached there are serious practical problems to be solved. There would be no particular advantage for the United Nations or for the divided States themselves were they to do no more than import their special problems and conflicts into the wider forum of this Organization.\n53.\tI have said that Canada endorses the principle of universality, and in the Canadian view there is an important principle involved. The communications explosion has annihilated time and distance, two factors that used to isolate problems in one part of the world from those in another and frequently contributed to the solution of such problems by allowing a breathing-space in which good judgment and common sense could be brought to bear. International problems can no longer be localized easily; every such problem is a world problem and involves the world community, which is, in effect, the United Nations. The simple theorem that universal problems call for universal solutions is almost a tautology. And universal solutions are likelier to be found by a body that is universally representative.\u2003\n54.\t1 should like to illustrate what I mean by touching briefly on four problem areas: armed conflicts, the physical environment, arms control and disarmament, and world trade;\n55.\tAs we look around the world today we see armed conflict or the seeds of aimed conflict in many parts of the world, Those cases where international disputes involve Member nations, as for example the Middle East, fall clearly within the responsibility of the United Nations. Where conflicts are contained within a single State, established practice at least suggests that they do not so fall. This leaves with us a question which I will pose and discuss but to which Canada has no definitive answer to offer: at what point does an internal conflict affect so many nations to such an extent that it can no longer properly be accepted as a domestic matter?\n56.\tI sense a growing world concern that tragedies are unfolding and that nothing is being done about them by the world community as represented by the United Nations. The capacity of this Organization to resolve conflicts, whether domestic or international, is limited by two realities: the terms of the Charter and the will of the Member nations.\n57.\tI need hardly say that we do not here constitute a supranational authority. I do not believe that the world is ready for such an authority, for any kind of world government. Today, most of the nations of the world, older and newer equally, are preoccupied with internal problems. Certainly Canada is no exception. Canada is facing internal problems of both an economic and a political nature. Canada believes that domestic problems are best dealt with by domestic solutions, and others feel the same way. The question is: how can the international community best assist in a situation where an internal problem has got beyond the capacity of the Government concerned? The mere fact that the nations are preoccupied with internal problems and questions of sovereignty in the foreseeable future does not excuse us from making the best possible use of the instrument we have, the United Nations. The United Nations can and should move promptly and effectively, as it often has done, to ameliorate human suffering and protect, to the extent possible, the innocent non- combatants that often bear most of the suffering. This is a noble end in itself and can be a means toward the settlement of a conflict by creating a better and saner atmosphere.\n58.\tNo move in the direction of universality can in itself offer any great hope for easier solutions to the problems that are troubling our world, but it could offer a strengthening of our Organization that should help us to come to grips with them.\n59.\tTurning to the second great universal problem, how to preserve a natural environment that will continue to support life on earth, the United Nations has recognized its global nature by setting up the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held in Stockholm next year, with a distinguished Canadian public servant, Maurice Strong, as Secretary-General of that Conference.\n60.\tCanada has a special interest in environmental questions, if only because we occupy such a large part of the\nearth's surface. Despite its vast extent and relatively small population, Canada has serious air- and water-pollution problems of its own. It also, inevitably, is a recipient of the pollution of others through the Great Lakes system and oil-spills on its coastlines, to name only two examples. This is why Canada is concerned about the inadequacy of existing international law relating to the preservation of the environment in general and the marine environment in particular.\n61.\tCanada is working toward the development of an adequate body of law in this field. At the national level, the Canadian Government has adopted laws for the protection of fisheries from the discharge or deposit of wastes, for the prevention of pollution disasters in Canada's territorial waters and fishing zones, and for the preservation of the delicate ecological balance of the Arctic. At the previous session of the General Assembly  and last month in a draft resolution submitted jointly with Norway to Subcommittee III of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction [AI8421, annex V, sect. II], Canada invited other States to take similar measures at the national level to prevent and control marine pollution as a move toward the development of effective international arrangements.\n62.\tCanada is working towards a multilateral treaty regime on safety of navigation and the prevention of pollution in Arctic waters, with other countries having special responsibilities in the Arctic regions.\n63.\tIn a wider multilateral context, Canada is participating actively in the preparations for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, the IMCO International Conference on Marine Pollution and the third conference on the law of the sea. These three conferences, taken together, present a unique opportunity for the development of a comprehensive system of international environmental law. As the first and widest-ranging of the three, the Stockholm Conference will be of particular importance in helping States to come to grips with the apparent conflict between environmental preservation on the one hand and economic development on the other.\n64.\tCanada is usually and properly classed as a developed nation, but it is still in the course of development, still importing capital and know-how, still engaged in building its industrial base. This makes Canadians aware of the conflict between the need to develop, essential to economic growth, and the need to preserve and, where necessary, to recapture a viable natural environment, essential to the survival of life.\n65.\tFor this reason Canada has a special understanding of the dilemma seen by the developing nations, where the highest priority must be given to economic and social development as the means to achieve a standard of living that will offer dignity and opportunity to all their citizens, and where the preservation of the physical, environment, however desirable in itself, would-seem to come second. But I would suggest that this dilemma is wrongly posed.\n66.\tTechnology has now reached a stage where the industrialization needed for economic development need not disturb the environment to an unacceptable extent. And it is by no means the rule that an ecologically sound industrial or other project must be more costly than one that is not. With far-sighted planning and careful attention to design and ecological considerations there need be little or no added cost. The pollution befouling the Great Lakes system largely results from wasted opportunities, from dumping into the water by-products that in themselves have value if properly recovered. The Canadian Government is working with the Governments of the United States and of the United States and Canadian provinces bordering on the Great lakes system to establish water-quality standards, achieve them in the shortest possible time and see to it that they are maintained.\n67.\tThe discussions now going on between the various levels of the Governments in Canada and the United States will set into motion a program for the rehabilitation and preservation of the Great Lakes which will cost billions of dollars and call upon vast human and technological resources. These astronomical expenses would not have been incurred had we and our neighbors been able to foresee and forestall the damage we have done to the largest fresh-water system on earth.\n68.\tI urge my friends in the developing nations to balance the costs of anti-pollution measures against the cost, of pollution and the mindless waste of limited resources it so often represents. Everyone in this room is looking and working for the day when the prosperity now enjoyed by the few can be shared by all. Economic and social development is the route to prosperity. We should all take advantage of the fact that advances in technology mean that we can follow this route without poisoning the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that gives us sustenance, without disturbing the ecological balance that supports all life.\n69.\tMy third illustration of the universality of human problems is the whole field of arms control and disarmament. Canada firmly believes that, until the People's Republic of China is playing its part in our deliberations here and in the detailed studies and negotiations being carried on in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, agreements in this important area will be at best incomplete and at worst ineffective. This is not to downgrade the excellent work that has already been done, as evidenced by such achievements as the Treaty on the NGn-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof [resolution 2660 (XXV), annexJ, and the current work on a biological weapons treaty, in all of which Canada has had an active and essential part to play. Nor does it make any less welcome the encouraging and fundamental negotiations now taking place between the United States and the Soviet Union to curtail the strategic arms race.\n70.\tEarlier this month in Geneva I had the privilege of addressing the Fourth International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. I took advantage of my being in Geneva to speak to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament at its 536th meeting about a subject to which my country attaches the greatest importance; the need for a complete ban on nuclear testing, including underground testing. This Assembly will soon be seized of the special report on nuclear testing [A/8457- DC/234] by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, and for this reason I should like to make again here some of the points I made in Geneva,\n71.\tBefore a complete test-ban can be achieved, there are political and technical difficulties to be overcome. Canada is not alone in believing that these very difficulties call for s determined and speedy effort to reach a total ban on underground nuclear testing. There are steps which could be taken at once before international agreement is reached, steps we believe all Members of the United Nations would support. Those Governments which are conducting nuclear tests could limit both the size and the number of tests they are now carrying out, starting with the biggest, and announce such restraints publicly. This would represent no difficulty nor involve any complication.\n72.\tThere is little time left to us to ensure that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons becomes fully effective. All the measures needed to make that Treaty viable should receive the highest priority, and the ending of all nuclear tests must come first. Many Governments are anxious to see all obstacles to the full implementation of the non-proliferation Treaty removed, before the precarious equilibrium among the nuclear weapons Powers is further disturbed whether by on-going scientific and technical developments or by the emergence of new nuclear Powers. Canada is at one with those Governments in their concern and in their determination.\n73.\tThe continuation of nuclear weapons tests is at the root of the problem. The ending of all nuclear tests by all Governments in all environment is of the greatest possible importance for Canada and for the whole international community,\n74.\tThe safety of all is the concern of all, For Canada there is, if possible, an additional concern. The detonation by the Soviet Union in the last few days of a large underground nuclear explosion and the possibility of a considerably larger test in our own neighborhood by the United States emphasize that the rate and the size of underground testing on the increase. Competitive testing must not be advanced by the nuclear Powers as a justification for maintaining the momentum of the arms race. The danger is that it will, and this brings home to us all the urgent need for a complete ban on nuclear testing.\n75.\tI turn finally to my fourth illustration of the universality of problems today. I suggest that there is no part of the world and no country that is unaffected by the difficulties now being experienced in the monetary and trading arrangements arising out of the chronic balance-of- payments deficit of the United States. Developing countries are well aware that problems among the fortunate few are of great importance to them. They are affected directly in two ways: by the adverse effect upon development assistance and by increased barriers to the trade that, in the long run, offers the best possibility of economic betterment for their peoples,\n76.\tSocialist economies are steadily increasing their trade with market economies, to the benefit of all. As exchanges in the fields of science and technology multiply, the economies of all the world's nations become more inter- dependent-a trend that should be welcomed, not only for the immediate benefit\\\" it brings; but also as a proven means of reducing tensions.\n77.\tThe truth is that all of us-rich or poor, developed and developing, with socialist or market economies-have an interest in minimizing obstacles to trade and in facilitating trade by the maintenance of a workable system of monetary exchanges. All of us suffer when trade is impeded by the setting up of new obstacles to its free flow or by instability in world monetary arrangements.\n78.\tTrade is more than a matter of dollars and cents, more than a struggle for economic advantage. It is the only means we have to create a world economy that will support all the world's inhabitants at a level that will enable us all to enjoy the social justice that is our birthright and to achieve fulfillment in peace and dignity. It is to that end that so much of the best work of the United Nations family has been directed in the past and it is this great goal which must continue to call forth all that is best in us for the future.\n"

        "file_text": "129.\t Mr. President, in this first intervention of the Spanish delegation, I wish to express to you my congratulations and those of my delegation on your having been elected President of the Assembly. The qualities which distinguish you are a guarantee that you will direct our deliberations successfully. Allow me also to take this opportunity of congratulating the new Members, Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar, which have been incorporated into this Organization. This brings the number of Member States up to 130. We trust that the goal of universality, to which this Organization aspires, is on the way to becoming a reality.\n130.\tThis twenty-sixth session represents or at least should represent the beginning of a new stage in the life of our Organization. The problems which concern it must therefore be tackled with our eyes chiefly set upon the future and with an eminently dynamic approach. If the past cannot be forgotten, its recollection should help us to eliminate those impediments which at one time limited the effectiveness of our Organization and the errors the repetition of which it would be hard to forgive.\n131.\tOne fundamental problem which the United Nations must deal with from the outset of this new voyage consists in clarifying whether it responds constitutionally to the challenges of the present time.\n132.\tThe constitutional problems of the United Nations oblige us to establish, first of all, whether the Organization is a true reflection of the international community as it is shaped today. In the second place, it is likewise necessary to determine whether the legal instrument by which it is governed answers present needs.\n133.\tThe United Nations should today reflect, as it was supposed to in the past, the genuine composition of the international community, composed of all of its members. Any attempt to delay the universality of the United Nations would be prejudicial to the Organization, However, universality must not be achieved to the detriment of anyone, and should be attained in accordance with the aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n134.\tFor Spain, universalism is not merely a doctrine. In recent years Spain's foreign policy has been guided by its desire to improve and extend its relations everywhere in the conviction that international security demands sincere and active coexistence. Guided by this spirit, the Spanish Government has resumed its relations with countries having different political, social and economic systems, since it takes the view that coexistence implies the strictest respect for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of each State.\n135.\tIf the Organization is to be brought into line with present-day realities, the Charter, too, must be adapted. No change of the Charter must be made in respect of what is immutable, its aims and principles, but only in regard to what was the mere expression of a concrete social reality, which was subsequently translated into what we might describe as the \\\"internal economy of the Organization\\\". Study of the major subjects which demand reconsideration must begin, and I shall indicate some of them: the conversion of the Security Council into a more flexible and representative instrument, in which the void existing in it between the great Powers and the rest of the Member States should be filled; the Economic and Social Council must also be made more dynamic and brought into line with the needs of development; the quest for an effective system for the settlement of conflicts that respects both sovereignty and justice alike; and the organization of more suitable machinery for maintaining peace.\n136.\tI am convinced that the time has come now that more than a quarter of a century has elapsed since the end of the Second World War and inasmuch as the freezing of positions of the \\\"cold war\\\" has been superseded-to confront resolutely various centers of tension existing in the world and to establish the appropriate security systems. I shall refer to such widely differing questions as Central Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, which, at the present time, have the common factor of involving permanent threats to international peace and security. At the same time, it is necessary to tackle the over-all problem of the armaments race and military expenditures.\n137.\tOwing to its geographical position, Spain is particularly interested in the strengthening of security in Europe and the Mediterranean.\n138.\tThe situation in Central Europe, and its solution, suggest that it is possible to achieve a new system of European continental security; but without disregarding this fact, Spain has maintained a positive attitude towards the convocation of a European conference on security and co-operation.\n139.\tThe signing of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin last September seems to justify the hope that with suitable developments,, it may form a starting point towards a multilateral preparation of this conference. ' ,\n140.\tTogether with this, we should seek to give the principles that must govern life in Europe an interpretation which is identical for all and accepted by all. Such a continental, balanced and just order would justify a reduction of forces and the kind of disarmament that would relieve Europeans of a permanent threat.\n141.\tThis disarmament and reduction of forces should not be confined to Central Europe, but should also extend to the Mediterranean, in which there has been a recent increase of tension.\n142.\tAt the present time total demilitarization and neutralization of the Mediterranean is unrealistic. But what is indeed an attainable objective is the stabilization of forces at their present level, with a view to their gradual and balanced reduction. For this purpose it is indispensable for the coastal States to concert iheir thoughts and deeds with a view to reaching decisions concerning the area. At the same time they should strive to increase regional co-operation in the economic, technological, social and cultural fields.\n143.\tMay the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs be allowed, on behalf of Spaniards everywhere for no problem in my country ha:, ever elicited such a deep-seated and unanimous response-to set forth before this General Assembly our concerns and hopes in the question of Gibraltar.\n144.\tWe are deeply concerned by the fact that still no solution has been reached. The view of this Organization is unequivocal and clear-cut: an end must be put to a colonial situation which seriously affects Spam's territorial integrity, while at the same time safeguarding the interests of the population of Gibraltar. Together with this, an end must also be put to an anachronistic situation which does nothing but obstruct the creation of a greater and more united Europe, to which common undertaking both the British and the Spanish people feel committed*\n145.\tIt is our hope-and it would be a very serious matter to disappoint that hope that without further delays the United Kingdom will come to a realistic view which will cause the existing contacts to lead to genuine negotiations, so repeatedly requested at different General Assembly sessions. We believe that the shortest line to these negotiations is a straight line and not irregular tacking which sharply wound Spanish sensitivities and unnecessarily create an atmosphere of tension. Let us stop our quibbling once and for all; let us no longer use equivocal language and procrastination and let us work together in the quest for the goal towards which we are impelled by justice, the logic of our time and the resolutions of this Organization.\n146.\tThe principles and relevant resolutions of the United Nations should also, and as a matter of great urgency, inspire the settlement of the gravest conflict that affects the Mediterranean area and world peace and security: the conflict in the Middle East.\n147.\tFrom this platform and in the Security Council Spain has often said that there is a need to solve this long and distressing conflict on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and all the other relevant resolutions of the United Nations. My country now reiterates its conviction that the acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable and that there is a need duly to safeguard the rights of the Palestinian people.\n148.\tAt the same time we hopefully welcome all advances in negotiations that may mean a step towards a just political settlement of this problem. A partial solution can only be considered as provisional pending an over-all solution, which, we hope, will be final.\n149.\tFor obvious reasons, everything connected with Jerusalem deserves special attention.\n150.\tWe are following matters pertaining to the Latin American countries with close and sympathetic attention.\n151.\tDuring the first six months of this year and in two successive stages I had the honor of officially visiting nine South American Spanish-speaking Republics and Brazil. 1 propose to add to those visits very shortly by touring the Central American nations and the Caribbean. The Spanish Government did not wish those visits merely to have rhetorical value; they were intended to study and promote various types of cultural, technical and economic co-operation which will be capable of building new bridges for mutual aid.\n152.\tWe cannot disregard the internal stresses which Latin America is undergoing. In some cases that is due to the survival of antiquated social structures which the countries themselves are trying to remove; but at other times Latin-America has been the victim of unjust discrimination, a situation clearly reflected in the deterioration of the terms of economic trade which has devaluated raw materials and raised the cost of manufactured goods to the prejudice of Latin America.\n153.\tIn this way and in other similar ways, it is undeniable that Latin America has frequently been attacked in the cultural field and even devastating^ plundered both is regards its spiritual values and its material wealth. Hence it is only natural for each nation to seek within itself the strength needed to assert its personality and promote the proper use of its resources. Spain is observing this process, which is similar to what is happening in its own country, with the sincere and profound understanding which is the mark of its unchangeable brotherhood with Latin America.\n154.\tWe are still far from the ideal of general and complete disarmament under suitable international control, but it can be said that the Disarmament Decade is beginning auspiciously.\n155.\tIt is desirable not to lose the momentum acquired, and the basic responsibility for this devolves upon the major Powers. Taking advantage of the relaxation of tension, which may now be seen for the first time in many years in their mutual relations, it is up to them to take the initiative in nuclear disarmament-the type of disarmament most eagerly desired by all mankind.\n156.\tSpain for its part resolutely supports the struggle against the arms race and is ready to participate.actively in negotiations leading to disarmament and especially in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, which is an important subject to be dealt with by this Assembly.\n157. We are all aware that the achievement of peace is not based solely on the settlement of international conflicts and the strengthening of security, but something more is needed, namely, conditions which, by making a dignified life possible for man, will render unnecessary his rebellion against injustice.\n158.\tThe achievements of the United Nations in this field ultimately depend on what each one of its Members is prepared to do. Aware of this, Spain has not failed and indeed cannot fail to comply with its duties of co-operation.\n159.\tMy country, which declared last year from this platform its complete adherence to the objectives of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], has already begun to put its principles into practice. The Spanish Government, when drafting the third development plan, which coincides with the beginning of the Second Development Decade, not only included its philosophy therein but also established an appropriate system of evaluating results and goals.\n160.\tAs an inevitable consequence of our concept of economics in the service of mankind, the most important objectives to be attained in our third development plan are social improvements of all kinds, which my country desires to achieve for the Spanish people. These improvements concern education, housing, health assistance, social security, vocational training, and so on, which are all part of a program which the Spanish Government began many years ago.\n161.\tBut besides national action there is need for suitable action at sectoral, regional and world levels. In those plans Spain would like to see machinery being used for the examination and evaluation of the objectives and measures of policy agreed upon in the Strategy.\n162.\tAt the sectoral level-and I shall refer to one sector that is most significant, that of trade-the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which will be held next year at Santiago de Chile, will afford a propitious occasion for continuing consideration of these basic problems jointly.\n163.\tThe fact that Santiago de Chile is to be the seat of the third session is particularly welcomed by my Government, it being the first time that so important a meeting will take place in a country of Hispanic stock which has been so brilliantly contributing to its work.\n164.\tAt the regional level, we attach importance to the role of the regional economic commissions, without prejudice to the active co-operation which may be provided by the regional organizations not belonging to the United Nations system, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n165.\tFinally, at the world level we regard as most interesting the proposals to revitalize the Economic and Social Council in conformity with the role assigned to it by Chapter IX of the Charter in economic, social, scientific and technical subjects.\n166. Spain, a developing country which participated actively in the preparation of the Strategy, is again ready to give its assistance to this effort of collective responsibility on the part of the international community.\n167.\tA greater awareness and knowledge of the problems of development have bd to the conviction that science and technology are important driving forces behind it. In my address during the general debate last year [1867th meeting] I mentioned our special concern over various aspects cf this problem, especially the transfer of technological knowledge. I think there is an urgent need for an intergovernmental organ at the highest level to co-ordinate and provide momentum for the decisions of the Organization as a whole in this field,\n168.\tOne phenomenon of our time is the movement for economic integration. But it is equally true that the division of labor and specialization are essential. Hence we must regret the contradiction into which strongly developed economies have fallen when, while renouncing and abandoning highly technical projects for which they are specially prepared, they erect, on the other hand, artificial barriers to protect sectors in which they are not so competitive. They thereby delay their own technical advancement and the development of other less-advanced countries.\n169.\tI cannot fail now to refer to a question of the greatest current interest: namely, the monetary crisis.\n170.\tThe impact of the measures recently taken urgently brings out the need for international solidarity and for new forms of agreement. But such agreements must be entered into not exclusively from the standpoint of the interests of the great Powers, but only on the basis of broad co-operation taking into account the interests of all countries, since it does not seem fair that precisely the developing coun- tries-which have been wholly unconnected with the birth of the crisis should be the ones to suffer the most from its consequences.\n171.\tThe reform of the international monetary system cannot bs put through behind their backs, nor should their specific problems be overlooked.\n172.\tNeither do I wish to omit a justified reference to one important aspect of United Nations action in this field of development. In a few months' time the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment will be meeting in Stockholm. Spain, which is in the full process of industrialization, wishes to avoid a confrontation between economic growth and the deterioration of the environment. We firmly believe that it is possible to combine economic and social development with the preservation of the ecological environment, and we are prepared to seek formulas for uniting them.\n173 . I should also like to refer to a problem of increasing gravity which affects the physical, mental and moral health of peoples. I am speaking of the widespread consumption of narcotics causing general concern which the Spanish Government fully shares.\n174. That anxiety is responsible for Spain's signing and ratifying international conventions on the subject. It also accounts for the legislative work of incorporating those agreements into our national code, and for busy police activity aimed not only at suppressing internal traffic, but at preventing the use of our territory for transit.\n175.\tHowever, that internal action needs to be supplemented by close and sincere international collaboration for the purpose of establishing universally more severe penalties aimed at the radical elimination of this the vilest form of human enslavement.\n176.\tMy Government has accordingly taken note with satisfaction of the recent proposals in this matter, especially that of the President of the French Republic, and it trusts that 'those timely suggestions will attain the necessary universality without confining themselves to any particular geographical or political framework.\n177.\tAn important point which is bound to draw our attention concerns the task of bringing marine law up to date-a task which is at present being carried out by the United Nations. The initial results of that work can be considered satisfactory. The debates in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction have allowed a forthright exchange of views.\n178.\tThroughout history, the law of the sea has sought to satisfy and balance two great classes of interests: on the one hand, the economic interests of States in the use and exploitation of the sea, and, on the other, political and security interests.\n179.\tAt the present time those two great classes of interests remain, but the new political, economic and technical realities have substantially modified their content and orientation.\n180.\tThe process of socialization which has been noted in the whole of international law has had a direct impact upon the law of the sea and has deeply transformed a large sector of economic interests. The freedom of the seas, as regards liberty to use marine areas, still remains an essential necessity for all States, coastal or otherwise. But at the same time the needs arising from the economic and social development of peoples have become more urgent and vital.\n181.\tThus the interests of the international community  and especially the interests of the developing States- require that we give a satisfactory legal response to three basic economic needs: in the first place, to the need for exploring and exploiting, in an exclusive manner, the resources of the continental shelf, while establishing a broad and uniform limit to that zone; secondly, to the need for coastal States to enjoy a number of preferential rights in regard to the conservation and exploitation of fishing resources over an area of the sea adjoining their coasts which shall be wide enough to satisfy their needs. Thirdly, we are bound to give an imaginative reply to the problems and needs of the \\\"international zone of the sea-bed and ocean floor\\\", already described as the \\\"common heritage of mankind\\\".\n182.\tIn the second area of interests, which I have just indicated, the process is similar. Traditional political and strategic interests, in the face of the new realities, alter their content and orientation.\n183.\tThe need for us to provide an adequate guarantee for the survival of the human race requires us, in the new law of the sea, to include legal rules and suitable technical procedures to prevent and eliminate pollution in all marine zones. Those rules, in the last resort, can only be a direct consequence of the fundamental right of the human being in respect to his environment, as a corollary of his right to life.\n184.\tIn the second place, States have an inalienable right to security. Territorial waters have always constituted for coastal States not only a zone of economic protection but also an area to guarantee their national security.\n185.\tTraditionally, the legal regime of territorial waters has been built on the key notion of the \\\"right of innocent passage\\\", which strikes a fair balance between the general needs of international navigation and the powers that arise from the sovereignty of States in the marine area. That idea still retains its full value today in view of the new security needs of Spates, and it cannot be regarded as admissible that, because of the openly admitted strategic needs of a few Powers, anyone should seek to impose on coastal States certain alleged freedoms of navigation in, or flight over, straits forming part of the territorial waters of one or more States.\n186.\tAnd we consider it inadmissible also because those hypothetical freedoms, while unnecessary for the needs of peaceful navigation, would violate the national sovereignty of coastal States since they would seriously restrict those Stales' inalienable right of security, and briefly, because they would serve to promote the world-wide expansion of nuclear power, both marine and aerial. Nobody can doubt that they would increase tension and conflicts, thereby jeopardizing the United Nations objectives of peace and security.\n187.\tFinally, from this important rostrum, I wish to make an appeal in favor of those who have suffered the consequences of war and natural disasters, and particularly those who are the victims of a lack of understanding among nations and are forced to suffer the hardships and displacement imposed by those circumstances.\n188.\tIn the coming days we shall be dealing with grave matters of transcendent importance. My delegation fervently hopes that, notwithstanding any antagonism which might arise in the course of debate, we may part united for the welfare of this Organization and the peace and security of the world.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "227.\t Mr. President, I should like to express the satisfaction of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania at the mark of confidence and admiration displayed by the whole membership of the United Nations in entrusting to you the presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Such in honor is, above all, a deserved tribute to your outstanding qualities, which are well known to all those who have had the privilege to appreciate your talents and qualities as a statesman. Your election to this high office also testifies to the deep respect that the international community feels for your country, for the people of Indonesia, and for its distinguished leaders. My delegation wishes to take this opportunity of extending to you its warmest congratulations and assuring you of its full and unstinting cooperation.\n228.\tMy delegation also wishes to pay a warm tribute to Mr. Edvard Hambro for the dedication and exceptional ability with which he conducted the proceedings of the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session.\n229.\tWe should also like to take this opportunity of extending a warm welcome and hearty congratulations to the States of Bahrain, Qatar and Bhutan which have just been admitted to membership in our Organization. We are sure that these countries will make a positive contribution to the strengthening of peace and to understanding among peoples.\n230.\tThe twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly is meeting at a time when grave conflicts continue to threaten international peace and security. Senseless colonial wars are still being waged in various parts of Africa and Asia continents chosen by international imperialism as sites for conducting power struggle and for creating hotbeds of war.\n231.\tSouthern Africa is, for the most part, bowed under the threat imposed by a coalition of selfish and contemptible interests which join the proponents of apartheid in Pretoria and Salisbury with the decadent colonialists of Portugal.\n232.\tThe Zionist troops, which enjoy unconcealed benevolence in certain quarters, continue to occupy with impunity vast territories belonging to countries that are the victims of cowardly aggression, indignantly condemned by all those who, in the interest of peace and harmony among peoples, wish to see the United Nations survive.\n233.\tAn unjust war continues to rage in VietNam, Cambodia and Laos, imposing great suffering and consider* able material loss on the peoples of Indo-China whose crime is a wish to enjoy their legitimate right freely to choose their own destiny.\n234.\tThe restoration of the lawful rights of one of the greatest Powers of our times and a founder Member of the United Nations is becoming an absolute necessity if we wish to arrive at real international detente and to put an end to 1 the inhuman sufferings endured by the peoples of Indo-China for over 20 years.\n235.\tAt the socioeconomic level, the dangerous imbalance created by the widening gap which divides the world into wealthy countries and underdeveloped countries continues to grow,\n236.\tThese are all matters of grave concern to the people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, and to all peace and justice-loving peoples and Governments genuinely interested in the strengthening of international security.\n237.\tAs a small country belonging to the underdeveloped world, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has every reason to feel deeply the necessity to maintain peace, stability and harmony among peoples. This profound reality is the reason why we chose, as the basis for our foreign policy, nonalignment as defined by the Mauritanian People's Party and applied by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\n238.\tThat is why our activities, which reflect the profound aspirations of our people, are always guided by a concern to establish, strengthen and expand friendly and cooperative relations with everyone, while refusing to engage in the politics of hegemony.\n239.\tWe believe that this policy of nonalignment that the Islamic Republic of Mauritania applies both on the continent of Africa and elsewhere by no means excludes the possibility of concerted action and fruitful cooperation between our country and any other State, whether a neighbor of the Islamic Republic or not. In a climate cf confidence, such consultations and coope' i;on can lead to agreements that respect the interests of eaU. of the parties, or to a common position flowing from a common destiny or any other valid and legitimate reason. Such undertakings, which our country, true to itself and to the sense of dignity and honor characteristic of the Mauritanian people, will faithfully observe, undoubtedly constitute an important and concrete contribution to the quest for and the maintenance of peace in the struggle against underdevelopment.\n240.\tThe party and the Government of Mauritania will never lose sight of the role imposed on them by the geographical position of Mauritania and by the ethnic composition of its population. This fundamental idea was once again recalled in the National Assembly by the Mauritanian head of State who, in November 1970, said:\n\\\"History and geography give Mauritania a privileged place, that of a meeting ground par excellence, of fertile\nhuman and cultural currents which have fused in a crucible of exemplary complementaries, predisposing us to play a special role in elaborating the guidelines of the African renaissance.\n\\\"It is in this, context that, profoundly convinced that the development of our continent requires the consolidation of its unity, we are working tirelessly to erect structures which will promote the best interAfrican cooperation.\\\"\n241.\tThis clearly shows that it has always been our ambition, in the past as well as today, to represent an element of stability and concord in our geographical area, thereby contributing to the maintenance of peace and understanding among peoples. The attainment of these objectives, consistently and resolutely pursued by the people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, will, we are convinced, be in the best interests of the African continent.\n242.\tMy country, a militant member of the Organization of African Unity, makes common cause with all brother countries of Africa in facing the difficulties they may encounter while working to strengthen their independence and unity.\n243.\tWith regard to decolonization, it is sad to see that after 26 years of effort, the United Nations has still not succeeded in putting an end to colonialism. However, we should not overlook certain positive results achieved in this field as a result of United Nations action. We should like to hope that all chose who have had to live in a colonial situation will make the necessary effort to understand the irreversible nature of decolonization.\n244.\tIn this spirit, and taking into account the tripartite conference of Nouadhibou, which in September 1970 brought together the heads of State of Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania, the problem of the decolonization of socalled \\\"Spanish Sahara\\\" will now be approached jointly by the three countries neighboring the Sahara on the one hand, and Spain on the other. We are convinced that a constructive attitude on the part of the Spanish Government would still further strengthen the friendship and the many traditional bonds that unite Spain with the northwest African subregion as a whole.\n245.\tThe people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, being profoundly anti-colonialist and anti imperialist, view with concern the powerlessness to which the racist minorities in southern Africa, proponents of the deplorable doctrine of apartheid like the Zionist authorities in Tel Aviv, have reduced our Organization.\n246.\tThe party and Government of Mauritania wish forcefully to reaffirm their support for their brothers fighting with determination in Angola, Mozambique, Gu^< i (Bissau), Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa, to recover their independence, and to exact respect for their dignity and their fundamental rights as free men.\n247.\tWithout the assistance of certain countries, it would fee more difficult for the Portuguese oppressors to carry on a criminal colonial war in a distant land, which is a burden on the slender resources of a country ranking among the poorest In the world,\n248.\tI should like to take this opportunity to say how very concerned the Mauritanian people, its party and its Government are at the persistent cowardly and criminal attempts at aggression made by Portuguese Imperialism at bay against our sister republic of Guinea. We strongly condemn this desire for neo-colonialist reconquest of an independent African country, whose inhabitants, united in its vanguard party, the Parti democratique de Guinea, an offshoot of the Rassombloment democratique africain, have always defended the independence and dignity of Africans with courage and determination, We reaffirm our common destiny with our brothers in Guinea and with the Guinean party and Government; more than ever, our solidarity is absolute.\n249.\tPortugal docs not limit itself to the permanent tension It has created in Guinea but is extending its activities to the territory of Senegal as well. In its determination to maintain a decadent hegemony, which is rejected by the continent of Africa, Portugal is extending its attempts at intimidation to the courageous Senegalese on the borders of Guinea (Bissau). Peaceful villages are now accustomed to the stench of napalm; whole families are forced to leave their destroyed homes. Such is the picture of the flight of our innocent Senegalese brothers. This forced exodus of these people is tragically reminiscent of that endured by the Palestinian people since 1948.\n250.\tIt is inadmissible that the international community should accept such a situation. More specifically, the permanent members of the Security Council have the urgent duty to take the necessary steps to ensure that Lisbon's troops leave this African territory, thus putting an end to the colonization of Senegal and to a permanent threat to its territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n251 My country protests with indignation this policy of the outrageous Lisbon regime and assures the people and Government of Senegal of its total and active solidarity.\n252.\tIn other parts of Africa, oppression and racial discrimination elevated to a system of government are practiced in Namibia. Pretoria's troops continue to occupy that territory with impunity, in defiance of the pertinent resolutions of the Security Council and of the recent opinion of the International Court of Justice. It is now up to the Security Council to devise practical arrangements whereby the people of that Territory may choose freely the national political institutions they desire.\n253.\tIn the Middle East the Zionist authorities of Tel Aviv continue to trample the fundamental principles of the Charter and the decisions of this Organization; their troops continue to enjoy the fruit of their aggression. The vast territories of the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Arab Republic of Syria and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan continue to be subjected to barbarous military occupation. Hie burning of the AlAqsa Mosque a year ago roused the indignation of almost the whole world. This fire, for which the Zionist occupation authorities are entirely responsible, reminded the world of the grave threat to the holy places of Islam, Christianity and Judaism represented by the illegal and invalid decision taken by the Zionist authorities as regards the annexation of the Arab part of the city of Jerusalem.\n254.\tThis situation constitutes a flagrant violation of the principles of justice, equality and territorial integrity of States and of absolute respect for their sovereignty, principles which arc the very crux of our Organization .\n255.\tThe people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania pay admiring tribute to the heroic resistance of the peoples of these territories hi the face of their Zionist oppressors. The legitimate liberation struggle carried on by the Palestinian people to recover their usurped homeland is actively supported by Mauritania and by all freedom and justice-loving peoples.\n256.\tIt is vitally important to understand that if the pertinent decisions of the Security Council are not implemented without delay and if the slighter* change is made in the frontiers as they existed before 7 June 1967, our Organization will lose not only any chance of controlling the explosive situation in the Middle East, but also the confidence of mankind, the source of its authority.\n257.\tHowever, we venture to hope that the efforts of the great Powers, working with the SecretaryGeneral's Special Representative, Mr. Jarring, will be of help in finding a solution to this painful problem in conformity with Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We also hope that the \\\"mission of wise men\\\" of the Organization of African Unity will produce positive results with a view to a just and lasting solution of the conflict.\n258.\tThe dangerous situation in the Middle East should not make us forget the heroic struggle resolutely carried on by the IndoChinese peoples of VietNam, Cambodia and Laos to ensure respect for their sacred right to choose their own destiny freely.\n259.\tA dramatic and dangerous situation exists in Cambodia where foreign forces are opposing the legitimate aspirations of the valiant Khmer people, who are struggling to win their freedom and dignity.\n260.\tThe Government and people of Mauritania assure the Government of the National Union of Cambodia of their unfailing solidarity and support.\n261.\tAll justice-loving peoples must continue their struggle for the restoration of peace in Indo-China. Such peace will be effective only after the total withdrawal of United States troops and those of other foreign countries and when the interested parties have accepted the recent seven-point Government of South VietNam. In any event, it is certain that the VietNamese people, strong because their cause is just, will in the end inevitably triumph over all the obstacles on their road to independence and freedom.\n262.\tThe people and Government of Mauritania unreservedly support the people and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam in their heroic struggle for the dignity and liberty of the VietNamese. Nevertheless it is still our hope that the Paris conference on VietNam, despite the extreme leisureliness of the proceedings will in the not too distant future offer a peaceful solution in that part of Asia,\n263.\tElsewhere, the cessation of all foreign interference in the affairs of Korea represents an important factor for the maintenance of peace in SouthEast Asia and throughout the world.\n264.\tThe people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania consider that it is the urgent duty of our Organization not to allow the United Nations flag to continue to be used to camouflage the presence of foreign occupation troops in Korea. To restore peace in that troubled region, it is necessary for the Korean people, free from all foreign interference, to be able freely to choose their destiny .\n265.\tMy delegation's concern is not limited to the grave problems I have mentioned. Quite the contrary.\n266.\tWe believe that the problem of disarmament is of an urgency which escapes no Member of our Organization.\n267.\tThe accumulation and continuous improvement of weapons of mass destruction is a great danger to the development and even the survival of mankind. The considerable sums spent on armaments dangerously reduce the investment possibilities necessary for the economic and social progress of developing countries. Moreover, the kind of balance of terror in which the world lives should give way to a genuine international detente conducive to better cooperation and comprehension among peoples. In other words, my delegation, so far as it is concerned, supports any international effort to bring about true general and complete disarmament.\n268.\tBut the people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania wonder how we can seriously expect real progress in this area in the absence of the greatest human power, which has now become a nuclear Power. What real impact can the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] have on nuclear disarmament so long as the People's Republic of China is not a party to it?\n269.\tHere again the absence of the People's Republic of China from this Organization represents a major obstacle to all attempts to achieve real disarmament.\n270.\tThis illustrates, if any illustration were needed, the dangerous irrationality of continuing to keep that great Power outside this Organization.\n271.\tThat is why my delegation wishes to reaffirm its conviction of the need to proceed without delay to restore the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. We categorically reject the two Chinas theory, or the theory of one Taiwan and one China, that certain Powers are attempting to circulate in our Organization; since this could only perpetuate the division of the people and territory of China.\n272.\tMy delegation would here like to salute the dynamism and vitality of Chinese diplomacy, which has brought that great country a flood of recognition on the part of many States, including many that had held back until recently. From this standpoint we welcome the dialog which has begun between the Governments of the United States and China, and we hope that President Nixon's forthcoming journey to Peking will contribute to a detente in that part of the world and to world peace. We are convinced that, thanks to the profound wisdom of the peoples of the United States and China, thanks also to the courage and political realism of their leaders, substantial progress will be made towards better cooperation and towards harmony between the two peoples.\n273.\tIt would be unthinkable for my delegation to address this distinguished Assembly without mentioning the concern we feel at the grave economic and social problems now tragically confronting the developing countries. It is regrettable that, in this sphere so crucial to the improvement of international relations, cooperation among peoples is cruelly lacking. The disappointing results of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the failure of the First United Nations Development Decade, have revealed the absence of political will to take the necessary steps to establish, in the interests of all Member States, genuine international cooperation. In these circumstances, with the fluctuations in primary commodity prices and the constant increase in the price of manufactured goods, the gulf, already scandalous, continues to grow.\n274.\tOur Organization must redouble its efforts and ensure that great Power rivalry is carried on in the peaceful and inspiring field of scientific research in the service of mankind.\n275.\tWhile we welcome achievements in the field of space, which open great vistas before mankind distant, certainly, but exciting indeed it is necessary first of all to ease the sufferings of a large part of mankind which is bowed beneath the weight of poverty, ignorance and despair. The considerable funds spent on the conquest of space could contribute to the welfare of man on earth and to his harmonious development.\n276.\tFor its part, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania is convinced that no country can truly triumph over underdevelopment without a lively awareness of the real and, indeed, tremendous efforts and sacrifices that must be made at the national and individual level. That is why we should like to say how keenly aware we are that we have to count on ourselves before we count on others. Mauritania believes that the countries of the third world should not take the easy yet risky course of looking to foreign aid for everything.\n277.\tIndustrialized countries of course, in their own longterm interest and that of all mankind, owe it to themselves to organize and develop international economic cooperation. It is at that price and that price alone that international relations can lead to a world in which harmony and mutual understanding will reign.\n278.\tThat is why we hope that everything will be done to ensure that the Second United Nations Development Decade results in more effective international cooperation.\n279.\tSo far as the African continent is concerned, the people and Government of Mauritania believe that countries should unite around common objectives as a powerful means of ensuring rapid growth, We therefore see the usefulness of forming groups at the subregional, regional and continental levels, Since they constitute markets and enable the States belonging to them to harmonize their development plans, such groups represent an appropriate and useful framework and their establishment should be encouraged by the United Nations. Such an approach is perfectly consistent with our Organization's efforts for social and economic promotion.\n280.\tThis brings me to the end of my statement; however, I would not wish to close without paying a resounding tribute to a man who has compelled the esteem and gratitude of all nations by his dedication and his service to the cause of peace and understanding among men. I refer to UThant, SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, to whom Mauritania is profoundly grateful and to whom we feel the most sincere affection. For all these reasons, my delegation would have liked to see him continue presiding over our Organization, carrying on the great work he has so well begun. The very positive, discreet and effective role which he has played so admirably has enabled our Organization to contribute to peace in the world.\n281.\tFor despite conflicts and the political and economic difficulties that sometimes darken the international horizon, and despite the weakness it shows' in solving grave problems, our Organization has, over the past decade, helped certain States to settle their disputes peacefully.\n282.\tWe express the sincere hope that each and every Member State will work to promote respect for the principles of the Charter and the application of decisions taken by this Organization. Thus, for the greater good of mankind, the somewhat eroded confidence of the peoples in this Organization will be reborn.\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t  Allow me, Mr. President, to present to you the warm congratulations of the Government of Haiti and of the delegation over which I have the honor to preside on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your long experience as a statesman and the eminent service which you have rendered to the cause of peace constitute a sure guarantee for harmonious work during the present session. Be assured of the full cooperation of the Republic of Haiti which extends to you its best wishes for success.\n2.\tAllow me also to pay a tribute to the President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Edvard Hambro, who carried out his delicate mission to the complete satisfaction of the Members of the United Nations, bringing into play his lofty sense of responsibility and drawing on the noble qualities which distinguish the people of Norway.\n3.\tAlthough the present session opened with the usual ceremony and although at this session the General Assembly is called upon to examine questions which we might call conventional because they always appear on the agenda of our -sessions, this session, nevertheless, is of special importance because of the fact that the Assembly must take decisions which will surely exercise a determining influence upon the future of our Organization itself, as well as upon the history of international relations during the latter part of this century.\n4.\tWe refer, in the first place, to the election of a new Secretary-General to replace U Thant, whose departure we greatly regret.\n5.\tA pilgrim of peace, U Thant has devoted himself for the past 10 years with remarkable skill to reconciling antagonisms and has undertaken many fruitful initiatives for the benefit of all mankind.\n6.\tWhether it was a question of the war in Viet-Nam, the fratricidal struggles in Africa, or the problems in the Middle East and it is always with emotion that we recall the deep understanding shown by the Secretary-General and the entire Organization each time that it was necessary during these last 14 years here to debate such matters as the defense of the sovereignty and integrity of the Republic of Haiti. Whether it was a question of the defense of the human dignity of peoples who are victims of colonialism or racial discrimination, or whether it was a question of the economic and social development of the under-developed countries, impartial history will recall, Mr. Secretary-General, your many initiatives as a proof of manifest goodwill and devotion to the cause of international peace.\n7.\tThe delegation of Haiti would like once again to express to you its admiration for the remarkable services you have rendered to humanity and express the hope that the Secretariat of the Organization will continue to follow the road of wisdom, serenity and dynamism which you have shown it during these last 10 years.\n8.\tAlthough the results of the initiatives of the Organization were not always consistent with the legitimate aspirations of peoples, the responsibility can be imputed to the imperfect structures established at its foundation, for, unfortunately, it still shows the marks of a genesis characterized by the precarious compromise among the great Powers which serves as the basis of the Organization. We are all aware of the limitations of the Organization, as we are aware of its great ability and its potential. Despite everything, the Organization remains a place where, on a footing of equality, States may discuss their problems, seek peace and progress, and lay the foundations for the co-operation which is necessary among the peoples of the world.\n9.\tTherefore, the delegation of Haiti wishes to express its concern with regard to the election of the new Secretary-General who, in addition to the attributions laid down in the Charter in Articles 97 to 101, is invested with the high moral authority and general responsibility upon which the life and functioning of the Organization depend.\n10.\tWith the feeling of equity and equilibrium required in order to realize the fundamental objectives of the universal nature of the Organization, the Republic of Haiti, whose destiny seems to be to constitute a link and a bond between Latin America and Africa, feels that the post of Secretary-General of the Organization should be given to a personality belonging to one of these two continents. Obviously, such a candidature would enjoy from the very beginning a\nprestige and a remarkable strength if it were to be supported unanimously by the African and Latin American Member States. The delegation of the Republic of Haiti, which has already begun to take initiatives along these lines, would make an urgent appeal to dl nations desiring to achieve this indispensable unity so as to build a more equitable and more harmonious world.\n11.\tThe twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly has before it a question which is more than 20 years old, but which comes up every year. It is an old question, namely, the representation of China in the United Nations, but we must examine it in the light of an international situation which is always changing; it is an old question, of course, but it must necessarily be borne in mind by all those who advocate unity in diversity, all those who are not resigned to a division of the world into two monolithic blocs, all those who reject with all their strength the difficulties which negative ideologies or the straitjacket of short-sighted policies impose upon mankind.\n12.\tThe delegation of Haiti wishes to draw the Assembly's attention to the need to give the problem of the representation of China due importance and to consider it with all the lucidity and clairvoyance necessary so as to avoid establishing a precedent which might in the near future imperil the very basis of our Organization.\n13.\tThe title \\\"Restoration ,of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations\\\", under which certain delegations have raised the problem of the representation of China, suggests the idea of the pre-existence of rights of which China has been frustrated. In any case, the Government of the Republic of Haiti, while accepting the principle of the representation of the People's Republic of China, is resolutely opposed to any draft resolution which would expel the Republic of China.\n14.\tIt is true that, in view of the universal nature of the United Nations, it would be desirable to open our doors to the People's Republic of China with the assurance that the latter would profess respect for the principles in the name of which we are met here in this Assembly.\n15.\tBut, we must also recognize that the Republic of China is a real entity, an independent and sovereign State, a founding Member of the Organization and in that capacity the Republic of China fulfills all its obligations under the Charter. Legally, to what can one refer to justify its expulsion from the Organization, to which it has always made such a positive and effective contribution?\n16.\tThese are, in the understanding of the Government of the Republic of Haiti, the principles and facts which should guide the work of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly if it is to arrive at fruitful conclusions which will give rise to progress in concord among men from every corner of the world.\nthe Organization of African Unity H.E. Moktar Ould Daddah, in condemning, once again, the policy of apartheid and the policy of racial segregation which are carried out by the Governments of South Africa and Rhodesia to the detriment of the inalienable rights of the great majority of the population of black people.\n18.\tIn this second half of the twentieth century, when almost everywhere economically weak countries are mobilizing their material and human resources so as to give a new impulse to their development, it is disturbing that a minority of the population of South Africa and Rhodesia should by coercion force the great majority into a disgraceful situation in the name of an anachronistic philosophy of racial superiority in order to maintain their privileges and economic power indefinitely.\n19.\tFor eight years the United Nations has been adopting more and more resolutions and recommendations but these two countries continue to be indifferent to and scornful of them.\n20.\tAt its twenty-fourth session, the General Assembly proclaimed 1971 the \\\"International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination\\\" [resolution 2544 {XXIV)]. In all sincerity, what list of failures could we now draw up and must we not recognize that most of the responsibility for this failure rests upon the shoulders of Member States which refuse to implement coercive resolutions providing for measures such as the embargo, the prohibition of arms sales and the breaking off of diplomatic relations? We must give economic questions their due and everyone must realize that the same trade exchanges, especially trade in precious metals, could be continued and sven expanded with a Government representing the great majority of the black population.\n21.\tWith the same feeling of indignation, the Government of the Republic of Haiti energetically condemns colonialism, which continues to keep large communities of our Africa in a sub-human situation. Apartheid and the policy of racial discrimination are unmistakably reminiscent of Mmn Kampf, which the world unanimously rejected after the sufferings, the slaughter and the destruction of the last war.\n22.\tThe Constitutional Government of the Republic of Haiti quite rightly believes that, following a pragmatic philosophy, the United Nations should associate its action closely with that of the Organization of African Unity in bringing to the resolutions of the latter its prestige, influence and the weight of its moral authority. We exhort each Member of the United Nations to do everything possible tr put an end to the humiliating situation in which these peoples of Africa find themselves, so as to grasp and understand the inexorable progress of history and to ensure respect for human dignity in every man without distinction as to race or color.\n17. Faithful to its most distant origins, and to its political philosophy of the dignity of the black man, as well as to the destiny of Latin America, which is also our destiny, the Republic of Haiti from the Caribbean Sea associates itself with the words of Africa expressed at the twenty-sixth session [1938th meeting/ so eloquently by the President of\n23, With regard to apartheid, the terrible fate imposed on the African peoples under Portuguese domination and Namibia, we must remind the Governments which conduct themselves as if the earth and its inhabitants had been created to satisfy the interests of a single nation, race, class or particular group, that they are infringing upon the\nfundamental principles of the Charter, threatening the security of all Members and hindering international cooperation. None of these problems can be solved within the framework of the United Nations so long as there persist, either through political calculation or in order to satisfy economic interests, attitudes and conduct which encourage the exploitation of those courageous peoples.\n24.\tSuch attitudes and conduct create doubt as to the essential principles of the Organization and undermine the confidence of people in it. If a common intention to work for the physical and moral well-being of humanity has brought us here, then it is time for us to cease to invoke abstract equality and freedom.\n25.\tDr. Francois Duvalier wrote in 1968:\n\\\"The great hope which the dynamic peoples of the third world have nourished since the last meeting of the General Assembly are far from being realized. The price of raw materials, above all the pries of coffee, sugar and sisal, continues to drop in the international market while at the same time the cost of manufactured goods goes up and up. Hie assistance granted by international banking institutions is insufficient in face of the urgent development problems that confront the Governments and peoples of the under-developed countries.\\\"\n26.\tSince then the situation has not improved but has deteriorated even more. Caught in an inflationary phenomenon, the world economy is suffering from a permanent imbalance with even more disastrous consequences for the countries of the third world, because, whereas the price of manufactured goods rises sharply, that of raw materials remains stationary, provoking a constant deterioration in terms of trade. No responsible nation can fail to realize the terrible consequences of such a situation to the international community, and the feeling of frustration and disillusionment which it entails.\n27.\tIn such a situation, it is illusory to speak of peace, since, as Pope Paul VI said, \\\"Peace is achieved by general development.\\\" Such a situation can be remedied only by a broader concept of social justice and equity, not only among the wealthy classes and the poor classes within a country, but also among the rich industrialized countries and the great number of poor countries whose peoples are still faced with the difficulties of stone-age men. This development strategy could very well be set up through the specialized agencies of our Organization, and through a more genuine and more effective co-operation on the part of the great Powers.\n28.\tTo that effect the leaders of the peoples of the third world must become newly aware of their responsibility so as to strengthen their solidarity and present a united front for the defense of the legitimate economic interests of these millions of men who are suffering from physical and moral wretchedness.\n29.\tLet us remember that no matter how difficult the situation, we men of the third world must be the prime movers of this effort to bring about the economic and social development of our countries. Not only does our action lead to positive results, but it also has value as an\nuplifting example and becomes a catalyst for the national effort,\n30.\tSuch was the deliberate choice made by the Government of the President for life of the Republic of Haiti, H.E. Jean-Claude Duvalier, who, in his desire to contribute to world peace, has drawn up a strategy based on a national economic policy and upon the search for international co-operation.\n31.\tAt this moment it is right to say how comforting for the Government and people of Haiti were the expressions of sympathy upon the death of our leader, Dr. Francois Duvalier, who had, for 14 years, directed the destiny of our nation.\n32.\tIn spite of the Machiavellian calculations of those who expected to see the first independent black republic of the world founder in civil war and subsequently constitute a threat to inter-American and world peace, the people were able to find within their history and the reserves of its race the necessary strength to ensure fundamental unity and pursue its great destiny.\n33.\tAfter the 1960 and 1963 hurricanes which severely affected the already precarious economy of Haiti, recovery was begun in 1968 thanks to the efforts of the Haitian' Government concentrated in those sectors where accelerated development could be brought about and thus lead the general economy into better days, such as assembly and processing plants, the tourist industry, and fruit and vegetable crops for export. Along with these activities leading to a rapid recovery in the general situation, the Haitian Government strengthened and expanded the economic infrastructure so as to stimulate private initiative.\n34.\tThe results were not long in manifesting themselves in a notable increase in the gross national product. Agricultural production continued to have a yearly growth rate of 2.5 per cent due in great part to an increase in the volume of exports, principally sugar and food-stuffs. The industrial sector showed an annual growth rate during the same period of 5.5 per cent thanks to the encouragement given to the processing industry for re-export.\n35.\tIn the field of the economic infrastructure, the Haitian Government has just made an extremely important leap forward with the operation of the Francois Duvalier Hydroelectric Plant at Peligre, which is now producing 180 million kilowatt hours a year. The production of energy is presently 100 per cent higher than it was last year.\n36.\tThe noticeable improvement in the living conditions of the masses of Haiti, along with the determination of President Jean-Claude Duvalier to pursue the revolution by progressively strengthening political democracy in response to the aspirations of the Haitian people, has permitted stability and the maintenance of an atmosphere of internal peace propitious to fruitful work.\n37.\tThe number of visitors and tourists has tripled, whereas the . great international enterprises have undertaken the construction of new hotels along our sunny shores.\n38.\tForeign policy being but the reflection of internal policy, we shall reply to the interest shown by this\nAssembly by stressing that the great step forward was only possible thanks to the constant policy of equity, justice and public welfare pursued by the Government of the Republic of Haiti. It is understandable that these courageous choices in favor of the great masses of the poor should have upset the ancestral interests of an \\\"oligarchy which was Haitian only in name\\\".1\n39.\tIt is the same oligarchy which, deaf to the voice of reason, indifferent and hostile to the higher interests of the country, fills certain large cities with its weeping and wailing,\n40.\tBut the policy of reconciliation, entente and peace of the Government ot the Republic of Haiti has given rise to unexpected results: former diplomats, members of parliament, secretaries of state, ex-members of the office of the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Haiti, not to mention a number of compatriots whp had not realized the humanitarian nature of the Haitian Revolution have come back to their native shores, where they are now freely pursuing their activities, under the protection of the law and the administrative authority.\n41.\tThe latest grave events which occurred in the Middle East on the very eve of the inauguration of this twenty-sixth session and which have provoked stormy debates in the Security Council show once again the precarious nature of the peace prevailing in that disturbed region. The Powers directly or indirectly involved in that explosive situation must place their own interests in the background and renounce their policy of escalating the arms race between the belligerents and must make a positive contribution to the action of this Organization.\n42.\tAs early as 22 November 1967, Security Council resolution 242 (1967) entrusted to the Secretary-General's Special Representative to the Middle East, Mr. Gunnar Jarring, the authority necessary to seek a formula for a viable peace between the parties to spare the civilian populace and war prisoners from any additional suffering. Would it not be a good idea to avail ourselves of these cease-fire periods in order to strengthen the role of the United Nations and, under its supervision, lead the parties not to a sterile and vain confrontation, but to positive and fruitful meetings?\n43.\tThe burden of hostility and hatred accumulated over the centuries among the peoples of that region necessitates an approach to the problem which would not be confined to an endless enumeration of complaints and counter-complaints; and we must note in this respect the new spirit of coexistence which today animates certain peoples of that region which only yesterday had been violently opposed.\n44.\tThe search for a wise solution does not consist in drawing up a long list of charges against Israel or the Arab States while pursuing a systematic policy of arming one party or the other with the ultimate goal of satisfying the desire for power and political hegemony on the part of the great Powers. More than vicissitudes and passing incidents,\nthese considerations, which arise from the confrontation of ideologies, are situated at the very basis of any serious attempt to restore peace to the Middle East. Would it not be a good idea, then-and this is the wish of the Republic of Haiti, which in these days when the wretched peoples of the Middle East, who have known the horrors of war, are binding their wounds and thinking perhaps of a better future-would it not be a good idea, I say, for the United Nations to intervene at this psychological moment to appeal to the conscience of those in authority to give new impetus to the mission of Ambassador Gunnar Jarring and advance the cause of peace by ensuring the political and economic security of all States of the Middle East?\n45.\tAlthough the General Assembly reaffirmed once again, in its resolution 2661 (XXV), the responsibility of the United Nations in the attainment of general and complete disarmament, which is the most important question facing the world today, the armaments race, with all the potential destruction which it implies, has not been halted.\n46.\tEvery day new chemical and bacteriological weapons are developed. The atomic Powers constantly reinforce their arsenals, while others undertake nuclear and thermonuclear tests in the atmosphere and underground the better to penetrate the destructive power of the atom. Resolutions, counter-resolutions and declarations of intent proliferate, while peoples witness the impotence of the Organization as the arsenals grow. For what purpose, we might ask, if the peoples of the third world are not regularly confronting threats to their security and their future? An infernal cycle seems to be continuing with the regularity of the seasons: the manufacture of atomic, thermo-nuclear, biological and chemical weapons; the destruction of stockpiles; then the manufacture of new, even mere deadly, weapons, and so forth.\n47.\tThe United Nations must intervene decisively to stop the terrible effects of this policy of armament, the consequences of which are incalculable, and of which pollution is only one aspect. We must mobilize all possible resources so as to achieve that supreme objective, on which hinges the future of mankind.\n48.\tThus the considerable amounts of money invested for some two decades now in the manufacture and production of those horrible weapons of destruction could be used for the creation of hospitals and educational liters and for the implementation of sweeping economic and social programs for improving the living conditions of the two thirds of all mankind on our planet who are suffering from all sorts of physical and moral wretchedness.\n49.\tIn that way the United Nations would be in a position to strengthen the role of its agencies responsible for the development of the peoples of the third world and to adopt specific programs to ensure continued growth in the developing countries. That, in the view of the Government of the Republic of Haiti, should be the very first objective which the United Nations should set for itself at this time the end of the twentieth century-for the full development of the immense potential of mankind.\n50.\tHis Excellency Jean-Claude Duvalier, the youngest President in the world, declared recently:\n\\\"Out of faithfulness to the doctrine of our revolution and out of personal conviction, I believe that the\nprinciples of non-intervention on the part of one State or group of States in the internal affairs of another, and the right of peoples freely to decide their own destiny remain the basis of international law and the primary condition for harmonious relations among the various members of the international community.\\\"\nThose two principles, together with that of the development of economic and financial relations through international co-operation and the peaceful solution of conflicts, form the pillars on which the Government of Haiti has built an active policy of rapprochement and co-operation with the States of the Caribbean area and of all America.\n51.\tWithin this framework the delegation of Haiti would like to appeal for the economic integration of the Caribbean area, the strengthening of its economic structures and the establishment of a realistic development strategy; because we remain convinced that the economic progress of the countries of that region should not be stated in terms of confrontation and antagonism, but in terms of solidarity and co-operation. Thus we invite the Governments of the Caribbean area, that cross-road of races, civilizations and cultures, to seek, in a common effort and fully aware of current-day economic imperatives, a form of co-operation that would solve such problems as their restricted national markets, permit horizontal specialization at the regional level and ensure their development in peace and in mutual respect.\n52.\tWhen we consider the wonderful course followed by some peoples of the world we can express our satisfaction and feel proud to tackle our problems with enthusiasm and confidence. Furthermore, the international situation is propitious. A spirit of detente can be seen on the horizon. The struggles in Viet-Nam in the past few years have abated and the people of Viet-Nam will soon be able to make their choice and choose their destiny freely.\n53.\tEurope, which twice during the course of this century led the world into war, is building new and powerful economic structures. The Germano-Soviet treaty, due to a great extent to the peaceful spirit of the Federal Republic of Germany, reinforced by the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, signed at Berlin on 3 September 1971, constitutes a great contribution to the maintenance of peace.\n54.\tThroughout the world men of goodwill are enthusiastically taking initiatives rich in promise, such as cultural and technical co-operation agencies which unite peoples of the French language and culture, and there is also town-twinning and many other ideas which should enjoy the firm support of the United Nations.\n55.\tThe roads of economic freedom to which respect for the dignity of man is so closely connected are as difficult as the roads of political freedom. The questioning of our traditional values, called the crisis of our civilization, offers perhaps a great opportunity to build a more just and better balanced world which would satisfy the essential needs of all men. We must and this is a heroic resolution, of course,\n2 Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, signed at Moscow on 12 August 1970.\n5\nbut very decisive for the future of humanity-devote the technical resources and the considerable sums invested in the policy of armament to development and the progress of the peoples of the third world and also the improvement of the living conditions of the poorer classes in the industrialized countries: in other terms and more simply, generalized and equitable development, social justice, the sharing by all men of the wealth of the world.\n56.\tThere exists a great force for peace which can be got under way, and men with great ideals have decided to transform this force into a veritable crusade to build the fraternal world of the future to which the new generations aspire with all their strength.\n57.\tThe Haitian delegation thanks the members of the Assembly for the attention with which they listened to this address and expresses the hope that at this twenty-sixth session, which bears the hopes of all mankind, reason and practical sense will triumph so that the General Assembly may reach practical conclusions in the examination of the problems on its agenda.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "75.\t  Mr. President, allow me to echo the sentiments which have been expressed by all the speakers who have preceded me and to offer you, on behalf of the Malta delegation, my warmest congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election is particularly welcome to us not only because of the high qualities which we recognize in Your Excellency, but also because your country, like mine, belongs to the developing world and as such, despite their huge disparity in size, they hold many ideals in common.\n76.\tMay I also take this opportunity to express our appreciation to your distinguished predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, for his inspired leadership during the historic twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n77.\tFinally, I wish to offer to OUL1 respected Secretary- General our admiration and gratitude for the dedicated service which he has so ably rendered to this Organization and to the cause of world peace during the past decade. It is with regret that my delegation views his declared intention to vacate his high office, and we can only hope that his inspired service will call forth an equally dedicated and worthy successor.\n78.\tTo the four States which have joined this Organization at this session-Bhutan, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar-we extend our warmest welcome and congratulations. May their admission be an augury for the true universality of our Organization.\n79.\tAs we look around the world today we see areas of great and unparalleled prosperity, where larger and larger numbers of people enjoy more and more of the material benefits of life, side by side with other vaster areas inhabited by the majority of the world's population where poverty and hunger are still part of the daily scene. This deep and divisive inequality has long been recognized by responsible statesmen everywhere as containing within itself the seed of future catastrophe, and declarations have not been lacking-especially within this Organization-stressing the need for action to remedy this state of affairs before it is too late. The proclamation of this decade as the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)J was a useful step in the right direction. But declarations in themselves must be met by concrete efforts on the part of the world community to achieve unprecedented results.\n80.\tThe time is short, far shorter than seems to be commonly believed, and certain protectionist trends which we have unhappily discerned in recent times will not contribute towards the success of the co-operative effort in development which the world's underprivileged majority simply must have within their grasp before the decade is out. We join our voices with those who, from this rostrum, have appealed to the developed countries to make a fresh and imaginative commitment to world development, to\nliberalize trade and to dismantle prohibitive tariffs, particularly on goods from the developing countries, and to , redouble their efforts in aid and assistance.\nMr. Mwaanga (Zambia), Vice-President, took the Chair,\n81.\tThe eyes of the people of the developing world will be focused next year on the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ. It is fervently to be hoped that their legitimate expectations will not be disappointed again; and that enlightened self-interest will be forthcoming in sufficient measure from the richer countries to ensure a continuous progress towards the expansion and liberalization of world trade with suitable concessions to the exports of developing countries. In this connexion, I cannot help remarking that the discriminatory limitations placed by some countries on their schemes under the generalized system of preferences have generated despondency and erected fresh barriers against the exports of those developing countries, like my own, which have so far been left out. At the same time it is of the utmost importance that the international monetary system should be reorganized as early as possible in such a way as to respond to the needs of all the world's countries, not only of the rich few.\n82.\tOur glance around the globe also reveals several areas of tension, of which some are recent and others of long-standing, but all of which are potentially explosive. The Middle East, South-East Asia, East Pakistan, southern Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean, to mention a few, are all areas where for one reason or another progress towards peace and security, based on mutual respect, must no longer be delayed. We are pleased in this connexion to note the positive movement towards detente which has taken place in Europe in recent times. We congratulate the parties concerned and look forward to further encouraging achievements in this theater which so closely concerns my country.\n83.\tIn the Mediterranean, the presence of large and powerful opposing fleets is not a factor for stability, and we venture to express the hope that, in the context of wider negotiations aimed at securing a more relaxed attitude in Europe generally, the potential for confrontation between the great Powers in the Mediterranean will also be suitably defused. My country has already committed itself to make an important contribution towards the maintenance of peace in the central Mediterranean. The NATO headquarters and military facilities in Malta are being dismantled and are in the process of being withdrawn at the request of my Government. The transition from a military to a peaceful coexistence depends, however, on certain economic realities which in our case are too important to be ignored. We had a war economy for many centuries and my country is not yet in a position to sustain its economic growth on normal activities like industry, tourism, agriculture, and so on. The big problem at present absorbing all the energies of my Government is the need to create in a very short time those economic instruments which Malta requires so that' it will not be forced at any time in the future to offer military bases to any foreign Power purely for reasons of economic stringency.\n84.\tThe situation in the Middle East continues to grieve us deeply. Despite all the efforts of the United Nations\nmediator, Ambassador Tarring, and other initiatives undertaken by other parties, the road to a just and lasting peace has not yet been opened. The cease-fire, although in its fifteenth month, remains a precarious substitute for a settlement. Hostilities may break out anew at any time. The disastrous consequences of such an eruption are neither desired nor sought by any side. But the present situation cannot prevail indefinitely. It is draining the resources of the protagonists; it perpetuates the agony of the innocent victims-the refugees-who have not known a home for 23 years; the continued closure of the Suez Canal continues to cause heavy economic losses not only to the parties directly concerned, but also to others whose trade routes are affected.\n85.\tMy delegation sincerely hopes that, through the continuing efforts of all, especially of those directly concerned and of the big Powers, the way will be opened to the full and final implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which contains all the basic ingredients of an acceptable settlement.\n86.\tIn South-East Asia my delegation views with anguish the continued death and destruction wrought by a war to which an end is not yet in sight. Despite the peace talks in Paris, despite the process of withdrawal of the United States troops, the sufferings of the populations continue unabated. May the day soon come when this sorely-tried people, freed from the presence of all non-indigenous forces, can freely decide their own future and bend their energies towards the rewarding task of reconstruction.\n87.\tIn southern Africa, the abhorrent policy of apartheid continues to proclaim racial discrimination in the name of separate development. My country vehemently denounces every form of discrimination and infringement of human rights. We make no secret of our disgust at a policy which seeks to make, on the grounds of race and color, second-class citizens of the majority of the people of South Africa, and to perpetuate a situation where a privileged- minority can dominate the rest. Likewise we condemn the colonialist policy of Portugal, the rebel regime of Southern Rhodesia, and the affront to the international community constituted by South Africa's continued illegal presence in Namibia.\n88.\tRecent events in East Pakistan have similarly caused us grave concern. Whatever the genesis of that situation, the world is faced today with an unprecedented influx into India of refugees, who have strained beyond limit the absorptive capacity of that country and its ability to give them food and shelter. Despite the efforts of the international community, and the welcome announcements by the major Powers of emergency assistance on a massive scale, the conscience of mankind demands still further effort. Bengal is a crucial test of world civilization and if the children die we are all indicted. The need for relief assistance has been described by international aid organizations as being so vast as to lie beyond the capacity of any country acting independently. It is therefore imperative that all nations should join together under the auspices of this Organization to assemble without delay a relief operation of truly massive proportions. It must also be said that no nation or the world community can realistically be expected to feed and look after 9 million refugees indefinitely, These camps of squalor are not the result of some unimaginable natural phenomenon. They are the direct result of political and military action-action that can be reversed. Without this hope, the millions of refugees face gradual disintegration.\n89.\tI have referred to a number of areas where tension abounds and where a solution, based essentially on political accommodations, is at best elusive. By all means let us persist in our efforts to seek such solutions-the world can do no less. But during the long-drawn-out process of negotiation let us keep in the forefront of our minds the plight of the unfortunate victims.\n90.\tThey, too, have their inalienable human rights, some of which may not be attainable while the present situations persist. But at least let the world ensure that their basic right to life itself is upheld. In the face of stark famine and pestilence threatening millions of refugees, let it not be said that this Organization could find time to discuss how to improve the quality of life on this planet, but was unable to save the lives of destitute refugees.\n91.\tEvery year during the general debate the world's statesmen continue to give expression to the hopes of humanity for a better world order than has ever been known in the past, one in which the specter of war will have been banished and peace and security will be available to all in a world without armaments. The progress towards disarmament registered in the past 25 years has been disappointingly modest. The various ''non-armament\\\" treaties negotiated in recent times stand out in all their stark reality against the background of the much brighter hopes for real disarmament which are still cherished by humanity as a whole. We welcomed those treaties for what they .were, as we shall welcome this year the agreed draft, convention banning biological weapons.\n92.\tBut our hopes for the future remain fixed on more tangible achievements. In particular, we would welcome early agreement on achieving a comprehensive test-ban and the conclusion of a treaty banning chemical weapons. Above all, we passionately await concrete results from the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the USSR, leading to the long-heralded agreement on limiting both defensive and offensive strategic weapons. Such a development could well be the necessary prerequisite for setting the stage for renewed efforts towards the goal of general and complete disarmament. In this connexion, my delegation has noted with interest the Soviet initiatives for convening a world disarmament conference [A/L.631], as well as a conference of all five nuclear-weapon States [A/8328].\n93.\tCertainly the movement towards nuclear disarmament cannot realize its full potential without the participation of all the nuclear Powers, including France and the People's Republic of China. My delegation welcomes the prospect of seeing the People's Republic of China assume its rightful place in this Organization during this session of the Assembly. We hope that that historic event will bring the United Nations a big step nearer to the realization of the goal of universality.\n94.\tMy delegation was instrumental in bringing before this Assembly the issue of ocean space in all its dimensions. My\nGovernment believes that all countries, each in its own way and within its possibilities, should contribute towards peace among all peoples. It is with that thought in mind that the Government of Malta continues to take a keen and lively interest in the work which the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction is doing in preparation for a conference on the law of the sea, scheduled to take place, we hope, in 1973.\n95.\tIn the terms-of General Assembly resolution 2750 C (XXV), adopted last December, \\\"the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole\\\". It is therefore our view that, unless the necessary international legal instruments for the orderly development of ocean space as a whole are laid down in the near future, conflicts and confrontations will reign in that vast area of our globe as technological progress makes the use of that area more varied and more intensive. In an attempt to deal effectively with the problems of ocean space through a unified and comprehensive approach to them, the delegation of Malta presented, at the summer session of the Sea-Bed Committee in Geneva, a draft ocean space treaty as a working paper for discussion purposes [see A18421, p. 105]. The paper seeks to outline an equitable legal framework within which the vital interests of mankind are protected and all States can find expanding opportunities in the beneficial and peaceful use of the marine environment.\n96.\tThe phenomenal advance of technology has produced increased awareness of a host of other problems, all urgently pressing for attention and solution. One of these closely affects the life pattern of the world's human population. I refer to the question of the elderly and the aged, the problems associated with the increasing proportion of the world's population falling within this definition as a result of increasing life expectancy and advances in medical care, as well as the urgent problem of utilizing to better effect the immense reservoir of human knowledge represented by that segment of humanity and its closer integration with the rest of society. My delegation will have more to say on this matter at the appropriate stage in committee.\n97.\tMy Government attaches the greatest importance to this Organization. We unreservedly uphold its principles and ideals. I welcome this opportunity solemnly to reaffirm Malta's unswerving adherence to the Charter of the United Nations. It is in this spirit that we endorsed the important declarations adopted last year: the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [ resolution 2734 (XXV)] and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)]. In its relations with other countries, Malta seeks to put these principles into practice. Our policy is to promote friendly and mutually beneficial relationships with all and hostility towards none. In that part of the world where we are situated, in the Mediterranean, we enjoy close and friendly relations with our neighbors, and it is our firm desire further to cement those friendships.\n98.\tWe visualize the Mediterranean as a zone of peace and we earnestly look forward to the day when such a prospect can become a reality, when all foreign forces alien to that sea would have been withdrawn in peace, and foreign intervention in the area would become a thing of the past. If, in the meantime, my country continues to make available to other Powers the use of its facilities for defense purposes, it is precisely because we are convinced, and intend to ensure, that the facilities are used exclusively for defense and security purposes and never for offensive acts against anyone, and under such conditions as will guarantee that our relations with each of our neighbors are not adversely affected. Such use of our facilities is, above all, designed to ensure for our people sufficient revenues during a period in which our efforts to build a peaceful economy find their greatest need.\n99.\tMalta possesses no natural resources, but its excellent geographical situation lends itself admirably to a concerted program aimed at attracting international conferences and conventions within the context of our developing tourist industry. It is my Government's express desire to host more such conventions and conferences, particularly those of a truly international character, and, in accordance with Malta's declared policy of changing its image from that of a former military base to a center of international peace and co-operation, we would welcome the opportunity of affording more facilities of this nature, including permanent facilities. In the meantime and until such time as we are able to develop our economy, our strategic position constitutes the closest similarity to a natural resource, and it is our right and duty to employ that one resource which God has given us for the best benefit of our people. Nobody would deny us that right.\n100.\tIn the full recognition of such right, I am glad to record that the prospects for still closer relations with our friends and neighbors have been enhanced. My delegation attaches particular importance to the excellent relations which Malta enjoys with its two immediate neighbors to the north and south Italy and Libya-and we have noted with appreciation the kind words spoken the other day from this rostrum about my country by the Foreign Minister of Italy [1954th meeting]. We fully reciprocate those sentiments.\n101.\tAs we embark upon the second quarter-century of our Organization's existence, we cannot but be struck by the immensity of the tasks facing us-in the fields of disarmament, economic development, colonialism, social progress, and the strengthening of peace and security. In addition, the inexorable progress of science and technology have awakened opinion to the dangers of environmental pollution which could threaten the entire basis for continued life on this planet. Only a truly co-operative effort on the part of all the nations of the world could, in the long run, provide adequate solutions to all these problems. It is time to sink our disagreements-which history will surely characterize as petty in order to embark upon a course of active co-operation, in the shared conviction that unless we do so, the future of our planet, this spaceship earth as it has been called, will indeed be bleak.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "52.\t  Mr. President, the sincere feelings which lead heads of delegations to congratulate the incumbent of the lofty office of President of the General Assembly are doubly felt by me, when I reiterate my delegation's deep gratification to see you presiding over our present session. Apart from your personal qualities of tact, knowledge and wide experience, you have a unique history as a resolute freedom fighter who unswervingly persevered in the face of numerous hardships and difficulties in promoting the cause of freedom and independence, and the deliverance of peoples from foreign domination and, above all, from economic backwardness and ignorance. There are no qualities admired more by my own countrymen than those of a dedicated freedom fighter. When such a person is the representative of Indonesia, a country which is bound to the Arabs by the strongest affinities of culture, religion and unity in the defense of the causes of liberty, justice and human dignity, we feel that we have equal reason to congratulate ourselves on such an auspicious occasion.\n53.\tIt is fitting to add here that your predecessor, Edvard Hamfc fo of Norway, lived up to our highest expectations when he presided over the commemorative twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, for which he merited our deep esteem and appreciation.\n54.\tThree years ago our distinguished Secretary-General pointed out in his report to the twenty-third session of the General Assembly that .. little progress, if any, has been recorded towards the growth of international order based on law and justice\\\" [A/72011Add. 1, para. 174]. It dis-tresses me to have to stand here now and express my fears that, despite the unmistakable signs of change which appear on the international horizon, it does not seem that any substantial progress has been made or is likely to be made to satisfy the full aspirations of the international community to peace and justice.\n55.\tThere have been, admittedly, some gestures from the imperialists which may give the impression, on the surface, that they have finally come to their senses. But let us not be deceived by all this. Whatever may appear as a sign of conciliation on their part would not really have taken place but for the resolute will of the peace- and freedom-loving countries and their insistence on regaining their full rights without any quarter being given or taken. In other parts of the world where international imperialism believes that peoples are dormant, less vigilant, or unable to resist outside interventions and designs, imperialism is still actively engaged in its usual scheming and manipulations. Thus, when it seems that, for example, United States policy is finally facing the realities in the Far East, let us not overlook the fact that it has never for a moment forgone its customary maneuvering in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n56.\tAs far as the Arab part of the world is concerned, we have to observe first that a few months ago we entered the fifth year of Israeli occupation of the whole of Palestine and of parts of three Arab States. We entered the fifth year of Israeli aggression and occupation without any sign that this dismal picture is likely to change through the concerted efforts of the international community. What makes this situation all the more alarming is the fact that Arab land has been under foreign occupation for a longer period than most of the European countries were under Nazi occupation. All humanity joined forces during the Second World War to dislodge the Hitlerite Wehrmacht from the occupied European countries and terminate the Nazi aggression. Yet, when it comes to putting an end to the Zionists' aggression in the Middle East, we find the international community, and particularly the very instrument it created to reestablish international peace and order based on law and justice, incapable of taking any effective action to achieve the first and foremost purpose of the United Nations. We enter the fifth year of Israeli occupation with all the signs and indications of a perpetuation of that occupation, ranging from the perpetration of more faits accomplis in the occupied territories to the ruthless and inhuman liquidation of the Palestinian resistance.\n57.\tFrom the time of its adoption on 22 November 1967 we did not have much faith in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We suspected its objectives and we doubted the possibility of its implementation. We opposed the resolution's departure from the principle of peace with justice and we resented the fact that it was to all intents and purposes rewarding the aggressor.\n58.\tThe four years which have elapsed since the adoption of that resolution have been enough to justify the worst of our misgivings. We realized that the resolution would never satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine and ensure their inalienable rights to return to their homes and determine their own future in their own country- rights which were reaffirmed by General Assembly resolution 2672 C (XXV) of 8 December 1970. We felt that any attempt to settle the crisis in the Middle East without restoring and respecting the legitimate rights of the Palestinians was unjust and contrary to the principles and purposes of the Charter Of the United Nations, particularly the inalienable rights of peoples to self-determination.\n59.\tWe were also certain that the resolution was impracticable, as we were confident that, unjust as it was, it had not the slightest chance of being implemented in the face of the now too obvious Israeli designs of expansion and acquisition of more territory by use of force. We are not happy to see that it took four years of futile attempts to implement the resolution to prove us right. We are not gloating over the failure, bu+ are rather saddened that the international community has not yet resorted to effective measures to vindicate the purposes of the Charter. Only such measures, as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter, can establish a just and durable peace in the Middle East. That anything short of these measures will not effect any substantial change in Israel's policy has been amply demonstrated by Israel's immediate and defiant rejection of Security Council resolution 298 (1971), the third resolution the Council has taken against Israel's illegal annexation of the city of Jerusalem.\n60.\tWhat distresses us most is that we have witnessed since the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly a certain drift on the part of.the United Nations into apathy and a willingness by allowing one of its Members to assume its functions to abdicate its responsibilities for re-establishing peace in the Middle East. The entire authority of the United Nations and even its mandate under resolution 242 (1967) itself have been usurped by one of the major Powers, a permanent member of the Security Council and, at that, the major patron and benefactor of Israel. What makes the situation all the worse is the fact that the United States, in pursing its alleged objectives of establishing peace in our part of the world, has never ceased appeasing the aggressor and granting Israel one concession after another as an excuse for obtaining a dubious Israeli commitment, which Israel has no intention of honoring in the first place. There were even reports that the Government of the United States has promised Israel further deliveries of supersonic planes and war materials in return for the promise of a partial withdrawal from the occupied territories of one Arab country. If this pattern of appeasement is to continue, Israel will acquire all that it at present desires of weapons and instruments of destruction without yielding an inch of the occupied territories. What makes this all the more alarming is that Israel is now being promised weapons capable of delivering nuclear war-heads when Israel has obstinately refused to ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. To modernize and re-equip the war machine of an aggressor in order to make him disgorge his loot seems to me a most curious enterprise. The Nazis would have been reigning supreme in the world today had their aggression been treated in a similar fashion. \n61.\tWe believe that it is high time for the United Nations to shoulder its responsibilities towards the people of Palestine and towards peace in our area. It should reclaim the initiative in the search for solutions and endeavor to put an end to aggression by adopting the very same measures provided for in the Charter. At the same time, I should like to reaffirm from this rostrum the-resolute will of my Government to remain behind the people of Palestine in their just struggle to regain their inalienable rights to their country and homeland. We shall remain faithful to the Palestinian resistance and will assure It of our full solidarity against the attempts aimed towards its liquidation. I should also like to assert our firm conviction that no envisaged solution, whether total or partial, of the problem of the Middle East has the flimsiest chance of success if it does not ensure justice to the Palestinians and restore to them their elementary human rights to existence and self-determination.\n62.\tOur concern for the cause of Palestine and the fate of the Palestinians makes us all the more aware of the need to assure peace and stability in another part of the Arab world very much closer to my country and directly affecting its vital interests and future developments. We have always felt that the liquidation of the United Kingdom presence in the Arabian Gulf was long overdue. It has always been our firm conviction that the liberation of the Arab world would not be complete without the elimination of residual spheres of influence and the total liquidation of foreign hegemony in the area of the Arabian Gulf. We therefore supported every move towards the total .restoration to the Arab people of the Gulf of their rights to complete freedom and independence. We have always proclaimed our solidarity with our Arab brethren in the Gulf i : their struggle to reassert their full independence and regain their complete sovereignty over the natural resources of their lands. We therefore supported the endeavors of our sisterly Arab States of Bahrain and Qatar to terminate their treaty obligations with the United Kingdom and to regain their rights to sovereignty and full independence. We welcome their entry into the ranks of the family of nations, just as we welcomed the entry of Bhutan and the expected entry of Oman, and pledge ourselves to join hands with them and other Arab countries for the complete fulfillment of the aspirations of the Arab people in the Gulf, We stand ready to extend the hand of co-operation to every other country in the area which wishes to rid itself of the last vestiges of foreign influence and we pledge our full support for them to occupy their rightful place in the family of nations. We therefore welcome the efforts that have been made to achieve the Federation of the Arab Republics of the Gulf and would assure the Federation of our unswerving solidarity against any attempt to encroach upon its territorial integrity.\n63.\tIt is the firm belief of my Government that the future of peace and tranquility in the Gulf can only be assured through co-operation among the States of that region, a co-operation based upon complete equality and respect for each other's sovereignty and independence and conforming to the. strict rules of international law. In this respect it is imperative that all territorial claims and ambitions be relinquished. Naturally this should involve a demonstration of goodwill and expressions of good intentions on the part of all the countries of the area. I regret to state that this does not seem to be the case with our neighbor, Iran.\n64.\tTwo and a half years ago the Government of Iran unilaterally declared \\\"null and void\\\" the valid and mutually binding Iraqi-Iranian Boundary Treaty, signed at Teheran on 4 July 1937. To justify that act, the Iranian Government alleged that my country did not honor its Treaty ' obligations in the Iraqi national river of Shatt-al-Arab.\n65.\tIn the face of that indefensible act, my Government never departed front an attitude of patience and self- restraint in spite of Iran's continued violations of Iraqi regulations laid down to ensure safe and orderly navigation on the Shatt-al-Arab. to pursuance of this policy my\nGovernment on several occasions-twice from this rostrum, at the 1776th and 1854th meetings-called upon the Government of Iran to agree to refer these differences among neighbors regarding the application of the Boundary Treaty of 1937 to the International Court of Justice and to recognize the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with Article 36 of the Statute of the Court.\n66.\tIn the spirit of respect for the rule of law and the belief that disputes among States should be resolved through negotiations and not confrontation, I hereby call anew upon our neighbor Iran to accept the reference to the International Court of Justice of our differences regarding the boundary Treaty and its application and to safeguard the legitimate interests of both countries,\n67.\tOne of the positive achievements of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly was the adoption of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. Iraq has always believed that the attainment of international security on a global scale can be reached only through the full participation of the People's Republic of China in international life, including the restoration of its lawful rights in the United Nations. We have therefore joined hands with other friendly countries in proposing a draft resolution [A/L.630] to achieve that purpose. We feel that this is the only lawful and honorable course the United Nations can take to right the wrongs which have been perpetrated for the last 22 years. We also regard any suggestion that there are \\\"two Chinas\\\" or even \\\"two seats\\\" as a deliberate, though futile, attempt to circumvent the restoration of the legitimate rights of the people of China in the United Nations. Any pronouncement of the desire to normalize relations with the People's Republic of China does not seem compatible with the attempt to advance the myth of two Chinas, nor is it reconcilable with the attempts to frustrate the realization of the legitimate rights of the peoples in the Far East. Thus, it would appear to us hypocritical to advocate the normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China, and to pursue at the very same time the inhuman war against the courageous and heroic people of Viet-Nam. It is equally unthinkable that such \\\"normalization\\\" can be successful when war is extended to Laos and Cambodia and when foreign troops-largely United States troops-are still present in South Korea under the banner of the United Nations, thus effectively preventing the peaceful reunification of that country.\n68.\tThe strengthening of international security is closely tied to the principle of universality in the United Nations. Thus the present Berlin Agreement should pave the way to the participation of both Germanys and all the other divided countries in the world Organization.\n69.\tI mentioned earlier the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It is fitting now to make a reference to other endeavors undertaken by the international community to lessen international tension and create the right atmosphere to strengthen international peace and security, to achieve general and complete disarmament and arms control, and thus to end the tragic waste of human energies and material resources. We support every effort aiming towards a universal prohibition of chemical and bacteriological weapons. We also welcome efforts made to ensure universal co-operation in outer space and on the sea-bed. We particularly laud the initiative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in calling for the conclusion of an international treaty concerning the moon [A/8391] and for a world disarmament conference [AJL.631J.\n70.\tThe Soviet Union's concern for a new world order based on stability and justice has been demonstrated to us and other Arabs by its generous and sincere efforts to end the occupation of Arab territories by Israeli forces and its support for the restoration of the rights of the people of Palestine.\n71.\tThe Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction [resolution 2749 (XXV)] had our unqualified support, and we hope th t the present preparations for a conference on the law of the sea will culminate in the desired international regime and machinery to ensure that the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor will be equitably shared by all mankind, particularly the developing countries. Such concerted endeavors towards the betterment of the human condition and the improvement of life on this globe will receive our full support and active participation. Nations of this world have finally come to acknowledge that, notwithstanding human failures and foibles in the political field, ours is really one world regardless of political, geographical or other boundaries that separate nations. That point has never been more strikingly emphasized than by the ills of the human environment. All of us now have become av> ure of the problems of the environment and we are all conscious that the price of the technological advancement of the developed countries is being paid by all mankind. We therefore look forward to the convening of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to be held in Stockholm next year. We trust that that Conference, in which we hope all States and even Non-Self-Governing Territories will participate, will succeed in finding ways and means of controlling the global pollution that threatens life on this earth with total annihilation.\n72.\tMy country's faith in the United Nations as the only means available at present to co-ordinate universal efforts to maintain international peace and security, to develop friendly relations among nations and to achieve international co-operation in the economic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields has never wavered or diminished in spite of our valid grievances and misgivings. And in spite of the criticisms that have been occasionally and often rightly leveled against this world Organization, we do acknowledge the fact that efforts have been made and achievements recorded towards promoting international co-operation in the non-political fields. My country has always supported, and whenever possible actively participated in, the endeavors of the United Nations in the social, educational, economic and humanitarian fields. My country is proud to be represented in the Commission on Human Rights, the Commission on the Status of Women and the Committee on Natural Resources. We have always supported the activities and programs of the United Nations Development program and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. As a token of our appreciation of the assistance these two bodies have been rendering to the large\nnumber of developing countries and Territories, we have recently decided to increase our annual financial contribution to the United Nations Development program from $220,000 for 1971 to $300,000 for the year 1972, and from $10,000 for 1971 to $12,500 for next year's budget of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. We stand ready to study every possibility of rendering assistance within our means to all efforts of the United Nations to promote international co-operation in the economic, social and humanitarian fields.\n73.\tIt is indeed ironic that despite our awareness of the unity of mankind, regardless of race or ethnic origins, we still witness the divisive elements produced and nurtured by racial discrimination and the criminal theories of racial, religious or national superiority. Moreover, it is tragic that we still, in the last third of the twentieth century, have to endure the evils of apartheid and the fallacy of the existence of a \\\"chosen people\\\". No effort is too great and no price is too high if we are to overcome those social evils which are at the root of man's subjugation by man. Even our efforts in the field of decolonization are doomed to failure if we permit the persistence of tht n.yth that some men, because of their color, religion or race, are superior to others and accordingly have the divine right to shape the destinies of other peoples.\n74.\tIt is deeply discouraging to continue to witness the inability of the world Organization to take effective measures against the perennial problems of colonialism in Africa, due mainly to the failure of the Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities and exercise its full authority with regard to Namibia, Southern Rhodesia, and the Portuguese colonies. The International Court of Justice has given its Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970). What remains to be done now is to adopt effective measures to put an end to that illegal presence. It is to be hoped that those measures will pave the way to the liquidation of the unholy alliance of the colonialists in Africa and to the beginning of the total liberation of that great continent from colonialism.\n75.\tThis session marks the tenth year of the incumbency of U Thant, our esteemed Secretary-General. We take this opportunity to pay a sincere tribute to his indefatigable efforts in the service of the United Nations, to his integrity and his total dedication and adherence to the purposes and the principles of the Charter. U Thant has endured the strains and stresses of this delicate office and, in spite of many pressures, he has succeeded in living up to a reputation of complete neutrality and integrity. We shall be sorry to see him leave the service of this Organization, but we are quite confident that he will continue to make every effort to promote the purpoces of the Charter.\n76.\tThe man who will replace him will have to shoulder an onerous and formidable task. He will have to be endowed with exceptional qualities: competence, tact, knowledge, infinite patience, and wide experience in the affairs of international organizations. He will have to be a man of unique integrity having a profound sense of justice, and above all a man fully dedicated to the United Nations. Those qualities would then enable him to strike a balance between the enormous demands of his office and the need to maintain absolute neutrality in the face of conflicting interests. The background of the candidate to that office should be such as to make him totally immune to the pressures to which he will undoubtedly be subjected once he assumes his lofty position, and which he cannot in all conscience allow to influence the discharge of his duties. Such an individual may be difficult to find, but we are confident that he exists. After all, he will be only a human being, albeit of exceptional qualities, dealing with other human beings.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n122.\t We are met together in this Assembly in a further attempt to resolve some of the issues which continue to militate against the progress and prosperity of nations great and small-. Indeed, many of these issues have been on our agenda since the inauguration of the Organization. Frustrating as that may be, we must continue to apply ourselves to the task in an endeavor to find solutions to these problems if we are to save mankind from self-destruction.\n123.\tIt is against that background, Mr. President, that you have assumed the presidency of this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and my delegation extends to you sincere congratulations on your election and pledges to you its full co-operation. We take this opportunity also to express our appreciation to Ambassador Hambro of Norway, who so ably guided the deliberations of the Assembly's twenty-fifth session.\n124.\tThree newly independent nations Bahrain, Bhutan, Qatar have now become members of this Assembly. Jamaica extends to them a hearty welcome, feeling sure they will play their full part in the deliberations of this Organization.\n125.\tOnce again the time seems to have come when the United Nations must find itself a new Secretary-General. It appears that we must take as final our Secretary-General's pronouncement that he will not be persuaded to accept an extension of his term. At the appropriate time my Government will wish to have the opportunity to place on record an expression of our appreciation of the contribution U Thant has made to the cause of world peace, our awareness of the delicacy and inherent difficulties of his many responsibilities, and a sense of our indebtedness and that of all humanity for his distinguished service. For the present, however, it appears that the United Nations must now address itself to the task of selecting his successor. In that connexion, there is one thought I would wish to leave with my colleagues.\n126.\tWhenever a change in the office held by the chief international civil servant is contemplated everyone succumbs to the temptation of proceeding to define the almost superhuman qualities of mind of heart a United Nations Secretary-General must bring to his task. In that respect we are all no doubt quite right. Seldom, however, do we, the Member countries of the United Nations, pause to remind ourselves that there are obligations which we owe the holder of that post and which have probably not been discharged with sufficient concern for his effectiveness.\n127.\tIn the view of my delegation a special responsibility devolves upon the smaller Powers of the United Nations to make the effectiveness of the office of Secretary-General their particular concern. It is in the interest of the smaller Powers that the United Nations should grow in strength and prestige. It is in our interest that this trend towards the removal of world issues from the United Nations forum should be reversed. It is we who mainly stand to gain from an effective Organization; it is primarily our interests that are damaged when the United Nations fails. And to strengthen the hand of the Secretary-General is to strengthen the whole United Nations.\n128.\tMy delegation would urge that, as we go to the selection of a new Secretary-General, we should pledge that we will together provide our Secretary-General in the future with the unswerving support he will need for the effective discharge of his onerous duties.\n129.\tLooking now at the background against which the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly is being held, my delegation must express its deep concern at the global financial crisis that has greeted the opening of the Second United Nations Development Decade, a crisis which has been highlighted by the announcements of the President of the United States on 15 August.\n130.\tIn many an international forum the issues raised and the problems posed to the international community by these recent measures are being actively debated, and it would be inappropriate and no doubt impracticable to debate this range of issues here in this Assembly. Speaking, however, as one of the developing countries of the world, it, is our view that the present international monetary crisis can be traced to the trading, financial and social policies of the developed countries. Their unwillingness to open their markets to the developing world or to accept restrictions upon their manufactured goods hinder the attempts of the less developed countries to industrialize. Those policies, linked to the poor flow of aid tied to their source, have worked to create a level of international conflict, misunderstanding and economic autarchy that has produced the present crisis. If conditions of trade which for us are normal can be rapidly restored, we shall see the upward movement of our economies continue, but if they are not restored, we shall soon find that a dramatic reversal will take place in the upward movement of our economies and in the already inadequate increases in our living standards. Unemployment will grow, and so will its well recognized and inevitable consequences.\n131.\tAlthough the great trading nations have commend- ably decided that their response to the events of 15 August will be an attitude of understanding and offers of cooperation and we commend them highly on that we must remind both them and the United States that the present uncertainties in matters of trade cannot be allowed to continue. We are in grave danger of inadvertently creating a global contraction in trade that in turn will mean a dramatic fall in the total living standards of all mankind.\n132.\tIt is here in this Assembly that the political decision should be urged upon the major trading nations not to permit such a contraction of trade. The disastrous consequences it would inflict upon the living standards of us all are well known.\n133. In 1970 the over-all development progress of the developing countries achieved a growth rate of 5 per cent. That was also the average growth rate of the 1960s-a rate not regarded as satisfactory by the countries most concerned. The developing countries are conscious of their own problems: rapid population growth; rampant unemployment; haphazard urbanization; inadequate housing; un-diversified and meager diets; insufficient facilities for health and education. They can and are tackling those problems by their own efforts and with outside help when it is available. But they suffer greatly from other problems not of their making and outside their control.\n134. This globe is but a small world. Economic impulses are transmitted from one country to another almost immediately. Inflation in one country is quickly exported to another, and the more powerful the inflation-producing country, the more widespread the havoc. It is obvious that the main responsibility for finding solutions rests with those that possess the greatest economic strength. An orderly economic expansion of the rich countries is vital not only for their own benefit but also for the progress of the developing countries, which depend on the delicate links of international trade and finance for the wherewithal to meet their own development ambitions.\n135.\tBearing that in mind, Jamaica believes that, should the enlargement of the European Economic Community come about, due consideration will be given in the formulation of its future plans and policies to the needs of the developing countries and, in particular, those whose economies will be seriously affected by the merger.\n136.\tMy delegation welcomes the progress made at the fifty-first session of the Economic and Social Council in the area of global and regional co-operation. At that session a genuine effort was made to reorganize the functioning of the Council, which is the main policy-making body of the United Nations system in the economic and social fields. A standing committee on matters relating to the transfer of operative science and technology to the developing countries was established by Council resolution 1621 B (LI), and we welcome the recognition by the Council of the increasing role which regional economic commissions should play in the advancement of the interests of the countries which they service.\n137.\tWe look forward with high expectation to the forthcoming meeting of ministers from the developing countries to be held in Lima, Peru, and to a successful conclusion of the work of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade' and Development, which will be convened in Santiago, Chile, in 1972. In the midst of all these preparations, it is hoped that there will be an early resumption of confident trading on the international, financial, commodity and other markets. That return to confidence is necessary for trade amongst developed and developing countries, for the promotion of East-West trade and for trade among the developing countries themselves.\n138.\tThe application of science and technology to development is a question which historically has not been given great attention in the developing countries. Many of those countries have achieved their independence without having inherited the scientific institutions and technological infra-structures that would allow them to implement adequate development policies. We are thus faced with the double task of training manpower while at the same time establishing institutions and carrying out development plans.\n139.\tJamaica therefore welcomes the United Nations World Plan of Action for the Application of Science and Technology to Development and expects to co-operate fully with the Secretary-General in that regard. If, by the misapplication of science and technology in the past, the developed countries have polluted the atmosphere and the oceans, and if the problems of health and poor living conditions in the developing countries have remained unalienated because of a lack of science and technology, then that is all the more reason why all countries, both developed and developing, should co-operate with the Secretary-General so that his world plan will contain a co-ordinated set of ideas which can act as a guide to their Governments in implementing their particular national strategy.\n140.\tThe link between environment, development and technology is too obvious for any Government to ignore. It is no longer necessary to impress upon representatives or upon the public at large the dangers inherent in the present ecological state of affairs which have been brought about by one-sided development and the ruthless exploitation of natural resources.\n141.\tThe United Nations system now offers us a new opportunity for global planning and for future development which we cannot but grasp willingly. Relative to our resources, the correction of past mistakes can be costly, but let me here and now emphasize that, from the preliminary research which has so far been done, it is becoming quite obvious that development planning which takes account of environmental factors need not be more costly than development planning which ignores the environment. Let us not be deterred by the larger number of inputs required for environmental planning. The fact is that even in the short-run the outputs from this type of planning can be much more comprehensive, useful and economic than from ad hoc decision-making.\n142.\tWe recognize that waste should not be regarded as an inevitable nuisance. We now recognize that noxious gases which have been released and which pollute the atmosphere can be a source of valuable raw materials. We now recognize that with environmental planning, natural resources need not be wasted, and that through environmental planning techniques investments -made at a particular point in time can be saved from obsolescence for a much longer period.\n143.\tBearing all those considerations in mind, my delegation expresses the hope that this session of the General Assembly will take measures to ensure that each and every country on earth will have access on an equal footing to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held at Stockholm in 1972. We cannot expect to have the world half polluted and half clean.\n144.\tJamaica attaches the greatest importance to the activities being pursued under United Nations auspices regarding the law of the sea, the utilization of the resources of the sea, and the preservation of the sea as a clean, healthy and natural resource for the benefit of all mankind. Delegations from Jamaica have actively participated in conferences and seminars sponsored by the United Nations on these questions. We look forward to an early agreement on the establishment of a new international regime for the seas and oceans. However, we cannot but feel some disquiet over the reticence on the part of some Powers \\.o recognize that the time has come when no nation can seek to capture for itself, and exploit in a haphazard manner, the resources of the sea-bed and of the ocean floor.\n145.\tThe changes and turns of history have given a few great Powers the technology necessary for such exploitation. Their technological developments in ocean-floor exploration and utilization are proceeding, but these seem aimed at selfish national advancement. Do the great Powers really imagine that they can now carve up the ocean floor among themselves in the same way as they previously carved up the land into colonies?\n146.\tWhile there might have been an excuse in earlier centuries for a chauvinistic approach to the exploitation of those natural resources not yet belonging to any individual or group of individuals, today we have adequate machinery within the United Nations to ensure that a peaceful and harmonious development of the ocean floor takes place in a manner consistent with the over-all needs of all countries, large and small, developed as well as developing.\n147.\tThe fishing rights of the developing countries in their off-shore waters should be preserved. The technologically advanced nations cannot hope to squander their own fishing resources and mercilessly exploit the off-shore fishing of other countries and appropriate to themselves the resources of the ocean floor. The Government of Jamaica looks forward to a sane and humanitarian approach to the settlement of these problems in the future meetings and conferences of the various bodies within the United Nations system, and in the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea.\n148.\tLast year in his address to the General Assembly my Prime Minister underlined the necessity for us to relieve the United Nations of the burden of responsibility for the exclusion of the People's Republic of China [1875th meeting, para. 49]. He also noted, however, that the principle of universal membership and simple realism called for a solution which would recognize that the millions of people in Taiwan de facto stand outside the political authority of Peking.\n149.\tThe present session sees us actively seeking a solution to this problem, with which the international community has grappled for some two decades. My delegation feels that a new sense of reality has been brought into this Organization by the increasing recognition of the fact that a quarter of the world's population cannot remain unrepresented in these halls. But we also note that there are certain realities in the situation in east Asia which need to be borne in mind: de facto, the Government of Taiwan has exercised effective control over that country for over two decades. By any accepted concept of international law, this would normally constitute a right to separateness a separateness which the international community should be willing to recognize. We neither assume nor believe that it is beyond the bounds of present-day diplomacy to find a formula which could give to the People's Republic of China its United Nations representation, including a permanent seat on the Security Council, and a seat in the General Assembly to Taiwan.\n150.\tIs the time not right for all the so-called divided States which de facto have operated for two decades or more as separate entities to be given their rightful voices in the world forum? Such a global solution of these problems which have been the accidents of war could surely be designated a great leap forward by the United Nations. Whether or not a decision on the representation of China is finally taken at this session, my delegation expresses the hope that the Assembly will be able to turn its attention this year to the problem of the divided States and their admission to the United Nations. My delegation will co-operate with other Member States in appropriate initiatives which may be taken to that end.\n151.\tIt is with regret that the question of the Middle East, far from being settled, is regarded by many as one of the intractable problems of the world. My delegation once more expresses its heartfelt sympathy to all those persons who have been uprooted from their homelands and to their offspring, who have never known a home. A solution must be found whereby these unfortunate people can be made to feel that they have not been swept aside by the tide of history and that the world community will never refuse to recognize their claim to a just settlement. It is still the view of my delegation that the issue of resettlement still holds the key to the solution of the Middle East problem.\n152.\tWe appeal to nations not to use the Middle East as a pawn in the game of power politics. It cannot be in the current interest of the great Powers for things to remain as they are. The situation continues to be a strain upon commercial relations between the countries of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans and represents a financial burden upon the international community. Again, my delegation would urge that this Assembly establish a new commission to seek and find solutions for the plight of the refugees and to prepare proposals for their resettlement and compensation.\n153.\tAs if the long-standing problem of the Palestinians was not enough, this year has seen a sudden increase of many millions in the world's refugees as the domestic disagreements of the people of Pakistan have spilled over national boundaries. When all the possible exaggerations and overstatements have been allowed for, the present situation and the plight of the refugees still remain a human tragedy of monumental proportions. There is no State Member of this Organization that is not moved by the immensity of the misfortune and would not help to find solutions if it could.\n154.\tThe political dispute is indeed a domestic affair of the sovereign nation of Pakistan and as such is not a matter of international concern; but the possibility always exists that external involvement could make it & threat to international peace and security. Apart from this possibility, however, my Government is concerned primarily with the humanitarian problem of the refugees. Jamaica supports the United Nations efforts made so far to gain access to the refugees, to ascertain the facts concerning their condition and to appreciate the circumstances in which their return to their homeland might be made possible. In the same way my Government supports the United Nations efforts to restore basic infra-structure, repair roads and bridges, reopen waterways and otherwise assist in restoring the normal life of these communities.\n155.\tWe know that many distinguished individuals have offered their good offices in this tragedy. Many governments are quite willing to do the same. We can only hope that a way will be found by which this willingness to help might be converted into effective help.\n156.\tThe situation in the southern countries of the African continent continues to be a cause for grave concern. The Territories over which the Government of Portugal still exercises colonial control are in turmoil, with the tide of rebellion and depression sweeping backward and forward across the face of the land. Under de facto illegal regime, apartheid moves gradually into all aspects of the social and economic life of Rhodesia. No amelioration of this policy of apartheid is in sight. Only in Namibia is there a ray of hope.\n157.\tAt last year's session of this Assembly my Prime Minister urged the United Nations to go to the rescue of the people of Namibia [1875th meeting, para. 66]. Since then, by majority vote, the International Court of Justice has rendered its advisory opinion on the legality of the South African presence in Namibia.s We have been told that no legal basis exists for that continued presence. A foundation has been laid for such action as the United Nations might choose to take within the limits permitted by the Charter to remove that South African presence. The Jamaican delegation supports the initiative taken by a number of Member States in urging the Security Council to give practical effect to the legal opinion. In my country's judgement, the international community has a solemn obligation which it should no longer postpone.\n158.\tLet us continue to address ourselves also to another decolonization problem: the fate of small inviable colonial and Trust Territories. In this connexion, I repeat my Prime Minister's proposal of last year that a Committee should be set up to study possible terms of their association with the United Nations.\n159.\tIn closing, I should like to express the gratitude of my delegation to the staff members of the United Nations for their untiring service in the cause of peace. In particular, I wish to place on record the high appreciation of the Government and people of Jamaica to Dr. Ralph Bunche, who, for the first time that I can recall in these many years, is not with us in this hall. His dedicated and imaginative contributions to the improvement of the lot of the world community have received international recognition and have brought prestige and honor to the United Nations.\n160.\tSolutions to the many difficulties which beset international relations and answers to the intractable problems of peace and want, can emerge only out of the continuing spirit of co-operation and the realities demanded of all of us here. The future of the Organization and the realization of the ideals expressed in its Charter rest squarely on the international community. Jamaica will continue to fulfill its responsibilities to this end.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "154.\tIt is with great pleasure that I extend to you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation and myself, our sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election to the high post of President of this Assembly. Your election to preside over the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly is not only a recognition of, and a vote of confidence in, your qualities, but also a homage to your great country. In this connexion, the delegation of Yemen wishes to assure you of its full co-operation in your endeavor to direct the proceedings of the General Assembly at this session. My delegation wishes also to pay a tribute to your predecessor* Edvard Hambro, for the efficiency and wisdom which he amply demonstrated during the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n155.\tDuring 10 years of unfailing efforts, the Secretary- General of the United Nations, U Thant, has rendered his service with competence, patience and dedication. We feel indebted to him for the ability, courage and personal integrity which he has shown in times of crisis, when the fate of the United Nations as an instrument for peace was at stake. U Thant, the man of peace and wisdom, has won the world's respect and high esteem. We pray that he will be able to continue to serve the cause of this Organization to which he has given so much of himself.\n156.\tThe delegation of Yem<M is greatly pleased to welcome warmly the new Member States, Bhutan, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, on their admission to this community of nations. We are confident that their membership will undoubtedly give a new impetus to the United Nations in its quest for universality and international peace, justice and dignity for all mankind, irrespective of race, color, creed or political belief.\n157.\tMy delegation is happy to state that Yemen has succeeded in achieving its national unity under the republican regime. Consequently, we face the great challenge of introducing within our limited resources the basic economic, social and educational developments which have been long awaited by our people. Yemen has embarked on a number of issues that are considered to be of profound importance in fulfilling the aspirations of the Yemeni people. Firstly, a permanent constitution providing for the establishment of a Parliament was drawn up and proclaimed on 28 December 1970. Furthermore, the Parliament, composed of 159 representatives, was set up in a free and general election for the first time in the modern history of Yemen. Secondly, my Government in co-operation with the United Nations specialized agencies and other international institutions has started a program of reform within a national plan of economic development. Thirdly, in the international arena, Yemen, which belongs to the non- aligned nations, strictly follows a policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries, respects the territorial integrity and national independence of other States, regardless of their political or social systems, and uncompromisingly opposes colonialism, racial discrimination and the policy of apartheid. On the other hand, Yemen has expanded its diplomatic ties with a number of countries in conformity with our policy of non-alignment and according to our national interest. In this connexion, Yemen reaffirms '<. belief in the unity of all Yemen and its people. My Government realizes that the task ahead of us is not an easy one, but we are confident that our fellow countrymen are able and willing to stand up to their responsibilities and meet the challenge.\n158.\tLast year the United Nations celebrated its twenty- fifth anniversary. Assessments and examinations of the role of this Organization were made in order to draw up a balance-sheet of the successes and failures of the United Nations. Admittedly, the record was set straight, arousing our utmost concern for the fate of our Organization. Indeed, our expectations that the United Nations would achieve the objectives of the Charter did not make us lose sight of the role which this international body should play. Rays of hope and encouragement which afforded grounds for optimism were pointed out and predicted. My delegation is happy to see signs of improvement and of a relaxation in international relations which partially fulfill some of the hopes that were expressed during the last session of the General Assembly.\n16\n159.\tWe welcome, in particular, the United States Government's initiation of a dialog with the People's Republic of China. We see tills as a realistic and natural approach, which could lead to the normalization of relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States and certainly have an impact on the relations among many nations.\n160.\tThese rays of hope are not strong enough to dissipate our anxiety regarding international peace and justice. The world community is still confronted with a series of problems which constitute a threat to peace and have a direct impact on the fate of our Organization. Wars of aggression and foreign domination persist and continue to be a source of anxiety and alarming concern.\n161.\tIn Viet-Nam, tragic events continue to occur every; day, spreading widely over all Indo-China and constituting the major obstacle towards reaching a solution to this question. The Government of Yemen asserts Us conviction that the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Viet-Nam is a necessary condition for any peaceful settlement in accordance with the principle of self-determination enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The people of Viet-Nam should be allowed to express their wishes freely and without any outside interference.\n162.\tOn the question of the Korean conflict, the Yemen Government strongly favors one united Korea, free of foreign interference.\n163.\tThe question of colonialism and colonial domination in South Africa remains unsolved, despite repeated resolutions calling upon the colonial Powers to recognize the right of the people to self-determination. The Government of Pretoria continues to pursue a policy of oppression and terror against the population of Namibia, as well as its repugnant policy of apartheid against the indigenous people of South Africa. The Yemen Government deplores the persistent refusal of South Africa to implement the resolutions of the United Nations regarding Namibia, particularly resolution 2145 (XXI), of 27 October 1966, which terminated South Africa's Mandate over Namibia as a result of that country's failure to fulfill its obligations under Chapter XI of the Charter. The recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice brings the Government of Pretoria to trial for its oppressive and illegal occupation of Namibia. My delegation calls for concerted international action to ensure the rights of the people of Namibia to self-determination and independence in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in resolution 1514 (XV).\n164.\tMy delegation also supports the legitimate struggle of the freedom-fighters in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) under the leadership of the Frente de Libertaao de Mozambique [FRELIMOJ. And we deplore the persistent refusal of the Portuguese authorities to implement the relevant General Assembly resolutions regarding those Territories,\n165.\tWe strongly believe that the United Nations should assert its authority, which has been flouted by the Government of Lisbon in violation of its Charter obligations,\n166,\tThe delegation of Yemen expresses its solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe in their struggle against the illegal and racist regime in Salisbury. Once again, all the Members of the United Nations who have respect for the Charter should act with responsibility to bring down the rebellious rdgime of Ian Smith and secure the transfer of power to the indigenous population of Zimbabwe.\n167,\tMy country is deeply concerned over the tragic situation in East Pakistan. We understand the heavy burden that India has to shoulder and we appreciate its difficulties. The international community is in duty bound to give generously to assist both India and Pakistan in their efforts to alleviate the sufferings of the refugees. We hope that Pakistan's internal difficulties will soon be overcome in such a way as to ensure the speedy return of the refugees. The Yemen Government would take this occasion to stress /its belief in the principle of full respect for the territorial integrity of all Member States.\n168,\tIt is high time now for this Organization to act with fairness and authority regarding the representation of the Chinese people. The restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, as the only legitimate Government which rightly and lawfully represents the great Chinese people has become imperative in this international body.\n169,\tMy country, which is a co-sponsor of the draft resolution on the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations [A/L.630 and Add.lf, will oppose any attempt to confuse the issue before this Assembly. The idea of \\\"dual representation\\\", advocated by some Member States, cannot be accepted since it violates the principle of the territorial integrity of States; furthermore, it replaces one problem by another,\n170,\tThe crime of usurpation committed by Zionism against the people of Palestine could not have been committed with impunity without the support of world imperialism. Zionism, which was born in Europe, has succeeded in becoming part of the plans for colonizing the Middle East. As far back as 1898, the Commission for the Colonization of Palestine was set up, along with the Company for Agrarian Development in Palestine and the Palestine Bureau. It was those institutions *hat were the instruments wf Zionist penetration. Then came the military and terrorist organizations, such as the infamous Haganah and Stern organizations. The Zionist plan was for the elimination of the Palestinians by expulsion and pillage, using all forms of oppression and terror in order to force the Palestinians out and acquire their land for the Jewish immigrants. The process of expulsion and pillaging still continues because the Zionist plan of expansion has not yet been completed.\n171,\tIt is regrettably true that the United Nations, because of intimidation and pressure by certain major Powers, played a part in the consolidation of this colonial fact by adopting a resolution which disregarded the will of the people of Palestine and was detrimental to the right of peoples to self-determination, as laid down in Chapter XII of the Charter.\n172,\tFurthermore, the right of the Palestinians to self- determination was once again disregarded when the Zionist\nState was admitted to membership in this Organization in May 1949. Since the creation of the Zionist State in the midst of the Arab world by terror and force, numerous resolutions have been adopted by the United Nations asserting the rights of the Palestinian people.\n173.\tThe right of the Palestinian people is sacred to us, who are convinced of the final victory of those who are fighting Jor their right to self-determination and independence. We unreservedly support the people of Palestine, as indeed we support other peoples fighting for their independence and human dignity. Neither Zionist imperialism nor colonialism and racial discrimination can check the movement of history. They cannot prevent the Palestinians, the Namibians or the Zimbabwe people from recovering their inalienable rights to self-determination and independence.\n174.\tIf a crime goes unpunished, it encourages the criminal to repeat the crime. Thus, by committing an unpunished act of aggression followed by another act of aggression zionism has been able to create a State and then expand it according to plans providing for the establishment of a Zionist State covering the whole area from the Nile to the Euphrates. Repeated acts of aggression by the Zionist State against the people of Palestine and, subsequently, against three States Members of the United Nations have made it possible for Israel to occupy new territory.\n175.\tPermit me to refresh the memory of this Assembly by quoting resolution 2672 C (XXV) of the General Assembly, which was adopted during the twenty-fifth session last year. The resolution states:\n[The speaker then read out the text of General Assembly resolution 2672 C(XXV)].\n176.\tThe Security Council has, on eight occasions since 1967, adopted resolutions warning Israel not to change the status of Jerusalem, to cease military attacks against Arab countries, and to withdraw from Arab territories.\n177.\tAs long as the Zionist State persists in occupying Arab territories, as long as the Palestinian people are denied their inalienable right to self-determination, as long as Israel continues with utter contempt and impunity to flout the numerous resolutions of the United Nations and the Charter itself, there can be no peace in the Middle East."

        "file_text": "\n153.\t Mr. President, it is my happy task to congratulate you, on behalf of the Somali Government, on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly an office which you are. eminently qualified to fill. We know that you will bring to the conduct of this session of the General Assembly the high qualities of learning and statesmanship which have been evident in your service to your country. The General Assembly will benefit also from the valuable experience which you have acquired in the field of international affairs.\n154.\tMy delegation also wishes to express to your predecessor, Mr. Hambro, its appreciation of his efficient and skillful handling of the arduous twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly.\n155.\tIt is appropriate at this point that I should extend to the delegations of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar the felicitations of my delegation on their admission to this Organization. They represent freedom-loving peoples with a rich cultural heritage and a determination to utilize to the maximum their generous talents and energies. We can be sure that they will make their just contributions to the furtherance of the objectives of the United Nations.\n156.\tPerhaps I am more fortunate than many representatives here in that I have had the privilege, in the past few months, of visiting many of the States of the Persian Gulf, including Qatar and Bahrain. I was deeply impressed by the skill with which all those States are tackling the problems of national development. It will not be long, I trust, before we shall also be able to welcome in our midst the representatives of the six remaining Gulf States which have recently formed a federal political unit. My Government has also been following with interest the political developments in Oman, and it is our hope that it will not be long before its people, too, are represented in the United Nations.\n157.\tOne of the factors that brought about the creation of this Organization was the threat which Hitler and his allies posed to the peace and security of the major Powers during the Second World War. With his defeat, threats to international peace and security are supposed to have dwindled, particularly since the situations that are potential sources of conflict do not threaten directly the interests of the major Powers. If those Powers do occasionally feel threatened, they are able to exercise their influence in the Security Council so that their interests can be defended.\n158.\tUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for the less powerful or developing countries. Many of them continue to face serious threats to their peace and security. Yet, despite repeated protests to the Security Council, despite the strongest evidence, backed by international law, there exists within the Council a group of powerful States which are indifferent to the predicament of the developing nations. The dangerous situation created in South Africa oy the application of apartheid policies, the ruthless colonial wars of Portugal, the dangerous and ambitious designs of the Smith regime in Rhodesia, the expansionist policies of Israel in the Middle East all those situations affect the welfare and the security of many developing countries and the millions of people who inhabit them.\n159.\tAre we to understand that a threat to international peace exists only when it involves directly the security and the interests of the major Powers? Are we to understand that resolutions on international peace and security which are supported only by the developing countries carry no weight despite the fact that collectively those countries represent over three quarters of the people of the world and of the membership of the United Nations? Is there a correlation between credibility and wealth?\n160.\tIf a majority of the Member States cannot find in the Security Council or in the General Assembly effective solutions to problems of international peace and security; if the United Nations cannot provide adequate protection for developing countries against lawless acts of aggression and against the consuming greed of racist, colonial and pseudo colonial regimes, then I fear that international law and order will be compromised and Member States will turn away from the world Organization. The United Nations, with all its faults, is still mankind's best hope for the realization of a new world order. It would be a great blow to that hope if the Organization were to be undermined by the self-interest of the few and by the denial to the many of the protection and justice which they seek.\n161.\tThe establishment of international peace and security through international cooperation is, of course, a fundamental objective of the United Nations. The development of regional organizations such as the Organization of African Unity has, been an important contribution to this goal. The OAU, for example, has been a stabilizing force in Africa. Its influence has worked for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means in accordance with the Charter, and for negotiation rather than confrontation. There have been no major wars between African States and the process of forging links between them continues steadily, if un-spectacularly, in political, social, economic, legal and cultural spheres in spite of the inevitable differences that arise.\n162.\tIt is my belief that Africa will remain a force for peace so long as its neutrality is not threatened by bigPower rivalries or by the economic or military pressures of neocolonialism or by the racism of southern Africa. The members of the OAU are all nonaligned nations and in that capacity have served to provide a balancing force in international affairs, My Government reaffirms its determination to work through the OAU for the maintenance of peace in Africa, and for the application to the world beyond of the principles of the Charter, which the OAU has repeatedly endorsed.\n163.\tInternally, the Government of the Somali Democratic Republic will continue to work for the wellbeing of all the Somali people through the application of the principles of socialism. Socialism has its unique political, social and economic philosophy but in applying it to our own conditions we have adapted it to suit our environment and traditions. It recognizes, above all, that our socialist revolution was not an end in itself but that the revolution is for the people.\n164.\tIt has recently been my pleasant and instructive task to visit a number of countries where I saw the great advances and achievements that had been made through the application of socialist principles principles which in every case were adapted to the particular needs and circumstances of the country. An additional aim of my visits was to improve and reinforce relations with those countries. In that context I should like to say that my Government places a high value on the maintenance of friendly contacts, not only with States which share our political philosophy but also with all States which are prepared to conduct friendly relations with us on the basis of respect for each other's integrity and sovereign independence.\n165.\tOne of Somalia's main concerns as a Member of the United Nations, and more particularly as an African State, is the continuation of racism and colonialism in southern Africa. The failure of the United Nations to come to grips with these twin evils remains a source of grave concern and disappointment to the Government and people of the Somali Democratic Republic. These evils have long been denounced by the world community. And yet, within the United Nations, there is a tendency in some quarters to belittle the efforts of those States which continue to insist that the struggle against racism and colonialism must continue without diminution. We hear, for example, that it is unrealistic to adopt resolutions which are unlikely to be carried out, or that the concern of African nations over southern Africa might be directed equally to other problems or to problems nearer home. It is significant that such criticisms usually emanate from those States whose economic and other ties with the southern African minority regimes are a contributory cause of the ineffectiveness of United Nations resolutions on southern African problems.\n166.\tThe other main cause, of course, is the continued intransigence of the minority regimes.\n167.\tWhat, then, can be done about southern Africa? In this situation I think we must always .ask these questions: what is the alternative to a constant laying down of the principles which must gain acceptance if justice for all is to obtain in southern Africa? What is the alternative to the firm and constant denunciation of the clearly perceived evils of southern Africa so that they are kept before the conscience of the world? What is the alternative to calling for the coercive powers of the world Organization short of the use of force to be directed against the intransigent regimes?\n168.\tThe United Nations could perhaps remain silent and inactive and thereby nullify whatever moral or practical initiatives it has so far undertaken, but one supposes that not even those States which would profit most from such a course would openly advocate a policy of indifference and cynicism. An alternative that has been advocated of late is that of dialog with South Africa. Somalia joined the majority of States which rejected this approach at the recent Organization of African Unity conference of Heads of State in Addis Ababa. It h easy to see how the idea of dialog, which has a certain surface charm, has come to be considered by a few States as a legitimate means of dealing with South Africa. But those who advocate this policy, however well-meaning they may be, are deluding themselves and are doing great harm to the cause of the liberation of the indigenous African peoples in South Africa, and in those neighboring States which South Africa supports and inspires.\n169.\tSouth Africa wants dialog for two reasons only. One reason is the hope that the dialog question will cause disunity in Africa and will deflect or undermine the international campaign against racism and colonialism which has begun to gain momentum, particularly among ordinary people and nongovernmental organizations in various parts of the world. African disunity would obviously weaken effective opposition to apartheid; and the grassroots movement within the international campaign presents a danger that is appreciated by the southern African regimes. The other reason for the dialog policy is that it would provide the basis for the establishment or expansion of African markets for South Africa's manufactured goods. Since apartheid keeps the majority of the people of South Africa poor, the Pretoria regime needs to find new outlets for the country's increasing industrial output. dialog would, therefore, be another means of entrenching apartheid, and in addition it would be a step towards bringing independent Africa under the economic sway of South Africa. The type of trade agreements likely to be set up externally under the dialog umbrella would be typically colonial arrangements. They would encourage the production and export of low-priced raw materials in exchange for higher-priced manufactured goods. The betrayal of the millions of Africans under colonial and racist domination should not be undertaken for any price. It would be tragic if it were to be undertaken in exchange for benefits which would at best be short-range and which in the long run would foster the cause of racism and colonialism in South Africa.\n170.\tIt is not only about the possible economic outcome of dialog that some States are deluding themselves. It is contended in some quarters that dialog, particularly with independent black African States, will somehow serve to undermine and crack the apartheid structure. But can it seriously be believed that dialog will serve to end the Terrorism Act and the policeState trials and persecution of those who oppose injustice and oppression? Will it end the mass deportation of Africans from their established homes to areas where they cannot make a living? Most important, will it restore their political rights to the African masses of South Africa? Let us not be taken in by the overoptimistic reports of the communications media whose aim is instant sensation rather than sober assessment. The wall of apartheid has not been breached and will not be breached by a show of friendship between Mr. Vorster, the Prime Minister of South Africa, and a few African leaders. The United Nations, then, is still faced with the problem of what it can do, effectively, to bring about justice in southern Africa.\n171.\tThe economic interests of the Western Powers have so far ensured that the Security Council would not call for economic sanctions. And what are the results now of the limited actions taken by the Security Council, or of the General Assembly resolutions aimed at bringing about change in southern Africa? Some of the major Powers continue to supply a long list of arms to South Africa under the pretext that there is a distinction between arms for external defense and arms for internal repression. The NATO powers decline to bring moral or material pressure to bear on Portugal to end its colonial domination in Africa and its aggressions against the neighboring independent African States of Guinea and Senegal.\n172.\tThe pattern of capitulation to the racist regimes is being repeated in tho case of Rhodesia. With the promulgation of the 1970 constitution, the rebel regime confirmed its determination to ensure white domination and the denial of political and other rights to the native people. The steady adoption of apartheid policies further illustrates that determination. The response of the United Kingdom, the Administering Authority, has been to hold talks with the Smith Government in an effort towards rapprochement with the rebel regime. In the meanwhile the economic sanctions imposed on Rhodesia by the Security Council are being effectively bypassed for want of a determined and effective naval blockade; for want of the kind of leadership that should be provided by the Administering Authority.\n173.\tAll these capitulations and evasions of responsibility by Governments are in contrast to the actions of a growing number of people who are finding ways to oppose racism and colonialism in southern Africa, One of the most hopeful aspects of the international campaign is the part being played by nongovernmental organizations in various countries. Whatever stirrings of consciousness exist in South Africa about the South African image abroad have been brought about not by friendly overtures, but by the pressure of ostracism in sport and in other fields. How much more effective would the ostracism of South Africa be if it had the full force of the international community behind it, and if it operated in all the fields and in all the way_ that have been recommended in various General Assembly resolutions.\n174.\tThe label of \\\"irresponsible majority\\\" has often been attached to those States which continue to call on South Africa's main trading partners to give substance to their verbal condemnations of racism and colonialism in southern Africa. If it is irresponsible to have a deep and abiding concern that a crime against humanity is being perpetrated in southern Africa, if it is irresponsible to refuse to meet that criminal situation with inaction and indifference, then we must take pride in the label of \\\"irresponsible majority\\\". As for South Africa's main trading partners, those countries can make United Nations resolutions on southern Africa effective. The onus of bringing about change in that area of the world is on them alone.\n175.\tA continuing threat to the peace and security of Africa has been the unfortunate indeed the tragic consequences of the colonial legacy of unnaturally divided peoples and territories. This factor is of particular relevance for the Somali people, for never in African history has a people of such homogeneity been divided between so many foreign rulers. Since those fateful years when the colonial Powers entered our region and divided up the land as if the people on it had no rights and no claim to justice, the Somali people have never ceased their quest for unity. This is a part of those realities which must be faced in Africa. Recently my President, Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, emphasized the necessity of coming to grips with these realities when he said:\n\\\"We should not be slaves to the colonial barriers created to suit the imperialist designs at a time when the wishes of the African people were not taken into consideration. We should have the courage to tear ourselves away from this bondage and resolve problems with sincerity and seriousness.\\\"\n176.\tThe position of my Government towards the question of French Somaliland is shaped not only by the fact that we are neighboring countries with strong historical and ethnic links, but also by Somalia's membership in the United Nations and in the Organization of African Unity. As a Member of those two Organizations my country is totally committed to supporting nonindependent peoples in the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence. These obligations arise from the Charters of the two Organizations and from the relevant resolutions adopted by those two bodies.\n177.\tNotwithstanding its obligations, the Somali Government is also cognizant of tile fact that, in the case of French Somaliland, the Government of France, the administering Power, naturally has a special and important role to play in promoting the political evolution of the inhabitants of the Territory, The French people regained their freedom and dignity following the French Revolution by establishing their government on three principles that are now universally acknowledged: liberty, equality and fraternity. These must be applied with equal force to the situation in French Somaliland. There must be equality of rights for all the people of French Somaliland; and a spirit of cooperation and understanding must be fostered and promoted among the people of French Somaliland, without any emphasis on ethnical, ideological or other differences that are actually of little relevance to the aspirations of the people as a whole. Finally, measures should be taken to ascertain the true wishes of the people of the Territory so that progress can be made towards the state of independence and liberty which they obviously desire.\n178.\tI am glad to report that, since the birth of our national revolution, relations between France and my country have been most cordial, and the bases for cooperation and better understanding on this problem and others have been firmly established.\n179.\tThe Charter necessarily remains the reference point of all our deliberations. Both the wisdom and the utility of its provisions have been established by the experience of the past 25 years. There has been little need for change, but there certainly has been a great deal of development of the principles implicit in the Charter. One of the most important of the achievements of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly was the adoption of resolution 2734 (XXV) containing the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security. That resolution, adopted almost unanimously, summarizes the development of the thought of the international community on the most essential aims and functions of the United Nations. In doing so, it reaffirms and strengthens the validity of the provisions of the Charter. Every issue on the agenda of the General Assembly can profitably be debated in the light of the relevant provision of resolution 2734 (XXV). My delegation believes that one of the most valuable tasks this session could perform would be to consider the question of the implementation of that most important resolution, as has been proposed by the Soviet Union [AjL,631J.\n180.\tIn our interrelated world the easing of international tensions in any one area is of great significance to all States. The Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September was a welcome sign of realism in world affairs, and it points to the fact that in an atmosphere of goodwill, patient negotiations can result in progress toward the solution of seemingly intractable problems. The way has perhaps now been cleared for direct agreements between East and West Germany and, it is hoped, for the political reality of the two Germanys to be expressed in the representation of both those States in the United Nations.\n181.\tAssuring permanent peace in Europe is an essential step towards the strengthening of international security and towards the goal of universal peace. A start has now been made in this direction. My Government believes that all these interests will be further served by a general acceptance of the Soviet Union's proposal for a European security conference which would include representatives of the United States and Canada. The heart of such a meeting would no doubt be negotiations on mutual and balanced induction of forces in Central Europe by the countries members of NATO and the countries signatories of the Warsaw Pact, but valuable cooperative efforts in other fields, such as the economic, scientific and cultural, would also be given attention. The outcome of a European security conference on the lines proposed by the Soviet Union could be only to increase the prospect of bringing about n new world order.\n182.\tThe conflicts and tensions raised by the existence of countries divided since the Second World War continue to i drag on, but the detente on Berlin gives rise to the hope that similar approaches based on political realities will be made in the cases of the two Koreas and the two VietNams. Both in Korea and in VietNam the question of reunification is a domestic matter which can be decided satisfactorily only by the peoples concerned. Their problems must be solved eventually by negotiations between the Governments of the divided countries.\n183.\tIt is a matter of grave concern to my delegation that the General Assembly has decided, on the recommendation of the General Committee, to postpone examination of the question of Korea until the twenty-seventh, session of the General Assembly. twenty- years ago this Organization lent its name to a highly questionable operation in Korea. What is clear today is that there is no justification whatsoever for that operation to continue. It should have ended immediately after the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. Unfortunately, the United Nations flag is still flown over the headquarters of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. I will not discuss the work of the Commission, since it stands condemned by its own reports. I wish to speak, however, about the fact that the United Nations flag provides a cover for the presence in South Korea of over 50,000 foreign troops. I cannot help thinking that if the flag was composed of a mosaic of United Nations flags, my Government would have no hesitation in removing the Somali flag from its midst. It is indeed a regrettable state of affairs that our Organization has so far failed to take action to withdraw the flag and dissolve the Commission,\n184.\tMy Government believes that it is time for this Organization to break the rigid mold in which its thinking on the Korean question has been set for the past 18 years. A bold initiative is required to improve the Korean situation, an initiative based on the realities of the present and free from the fears and policies of the past.\n185.\tWithin that context my Government was deeply impressed by the constructive and positive nature of the recent set of proposals which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has advanced as a basis for securing a solution to the Korean problem. This is a problem that must be settled by the Korean people themselves, and it is our hope that the proposals will pave the way for a final and happy settlement.\n186.\tMost certainly on the debit side of the international balance-sheet is the continuation of the war in VietNam. This whole world welcomes the United States troop withdrawals and other developments that seem to herald the beginning of the end of the ordeal of the VietNamese people. But the very accessibility of peace makes each day the war continues seem more unacceptable and each life lost on either side more tragically futile.\n187.\tThe farce of the supposedly democratic elections held recently in Saigon should be the final evidence, if more evidence were needed, that a long and vicious war has been fought for purposes as unreal as they were unworthy. It is obvious that the war has become a burden on the conscience of the people of the United States and that this great tragedy is compounded by the failure of the United States leaders to set a specific date for a complete withdrawal of foreign troops from VietNam. My Government joins the consensus of world opinion in calling for an immediate end to the war so that the people of that ravaged land can return to the task of peace and can decide their future on their own terms.\n188.\tThe recent thaw in relations between the United States and China is a development to be welcomed. My Government hopes that this easing of tension between these two great Powers heralds a new wind of change in international affairs, a new realization that national rivalries and conflicts of interest must be seen for what they are secondary considerations compared with the challenges inherent in the new conditions that have been created by advancements in science and technology.\n189.\tIt is our earnest hope, however, that the friendly overtures made towards the People's Republic of China by the United States will not be negated by a policy on the representation question that would in effect be yet another device for keeping the representatives of the People's Republic of China out of the United Nations.\n190.\tMy Government will support without reservations the restoration to the Government of the People's Republic of China its rights as sole representative of China in the Security Council, in the General Assembly and in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. We have always rejected the legal fictions, the procedural devices and the semantics that have been used to keep the true representatives of China from their rightful places in the United Nations. The current fictions about China's representation are no better than past ones. The \\\"two Chinas\\\" policy is completely unrealistic since both the Government of the People's Republic and the ruling authorities of Taiwan maintain there is only one China. The dual representation proposal is illegal because the Charter does not provide for such an arrangement.\n191.\tThe Government of the People's Republic of China was prevented from representing China as its de facto and de jure Government because of the intense cold-war rivalries of the 1950s. It is unrealistic for this situation to continue in the age of peaceful coexistence. The United Nations must not continue to accept a situation in which the provisions of the Charter are twisted or ignored in the interest of expediency.\n192.\tThe Somali delegation will join with those who seek a truly realistic and equitable outcome to the question of the representation of China.\n193.\tThe dangerous and tragic conflict in the Middle East continues to plague that area and to threaten world peace. And yet ever since the Security Council formulated and approved resolution 242 (1967) a reasoned and practical formula for peace in the Middle East has existed. That formula takes into account the basic positions of the parties to the conflict and makes clear the steps which have to be taken by each party so that a peace settlement can be achieved. In addition, it has the support of the majority of\n, the United Nations membership. There was widespread hope earlier this year that the Jarring mission would succeed in its aim of enabling the provisions of resolution 242(1967) to be translated into political reality. The positive response of Egypt and Jordan to that mission created the most favorable opportunity for a just and honorable settlement that has existed in the history of the Middle East conflict. Israel's failure to match the response of the Arab States disappointed even that country's staunchest supporters and has ensured that the shadow of violent conflict will remain over the Middle East and continue to threaten world peace.\n194.\tIn > February 1971 the difficult, long drawn out and complex Middle East problem resolved itself into one question only: does Israel want peace or not? The answer to that question has since been made clear through Israel's stated policy and through its actions in occupied Arab territory. Israel has shown a complete disregard of United Nations resolutions on the Middle East and in all areas of occupied territory there have been operations deliberately aimed at changing the status of those areas at turning occupation into permanent control. This is not a matter of conjecture, and the details are not in question. They have been widely reported by the international press and proudly described by the Israelis themselves.\n195.\tThe central issue of the Middle East conflict is, of course, the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force. Israeli leaders have claimed that it is wrong to expect Israel to accept that principle on the grounds that it has never been accepted before in human history. That is a debatable point. But more pertinent is the consideration that there has never before been a United Nations Charter; there has never before been a basis for the development of an international legal system aimed at outlawing aggression and the enjoyment of the fruits of aggression. Obviously, armed aggression as a means of settling disputes has not been eliminated from the international scene. Differences between States continue to result in armed conflict. But where else in the past 20 years has there been such a blatant and large-scale example of an aggressor holding on to the fruits of aggression as in the Middle East since the Israeli armed forces launched a surprise attack against Egypt in June 196^? The political situation in the Middle East today is the same as that which existed immediately after the Israeli aggression and conquest of 1956. Then, as now, Israel demanded firm guarantees as a condition for withdrawing its forces of invasion. And what was the consensus of international opinion at that time? It can be summed up in these words of the late General Eisenhower: \\\"If we agree that armed attack can properly achieve the purposes of the assailant then I fear we will have turned back the clock of international order\\\".\n196.\tIn proclaiming that they have acquired rights through conquest, Israel's leaders are indeed turning back the clock of international order. More immediately, Israel's attitude closes the door to peace in the Middle East. That door can be opened again at any time, since resolution 242 (1967) remains the consensus of the United Nations on the Middle East question and since its provisions remain acceptable to Egypt and Jordan. My Government will support any initiative aimed at bringing about a just and lasting pear e in the Middle East on the basis of resolution 242 (1967).\n197.\tThe question of disarmament is, of course, the most pressing of those problems of a universal scale which call for courageous and revolutionary thinking. Because we have grown used to the awesome knowledge that the push of a button can release nuclear energies capable of wiping out life on earth does not mean that the danger has lessened. And now it seems to have become equally commonplace that the social and economic problems of individual societies, and the problem of reducing the gap between the rich and the poor nations, have lesser priority than the arms race in both nuclear and conventional weapons.\n198.\tIt has been estimated that $215,000 million are spent each year by the nations of the world on armaments, while it has to be conceded that the first United Nations Development Decade was a failure and the prospects for the Second Development Decade are not particularly hopeful. However, some progress towards disarmament goals has been made and must be welcomed, even though it sometimes seems that the less immediately pressing questions are given priority over the more immediately dangerous ones.\n199.\tThe agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on a draft convention that would outlaw biological weapons is a meaningful achievement. At the same time, it was regrettable that it was not possible to gain the support needed for the inclusion in the treaty of a ban on chemical weapons. Bacteriological warfare is a horrible possibility, but it is not in current use. Chemical weapons, on the other hand, are being used against people in Africa and Asia.\n200.\tThe need for a complete ban on nuclear tests in all environments is one that seems particularly urgent to nonnuclear States. We should like to see our initiative on the renunciation of nuclear' weapons matched by some truly significant advance towards nuclear disarmament  such as an agreement on a complete test ban would be. There seems to be no obstacle now in the way of the achievement of such an agreement. As the Canadians have pointed out, the stumbling block of the question of on site inspections has been removed by the development of instruments which can detect underground blasts of any significance in distant countries.\n201.\tOne of the hopeful signs of a movement towards nuclear disarmament is the agreement by the United States and the Soviet Union to concentrate this year on curbing anti-ballistic missiles and to agree on certain measures to limit offensive weapons. Strategic weapons systems are inherently dangerous to world peace, since the development of missiles, antimissiles and counter antimissiles seems to be a frighteningly irreversible process. The curbing of strategic weapons systems is an issue which should have the highest priority. One hopes that the escalation of these systems will not continue while the big Powers jockey for the most advantageous position from which to agree on their limitation.\n202.\tIn the view of my Government, a great opportunity for truly significant progress towards disarmament is afforded by the initiative of the Soviet Union in calling for a world disarmament conference on both nuclear and conventional weapons. My Government will give its full support to the proposal that such a conference should be convened by the General Assembly. Disarmament, like other major questions of survival, must be approached with a global view, and can be resolved only by the agreement of the world community.\n203.\tHie United Nations has lived through several crises and dire predictions of failure but has survived to celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary. We might ask ourselves at this time: what important influence is likely to dominate the international scene now and in the near future? I believe that present day realities demand that the predominant feature of international affairs should be thinking and planning on a global scale.\n204.\tThe proliferation of weapons, the proliferation of people, and the proliferation of machines are probably the three basic considerations which are well on the way to determining the character of all other aspects of human society. Because these problems concern all peoples and are of a scale and complexity unprecedented in the history of civilization, it is essential that nations do, not allow themselves to drift into the future with the naive hope that everything will turn out right in the end.\n205.\tThe United Nations already views a large number of fields with a global perspective. The work of the specialized agencies boars reassuring witness to this fact, and in the sphere of development we speak of a global strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. If performance has not always matched the plan in some areas of United Nations global activity, at least the vision is there; the goals have been set and the work has begun.\n206.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held in 1972; the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction; the work of the Advisory Committee on the Application of Science and Technology to Development beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction; and the findings of the Committee on Natural Resources and of the Population Commission: all these deal with or will deal with problems of universal application and pressing urgency. The United Nations alone can provide the global perspective and the global organization to tackle these problems. Only the wisdom of governments can ensure that global action will be taken.\n207.\tThe most ardent supporter of a global concept of the problems we all face is, of course, the SecretaryGeneral. U Thant is about to leave the United Nations after having served as the world's chief steward for the past 10 years. He will leave behind an outstanding record of achievement in the field of international cooperation and understanding. His great humanism, his devotion to peace and justice, his deep concern for human dignity have endeared him to the hearts of the Somali people. Many of his words of wisdom and inspiration will be echoed in current and future debates of this Organization. I can think of no better way of paying tribute to him, and of ending this statement, than by quoting some of those words. In his address to the fifty-first session of the Economic and Social Council held in Geneva this year he wrote:\n\\\"I look forward to the day when students will read about the trying period of the 1960s and 1970s, when human existence and civilization stood in the balance, and when the vision and energy of men and women, acting as the bearers of great responsibilities, or just as the world's first servants, succeeded in making these two decades a period of peaceful transition.\\\" \nUThant's words hold a challenge to which every Member of the United Nations must respond if a new world order is to come into being.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "195.\t May I offer you, Sir, the warm congratulations of the Nigerian delegation on your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n196.\tYour personal qualities as a diplomat and statesman and your wisdom and long experience in the affairs of the United Nations will, I am sure, make your tenure of this high office as memorable as that of your predecessor, Edvard Flambro of Norway.\n197.\tAt the commemorative twenty-fifth session of the United Nations, last year, the General Assembly adopted four documents: a program of action for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 2621 (XXV)]; the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]; the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)]; and a reaffirmation of the dedication of States Members of the United Nations to the objectives and purposes of the Charter and to the anniversary Objectives of peace, justice and progress [resolution 2627 (XXV)].\n19S. The Government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria believe that the effectiveness or otherwise of the United Nations will be judged by the determination of the United Nations to meet the challenges and achieve the objectives so movingly set out in the Organization's own declarations.\n199.\tUnfortunately, even a cursory review of the world situation will show that the rate of progress, if any, in achieving the objectives set out in the General Assembly'; declarations at the 1970 commemorative session has been disappointing. You will permit me to refer to the situation in the southern parts of my own continent, Africa, to illustrate the continuing frustration of the ideals and goals to which we all are committed in this Organization and which must be implemented in the interest of the United Nations and the whole of mankind.\n200.\tWe have all witnessed the steady and deplorable deterioration in the situation in southern Africa during the last few years. In many parts of southern Africa repressive minority Governments continue to hold large populations of Africans in bondage and to inflict the most humiliating and brutal assault on them in defiance of world opinion and in contravention of the very fundamentals of the Charter of this Organization. It is a matter for serious regret that in spite of repeated exhortations, and in spite of the universal expressions of distress and disgust over the situation in southern Africa, the intransigence of the colonial or white minority Governments still continue unchecked and unabated.\n201.\tWe have before us the recent historic pronouncement, in the form of an advisory opinion, of the International Court of Justice regarding the situation in Namibia.  The world Court has categorically stated that South African presence in that Territory is illegal. That memorable pronouncement can only be given effect if this Organization rises to its duty and its obligations in order to implement, especially in such a clear and indisputable situation, some of the ideals and objectives which the General Assembly and other organs of the United Nations have repeatedly asserted in the past. The unambiguous and unequivocal declaration of the world Court is a challenge to this Organization. South Africa still remains in illegal and defiant occupation of a Territory to which it has no legitimate or legal claim. The major task of this twenty- sixth session of the General Assembly would, therefore, be to devise ways and means of re-establishing without further delay United Nations authority in the Territory.\n202.\tThe Zimbabwe people still languish under the oppression of a misguided group of adventurers who usurped the rights of the people and established a totally unrepresentative and illegal administration over the United Kingdom colony of Southern Rhodesia. Clearly, all f^'-minded and objective observers have come to the conclusion that the pious hopes that were assiduously pressed upon us some time ago that this illegal Government would be removed by the application of economic sanctions have not been realized. Meanwhile, brutality against the rightful owners of the land and the usurpation of their freedom continue unabated. Leading nationalists and leaders of the people of Zimbabwe are still being held without just cause in cruel imprisonment and under the most inhuman and degrading circumstances. Many have been killed in the defense of their elementary human right to exist; others have died in prison.\n203.\tWe have before us a strange spectacle. For the first time in British colonial history, an unmitigated act of open rebellion and high treason against the Crown has not been crushed or dislodged. There are now widespread fears in some quarters that the legitimate and responsible Government for that Territory-I refer to the United Kingdom Government-may have lost its will to assert its sovereign authority in Rhodesia and to undertake its sacred duty to prepare the people of Zimbabwe for orderly, rapid and urgent progress towards genuine independence. The whole world is watching that situation with anxiety, bearing in mind the repeated assurances that had been given to the world that any political solution in Rhodesia would be based on the principles of equal rights, responsibilities and duties for all its citizens, without discrimination as to color or creed.\n204.\tElsewhere in the continent of Africa, especially in the southern parts thereof colonial exploitation and undisguised oppression still continue. No progress has been made, since the declarations of the last session of the General Assembly, in the situation of the African Territories controlled by Portugal. On the contrary, the Security Council has had evidence, on the basis of a report by an impartial fact-finding committee, of a direct and outrageous armed incursion and invasion into the Territory and capital of an independent, sovereign African country. This flagrant act of open aggression against the United Nations Charter and the elementary principles of international law is compounded by reports of further designs on the part of Portugal to continue this policy of naked aggression and intimidation of African countries situated near its colonial Territories. The spirit of the oppressed peoples is not crushed, however, and the struggle for freedom goes on in the Territories under the colonial domination of Portugal. But there is, alas, no sign of the colonial authorities' initiating the legitimate and rational steps that would end confrontation and conflict and begin the preparation of those Territories for independence and fruitful cooperation.\n205.\tIn South Africa, the Government persists in pursuing, in the name of its national interest, the horrors and inhuman policies of apartheid which seriously offend the spirit and the Charter of this great Organization, and the conscience of the world. It is, of course, universally acknowledged that the South African Government is much assisted in its repressive policies by the support it receives from some prominent Member States of this Organization, and is thereby emboldened to continue in its inventions of additional methods of terror and oppression against the poor, defenseless black population. Not only the legitimate nationalist leaders, but even universally respected prelates of the Church, now fall victim to the capricious reign of terror unleashed upon the population of that unhappy country. The threats of the South African Government to the security and independence of sovereign African States continue with impunity. This Organization and the whole world look on in horror while those great Powers which have the influence and the means to check this steady deterioration in that part of the world stand idly by, wringing their hands in pretended agony.\n206.\tIn the light of the well-documented record of cruel oppression and blatant racial discrimination against the black population in South Africa, many people have rightly viewed with skepticism the recently reported desire of the authorities in South Africa to engage in a dialog with other countries and Governments on the African continent. This skepticism arises from the basic fact that it is illogical, even ludicrous, for the South African Government to refuse to meet and accept the black citizens of its own country on terms of equality, while pretending to want contacts with leaders of independent African States. Unless the whole effort is a ruse to deflect African and world attention from the cruel inhumanities which characterize the rule of the present Government in South Africa, it is difficult to understand why such dialogs should not begin at home, within South Africa itself.\n207.\tI make no apologies for speaking so long on the situation in Africa, because it is one part of the world where the glaring examples of historical inequities and racial injustice remain unresolved and are pursued with impunity by those who perpetrate them. It is our conviction that the solution of those problems, and indeed the urgency and dispatch with which they are resolved, will seriously affect the faith of mankind, especially in the developing world, in the validity of the claim\\\" and assumptions on which the ideals of the United Nations are based,\n208.\tMy delegation deeply regrets the lack of substantial improvement in the Middle East situation over the last year, The fragile peace, or rather the fragile state of near-conflict, which subsists in that area of the world is a source of continued concern to all peace-loving people. The Organization of African Unity has, as you may be aware, felt so strongly on this subject that the Heads of State and Government of Africa set up a committee of 10 heads of African States for the purpose of doing what we in Africa can do to assist in the process of finding a solution to the situation in the Middle East. Nigeria, as a member of that committee, will co-operate fully in every effort to reach an equitable and honorable solution that will take into account all the main elements of that confused and tangled situation. For us in Nigeria, Security Council resolution 242 (1967) still remains the best hope, and still contains the most acceptable principles, for a genuine solution to the Middle East situation.\n209.\tLet me mention that the Committee established by the Organization of African Unity is not an alternative to the valiant and highly commendable efforts of Ambassador Gunnar Jarring in his mission as the Secretary-General's Special Representative to the Middle East. On the contrary, the functions of the new Committee of the Organization of African Unity will be complementary to the efforts of the United Nations. The African Committee is an impartial, yet deeply concerned, body which hopes that it can convey to the principal parties in the dispute a sense of the agony and concern of Africa as a whole over the increasingly dangerous situation in the Middle East.\n210.\tOne of the crucial issues before this Assembly is the question of the representation of the Chinese people in the United Nations. My delegation is gratified to note that, this year, even those who, for nearly 25 years past, have sought to Prevent the seating of the representatives of the People's Republic of China in this Organization have now found the movement of world opinion inevitable, and have themselves moved somewhat from their previous opposition to the People's Republic taking its rightful place in the councils of the world. It was evident from the record of voting on this issue last year [1913th meeting], that a substantial majority of Member States represented in this Organization had publicly acknowledged that it is an untenable proposition for a Government representing nearly a quarter of mankind to continue to be prevented from participating in the deliberations and activities of the United Nations. The Nigerian position on this issue has always been clear and simple, We have always indicated that the representatives of such a large, populous and important nation should legitimately take their place in the United Nations Organization. We have always said that there is a popular error in describing this issue as the question of the \\\"admission of China\\\". China has always been a Member of this Organization and is, in fact, a permanent member of the Security Council. The issue before the General Assembly is, therefore, a question of which of the administrations claiming rightful representation of China should legitimately occupy that seat. There is no doubt in our mind that, in the circumstances, the People's Republic of China should take its rightful place in this Organization, My delegation will express itself more fully on this subject when this particular issue comes to be discussed in this Assembly.\n211.\tOwing to the deep points of difference between the great Powers, without whose agreement no progress would be possible in this particular case, the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations has witnessed an impasse since 1969. Differences over the establishment of observer missions, their direction and control and the relevant, legal and financial arrangements have not been resolved. Over the past two years it has not been possible to reach agreement on the respective roles of the Security Council and the General Assembly on the important question of authorization of missions and, therefore, no work could be done on the definition and task of peace-keeping operations involving military contingents. The present state of affairs is clearly frustrating. We believe in the usefulness of the United Nations peace-keeping role in appropriate circumstances and we hope that renewed efforts will be made during the current session to break the impasse.\n212.\tMy delegation places a high priority on the urgent need for progress in the area of disarmament, especially in the face of the constantly growing and multiplying stocks of armaments, including nuclear weapons of unspeakable horror, developed and stockpiled by some advanced countries. The situation, already urgent and pressing, is Complicated by the fact that a number of other countries may well be on the way to developing their own nuclear capabilities. It is true that a few useful but highly limited achievements have been recorded in the general question of disarmament; but my delegation must register its disappointment at the lack of more substantial progress in this matter.\n213.\tWhile Nigeria takes solace from the reported measure of progress in the Strategic Arms limitation Talks between the Governments of the United States and of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, we cannot but express our disappointment at the minimal results of the negotiations on disarmament being conducted in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. It is tragic that, after all these years, no agreement has yet been reached on a comprehensive test ban. In fact, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has hardly torched the issue this year. Also, although the agreement on a draft convention on the prohibition of the development) production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction [AI8457-DC/234, annex A] is a definite step towards the fulfillment of mankind's yearning to be rid of the danger and the burden of frightening armaments, my delegation feels, nevertheless, that a greater willingness, and a clear demonstration of it, by the great Powers to co-operate in the urgent search for wider and more effective disarmament arrangements, is very much needed. Nigeria, as a member of the conference, has always held the view that both chemical and biological weapons form a whole, and prohibition of both types of destructive weapons should equally engage the serious attention of all. The General Assembly endorsed this view last year [resolution 2662 (XXV)]. It is, therefore, disappointing that the agreement so far concluded was limited to biological weapons. We are, of course, aware that negotiations for an agreement to ban chemical weapons will, it is promised, be continued in the days ahead. However, we recall that a similar commitment was made in respect of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] with regard to a ban on underground tests; but we all know that that commitment which was said to be made \\\"in good faith\\\" has not yet been implemented by those concerned. My delegation will have more to say on this in the appropriate Committee.\n214.\tThe present decade has been designated as the Second United Nations Development Decade. It is a simple statement of fact that the First United Nations Development Decade did not satisfy the expectations of many Member States. As we now enter the second year of the Second Development Decade, my delegation hopes that a change of attitude and concept will be manifested, especially on the part of the advanced countries, if the objectives of the Development Decade are to be fulfilled. The reluctance of some advanced countries to contribute to the development of the less advanced areas of the world should be overcome. Although we in Nigeria do not believe that true economic independence can be built on charity, we nevertheless recognize the continued need for a flow of technical expertise and equipment, and in some cases of capital, from the industrialized countries to the less advantageously placed areas of the world, to enable the latter to prepare their economies towards a desirable level of development.\n215.\tIn this connexion I wish to draw attention to the co-operative efforts of African countries to establish a road link between Mombasa on the east coast of Africa and Lagos on the west, a project which we believe deserves the support of the international community.\n216.\tMy delegation looks forward to the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We also welcome the proposed meeting in Lima of the Group of 77. We hope that these conferences will evolve a global trade strategy which can revitalize international commerce and promote mutual benefit for the advanced and the developing countries alike.\n217.\tOne cannot conclude even this brief review of the world situation without reference to the recent events in the economic and monetary arrangements of the world which have seriously affected the orderly development of legitimate transactions between the Member States of this Organization. These events have also affected the economic basis of the development of many less advanced countries.\n218.\tRecent economic and financial measures adopted by some powerful countries have inevitably disorganized we \nhope only for a brief period international trade and payments arrangements that have been in force for nearly three decades. We acknowledge that the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944 and the policies and practices set out in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have not always been perfect. On the other hand, it must be acknowledged that world trade and international commerce have experienced a 'considerable degree of satisfactorily progressive expansion during the past 25 years, Today the financial measures taken by a few advanced and powerful countries with highly developed economics have caused uncertainties which will have a serious effect on the development processes of the countries whose economies are not so advanced. No one can deny a Member State of this Organization its right to take such action as it considers necessary in its own national interest. We mast, however, express the anxiety that such measures taken in the national interest should always embrace and take into account the need for promoting a continued, orderly, international economic arrangement, without which the whole process of international development would be jeopardized.\n219.\tEvidently, it is now essential for those whose policies have had the effect of disorganizing the existing arrangements to take the initiative of instituting and ensuring the necessary wide-ranging consultations, either in the existing international monetary and financial bodies or by other means, with a view to establishing new and more generally agreed, even if not universally acclaimed, arrangements for the regularizing of international monetary affairs and the free exchange of goods and services between nations. It is our sincere hope that any such measures or any such consultations would fully involve the developing countries, which constitute an important element in world trade and whose fortunes and future development depend on a stable international order. Indeed, any solution of world economic and political problems must involve the developing countries, especially in the preparation or examination of the means designed to achieve such solutions.\n220.\tNigeria shares the concern of the international community about the misuse of the environment in both developed and developing countries. We acknowledge the importance of United Nations responsibility in this field and we pledge our full support for, and active participation in, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment which is scheduled to take place at Stockholm in 1972. Similarly, my Government and my delegation have followed with close interest the work of the sea-bed Committee  because we believe that the uses of the high seas and the exploitation of the sea-bed through the development of modern technology are vital issues for the future of the world's resources. My delegation will express its opinion more fully on this issue in the relevant Committee.\n221.\tThe tasks that face our Organization have not always been easy nor have the procedures, which have been followed been as economical as might be desired. My delegation therefore welcomes the efforts which are being made rationalize the procedures and organization of the General Assembly. The aim, in our view, should be to save time and to reduce the volume of documentation without impairing the efficiency of the functioning of the General Assembly and other United Nations organs. To this end, my delegation expects that the recommendations of the Special Committee on the Rationalization of the Procedures and Organization of the General Assembly will be sympathetically considered and adopted by the General Assembly [see A/8426}.\n222.\tLastly, on behalf of the Government and people of Nigeria, I wish to pay tribute to our beloved Secretary-General, U Thant, for his sterling- qualities and outstanding statesmanship and for his invaluable services to this Organization and to the whole of mankind. I salute him for his devotion and dedication to the ideals of the United Nations. Reports of .'lie decision of this dedicated servant of peace and distinguished statesman not to offer himself for continued service in his present post have been received with deep regret in my country. We firmly believe that not only this era, but also the future history of this Organization and of mankind will fully acknowledge the great services which he has performed and the imprint of calm and wisdom he left upon this Organization and the community of mankind."

        "file_text": "127.\t I am happy, Mr. President, to address to you the congratulations of the delegation of Senegal on the occasion of your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In entrusting to you the heavy task of leading its work, our Assembly I am deeply convinced-wanted to pay a tribute first to your country, Indonesia, to the lucidity of its people and its realism, your country which, as you said, Mr. President, keeps the privilege of being faithful to dignity in diversity. But your election is also a tribute to your personal activities, to your qualities ^n open-minded man and a wise negotiator, to your role as head of the Indonesia delegation which you have been leading at the United Nations since 1967.\n128.\tMay I, Mr. President, on this occasion address the congratulations of the delegation of Senegal to Mr. Edvard Hambro, whose experience, knowledge of the law and of men greatly contributed to the success of the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations.\n129.\tThe Government and people of Senegal, at the same time, welcome the admission to the United Nations of the States of Bhutan, Qatar and Bahrain, whose presence among us is well in keeping with the universalist character which must remain one of the essential characteristics of our Organization.\n130.\tThe activities of the twenty-sixth session, which is now beginning, will possibly mark a turning-point in the life of the United Nations. We shall have been the attentive witnesses of an evolution in Asia, which can remain one of the most important events of the last 10 years. The United States of America and the People's Republic of China have given an example of that evolution: they have started moving towards a rapprochement of peoples in conformity with the ideal of our Charter.\n131.\tIt appears more clearly today to the international community that the admission of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations could not be delayed much longer. We must admit that in the final analysis it would strengthen the character of universality of this Organization, whose purpose, is to gather together all the nations of the world, large and small, and who knows if we may not after all be led to seek in this universality, if not their immediate reunification, at least an answer to the question raised by all the divided countries?\n132.\tAre we not entitled to believe that the thaw in relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China brings with it renewed hope for the restoration of peace in the Far East for the sufficient reason that neither peace : ^ solidarity can be divided?\n133.\tHow can we imagine that the peoples of Asia, who have remained true to themselves through upheavals and isolation, do not feel the need to remain united after the storm has blown over? We must recognize that it is more propitious for the cause of peace, as for that of peace of mind, for each people to be master of its destiny inside its borders. That is the ardent wish of the delegation of Senegal for the peoples of Asia, so unjustly immersed in fratricidal war, especially for the people of Viet-Nam whose martyrdom for over 25 years is well known. It is certainly also the will of all the young States, impatient at the same time to discover the secret which would enable them to be realistic towards events while remaining true to principles. These young nations know that their salvation that is to say, their survival, their progress, their development and their prosperity is predicated upon international peace and security. For these young nations, our Organization is in duty bound to redouble its efforts to ban from relations among States any resort to violence or war in whatever form.\n134.\tThat is why they have been happy to welcome the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, signed at Berlin on 3 September 1971, which they interpret as a new contribution to the easing of tension and as the prelude to an understanding which is more than ever necessary for the strengthening of peace.\n135.\tBut our Organization must also, we believe, carry out the mission which it undertook to discharge with the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples /resolution 1514 (XV)]. Our Organization must achieve in fact the implementation of the right to self-determination of all the peoples which are still enslaved. It must obtain respect for the obligation of the administering Powers to restore sovereignty to the peoples placed by history under their domination in the past,\n136.\tThe triumph of such principles in Africa and elsewhere is the same as that of the principles upon which the international community must build its cohesion. It is in the name of that policy that great countries have led to national independence, in accordance with their own procedures, peoples which their flags had covered for a long time. And yet it is precisely that which Portugal and South Africa refUse to the populations of Namibia, Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).\n137.\tH,E. President Moktar Ould Daddah, current President of the Organization of African Unity, hardly a week ago opened the debate on the case of Namibia in the Security Council at its 1583rd meeting. But did not the\nGeneral Assembly itself as long ago as 1966 put an end to the Mandate of South Africa over Namibia in resolution 2145 (XXI)? It did so because South Africa had \\\"failed to fulfill its obligations in respect of' its Mandate and \\\"to ensure the moral and material well-being and security of the inhabitants of' the Territory. That is why the Security Council, as long ago as 1969, invited the Government of South Africa to withdraw from Namibia in its resolution 264 (1969).\n138.\tToday it is the International Court of Justice that has taken a decision. It formally states\n\\\"that, the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia being illegal., South Africa is under obligation to withdraw its administration from Namibia immediately and thus put an end to its occupation of the Territory\\\". \n139.\tIt is up to the United Nations to use the excellent formula of the Head of State of Mauritania-to study the ways and means to take up the challenge which South Africa is hurling at the international community.\n140.\tI shall abstain from raising the case of Rhodesia because it is in everybody's mind and because it is well known that it involves very clear responsibilities and causes great concern to those who place their trust in the United Nations.\n141.\tThe international community continues to be con-fronted with the practice of racial discrimination and of apartheid by the Salisbury authorities and even more by the Pretoria regime.\n142.\tThe Organization of African Unity, for which freedom and justice, equality and fraternity are objectives in keeping with the aspirations of all peoples, proposed a solution in a document, which one should never tire of recalling. I am speaking of the Manifesto on Southern Africa,  to which, I am deeply convinced, we will have to come back one day in order to found on harmony the coexistence of human communities living in the Union of South Africa. The Manifesto declares that when the objective and the foundation of the foreign policy of States are misunderstood there is a certain lack of harmony among ;; i nations.\n143.\tThe Manifesto states that the necessary harmony between peoples and men implies respect for the human person and human dignity, and respect for the equality of their rights. It considers that all men are entitled and are in duty bound to take part in the organization of their own society and, therefore, in the government of their country. But what has to be particularly stressed is that the manifesto recognizes that provisional measures may be necessary in order to carry out without any disruption the mutations which would make it possible to pass from the inequality of groups to the equality of persons.\n144.\tWhat the Manifesto and all other States basically expect of the Union of South Africa is the acceptance of the principle of the equality of men and of respect for human beings and not an absolute and immediate perfection of institutions.\n145.\tThe Manifesto considers that all those who have established their homes in the- countries of southern Africa are Africans without any distinction as to race. The Manifesto is not hostile to the South African administration because it is controlled by white men; it is hostile to that administration because it is in the hands of a minority and because its system is founded on the alleged inequality of men based exclusively on racial origin.\n146.\tThose are the ideas on the basis of which the African States think that it is possible to build up in South Africa a coherent multiracial community which would be reconciled with itself. I hope that the representatives of South Africa soon will come to be as astonished as we are that the Manifesto on Southern Africa has not been better understood.\n147.\t'\tI also hope, without the slightest passion, that the Government of Lisbon will become convinced that there can be no lasting peace if injustice prevails and that there can be no true fraternity with domination. Let the Government of Lisbon become convinced of that and thus rethink its relations with the peoples forced to fight, with weapons in their hands, against its presence on their lands.\n148.\tBut the United Nations must not only oppose the Portuguese presence in Africa, condemned by everything  history, events and developments-because the Organization is the every-day witness of attacks launched by Portugal against African States every time the territories bordering on those countries prefer armed struggle to Portuguese occupation.\n149.\tThus the Democratic Republic of the Congo was to complain to the Security Council about two violations of its Territory by Portuguese troops, in 1966 and 1967. Zambia, for the same reasons, had to seize the Security Council of its complaint, in 1969. And there is no need, I think, to recall the recent aggression against the Republic of Guinea by the Portuguese forces.\n150.\tThe Government of Senegal, because its villages had been victims of Portuguese attacks, had to call on the Security Council as early as 1963. The Security Council was to reconvene three times more in 1965, 1969 and in July of this year-because of the gravity of the acts of violence committed by Portuguese forces on Senegalese territory.\n151.\tThere has been no year, since 1963, that the Government of Senegal was not compelled to seize the Security Council and world public opinion of Portuguese violations of the borders and air space of Senegal; of bombings and arson in its villages; and of premeditated murders and kidnappings carried out on its territory by Portuguese troops.\n152.\tHowever, despite all those infringements of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Senegal, President Leopold Sedar Senghor did not hesitate to propose publicly a peace plan to Portugal in order to put an end to a situation which is destroying Guinea (Bissau) and whose appalling burden Senegal has had to bear for over 10 years.\n153.\tThose proposals are as follows: a cease-fire; then negotiations on internal autonomy, the modalities, limits and duration of which would be discussed between representatives of the Portuguese Government, on the one hand, and representatives of political movements in Guinea (Bissau), on the other hand, granting them independence as the last stage.\n154.\tThose proposals were confirmed to the Secretary- General; they received the agreement of the liberation movements. I offer them today for meditation to the Members of our Organization, because the true problem is to recognize to the people of Guinea (Bissau) its own identity.\n155.\tThe problem will always be to treat the nationals of Guinea (Bissau) like all other men, as our Charter prescribes: in other words, the problem consists in turning away from colonial dependence, and in establishing relations to create links of sounder co-operation among free partners partners free to choose their own destinies.\n156.\tThe Security Council recently decided to dispatch a commission of inquiry to Senegal. That Special Mission of the Security Council has just presented its report.  My Government thinks, like the members of the Commission, that there is no other solution, to restore peace in Guinea (Bissau), than to make its people master of its present and its future.\n157.\tThe celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations was the occasion for our Organization to reaffirm, in solemn Declarations, certain principles of the Charter. This goes for the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] and, especially, the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. President Hambro said of the latter that it was one of the most important and constructive documents ever adopted by an international organization or a diplomatic conference.\n158.\tAt its twenty-fifth session, the General Assembly, among other positive merits, stressed the interest of safeguarding the sovereignty of developing countries over their natural resources, which, for some, are their fishing resources. It becomes obvious that such countries are directly concerned with questions involving the conservation of its marine resources, the definition of the limits of the continental shelf, the territorial sea and adjacent zones. One cannot forget this if one wishes to promote a legislation on the law of the sea which is adapted to present-day realities.\n159.\tThe Assembly, at the same time, thought it necessary to advocate liberalization in international trade; but the elimination of some tariff barriers proposed to developing countries, through the setting up of a system of generalized preferences, was rendered null and void in advance by the on-coming monetary crisis and the present restrictions on trade.\n160.\tThat confirmed the risks entailed for developing countries in a generalized preference system before the establishment of mechanisms offering guarantees for the marketing of their produce, for the prices of their commodities, and other compensations.\n161.\tThe International Strategy for Development cannot attain its objectives merely by defining relations between industrialized and developing countries. If we wish to attain those objectives, there must be a full awareness of the solidarity among all and of the determined will to create in their economies conditions favorable to their respective growth.\n162.\tThe developing countries, by the force of things, are more vulnerable than others to protectionist measures around a large market such as that of the United States of America. That makes it easier to understand why many African countries have always expressed preference for a regional marketing organization along the lines of their association with the European Economic Community. Experience shows that it will be difficult to avoid these aspects of the problem at the next United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n163.\tIt is up to the Assembly at its twenty-sixth session to take both new and constructive decisions in the economic and social fields. Machinery must be defined that will make it possible to assess the progress achieved in attaining the objectives of the International Development Strategy.\n164.\tBut actually we must redefine, together with the Director-General of the ILO, Mr. Wilfred Jenks, an economic policy in which investments and rural development, industrialization, infrastructures and trade will be dealt with as inseparable components of a strategy for economic growth and social progress, as well as for the mutual development States.\n165.\tWe must consider the matter of trade between the rich countries and the developing countries as an equal exchange of services among the members of one single community to grant more advantageous and more stable prices to the primary commodities of the countries of the third world.\n166.\tWe can never insist on that enough:\n\\\"The setting up of prices on the world market is based not only on intrinsic realities, but also on the free will of men. What the nations of the third world expect from the rich countries is that they consider the foundations of international trade not in terms of relations of strength, but as relations of co-operation and solidarity necessary between the rich countries and those of the third world. They must be considered by them as relations founded on the peace of the heart and on the solidarity among men.\\\"\n167.\tYou have seen that I have spoken an at length about President Senghor and his statement to the International Labor Conference at its fifty-sixth session held in Geneva in June last.\n168.\tYou will also have noticed, maybe with wonderment, my silence on the problem of the Middle East. This only shows the deep desire of my country, Senegal, and of States entrusted with a well-known mission better to contribute to the advent in this part of the world of \\\"relations based on the peace of the heart\\\".\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "98.\t  Mr. President, allow me to offer you our warmest congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a tribute to you personally, and is a reflection of the esteem in which your country is held. We especially welcome it not only because of the close and friendly ties which bind our two countries, but also because of the high regard we have for you, which was clearly demonstrated during your recent visit to Iran.\n99.\tMay I also take this opportunity to express our appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro, who presided over the last session with great ability and wisdom. His untiring efforts to promote the objectives of the United Nations were manifested not only within this Organization, but also through his extensive travels to Member countries, including my own.\n100.\tAllow me, furthermore, to express once again to the Secretary-General our admiration and high esteem for his outstanding performance throughout his term of office, and for his devotion to the cause of world peace. I should also like to pay a tribute to him for the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8401/Add.l], which we have read with great interest and attention. In this report the Secretary-General has treated with candor and forthrightness the many basic problems besetting the world Organization. It is our earnest hope that his thoughtful and most valuable remarks will be heeded by the membership. The Secretary-General's decision not to make himself available for another term was, therefore, received by my delegation with deep regret.\n101.\tThis year we are celebrating the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire by Cyrus the Great. We are commemorating a great humanitarian figure who, 25 centuries ago, was the first to introduce the values of humanity and justice into the social and political order of an Empire. Throughout succeeding ages, when genocide, religious persecution and cultural eradication have, shamefully, remained recognized traits of empire building, Cyrus' enlightened legacy of religious tolerance and cultural coexistence has remained one of history's brightest achievements. While ere are other important milestones in mankind's long search for a charter of human rights, the first step on this road was taken and formalized in the Edict of Cyrus in the fifth century B.C. The respect he showed for cultural and ethnic diversity, and the moral and humanitarian values he espoused, have remained, throughout the millennial, a vital part of Iran's cultural life and have influenced our thought from generation to generation,\n102.\tWe, in Iran, have rededicated ourselves to the ideals for which our founding father lived and fought: human\nrights, tolerance and justice, peace, freedom and progress for all peoples and all nations, regardless of size, wealth, race and creed. Our \\\"white revolution\\\" under His Imperial Majesty the Shahansha Aryamehr, has embraced these values and breathed new life and meaning into them. Similarly, our independent national policy underlines the importance we attach to coexistence, non-discrimination and friendly co-operation in a world of diverse and independent units.\n103.\tIn contrast to the rather bleak picture of the world scene during recent years, we are meeting here this year in an atmosphere of rising hopes. Important developments since our last session point to the attainment of a real detente. In Europe, the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin is of particular significance. I am sure it will have far-reaching effects in strengthening European security. Also, preparations for a meeting between the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and of the Warsaw Pact, for the purpose of troop reduction in Europe, are already under way.\n104.\tIn Asia, while Viet-Nam continues to suffer the scourge of war, for the first time the end seems to be in sight. And for the first time the prospects are bright for the participation of the People's Republic of China in world affairs; The importance which such participation will have for world peace, especially for peace and security in Asia, can hardly be over-emphasized. We welcome the decision made by the President of the United States to visit China. We are confident that contacts and talks between the leaders of these two countries will have a salutary effect on international peace and security.\n105.\tIn the field of arms control, the most important advance is the signing, early this year, by more than 60 States, of the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor [resolution 2660 (XXV), annex]. The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks also provide a ground for optimism.\n106.\tDespite the easing of tensions and the improvements in the world situations which I have just outlined, armed conflicts as well as explosive situations continue to threaten world peace and security. In the face of these conflicts and crises, the United Nations is still unable to carry out its fundamental duties. With the participation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, we are confident that one of the main obstacles to the United Nations playing a more effective role will be removed. A world Organization that seeks to resolve man's basic problems cannot exclude the world's most populous State.\n107.\tThe growing concern on the part of a number of States, including my own, in establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China is a hopeful sign of the world community's determination to achieve universality.\n*\n108.\tOur views on the question of China are based on the following three conclusions: first, we recognize the People's Republic of China as the sole Government of China; secondly, the People's Republic of China should take its rightful place at the United Nations; thirdly, the People's \nRepublic of China should take its rightful place among the five permanent members of the Security Council.\n109.\tThe situation in the Middle East continues to cause us profound concern and sorrow. Israel continues to occupy Arab territories seized in the 1967 war, and many Arabs continue to be exiled from their homeland.\n110.\tIt may be recalled that, in response to Ambassador Jarring's proposals for a peace settlement between Israel and the Arab Republic of Egypt, President Anwar El-Sadat declared his country's willingness to sign a peace agreement with Israel provided that Israeli armed forces are withdrawn from occupied Arab territories. The President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, in a subsequent move, went even a step further and offered to reopen the Suez Canal as the first step towards a settlement. These overtures, that were received with general international acclaim, met with Israel's negative response. As can be seen, the President of the, Arab Republic of Egypt took a more prudent and realistic approach based on legitimate Arab rights as well as on Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n111.\tAccordingly, Iran declared its full support for the proposals of the Arab Republic of Egypt in an official statement which was subsequently circulated as a Security Council document, as well as in a number of communications to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of other countries. In reaffirming Iran's belief that Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories was an essential condition for peace, we stated:\n\u201cNow that as a result of the positive attitude of the Government of the United Arab Republic, favorable conditions for restoration of peace in the Middle East have been realized, the Government of Iran hopes that Israel will reciprocate by taking positive steps in the direction of peace and regional tranquility so that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General may succeed in his efforts to enable the parties concerned to reach a just and honorable agreement.\n112.\t' Support for the position of the Arab Republic of Egypt has grown in almost every quarter. One of the most notable expressions of support has come from the six member countries of the European Economic Community.\n113.\tDespite the general expectation for a reciprocal move towards peace and stability, Israel has remained adamant. In our view Israel's negative attitude is not an enlightened policy, and the Government of Iran believes that Ambassador Jarring's recent proposals conform with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and provide a good basis for the establishment of an honorable and lasting peace.\n114.\tI must also express our deep concern about the recent developments designed to change the status of Jerusalem. Such efforts will meet with strong opposition from the overwhelming, majority of members of the General Assembly and members of the Security Council. It is our view that the General Assembly and Security Council decisions on the status of Jerusalem must be implemented.\n115.\tSouth-East Asia is another area of the world tom by death and destruction, and the early promise of the peace talks in Paris has failed to materialize. Our position on this issue needs no repetition. We share the sorrow and the anguish, of those who have suffered in this conflict and we look forward to a day when these unhappy people, freed from destructive and divisive forces, can devote their extraordinary strength and energies to the more formidable but appealing task of reconstruction.\n116.\tGeneral and complete disarmament, agreed upon in principle by the super-Powers a decade ago, remains an unrealized goal. Marginal agreements in regional or functional areas cannot supplant this ultimate goal.\n117.\tWith the easing of tensions and the development of the capacity for mass destruction, the two super-Powers appear increasingly willing to find and develop areas of agreement. Significant progress seems to have been made on reaching agreement on the banning of biological weapons. We hope that efforts to reach an agreement on prohibition of production, development and use of chemical weapons will also soon bear fruit.\n118.\tProgress in techniques of detecting and identifying underground nuclear explosions may have opened the way for serious negotiations on a comprehensive test ban. In the light of the close tie between the nuclear test ban and the subject-matter of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks-that is, the freeze and eventual cut-back of strategic nuclear weapons systems-a new accord on the latter will undoubtedly remove the basic impediment to a comprehensive ban on further testing.\n119.\tOne prerequisite for attaining the goal of nuclear disarmament is the participation of all important nuclear Powers, including the People's Republic of China and France, Thus we welcome the suggestion made on 5 May 1971 by the Secretary-General in an address to the Council on Foreign Relations in Chicago concerning discussions among nuclear-weapon States, as well as the proposal made recently by the Soviet Union regarding a world conference on disarmament [A/8491].\n120.\tI should like to conclude my remarks on disarmament by proposing once again that the Middle East should be declared a nuclear-free zone. This suggestion was first made by my august Sovereign. Iran would welcome any initiative by any of the- countries in the region to reach an agreement to this end.\n121.\tRecent developments in the relations between India and Pakistan are a source of grave concern to us. The separatist movement in East Pakistan and the subsequent flight of refugees to India have strained to a critical point the already tense relations between the two countries.\n122.\tWe support every effort made by the international community under the banner of the United Nations to deal with the humanitarian aspects of the problem on both sides of the border. We ourselves have already made our contributions for the refugees in India as well as for relief work in East Pakistan.\n123.\tAs to the political aspects of the situation, without wishing in any way to interfere in the internal affairs of\nPakistan, we are confident that the Pakistani Government, as has been announced by the President of Pakistan himself, will do its utmost to eliminate through pacific means the causes of friction and strife which have brought about pain and unhappiness among brothers in East Pakistan. In this highly sensitive area, where the danger of a broader confrontation exists, every effort should be made to normalize the relations between those two great countries, India and Pakistan.\n124.\tWith the impending departure of the United Kingdom from the Persian Gulf by the end of this year, that region is about to enter a new era. Colonial rule will be replaced by a community of free nations striving for the welfare and prosperity of the peoples involved. Bahrain and Qatar, closely linked to us by bonds of friendship and fraternity, have already taken their places among the Members of the United Nations. We have already had the occasion to welcome them into the community of nations and we wish to offer them once again our full co-operation within this Organization. Soon Oman will also join the Organization. We believe that the remnants of colonialism in that region, as in all other parts of the world, must be completely wiped out and that the destiny of the peoples of the area should be placed in their own hands. We attach great importance to the security of the Persian Gulf area, which we consider to be exclusively a matter for the littoral States. Therefore, we shall not shirk our responsibility in the defense of peace and stability in the Persian Gulf. We have already taken important steps in collaboration with our neighbors to the south to promote peace and prosperity in the area.\n125.\tThe United Nations has made valuable contributions in the field of decolonization. The fundamental right of self-determination has become a reality for most of the peoples formerly under colonial rule. Yet, more than a decade after the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, there are still millions of people living under colonialism.\n126.\t The advisory opinion delivered recently by the International Court of Justice on the question of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia has determined the issue of legality and provides an element for further consideration by the Security Council.\n127.\tLast year /1857th meeting] we pointed out that the first United Nations Development Decade, taken as a whole, had been a failure. Today we are particularly concerned with an emerging protectionist trend in certain developed countries, a trend which threatens to undo even the little progress achieved in the past few years. Such protectionist attitudes will undermine the very goals for which so many countries have labored. We, in developing countries, have worked hard to increase production and output by training manpower and providing capital. Just as our new products begin to find new markets, we are confronted by protectionist tariffs; This trend must be stopped and reversed, for its implications are ominous. We\n \nurge the developed countries to make a new commitment to development: to liberalize trade and to remove prohibitive tariffs, in particular, on goods from developing countries.\n128.\tAn important forum in which this new commitment might be undertaken is the forthcoming third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] scheduled to meet in the spring of next year in Santiago, Chile.\n129.\tIf we fail, however, to ensure the collaboration of the developed countries for the realization of our objectives within the framework of 'UNCTAD, we must then turn to other methods of persuasion. The results obtained from the recent Tehran negotiations on oil within the framework of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has an important bearing in this context. It demonstrates, once again, the importance of collective bargaining.\n130.\tSpeaking on that occasion, my Sovereign pointed out that while the prices of export products of five leading industrial countries of the world increased by 3 per cent during the past three years-according to the United Nations statistics-the royalties obtained from every barrel of oil, in real terms, decreased. Thus the first Development Decade proved to be an empty gesture as far as the developing countries and the oil-producing countries were concerned.\n131.\tMotivated by common objectives and interests, the oil-producing countries of the Middle East proved the effectiveness of a united stand in collective bargaining. I have no doubt that what was done with regard to oil could be done also in the case of other raw materials. I hope, however, that the developed countries would rather show greater flexibility, understanding and co-operation within UNCTAD, rather than confront a united stand on the part of the developing countries.\n132.\tFor the first time in history, the question of human survival has been broadened to encompass not only the threats of war and weapons but also the total human environment. The challenge and task confronting mankind today has grown in scope to include every aspect of man's life and his environment. We must learn to manage the earth's resources in a way that will permit economic and social progress.\n133.\tIn Iran, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the Society for the Preservation of Natural Resources and the Human Environment and other related organizations have been charged with the task of developing, within the framework of our next five-year plan, a comprehensive program to meet the problem in all its aspects.\n134.\tWe are all conscious of the increasing significance attached to the sea and to ocean space exploitation and control. The declaration of principles adopted by the last session of the General Assembly,  in fact, set forth a new legal foundation for future dealings with the issue of the \nsea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof. It is highly important for all of us to make determined efforts to define the regime of the seas and to create an effective international machinery that would protect this \\\"common heritage of mankind\\\".\n135.\tThe picture I have just outlined is not altogether bright; but is still promising and hopeful.\nThe United Nations has not always been successful in dealing with some of our problems-especially armed conflicts-but the value of the United Nations as a center for all nations to join forces to cope with man's global problems is beginning to grow. I fully agree with our Secretary-General that the time has come when, in the Wake of the present detente, a new great alliance of all concerned peoples should be reinstated against these common enemies: human poverty, injustice, moral and physical misery and the rapid deterioration of our planet's beauty and life-sustaining elements. These dangers and challenges have greater priority than the questions which divide nations at present.\n"

        "file_text": "31.\t Mr. President, may I congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations for this session and express my Government's pleasure in the confidence entrusted to you. I wish also to refer with pleasure to the historical and friendly relations that bind the peoples of Indonesia and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. We are quite confident in your ability to guide and conduct the work of the General Assembly because of the experience and wisdom which you are known to possess.\n32.\tWe should like also to thank your predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro, who skilfully directed the affairs of the General Assembly during its twenty-fifth session.\n33.\tThe heavy burdens assumed by Secretary-General U Thant and his efforts to preserve world peace and to strengthen the principles of co-operation among the peoples of the world deserve the gratitude of all of us. Today, after his service of 10 years in that position, we present him with our thanks, in the hope that he will continue to pursue this task which enjoys the support of our country and that of all peace-loving nations.\n34.\tThe needs which made essential the creation of this Organization 26 years ago have increased, the more so since the United Nations must justify the need for its existence through the role which it must play in order to preserve world peace, to assist all nations in their struggle for freedom and their right to live in peace and security, and to eliminate the dangers of war caused by imperialist policies aiming at the domination of other nations and the control of their destinies.\n35.\tThe People's Democratic Republic of Yemen won its independence by making sacrifices over many decades. This resulted in victory for the armed revolution against British imperialism under the leadership of the National Liberation Front with the participation of all our people. The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen could never have become independent and free from any imperialist interest had the people not resorted to arms, had they not made sacrifices, and had they not strengthened their will in spite of British plots and endless conspiracies to smother the revolution and to isolate it from the rest of the world.\n36.\tThe sacrifices made by our people constitute a reaffirmation of the esteem and reverence which we hold for our freedom and independence. The people are prepared to sacrifice their lives and property, still more to defend their revolution and independence against every conspiracy of the imperialists and their reactionary agents in the area.\n37.\tWhen the cause of our freedom was being discussed in the United Nations, the United Kingdom resorted to a deliberate distortion of our people's will by bringing forth its puppet sultans to speak in this Organization about the fake freedom which they claimed our people enjoyed. We recall these incidents in order to refresh everyone's memory of the way in which the United Kingdom lied to the United Nations and to the world. Its lies and plans, however, were exposed and our revolution triumphed, overthrowing its agents, who withered away with the end of colonial occupation.\n38.\tThese various imperialist schemes, with which our country is familiar and which were condemned by our people to failure, are now being reintroduced by Great Britain in the Arabian Gulf area with false announcements of independence which are no more than identical copies of what Britain failed to impose on the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.\n39.\tDuring the era of colonization Great Britain divided our country into 23 sultanates and sheikhdoms and established tariff and customs barriers to secure the division and isolation of the people and to prevent us from keeping in contact with one another. But the people refused to accept the division and fought for political unity, for their freedom, their union and their independence. Division was accepted only by the puppet lackeys.\n40.\tToday, we witness colonialist Britain again playing the same game of \\\"divide and rule\\\" in the Arabian Gulf, which constitutes a single political unit. Britain is dividing it once more into a number of small States with shabby political structures and claims for these structures the status of independent nations. It is pushing these States now to gain membership in the United Nations.\n41.\tIt is notable, however, that these entities which Britain is presenting to this Organization, bearing documents of their so-called independence, are none other than the same type of agents that have been used by Britain to rule the Arabian Gulf area for more than 150 years. Britain persisted in announcing its intention to withdraw formally from the Arabian Gulf area when it clearly felt that the revolution which had been triggered by the people of the southern part of Oman was fast spreading into that area. So Britain speed up the execution of its imperialist schemes in an attempt to pull the rug from.under the revolutionaries and to convince Arab and world opinion that there are no further incentives for the revolution around which the people have rallied.\n42.\tThe People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, in view of the ties of brotherhood, neighborly closeness and historical background which link it to the people of the Arabian Gulf, feels it to be its duty to help and support their struggle for liberation from colonialist domination. This is but a reaffirmation of our belief in the right of all people to decide their own destinies and to achieve their independence and the unity of their territory according to 1 the Charter of the United Nations and its resolutions.\n43.\tMy Government believes that the continued presence of colonialism, whether apparent or disguised, in the Arabian Gulf is not only a disparagement of and disregard for the rights of this nation, but also a real threat to our Republic and its people, who have suffered from the repeated aggressions of the British on our eastern borders, next to the Dhofar area, which has been liberated by the revolutionaries of the Popular Front for the Liberation of\nthe Occupied Arabian Gulf. Moreover, Britain has resorted to the use of its air and naval forces to threaten our borders in an attempt to crush the revolution, ignoring the fact that the revolution originates essentially from within the Gulf, not from the outside.\n44.\tOur mention of the colonialist presence in the Arabian Gulf area is supported by the documents submitted to the United Nations by the revolutionaries themselves and confirmed by those observers who were able to visit the area. That presence is evident from the large military bases that are situated all over the Arabian Gulf, in particular in the vicinity of Oman and its surrounding sea area. That presence is also certified by the secret and public agreements that leave no doubt whatsoever that the whole area still remains under the control and the protection of the British Mandate.\n45.\tThe peoples of the Arabian Gulf, like all other struggling peoples, are determined not to put down the arms they carried on the morning of 9 June 1965 under the leadership of the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf, until they rid their country of the colonialist presence. They have proved during their seven-year revolution that they are capable of resisting the most savage, repressive measures of the British forces and their puppets. Neither their determination to carry on the struggle nor their belief in their final victory will be swayed by British tricks; indeed, they will be only strengthened. And if Britain has succeeded so far in fooling anyone, it has not fooled, and will not fool, the peoples of that area and their heroic fighters, who will decide the destiny of their own countries as they see fit. The revolution of Dhofar is only a beginning, and Dhofar is only a part of the Arabian Gulf ar ^a.\n46.\tIn spite of the United Nations resolutions admitting both Bahrain and Qatar as States Members of the Organization, the peoples of the Arabian Gulf are still looking for the support of the United Nations and those of its Members that stand for peace and freedom.\n47.\tA delegation representing the revolution in the area was here to explain the crimes committed by British forces against thousands of civilians and to submit proof of the reality of the colonialist presence. That delegation called on the world's conscience not to allow Britain to carry on its imperialist schemes that contradict the aims of the Charter and the principles of the United Nations.\n48.\tThe United Kingdom, the United States of America and their reactionary puppet regimes in the area have exploited the circumstances of the set-back that struck the Arab liberation movement following the Zionist aggression in June 1967, backed by imperialism, against the Arab people and their progressive regimes. Among the primary objectives and most urgent aims of that act of aggression was the freezing of the Arab revolutionary liberation movement as a prelude to isolating it from its world allies and eliminating it altogether. The Arab nation, however, has shown its greatness by overcoming the set-back as the armed revolution intensified in one area and resulted in the independence of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen only six months after the set-back. \n49.\tOther victories followed shortly, serving but to confirm the Arab nation's rejection of the consequences of the Zionist aggression backed by the United States. The Palestinian resistance came into being to give the Palestinian people a new confidence in themselves and in their ability to rid their nation of Zionist colonialism, in spite of the recent and past imperialist conspiracies to which it had been subjected.\n50.\tMy Government opposes and condemns any attempt to strike at the Palestinian resistance movement as a conspiracy against the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights.\n51.\tMore victories followed in succession in other parts of the Arab world, leading to the removal of British and American bases supporting Israel and its aggressive plans and representing a threat to peace in the area. Libya, for example, moved into a prominent position in the Arab struggle following the revolution of September 1969. More than four years have elapsed since the Israeli aggression against the Arab peoples, an aggression backed by the imperialist Powers headed by the United States, and resulting in the occupation of substantial portions of the territories of three Arab nations, all of them Members of the United Nations. There is no doubt that the perpetuation of that aggression is a violation of the territorial integrity of those nations; as such, it cannot be tolerated by either those nations or by the international community at large. Force, aggression and war were the means used for the occupation of those territories, and such methods have been rejected in substance and in form.\n52.\tThe People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, which is a part of the Arab nation and a State Member of the United Nations, believes that the position of the United Nations and the world community as mere onlookers as that aggression continues in defiance of United Nations resolutions can only encourage the aggressor, and it considers this a disappointment to the hopes of peace-loving nations and their regard for the United Nations, its seriousness and its great principles as laid down in the Charter.\n53.\tIt is no longer a secret to the whole world that it is the United States which encourages Israel to ridicule and ignore the United Nations and world opinion, by providing that State with financial and military support and protection. Were it not for the backing of the United States, it would not be possible for Israel, by itself alone, to defy the whole world. The question confronting this Assembly is whether the United Nations can agree to set its resolutions on one side of the scale and the United States on the other. Is there any justice in this situation? We also direct the question to the great people of the United States, who will, we believe, reject this equation in our present age.\n54.\tThe problem that we refer to as the Middle East crisis is in essence the problem of the Palestinian people. The aggression of June 1967, in the view of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Arab people, is a continuation of the crime that was committed in 1948, a year to which the Arabs refer as truly \\\"the year of tragedy\\\". In that year world history witnessed the most cruel crime it has ever known; for never before in the world's history could we read of a whole people forced out\n \nof their land, to be replaced by others who came from different nations, united by hatred and racism, forcibly removing the people of Palestine from their country and seizing their houses, their lands and their properties by force. Had this happened to another people in Africa or Asia, would it have been accepted? Yet, it has happened, and it happened after the establishment of the United Nations, with the assistance of the imperialist Powers, headed by the United States and the United Kingdom Governments, the latter having a Mandate over Palestine.\n55.\tSo here we are today, with the Arab nations paying the price of that first crime, which has also had new consequences as evidenced by the forcible occupation of Arab territories by Israel. The occupied Arab nations have made every peaceful effort and obtained from the United Nations several resolutions, among them Security Council resolution 242 (1967); and although four years have passed, Israel continues to defy the United Nations and its resolutions.\n56.\tWhat is left for the United Nations and the Security Council to do regarding a party that rejects their resolutions and refuses to carry them out?\n57.\tThis resolution, which we have not accepted, was, however, accepted by some of the Arab nations, whose territories have been occupied, to show their goodwill. Nevertheless, that resolution could not be enforced by the United Nations because the United States refuses to impose its implementation and to request Israel to carry it out. In fact, the United States is encouraging Israel's intransigence by supplying it with financial and military support.\n58.\tThe People's Democratic Republic of Yemen sees no possibility of a solution unless such a solution is based on the right of the Palestinian people to recover their lands and their right to self-determination. It is in this belief that the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen supports the rightful struggle of the Palestinian people to liberate its homeland and the proclaimed aims of the Palestinian revolution in creating a democratic system in Palestine, by which all citizens, be they Moslem, Christian or Jewish, can coexist.\n59.\tI wanted to see the only legitimate and real representative of the great people of China to welcome him in my address and I hope that this wish will come true in the near future.\n60.\tThat the People's Republic of China should obtain its seat in the United Nations as the sole representative of the great Chinese people is only natural. To have kept a large nation such as China and a great people like the Chinese, who number more than 700 million, outside the United Nations was a strange phenomenon.\n61.\tMy Government is confident that the United Nations will make a rapid decision to seat China during this session, that it will welcome the representative of the People's Republic of China to his natural role among us and that it will at the same time expel the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek of Taiwan.\n62.\tSuch a historic decision will be a landmark in the history of this international Organization and will create\nnew and better circumstances in international relations, thus increasing the effectiveness of the Organization in maintaining world peace and supporting the struggle of nations to secure their rights in freedom, progress and welfare. Such a resolution implies great purposes, the most important of which will be the defeat of the imperialist and colonialist policies of the United States. The insistence of the United States in continuing policies, which are in contradiction of the interests of humanity in progress and co-operation, will lead that country once again into isolation and eclipse, against its own will.\n63.\tThe imperialist policies of the United States are responsible for the creation and the explosion of world crises and threats to international peace and security. And there that country is now, waging an aggressive criminal war against the heroic Viet-Namese people to prevent them from attaining self-determination and unifying their territory. Not only has the United States armed and strengthened its dummy Government in Saigon, but it has also sent land, naval and air forces to wage a genocidal war against the Viet-Namese, dragging its allies into an unjust war.\n64.\tThe resistance of the heroic Viet-Namese people and their valiant struggle is winning the support of all the peoples of the world, among them the people of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The victories of the Viet-Namese are also victories for the aims and principles in which our people believe.\n65.\tThe victory of the Viet-Namese people is now certain. Equally clear is the defeat that awaits world imperialism headed by the United States, in spite of all the American tools of destruction, the calculations of electronic data- processing machines, the technological progress of America, and the millions of tons of bombs that have been dropped by United States bombers on the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam in that dirty war waged by the United States against the heroic people of Viet-Nam.\n66.\tThe United States, instead of stopping its dirty war against the Viet-Namese people and withdrawing its forces, has resorted to expanding its range to include other nations in Indo-China, believing that such an action will suppress the fighting spirit of the peoples of Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia. But it was mistaken, as it has always been, and it has found itself facing the united strength of the resistance of all Indo-Chinese people and thus it has been dealt one defeat after another.\n67.\tThis succession of events, the publication of the Pentagon papers and the atrocities that were revealed in military trials, which described the mass murders of innocent Viet-Namese women and children by the United States army, turned American public opinion against its own Government.\n68.\tThe Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam has submitted a seven-point program to solve the Viet-Namese question and to restore peace to that part of the world, which has been deprived of it for so long because of the aggressive policy of the United States and its interference in the affairs of other nations.\n69.\tMy Government supports these realistic proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-\nNam and demands the total and rapid withdrawal of all United States forces and their allies and a halt to air raids over the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam.\n70.\tThe People's Democratic Republic of Yemen notes with pleasure the peaceful and firm policies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries with a view to bringing about a detente in Europe and eliminating the spectre of war which has always haunted Europe.\n71.\tThe solution of the Berlin question constitutes a beginning of the solution to the whole German question. It is essential to recognize the existence of two German States; the Federal Republic of Germany must retract its shameful claim to being the sole representative of all Germany, a claim that is supported by all the imperialist nations, headed by the United States.\n72.\tIt is also imperative that the world community accept the membership of the German Democratic Republic in all the specialized agencies of the United Nations, in the same manner that it has accepted the membership of the Federal Republic? of Germany in these agencies.\n73.\tEuropean security, and consequently international security, can never be achieved as long as military alliances last. It is therefore necessary to dissolve military pacts and to reduce the military forces and strategic armaments of both the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the countries signatories of the Warsaw Treaty.\n74.\tKorea remains divided by imperialist forces headed by the United States, and its occupation continues under the United Nations flag. The United States continues to violate the will of the Korean people and its desire for independence and sovereignty. This odd situation must be brought to an end. It is necessary to evacuate all foreign military forces from South Korea and to liquidate foreign military bases there. The Korean people must have the freedom to decide, in a free plebiscite without outside interference, the question of uniting the two parts of their country.\n75.\tThe passion of our people for the cause of freedom, a passion for which many of our sons have paid with their lives, has no limits. It is because our people believe in every nation's right to freedom that we condemn the abrogation of the freedoms of the Arab people of Palestine, and the African peoples of Namibia, Southern Rhodesia and South Africa, who are the owners of their lands. We demand that the United Nations take immediate action to end all acts of racial discrimination in these countries and to force the racist regimes, to acknowledge the equal rights of the majority, who are the original inhabitants of these lands.\n76.\tThe inability of the United Nations to take a firmer stand towards Israel's crimes in the occupied territories of Palestine and the crimes of the racist regimes in Africa constitutes an encouragement to these regimes to continue their criminal policies, defying all principles of human co-operation and world opinion.\n77.\tWe are sorry to see the United Nations, after 26 years of existence, still unable to take any firm and decisive action to bring a halt to the practices of racist regimes which have defied it and rejected its resolutions. \n78.\tThe People's Democratic Republic of Yemen lends all its support to the struggle of the people of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) against Portuguese colonialism. We are confident that Portuguese imperialism will be defeated despite all the support it is receiving from its imperialist allies, and victory will come to the peoples of these countries in the not-too-distant future.\n79.\tThe people of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, who maintain good relations with both the Indian and Pakistani peoples, hopes that these two great countries of Asia will be able to solve the problem of the Pakistani refugees who are now the guests of India, a country which is carrying this burden. We hope these refugees will return to their homes, and we are confident that such a solution will be in the best interests of both peoples.\n80.\tOur Government supported the inclusion of an item entitled \\\"The colonial case of Puerto Rico\\\" in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly and urged a debate on this question, the vital importance of which, in our opinion, makes it a primary responsibility of the United Nations. We will request the inclusion of this issue in the agenda of the next session.\n81.\tIn conclusion, we wish all success to the United Nations and its agencies in their work to implement fully the objectives and ideals for which they were created.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "109. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to express to you, on behalf of the Government of Kuwait, which has close ties and good relations with Indonesia, heartfelt congratulations on your election to your high office. Your election as President of this session of the General Assembly is a true reflection of the prominent role which the Asian continent now plays in international affairs. I should also commend the high status you enjoy in international circles as a statesman with wide experience and an outstanding reputation. I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Hambro, for the manner in which he presided over the past session of the General Assembly. He lived up to his high reputation as a Veteran statesman in United Nations affairs and as an eminent authority on public international law.\n110.\tWe warmly welcome the admission of the four new Member States, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Bhutan, to the United Nations, owing to our conviction that the new Member States will strive to strengthen the United Nations and uphold the principles enshrined in the Charter. Making membership open to all States will promote the principle of universality within our world Organization and will enable these States to work within the international family to fulfill the principles and purposes of the Charter and to co-operate on the basis of equality and mutual respect.\n111.\tAt the beginning of this year my Government established diplomatic relations with the Government of the People's Republic of China. The exchange of diplomatic relations is the outcome of the good relations which have existed between Kuwait and the People's Republic of China for a long time and which yielded their fruit in the field of economics and trade. In conformity with the political reality of the People's Republic of China, we are in favor of its admission to the United Nations as the sole representative of the friendly people of China, who have always supported the Arab position in Palestine. We are  Sponsored by the Kettering Foundation and held at the United Nations, New York, from 25 to 28 May 1970. \nconfident that the admission of the People's Republic of China to the Organization as the sole representative of the Chinese people will improve the effectiveness of the United Nations and the prospects for peace, especially in the region of South-East Asia.\n112.\tWe are fully aware of the dangers engendered by the armaments race and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We therefore call for renewed efforts to achieve general and complete disarmament. We would like the funds which are being spent on destructive weapons to be used to combat famine, poverty and privation in the world. We advocate using atomic energy for peaceful purposes and to serve mankind. General and complete disarmament and the prohibition of the use for military purposes of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and outer space will promote the welfare of mankind and its prosperity, and improve the prospects for peace.\n113.\tWe attach great importance to the discussions that are being held at the ministerial level in preparation for the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD].\n114.\tThe Group of 77 emerged within the framework of UNCTAD as an effective element in the field of economic and social development. The events of the past few years have brought members of the Group closer to each other. The Group has become a cohesive force and a constructive element in international relations. The demands of the developing countries are fair and necessary to bridge the gap which separates them from the advanced countries, to promote world prosperity and to strengthen international peace and security.\n115.\tIt is important to note that the third session of UNCTAD will be held at a time of crisis, in which the foundations of the monetary order are shaking and while some of the advanced countries are pursuing protectionist trade policies.\n116.\tThe recommendations of the first and second sessions of UNCTAD have not been implemented. The passivity of the advanced countries is reflected in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], which is devoid of any binding commitment on the part of the advanced countries to make available annually to the developing countries financial resource transfers amounting to 1 per cent of their gross national product. The developed countries have refused to pledge in an unequivocal manner to carry out the numerous recommendations aimed at accelerating economic and social progress in the developing countries.\n117.\tI cannot help noting in this respect that the foreign aid which has been and is being extended by Kuwait amounts to one third of the State budget.\n118.\tThe United Nations has adequate machinery which can be used to provide disinterested aid with no political or military strings attached. The main organ in this respect is UNDP which is now passing through a transitional phase which we hope will enhance its effectiveness and increase its resources. This cannot be done unless the advanced\n \ncountries contribute generously so that UNDP may formulate sound criteria for providing aid according to the actual development needs in the recipient countries.\n119.\tIt is a sad reality in the world today that some nations are still under the yoke of imperialism or subjected to foreign control and racial discrimination. The main organs of the United Nations condemned these practices, which are contrary to human principles. It is incumbent upon us to insist on the implementation of United Nations resolutions so as to put an end to these unlawful activities.\n120.\tThe recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice regarding the legal consequences for States of the continued illegal presence of South Africa in Namibia  constitutes an incentive to the international community to take concerted action so as to put an end to this human scourge.\n121.\tWe should also demand withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territories of other States, especially from Indo-China, to enable the people of that region to exercise their right to self-determination in complete freedom and without any foreign pressure.\n122.\tThe problem, which it has become customary to call \\\"the situation in the Middle East\\\", continues to receive our most serious attention, as it has done in past years. This is so not only because of its effect upon the fate of fraternal Arab peoples and sister Arab States, or because of its impact upon the security and prosperity of our region, but also because of its import for the destiny of the international system.\n123.\tIt is well known that the primary victim of the problem in question is the Arab Palestinian people, which has suffered dispersion, oppression and deprivation of its basic human rights for a quarter of a century.\n124.\tIt is also well known that the Arab States adjacent to Palestine, sizable portions of whose territories have been subjected to Israeli occupation for over four years, constitute the second victim in the Middle Eastern situation.\n125.\tAnd it is well known that the entire Arab area of the Middle East is the third victim of that situation, inasmuch as its security, stability and prosperity are adversely affected by what has been happening in and around Palestine.\n126.\tHowever, what I wish to discuss now is not any of these aspects of the problem in spite of their importance in themselves and the special importance which Kuwait attaches to them-but rather the effect which the problem is likely to have upon the United Nations and upon the foundations of the international order which this Organization strives to establish.\n127.\tFor the conflict in the Middle East-between Israel and the Palestinian people, and between Israel and the Arab\nStates- is, in one of its aspects, a confrontation between Israel and the international community.\n128.\tIt is a confrontation between a regime which arose, entrenched itself and achieved territorial expansion through the use of force, on the one hand, and an Organization which came into being in order to prevent the resort to force and to deprive those who do resort to force of the ability to enjoy the fruits thereof, on the other hand.\n129.\tIt is a confrontation between a regime which has habitually violated international covenants and the rules of international law and an Organization which strives to promote respect for the law and observance of its principles.\n130.\tThis aspect of the Middle Eastern problem is indeed worthy of the attention of us all and calls for serious and responsible consideration of the obligations it lays on us all.\n131.\tI must admit that, whatever its role may have been initially-whether in the creation of the problem in the first place, or in the adoption of an attitude of passivity towards its subsequent aggravation thereafter-the United Nations has at last begun to correct its attitude, particularly after Israel had finally unmasked itself and revealed its true image so clearly that neither those who had formerly chosen to ignore the facts, nor those who had been deceived by appearances, could fail to see the truth about that country.\n132.\tThus, the United Nations has come at last to adopt the position required by the principles and purposes of its Charter.\n133.\tAccordingly, the mistakes committed in the past with respect to the Palestinian people were corrected when the General Assembly declared, at its twenty-fourth session [resolution 2535 B (XXIV)], its recognition of the inalienable rights of that people, and proceeded at the following session [resolution 2672 C (XXV)] to reaffirm that recognition, to proclaim that those inalienable rights included equal rights and self-determination, to emphasize that full respect for those rights was an indispensable element in the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East and to make specific mention of the people of Palestine, along with the peoples of southern Africa, when condemning those Governments that deny the right to self-determination of peoples recognized as being entitled to it [resolution 2649 (XXV)].\n134.\tIt is true that such belated recognition of its inalienable rights is not sufficient by itself to redress the wrongs done to the Palestinian people in consequence of the initial denial of those rights, nor is it adequate to compensate that people for the tragedy it has been suffering for a quarter of a century as a result; nor is it enough to ensure progress towards the creation of opportunities for its actual enjoyment of its human and national rights. Nevertheless, the mere declaration by the General Assembly of its recognition of those rights was a significant initial step in the right direction, which we note with appreciation.\n135.\tSimilarly, with respect to Israel's occupation of the territories of some Arab States and its policies and practices\n \nin those occupied territories, the United Nations has not failed to insist that the occupying authorities should act in conformity with the principles of the Charter.\n136.\tAs far as occupation in itself is concerned, the Security Council has repeatedly emphasized \\\"the established principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by conquest\\\" a principle which the Council reiterated for the fifth time less than two weeks ago in its resolution 298 (1971). In its turn, the General Assembly proclaimed this principle in two general Declarations issued at its twenty-fifth session and reiterated it with particular reference to the Middle East in its resolution 2628 (XXV) of 4 November 1970, in which it also deplored the continued occupation of the Arab territories since 1967.\n137.\tLikewise, the responsibility for obstructing progress towards a peaceful settlement embracing, inter alia, Israeli withdrawal has been unambiguously defined by the Secretary-General who, together with his Special Representative, has been assigned special functions in an attempt to achieve peaceful settlement. In the introduction to his latest report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General states:\n\\\"Ambassador Jarring feels, and I agree with him, that, until there has been a change in Israel's position on the question of withdrawal, it would serve little useful purpose to attempt to reactivate the talks\\\" [A] 8401/Add. 1, para. 219].\n138.\tLastly, on Israel's policies and practices in the occupied territories the United Nations has defined its position unequivocally in 52 formal resolutions. Those resolutions have dealt with Israel's annexation of some of the occupied territories; its forcible mass displacement since the occupation of tens of thousands of the rightful inhabitants of these territories and its forcible individual exile of hundreds of others; its prevention of the return of Arab refugees, displaced persons and expels to their homes; its importation of Jewish settlers and establishment of new settlements on confiscated Arab lands in the occupied territories; and its repressive measures against the population under its control including the imposition of collective punishments, the destruction of homes, the confiscation of property, the subjection of people to prolonged administrative detention, the torture of prisoners and other acts prohibited by the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949  and by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n139.\tBy those resolutions of the United Nations, the international community has demonstrated that it has no uncertainty as to who is responsible for the aggravation of the problem, and that it has no difficulty in establishing Israel's guilt and no doubts about, the imperative need for rectification of the conditions resulting therefrom.\n140.\tFor the resolutions in question contain no less than 38 expressions of the \\\"regret\\\", \\\"concern\\\", \\\"alarm\\\" or \\\"distress\\\" felt by the international community as a result of Israeli actions in the occupied territories. Furthermore, \nthose resolutions no less than 27 times \\\"deplored\\\", \\\"censured\\\" or \\\"condemned\\\" Israel or its policies and practices.\nHI. Such a record leaves no room for doubt about the position of the international community. However, it does cause some concern about the value of its being content with adopting resolutions, expressing displeasure or issuing condemnations; and it raises questions about what the United Nations should do, now that it has established that general international covenants, universal declarations and particular resolutions are equally incapable of deterring Israel from pursuing its policies or of ensuring the restoration of rights.\n142.\tWhat should the international community do in the face of this Israeli defiance? This is the challenging question that now persistently faces of all.\n143.\tYou have heard Israel's reply, voiced during the present general debate [1946th meeting ] the United Nations should desist from adopting more resolutions on the question.\n144.\tThis advice, which can hardly be described as disinterested and non-self-serving, has been heard before by the international community, and it has been consistently rejected, for the international community has recognized that the pursuit of this course, recommended by those who have shown contempt for its principles and disregard for its will, is tantamount to the abdication of its responsibilities and is certain to lead, in the end, to the loss of its authority, if not its very being.\n145.\tNor has the United Nations been content with dismissing this Israeli counsel. It has actively searched for a way out of the dilemma caused by Israel's continuing refusal to show respect for international resolutions. In the course of that search, some United Nations bodies and specialized agencies have in fact conducted certain experiments with alternative methods of shaking Israel's intransigence.\n146.\tFirst among such experiments was the attempt to give wide publicity to the facts about Israel's policies and practices, and to the reports and resolutions of United Nations bodies regarding them. This attempt was predicated on the belief that such publicity would enlighten world public opinion and might stimulate some international moral pressure upon Israel that might influence its policies and practices. This appears to have been the hope entertained by the Executive Board of UNESCO when it adopted its decision No. 4.3.1 at its eighty-third session, and by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights when it adopted its resolutions 10 (XXVI) and 9 (XXVII).\n147.\tBut the lesson already learned by the international community from its experience with the racist regime in South Africa soon proved to be equally true in the case of Israel: namely, that a regime based on disregard of the rule of law and on contempt for moral principles is hardly likely to be deterred, by the mere displeasure of world public opinion, from proceeding along its ordained course. Particularly is this the case when such a regime feels confident that the recognized superiority of its propaganda will counteract\nand prevail over the efforts of international agencies, and that the facts will remain concealed from the sight of the world.\n148.\tThe Security Council selected a different course. It chose to warn that if Israel persisted in its violations, further and more effective steps or measures might be adopted. As members of the General Assembly are aware, the Security Council has issued such warnings on eight different occasions since 1967: twice with respect to Israeli measures purporting to change the status of Jerusalem, and six times with respect to Israeli military attacks on the territories of Arab States.\n149.\tHowever, the mere repetition of these warnings, time after time, without the actual adoption of any measures indicating the sincere determination to put them into effect, deprived the successive warnings of their credibility and effectiveness. Moreover, Israel's certainty that it would receive continued support under all circumstances from one of the permanent members of the Security Council has served to embolden it to ignore and dismiss disdainfully the repeated warnings of the Council.\n150.\tThe General Assembly's request addressed to the Security Council in paragraph 3 of resolution 2535 B (XXIV), to \\\"take effective measures\\\" to ensure the implementation of past resolutions of both bodies, failed to elicit any response from the Council or to produce any effective enforcement measures. Nevertheless, the mere issuance of such a request by this Assembly was a significant sign of impatience with Israel's continuing violation of international conventions and its defiance of United Nations resolutions.\n151.\tThis impatience was expressed more clearly by the Commission on Human Rights in the latest of its resolutions dealing with Israeli policies in the occupied territories; I refer to resolution 9 (XXVII) of 15 March 1971, in which the Commission declared that\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s continued and increasing violations... indicate the necessity of collective action on the part of the international community to ensure respect for the human rights of the population of the occupied territories\\\". \n152.\tConfronted with the sterility of the first method, namely, the reliance on moral pressure exerted by world opinion to influence Israel and cause it to alter its policies voluntarily; and confronted also with the futility of the second course, namely, the warning that effective enforcement measures would be adopted, some international organizations have begun lately to consider a third course, namely, the adoption of punitive measures.\n153.\tReadiness to take the first step along this road was indicated a few months ago by the World Health Organization, whose Assembly warned, in resolution WHA 24.33 of 18 May 1971, that the continuation of \u201cIsrael\u2019s violations of basic human rights... would necessitate that the Organization should consider the application of Article 7 of its Constitution\\\"-a measure which would entail the suspension of Israel's voting privileges in the World Health Organization as well as the services to which Israel is entitled as a member.\n154.\tThe international community has passed the stage of reaffirming its principles;. It has passed the stage of investigating Israeli policies and practices and determining flagrant Israeli violations. It has passed the stage of declaring certain Israeli measures legally invalid. It has passed the stage of demanding that Israel rescind those measures and desist from taking similar ones in the future. It has passed the stage of expressing its regret and its concern. It has passed the stage of pronouncing censures, of deploring, of condemning. It has passed the stage of publicizing, and focusing the spotlight of world attention on Israeli policies. It has passed the stage of issuing warnings that are not accompanied by indications of its determination to put them into effect.\n155.\tIt is now incumbent upon the international community, having passed all those stages, to embark upon the course of adoption of punitive measures in accordance with the Charter, in order to compel Israel to show respect for the rules of international law and United Nations resolutions.\n156.\tFor, otherwise, the United Nations has only two choices: either to go on repeating what has been proved by experience to be unproductive, or to give up and acquiesce in the fait accompli, and accept Israel's intransigence as final and unchangeable.\n157.\tThe first choice can only enfeeble and emasculate the United Nations. And the second choice can result, in the Middle East, only in further turmoil ever recurring and ever menacing the peace of the world; and, elsewhere, only in giving would-be violators of the rule of law the coveted assurance that they may do so with impunity.\n158.\tIt is a severe test that now faces the United Nations. The very being of the international order may well depend upon what the United Nations will do from now on.\n159.\tLet us so act as to give no cause for future generations to say that our generation saw the truth but lacked the will to put it into effect. Let us so act as to give no one cause to judge that our generation saw injustice being inflicted on . peoples and States and witnessed laws being violate --nd the principles of the Charter trampled underfoot, mt, although it rejected what it saw in both thought and word, it remained unwilling to act to safeguard the rights of a man, a people or a State.\n160.\tThe effectiveness of the United Nations and its success in fulfilling its mission as the instrument of world peace and for the elimination of the causes of international tension are largely linked to the willingness of its Member States to react to the principles and purposes of the Charter and to respect the will of the international community. The world Organization in its present form is a mirror which reflects the conduct and the will of the Member States. The United Nations cannot be strengthened and developed unless we all work together in the spirit of one international family, transcending our individual interests and having as our sole aim world security and prosperity.\n \n161.\tWe in Kuwait believe in the principles of the Charter because we believe in the right of nations to live in peace and security, and because we yearn for world peace based on justice and the abhorrence of aggression, occupation and domination.\n162.\tOur faith in these values is closely linked to our great appreciation of the role played by our Secretary-General, U Thant, in safeguarding the goals of our Organization. We would like to take this opportunity to express the hope that he will continue in his present responsibilities at this crucial stage, which necessitates granting the Secretary- General wider powers, as part of strengthening and developing the United Nations so as to ensure faithful implementation of the principles of the Charter.\n163.\tLet our deeds match our aspirations in reaffirming the principles of the world Organization. Let us show zeal in our dedication to the United Nations, whose message is that of the human person with all his material and spiritual values.\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t I am indeed pleased, Sir, to extend to you, on behalf of the Liberian delegation and myself, sincere congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The Assembly, in our opinion, is indeed fortunate to have someone with your wide experience to guide its deliberations at this important session.\n2.\tMay I also take this opportunity to pay a deserved tribute to your distinguished predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, who presided over the commemorative proceedings with aplomb and who directed the work of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly so ably as to merit the respect and admiration of all of us.\n3.\tThe Liberian delegation welcomes the recent entry into the United Nations of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar and extends to these delegations its sincere felicitations.\n4.\tWe in Liberia bemoan the recent passing of our late President, William V. S. Tubman. His tenure as leader of his country exceeded in time the life of this Organization. In his more than 27 years as Head of State, the late President Tubman spared no efforts in his endeavors to promote the interests of his people both at home and abroad. His untiring devotion to the cause of peace extended beyond the boundaries of Liberia and beyond the continent of Africa. His support of the United Nations and of the purposes for which it stands is well known.\n5.\tHe has been succeeded by President William R. Tolbert, Jr. whose faith in the United Nations and its purposes and whose dedication to international co-operation and to international brotherhood are equally and as firmly fixed.\n6.\tPresident Tolbert, who served ably and faithfully as Vice-President for over 19 years, has always supported the\n\nUnited Nations and other international organizations. He has directed me to assure the United Nations of his continued support and co-operation in its quest for international peace and security.\n7.\tAfter almost three quarters of a century, in which the world has not been fr >.) of violence and war, with all the loss of human life and all the devastation that this has entailed, the world's peoples are yearning for peace and progress and for a better life. There are problems about Which we in Africa are gravely concerned.\n8.\tThe situation in southern Africa presents perennial problems to which this Organization has been unable to provide solutions. I need not detail here the frustrations and anger and the disappointment this has caused to the peoples of Africa. The conditions necessary to find just solutions are clearly outlined in the Charter to which the Members of this Organization have subscribed. Nevertheless, this perilous situation has been allowed to linger because of selfish interests.\n9.\tThe South African Government has demonstrated extreme contempt for the ideals, principles and obligations of the Charter of the United Nations, among which are \\\"respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples\\\" and \\\"respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\\".\n10.\tThose principles inserted in the United Nations Charter seem, in our opinion, to place certain interests, as they relate to basic human rights, beyond the reach of arbitrary State action. Yet the South African Government has continued to ignore those principles and has challenged and defied the will and decisions of the Organization on them with a certain degree of impunity.\n11.\tThe failure of the United Nations to fulfill its mandate, at least in respect of southern Africa, clearly undermines the authority of the United Nations as a world Organization designed to ensure international peace and security. Many of the proposed remedies break down under critical analysis due to the attitudes of some powerful States. They declare lip-service condemnation of the atrocities of the Government of South Africa while lending extraordinary economic and other direct and indirect support to it. Thus, it is not very difficult to understand the apparent intransigence of South Africa.\n12.\tThere is no need for confusion about, or misunderstanding of, the avowed policy of apartheid. Any State that declares its policy to be based on racial distinctions over which the individual has no control and in fact imposes repressive measures to foster that policy, whatever the form of those measures, should be condemned.\n\n\n13. One of the consequences of ineffective action by the international community is that the Pretoria Government has extended its heinous policy of apartheid to Namibia. In addition to the size of the world which frowns upon, condemns and opposes that policy, the International Court of Justice has, in its recent advisory opinion, declared unequivocally that the continued South African presence in Namibia is illegal. My delegation feels that that significant opinion provides a basis for positive action by those big Powers that have, by their indirect action, conveniently encouraged South Africa to ignore the decisions of the United Nations on this burning issue.\n14.\tThe illegal minority regime in Zimbabwe-otherwise called Southern Rhodesia provides another example of the grave situation in southern Africa which poses a threat to international peace and stability in the area. What is even more disturbing is the apparent ease with which a powerful sector of the international community seems to be adapting itself to the situation.\n15.\tAt the time of the unilateral declaration of Independence by the Ian Smith regime, the United Kingdom expressly limited the measures it was prepared to take against ..its colony. That resulted in partial and weak measures being applied, an 1 they have not been effective.\n16. In 1968 the Security Council again voted unanimously to adopt resolution 253 (1968), imposing, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against Southern Rhodesia. In spite of that expression of condemnation of the Smith regime by the international community through the highest world forum and the apparent manifestation of a concerted will to put an end to that illegal administration, the Smith regime has continued its intransigence. Last year's proclamation of a Republic of Rhodesia by the Smith regime is also illegal. Yet no successful attempt has been initiated to reverse the situation in Rhodesia and its tragic consequences for the African majority. The excuse for such failure is unconvincing, and the failure is due, not to inability, but to unwillingness to take the truly effective measures that would bring about success.\n17.\tOne of the reasons for the ineffectiveness of the measures taken in regard to the illegal regime in Zimbabwe is the collusion between Portugal, South Africa and the illegal regime.\n\n18.\tOnce again, I consider it necessary to call on the General Assembly to strengthen its support for resolutions reaffirming the inalienable right of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), at present under Portuguese domination, to self-determination and independence. The present situation in those Territories is clearly a threat to international peace and security. This has been further evidenced by the dastardly attack made last year by that retrograde regime on the independent African Republic of Guinea, as well as the offensive incursions which Portugal has made on the territory of the independent African Republic of Senegal. That threat to those independent countries is continuing today, and the Security Council Council is at present seized of those matters.\n19. It is high time that the last vestiges of colonialism should be removed in conformity with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, adopted as resolution 1514 (XV), and one of the documents adopted by the General Assembly at its commemorative session last year which called for the full implementation of that Declaration [resolution 2708 (XXV)].\n20.\tIt seems to me that the chief obstacle to our success in southern Africa lies not in our powers, were we to use them, but in those selfish aims which remain so little changed despite new situations. Unfortunately, it seems that it is the will of the international community that is at fault.\n21.\tOn the whole problem of southern Africa, I should like to re-emphasize what I said during the twenty-first session of the General Assembly on 10 October 1966: that the African Territories under Portuguese domination, Rhodesia, South West Africa and South Africa are elements of a single problem, the solution of which requires joint action [1435th meeting, para. 25J. That is essentially true as a result of the apparent unholy alliance among South Africa, Portugal and Southern Rhodesia, especially when South Africa daily increases its military potential and was reported recently to have developed missiles which might be exported or supplied to its allies.\n22.\tThe United Nations will most likely succeed in fulfilling its obligations when its Members learn to avoid narrow national interests, to eschew economic greed and to respect fully the principles of the Charter, so that they may find themselves in a position objectively to support the efforts of the Organization.\n23.\tUnfortunately the tragedy in Viet-Nam continues and there is still much uncertainty about a settlement. The talks in Paris have failed to yield satisfactory results. It is our hope that other events which have occurred recently may help to accelerate a solution in the interest of the Viet-Namese people and in the cause of world peace.\n24.\tAlthough there has been an effective cease-fire for over one year, the danger of an explosion in the Middle East which may have serious repercussions on world peace cannot be dismissed lightly. One of the causes for serious concern in that situation is the big-Power involvement. The missing element in that situation seems to be the will to make peace. The situation is further complicated by the unhappy ideological division in the world.\n25.\tWe believe it is time for the parties, Members of this Organization, which have obligated themselves to settle their differences by peaceful means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, not only to use the existing means available to them but also to undertake fresh initiatives to reduce tension in the area. In this connexion we are anxiously awaiting the result of the initiative being undertaken by the Organization of African Unity and we can only wish success for the efforts of the 10 members of \nthe Committee of African Heads of State established by the Organization.\n26.\tAt this stage I should like to mention the serious financial situation of the United Nations, which was highlighted by our Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/ 8401/Add.l]. This situation calls for serious decisions on the part of the Members of this Organization. We can no longer postpone or shirk the important responsibilities which the situation entails.\n27.\tAll of us need the United Nations. It is an important Organization for the maintenance of international peace and security and we cannot afford to let it drift into bankruptcy.\n28.\tThe problem of the refugees is one of great concern in many parts of the world. Because of the humanitarian nature of the problem we cannot brush it under the rug. Where there are internal conflicts and colonial wars the problem has been exacerbated.\n29.\tThe refugee situation in the Indian subcontinent places an onerous burden on India. This Organization has to assume the moral responsibility the situation imposes. Although something has been done to alleviate it, much more is required.\n30.\tAfrica is also afflicted with this problem. We hope that this Organization will make some progress in removing the conditions which have brought about such a serious human problem.\n31.\tAlthough the problems I have mentioned appear intractable and cause serious concern, there have been some events in the past year which have given cause for some optimism on the international scene.\n32.\tPerhaps I should mention first the reaffirmation of the dedication of Member States of the United Nations to the objectives and purposes of the Charter [resolution 2627(XXV)], one of the four documents adopted by the General Assembly at its commemorative session almost a year ago.\n33.\tMan's survival seems to depend greatly on the need to redirect our efforts to international co-operation and away from the forces which breed unrest and disorder. We also need to direct more attention to the human environment. Towards this .end we should make a reappraisal of the means necessary to enable us to attain these objectives and purposes.\n34.\tAnother important factor has been the recent Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin  and the successful treaties negotiated by the Federal Republic of Germany with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  and with Poland. These agreements point to a normalization of relations between West Germany and other Eastern European countries and provide a welcome opportunity for the reduction of tension in this area. No one can doubt that this may have a salutary effect on an East-West detente.\n35.\tAnother significant factor has been the favorable, although slow, progress made in the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks between the Soviet Union and the United States. To this must be added also the slow progress made in the Geneva disarmament talks by the draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction [Aj8457-DCj234t annex A], Liberia regrets that this agreement has not yet been extended to chemical weapons.\n36.\tThe Liberian delegation certainly wishes that more rapid progress could be made on the issue of disarmament. The arms race produces only unrest and instability and could result in disaster for mankind, especially in view of the advances that have been made in science and technology.\n37.\tApart from the fact that social conditions in many parts of the world can be substantially improved by funds diverted from armaments, we have a clear choice to make to prevent our self-destruction and ensure man's survival.\n38.\tMy delegation feels that the question of the sea-bed, and the ocean floor, and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction is one which requires the most delicate consideration and handling in our search for a solution within the meaning and context of General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) and within the frame-work of resolution 2750 (XXV).\n39.\tThe ability of the international community to promote order and to preserve harmony may be tested by the success of our efforts in devising means of regulating activities in the intricate and challenging age of scientific and technological advances. Only one path provides a solution in the interests of mankind as a whole, and that is by agreement based on the principles of universality and equality.\n40.\tTo achieve this end, partisan and selfish considerations will have to give way to common interests based on the principle of equity. An international community in which each State is willing to surrender only that for which it can see an equivalent in terms of itself alone is not one that will provide an answer for the settlement of the question of the sea-bed.\n41.\tGeneral Assembly resolution 2750 C (XXV) also provides for the convening of a conference on the law of the sea in 1973 and it assigns certain duties to the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction in preparation for the conference. While my delegation welcomes a conference on the law of the sea in 1973, we feel that views on questions relating to the law of the sea are in many respects so wide apart and diverse that a modification of extreme positions must be encouraged if the conference is to be successful. We must be prepared to submerge our separate and individual interests in a common cause for the common good and the benefit of mankind.\n42.\tI have spoken seriously about the political and social problems of our world. There is another problem which causes my Government serious concern. I have, in past statements before this body, applauded the United Nations for the role it is playing in the field of economic development and growth, in terms of technical advice, training, pre-investment studies and meaningful, if indirect, financial contributions.\n43.\tThe work of the United Nations Development program has become an integral part of the efforts of most developing countries to plan and implement both short- and long-term policies. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development continues to explore possibilities to improve trade relations between the developing and the developed countries.\n44.\tDespite these efforts, there is today re-emerging a kind of rugged nationalistic conservatism in international trade and financial matters which, if not rectified, may ultimately dissipate those efforts at international monetary co-operation, which are already strained, and hamper our attempts to make significant gains in this field during this decade.\n45.\tChange is inevitable and is a constant of history. In 1946, it was honorable to see the international community get together and work out financial arrangements for the furtherance and facilitation of international trade. Since that time, the nature of trade has changed and this has \\\"been the result of the imposition of protective measures which largely distort the real nature of trade in terms of both the actual exchange of goods and the international division of labor.\n46.\tWe, the developing countries, find ourselves at the lower level of an economic model we did not create. In almost every area of trade, our commodities suffet an unfair advantage in terms of price whenever they are permitted to enter into these protected markets. These markets are overprotected because the developed countries find it difficult to see the importance of those of our efforts which are not strictly related to their own national self-interest.\n47.\tIn the message delivered on behalf of the Secretary- General to the Economic and Social Council at its 1773rd meeting, in Geneva, it was stated that the task of translating the International Development Strategy into practice would require even more determination, understanding and goodwill than the original formulation which brought it into being. The concern expressed by the Secretary-General is one also shared by my Government.\n48.\tWith deteriorating terms of trade and a slowdown in growth, what developing countries need is the implementation of the terms adopted in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. The developing countries are in a situation where they are affected not only by their own economic policies but also by the economic policies of the developed countries, although the latter are not affected by the policies of the developing countries.\n49.\tRecently we have heard talk about letting the world markets respond to the simple concepts of supply and demand. Is it not ironic that the applicability of this concept practically excludes most countries of the third world? The constant plea of developing countries is for our commodities to enter the markets of developed countries at fair prices. How can we be expected to meet the targets of the Development Strategy if we have constantly to beg to sell those commodities which we produce?\n50.\tI am unable to conclude these remarks without stating that Secretary-General UThant deserves our appreciation and special praise for his sincere devotion and services to the United Nations as well as for his dedication to the cause of international peace and security. His astute handling of some of the most delicate international issues, his determination to serve humanity, his objectivity, his strength of character and his resoluteness in the face of challenging odds have merited for him our highest respect and won for him our admiration and affection. The Government of Liberia wishes indeed that he can be induced to continue in his high and responsible office. Nevertheless, should he insist on retiring we can only hope that his talents and experience can be made available to the Organization at times when they may be needed and that he and his family will have happiness in the years ahead.\n51.\tFinally, Mr. President, you may be assured of the full co-operation of the Liberian delegation during this session. The times demand from us nothing less than this.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "186.\t Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of Cameroon, I wish to join the representatives who have preceded me in addressing to you our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your remarkable talent and long experience in international affairs certainly augur well for the outcome of our labors. Your unanimous election is at the same time a tribute by the United Nations to the exceptional role your great country plays on the international scene.\n187.\tMay I also be permitted to extend once again my congratulations to Mr. Edvard Hambro, who, with real flair and competence, successfully guided the historic session marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of this Organization.\n188.\tIt is only fair also to pay tribute to UThant, our SecretaryGeneral, whose devotion to the world Organization has stood up under every test. He has succeeded in bringing his dynamism to the United Nations and has given it the self-confidence that has made it possible for it to deal successfully in many critical moments with so many disturbances of such a stormy nature. It was under Ids guidance, both bold and wise, that our Organization came of age without losing anything of its youthful vigor.\n189.\tWe are not going to go so far as to hold a naively high opinion of the accomplishments of the United Nations and to feel an unmixed satisfaction in their regard. At this very time, as a matter of fact, too many horrors and injustices darken the face of our world for us to be able to say that we can glimpse, even at a distance, any end to this tunnel of suffering and anguish through which mankind is passing. South Africa, VietNam, the Middle East, Northern Ireland and many other names evoke, for each of us, an appalling picture of man feverishly hunting his fellow man, driven on by the hateful demons whose names are colonialism, racial and religious discrimination, and the relentless pursuit of selfish interests.\n190.\tIf to all this we add the natural disasters and epidemics which during this year have afflicted a large number of countries in the third world, with the United Nations powerlessly standing by, it is very difficult to claim. any unqualified success for international solidarity.\n191.\tHowever, we cannot fail to welcome and to be thankful for both the bright spots that have marked the history of the last few months and certain things that have encouraged the inventive spirit of mankind and rekindled our hopes.\n192.\tIt is with those thoughts in mind that we point to the ever more numerous scientific achievements that have been scored by teams of researchers in all countries. We might in particular mention the lunar explorations which we all recently witnessed, thanks to radio and television, and which have now become almost familiar realities even though not long ago they seemed only adventures out of science-fiction.\n193.\tTogether with these hopeful signs there are a few major problems which, for many years, have been a source of concern to this Organization, anxious to preserve peace. First of all, the fact that there has been no new armed clash in the Middle East is in itself an encouraging result of the numerous efforts on the part of the United Nations.\n194.\tCameroon continues to offer its active support to the indefatigable action of the SecretaryGeneral and his representatives in the search for a just peace, negotiated on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n195.\tThe Head of State of Cameroon is participating with high hopes in the Special Committee Created at the eighth session of the summit meetings of the Organization of African Unity,  with a view to finding a solution to this conflict involving an African country, a founding member of the PanAfrican organization.\n196.\tIt seems that the war in Indo-China will evolve favorably towards pace in the coming months. As we have always said, we hope that in that part of the world the major Powers will act with reason and a sense of morality and will set aside their ideological egotism which has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of brothers. It should be possible to settle the VietNam conflict peaceably, especially since there is more and more international cooperation in Asia. That is why we warmly welcome any policy to restore the legitimate rights of the ancient Power that is China in the United Nations.\n197.\tFor its part, Cameroon decided on 3 April 1971 to open diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on the basis of the sacred principles of nonalignment. We are pleased that since that date many countries and, not the smallest one shave boldly embarked on this wise course. Iv. is indeed time to put an end to an absurd situation which seemed closer to fiction than reality.\n198.\tFurthermore, our love of peace prompts us to rejoice at the progressive disappearance of tension in Europe. Last year Cameroon joined with those who welcomed the GermanSoviet Treaty as a prelude to a salutary relaxation of tension. This year we welcomed the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. In addition, we hope that in signing the Agreement on Berlin, the allies of the last world war have finally decided to bring an end to the cold war.\n199.\tUnfortunately, we are aware of the fragile nature of these few positive results, which appear more like indications of better and more substantial achievements to come. Everyone realizes that there must be a greater balance in the world, a balance no longer based on terror and the power of armed blocs, but a new order based on justice, on respect for mankind, on the right of every people to self-determination, on noninterference in the internal affairs of States.\n200.\tPeople may say that we are mere dreamers. That may well be, but we can hold our heads high with all of you; for these principles that we have just enunciated are those of our policy of nonalignment and they coincide fully with the principles of the Charter of our Organization.\n201.\tHowever, our world continues to drift and these noble ideals are flouted daily, and international cooperation has become seriously bogged down. Of course, since the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly we have had an instrument which, in the opinion of our delegation, represents at the present time the most complete statement of the problems of cooperation and of the possible solutions. We are referring to the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. This document, when it was adopted, was, of course, accompanied by the serious reservations by certain Powers whose unconditional support would have ensured its effectiveness. These reservations have undoubtedly produced in the poorer countries a feeling of disappointment and frustration. But we should welcome the fact that in spite of this bitterness perhaps because of it the dynamic nature of our Strategy was safeguarded. That is why we would appeal to one and all to remove their reservations, and we trust that all the partners will demonstrate their political determination and collective will, without which the goals and objectives of our Strategy will remain mere pious hopes.\n202.\tIt is especially urgent that the thinking of people should be., changed since the inequalities between the developed and developing countries have become more accentuated, thus giving rise to a duality harmful to peace.\n203.\tHow can we fail to express once again our gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral, who has always endeavored to sound the alarm about this dangerous division between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\"?\n204.\tThus far, alas, his seems to have been a voice in the wilderness. Concern for the wellbeing of all men seems to have receded into the background in the conscience of the Governments of most countries, and especially the well to do countries, while the virus of the arms race has extended its destruction even to areas where hunger and ignorance continue to exist.\n205.\tIt is indeed high time that the recommendations which we adopted in this Organization became programs of action. These recommendations primarily concern international trade, basic commodities, the transfer of resources, the relation between official and private aid and the transfer of science and technology.\n206.\tCameroon, for its part, is prepared to participate in any negotiations towards this end in a realistic spirit. We shall do so with great conviction; for, in our opinion, the deterioration in the terms of trade as has been so correctly stated is unquestionably but a new form of colonialism. You are already aware that my country has always fought and will continue to fight against all forms of colonialism and racial discrimination. It was in accordance with the fundamental tenet of our policy and in close cooperation with the United Nations that the city of Yaounde, in June of this year, provided accommodation for the symposium on the evils of racial discrimination,  of which you are aware. We are pleased to say that although little was made of the results of this meeting, which brought together distinguished personalities from many countries, they were nonetheless outstanding, and the report which the competent services of our Organization will give you on this subject will surely convince you of that more than I could.\n207.\tWe believe that more initiatives of this kind should be taken in order to promote continually the thinking of all those who, throughout the world, are fighting against the unholy alliance of the forces of racial or colonialist oppression.\n208.\tI should like to take this opportunity to state once more our concern about the situation which prevails in Africa. Even in areas of extreme tension rays of hope seem to be appearing which point to favorable developments in the future; only our continent seems to see its horizon darkening every day.\n209.\tCertainly, during the first decade of their political independence, which is just now coming to an end, many African countries have wrought actual miracles in the field of economic and cultural development. This has been a surprise to many, to those who, at the dawn of our emancipation, held a rather dim view of the future of our continent, but now they are obliged to acknowledge that the economy of many countries is beginning to get off the ground.\n210.\tWe owe this extraordinary result partly to foreign assistance but mostly to the lucidity and courage of our leaders and people. It has been said that faith can move mountains. In Africa we have the unshakable faith of the builders of society, and that is why we are embarking on the next development decade with confidence.\n211.\tYet we would say that the situation in our continent continues to be a source of concern. Considering matters closely, we see that Africa is, to a very great extent, suffering from the typical evils and shortcomings of developing countries.\n212.\tBut, above all, this continent seems to have been chosen as the place for the lowest forms of dehumanizing systems. I refer to a primitive state of colonialism and avowed policies of racial discrimination.\n213.\tWe will not dwell on the methods and pseudo Christian doctrines of the Governments in Pretoria, Lisbon and Salisbury. Others on other occasions have done so with an eloquence which we could certainly not match. Furthermore, we should have very little pleasure in repeating the long list of misfortunes being experienced by our brothers in southern Africa. However, we cannot fail to cry out in indignation against the insolent attitude of those who trample underfoot the recommendations of this Organization and the fundamental principles of the Charter. There is indeed a long list of resolutions and solemn declarations adopted by the General Assembly, the Security Council and the International Court of Justice .\n214.\tHowever, not only do South Africa and Portugal care little for these, but in their countries they have casually developed these odious policies and the result is that for tens of millions of Africans a kind of concentration camp has been produced, and a more aggressive attitude towards free and independent countries has been brought about.\n215.\tFollowing their example, the illegal regime in Salisbury has for a number of years been consolidating its usurped power, with the complicity of those who have proclaimed that they have long been the champions of freedom and equality among men.\n216.\tThe treacherous voices of racists have arisen, offering economic and military cooperation, but the sole purpose is to destroy our brothers who are fighting for the dignity of men, all men, and for the honor of Africa. If we were to go along with them; we should be abandoning the just struggle that our people have undertaken throughout the entire continent, only because we are poor and because capital is being offered to us.\n217.\tAs far as Cameroon is concerned, its President, its Government and its people have already given a categorical refusal to these offers. We are convinced that Africa, which has already suffered so much but which for the past ten years has been determined to do away with colonialism once and for all, will not capitulate. We will not go to Canossa.\n218.\tThat is why we would once again appeal to all peace-loving and justice-loving men to give unreserved support to our action within the Organization of African Unity. We remembered it is a source of great solace to us that this Assembly almost unanimously adopted and endorsed the principles behind this action. My delegation is proud to say that it was on a proposal of its Chief of State, H.E. El Hadj Ahmadou Ahijo, speaking here [1780th meetingJ, on behalf of all his peers in the panAfrican organization, that the General Assembly at its twenty- fourth session adopted the Manifesto on Southern Africa. \n219.\tWe do not believe that that document has become irrelevant for any of the States that gave us their support. We have great difficulty in understanding the military and legal quibbling of certain Powers which know that without their moral and material support South Africa and Portugal could not wage the genocidal war which they have been pursuing in Africa.\n220.\tOf course, the maintenance of peace should continue to be the permanent concern of all States; but it cannot be said often enough that the structure and functioning of this Organization are such as to give certain Powers a special responsibility, towards history.\n221.\tIt was in full awareness of this that two years ago the Organization of African Unity tried to inform world public opinion about the real nature of the sacrifices of the freedom fighters and endeavored to awaken the conscience of the world.\n222.\tFrom this rostrum we would point to the tremendous quantities of capital invested by colonialist and segregationist enterprises in southern Africa and the great instruments of death that are furnished in growing quantities to the Governments in Lisbon and Pretoria, which are both aiming to strengthen colonialism and racial oppression.\n223.\tThe subtle distinction between defensive and offensive weapons means at the very most that some weapons are to be used against the African liberation movements and others against independent States. The Republic of Guinea and the Republic of Senegal have already had some sorry experiences in this connexion, and other States are now being threatened.\n224.\tCan we really hope that soon all countries will agree that this crucial problem is related to those of world balance and to the problem of development in short, to the problem of universal peace? The peoples of most of the countries which are now considered the wealthiest have\nlong fought against oppression, social injustice and racial discrimination and have endured the worst kind of suffering in order to bring about a really humanitarian society.\n225.\tThese countries can no longer be complacent about the tragedy of underdevelopment and colonialism which is taking place before our eyes, for man's struggle must be a total struggle. No one man can be truly free as long as any man is denied his right to achieve happiness.\n226.\tThis is the conviction of the people and Government of Cameroon and was also the conviction of those who created the United Nations. The fact that we are all gathered together here certainly proves that they were not merely Utopians and that man may yet bring about his own salvation.\n"

        "file_text": "68.\t  Mr. President, it is my honor and privilege, at the outset, to convey to you and to the distinguished representatives the greetings of my Sovereign, His Majesty King Mahendra, as well as his best wishes for the success of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n69.\tI should like to extend, on behalf of my delegation, our most sincere congratulations to you upon your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. I cannot adequately express in words the pleasure of my delegation in having a well-reputed personality like yourself as our President during this session. The delegation of Nepal has no doubt that you will bring to bear upon the work of the General Assembly the vast wisdom and wealth of experience you have gained in the course of a long and distinguished public career as an indomitable freedom fighter, an able diplomat, and an eminent statesman of a great country. We have regarded your election not only as a great hofiour to the country and the continent you represent, but also as a fitting recognition of your own contribution to the peace and understanding of the world. My delegation finds particular reason to be gratified at your election, because our two countries, Indonesia and Nepal, share many similar cultural traits and maintain the happiest and most cordial relations of friendship. May I offer you\nthe full co-operation and support of my delegation in the discharge of your heavy responsibility.\n70.\tAt the same time, I wish to put on record the deep appreciation of my delegation to Mr. Edvard Hambro for his memorable services during the last session of the General Assembly. Mr. Hambro guided the work of the twenty-fifth anniversary session with remarkable wisdom, assurance and good humor. Under his presidency, the Genera' Assembly took several decisions of a historic character, which, I am sure, have laid the groundwork for future tasks of the United Nations in such areas of common concern as international peace and security, and international development and co-operation.\n71.\tWe are opening the second quarter century in the life of the United Nations against the background of far-reaching developments in the world. Events have moved rapidly during the past year, events with exceptionally profound repercussions in world relationships. The dominant feature of the new era promises to be change, faster and more radical than that witnessed during the **rst quarter century. All discernible trends point towards a new order of, things and a new order of priority. The problem of coping with the new situation and harmonizing the diverging, and often conflicting, national aspirations and interests will indeed be a challenge to world statesmanship.\n72.\tTwo recent developments in international affairs show that world statesmanship is equal to this task. I refer to the developments relating to the progress achieve on the Berlin question and the steps taken towards the normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China.\n73.\tMy Government applauds both these developments. In terms of their contribution to the relaxation of world tensions, these two developments tower far above others which have taken place in recent years.\n74.\tThe improvement in the situation of Europe, which really began last year with the conclusion of the Moscow and Warsaw treaties, has continued. The basic agreement signed by the four Powers on the question of Berlin is additional proof that the trend in Europe is unmistakably towards a lasting detente. Considering that Europe was twice the scene of devastating wars on a global scale during our lifetime and that, even after the end of the Second World War, the German problem continued to be the biggest source of friction between the major Powers for two and a half decades, we cannot help admiring the bold, constructive and far-sighted statesmanship that is responsible for the removal of that source of friction once and for all. A new era of peace has dawned in Europe. That gives us reason to believe that the detente will be increasingly reflected in closer co-operation between the major Powers in particular and in East-West relations in general.\n75.\tLet us hope that this will ultimately lead to the divided countries being admitted to the United Nations on equal terms, so that the world Organization may be better equipped to deal with world problems on a practical and realistic basis.\n1 Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, signed at Berlin on 3 September 1971.\n76.\tMy Government has heartily welcomed the joint China-United States communique of last July announcing the visit of the President of the United States to Peking in the near future. It would be premature to make guesses about the outcome of a summit meeting between President Nixon and Premier Chou En-lai, but it goes without saying that the announcement of the meeting itself has brought about a sense of relief and generated tremendous hope for peace. The absence of relations -or, if I may say so, the existence of a de facto state of belligerency between these two great Powers, which were war-time allies a traditional good friends, had not only hampered the development of international co-operation in several areas, but also severely weakened the capacity of the world Organization, as well as that of individual Powers, to tackle most world problems realistically and with any chance of success. It is the fervent hope of my Government that the incipient thaw in Washington-Peking relations will be a prelude to the establishment of a genuine peace through the settlement, in the first instance, of all outstanding problems in the Pacific region. Good normal rations between all major Powers are of fundamental importance to world peace.\n77.\tMy delegation has repeatedly expressed our strong feelings about the need for China's full and rightful participation in international affairs. The first step in this direction is, of course, the restoration of the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. We are happy that more and more countries are coming to accept the basic fact that, without China's presence and participation in the United Nations, the world Organization cannot be as strong and purposeful as the Charter intended it to be. We recognize that many of the disappointments, frustrations and failures of the United Nations during the past two decades are directly attributable to the exclusion of the People's Republic of China from the Organization. As the United Nations enters into a new era, we cannot let this state of affairs continue.\n78.\tIn our view, the first priority in the new order of tilings should be the unconditional restoration of China's rights in the United Nations. In this way, not only will we be making a significant stride towards the universality of the Organization, but we will also be putting the United Nations in a better position to play the role which the Charter has set for it, namely, the pursuit of world peace.\n79.\tWith this end in view, my delegation has joined with several other delegations in submitting to the General Assembly a draft proposal [A/L.630J designed to restore to the People's Republic of China all its rights which are inherent in the Charter. The proposal is based on the fact of only one China and on the simple proposition that the Government which effectively governs the people of a State should be allowed to represent that State in the United Nations and all related agencies. We are confident that the General Assembly will approve our proposal. My delegation is determined to oppose any move or proposal which would have the effect of either delaying or obstructing the seating of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. We believe that the Assembly will reject all distracting tactics and that good counsel will prevail this year.\n80.\tThe development which has taken place in Korea in recent days also gives us some hope. As is evident from the\nbilateral Red Cross talks, authorities in both Koreas seem to be shifting away from a rigid position of intolerance and confrontation to one of accommodation and coexistence, It is the earnest hope of my delegation that these talks will eventually evolve into an open and effective machinery for dialog between South and North Korea at the governmental level,\n81.\tWhen we turn away from these welcome developments towards other problem areas of the world, the emerging hopes for a better and more peaceful life on earth are almost dashed,\n82.\tThe war in Viet-Nam is continuing. It is one of the most glaring examples of the consequence of failure on the part of States to observe the principles of non-interference and self-determination. The prolonged war and its extension to the whole region of Indo-China has brought home the truth that no military solution to a basically political problem can be possible. What we regret more than anything in this tragic situation is that the lesson of the past few years has not been bitter enough for some who should know enough to shun the impossible goal of a total military victory.\n83.\tThe solution of this problem should be sought and found at the peace table. The peace talks, however, have reached a deadlock despite a wealth of concrete proposals, the most comprehensive of them being the recent seven point proposal. What is lacking is a definite commitment to an early withdrawal of foreign troops. Outside interference should cease in that region and the Viet-Namese and other Indo-Chinese people should be left free to chart their ways of life by themselves in peace and independence.\n84.\tThe Middle East situation carries the risk of a war involving major Powers directly. We have the regime of a fragile cease-fire there, thanks mainly to the efforts of the United States over a year ago. But developments, including the growing arms build-up on both sides5 threaten the outbreak of fresh conflicts. The efforts of the Security Council have been virtually stalemated, and the situation is fast worsening.\n85.\tIt is almost four years since the adoption of resolution 242 (1967) by the Security Council. Despite the fact that the resolution commands almost universal support and contains the most practical framework for a peaceful settlement, the prospects for peace remain as bleak as ever. In our view, resolution 242 (1967) presupposes a willingness on the part of both sides to abide by the principles and the conditions laid down in it, including those concerning withdrawal and security guanntees, as well as a willingness to work out a solution by themselves on the basis of that resolution, with the help and assistance of the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Ambassador Jarring. It has established a mechanism for negotiations.\n86.\tThe tool of the United Nations in the person of Ambassador Jarring was, and still is, at the disposal of the parties. His services have not so far been fruitfully utilized. It is in this context that my delegation welcomes the recent initiative of the Organization of African Unity which is designed to supplement the efforts of the Security Council. The four African Heads of State carry with them the best\nwishes of my mission.\n87.\tA critical situation arising out of the recent domestic events in East Pakistan has developed in another part of Asia. The people and the Government of Nepal have been deeply moved by the great human tragedy taking place in our neighborhood. The tragedy is of an unprecedented magnitude, and it has reopened old problems and generated new ones. We share the view expressed by the Secretary-General that those problems, in their totality, are of common concern to the international community [Af 8401/Add.l, para. 177]. The containment and amelioration of the situation require understanding and compassion and, above all, statesmanship of the highest order.\n88.\tMy Government is aware of the social and economic implications to India of having to confront the problems of the millions of refugees who have crossed the border. In meeting the burdens imposed by these problems, India, true to its humanitarian tradition, has been valiant and generous. The economic and other strains on India are indeed very heavy.\n89.\tThe Secretary-General has initiated and mounted relief measures to bring humanitarian assistance to the refugees in India and the affected people in East Pakistan. We welcome and support these measures, which deserve wider support by the membership of the United Nations. At the same time, my Government recognizes the need to create conditions for the return of the refugees to their homes.\n90.\tThe situation in southern Africa continues to be a source of potential world conflict. In recent years, the pace of decolonization has not only slowed down, it has come to a halt. The worst forms of colonialism and racial discrimination prevail in southern Africa. The situation in Namibia, in the Territories under Portuguese administration, in Southern Rhodesia and in South Africa make a mockery of the principles of self-determination and human rights and fundamental freedoms. They generate intolerable racial tension.\n91.\tSo far, most of the major Powers which are permanent members of the Security Council have either failed or refused to comprehend their special responsibility as regards this situation. But we deem it essential that the interests of the major Powers be fully engaged if the problem of southern Africa is to be peacefully resolved. Only at our own peril will we continue to overlook the grave threat to peace arising out of colonial and racial repression in the African continent.\n92.\tThe existence of acute crises and critical situations in many areas of the world emphasizes the necessity of strengthening the role of the United Nations in the maintenance and preservation of world peace, and in ensuring the full operational capacity of the Organization. We in Nepal view the United Nations both as an ideal of peace and as an instrument for peace. My delegation has given constant support to all measures aimed at promoting the United Nations both as an ideal and as an instrument. We regard the adoption at the last session of the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXVj] to be one of those measures, and gave it our full support.\n93.\tHowever, it seems that we have not been as forth-\tSecond United Nations Development Decade [resolution coming in our financial support of the Organization. An insolvent organization cannot function on a day-to-day  basis, let alone perform its central task which is, in our case, the the maintenance of peace. The Secretary-General has sounded the waning that, unless some serious measures are\ttaken by Member States to solve the financial crisis, the viability of the Organization would come to an end in the not too distant future. My delegation is looking for a significant breakthrough in this regard. It is also equally\tproclaimed that an agreement be reached soon on the\tguidelines for future United Nations peace-keeping operations. \n94.\tIn the great human endeavor to keep the peace,\tdisarmament is first and foremost. Indeed, disarmament is an inevitable condition for a lasting peace. The progress towards disarmament, however, has been slow and arduous.\t\n95.-\tLast February, my Government signed the Treaty on\tthe Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and\tthe Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof (resolution  2660 XXV annex). We have been encouraged by the progress achieved at Geneva concerning a draft convention banning biological and toxin weapons, but we consider that this this should be coupled with, or followed very soon by, an\tagreement banning chemical weapons as well. We fully support the recent agreements signed by the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union and the United States on the\tmodernization of the existing hot-line link between\tMoscow and Washington and on a common procedure for\tthe prevention of an accidental outbreak of nuclear war\t between the two nuclear giants. The importance of these measures is that they create an atmosphere of confidence which, in turn, will lead to more substantive agreement or agreements on the limitation of strategic arms.\t\n96.\tTo our great disappointment, no agreement on the\tbanning of underground nuclear tests has been possible,\ndespite the fact that there is no technical obstacle in the\tway of such an agreement. Regardless of world public\nopinion, major nuclear Powers persist in the qualitative\ndevelopment of their nuclear weapons.\t\n97.\tThe arms race continues. Not only does it consume\thundreds of billions of dollars each year, but it poses an inherent danger to all nations, nuclear and non-nuclear, rich and poor, large and small. It is a matter affecting one and all. We should all continue, without exception, in our\t efforts to remove this basic threat to the very survival of mankind. To that end, my delegation has always urged the convening of-a world disarmament conference, a conference in which all nations of the world, including the divided ones, should be invited to participate. It is with great\npleasure, therefore, that my Government supports the spirit of the Soviet proposal in this regard [A/L.631].\t\n98.\tAt the last session of the General Assembly, we\t adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second UNited Nations Development Decade (resolution 2626 XXV). The strategy provides a broad indication of the scope of international cooperation during the Decade. It calls on the developing countries to approach the problems of development in a planned way, and at the same time it defines the obligations of the developed industrial countries in the matter of international development. In keeping with the spirit of the international strategy and as a matter of national economic policy, my GOvernent has proclaimed the 1970s to be a development decade of Nepal. Our current five-year plan envisages a high growth rate in terms of industrial and agricultural productivity and the expansion and diversification of our trade. We have also concentrated our efforts on the development of human resources in such a way as to secure a balance between the social and economic development of the country. \n\n99 The international development strategy recognizes the vital link between international peace and international development and social justice. This strategy cannot be an unrelated endeavor of the United Nations. But despite the adoption of the Strategy last year, developing countries in general continue to face difficulties in the way on their  planned economic development, because of the prospects of an over-all decrease in external assistance and the growing tendency towards tougher trade barriers. In this situation, the problem of the developing landlocked countries, which are, by an large, the least developed among the developing ones, are compounded by their physical distance from the sea. These countries cannot meaningfully participate in international trade and development if they do not receive adequate guarantees for their right of three access to the sea and unrestricted overland transit in international practice and conventions. In their review and appraisal of the progress achieved in the attainment of the goals set out in the International Strategy, the General Assembly and any machinery to be created for that purpose should not overlook the problems of the least developed countries. \n\n100 The interdependence of the world has been dramatically emphasized by the recent world monetary crisis. We do not wish to ascribe blame for this crisis to any country, but we feel that the recent events have not only had a damaging impact on world production and international trade, but also have created a crisis of confidence among nations by tearing down the long-established system. \n\n101 The national measures which have led to the present crisis are, in addition severely hampering the growth process of several developing countries. Any prolongation of monetary instability will impose more serious hardship on the developing countries than on the developed ones, because the capacity of the latter to withstand and adjust to occasional constraints is greater than that of the former.  Only co-operative endeavors coupled with the lifting of restrictive national measures and the realignment of currencies will enable the world to overcome the crisis. Any new arrangement for a steadier world monetary system should be geared to a more dynamic concept of world trade and development.  \n\n102 In our cautious, often methodical, but always slow approach, to world problems- problems of peace and security, development and social justice, and the preservation and exploration of the physical and marine environment we run the risk of being outstripped by events, whether caused by unilateral national action or by scientific and technological breakthroughs. In this world of interdependence and instant communication, these problems cannot be confined either to national boundaries or to ideological barriers, nor can they be tackled successfully at the national level. The projected United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and the conference on the law of the sea are timely responses on the part of the United Nations to the problem of reconciling the development needs of mankind with the need for preserving our physical and marine environment. The outcome of the conferences will show how far we have learned to harness the forces of science and technology for our common good. These conferences might build up new forms of international co-operation. The United Nations should always remain capable of dealing with such problems swiftly and decisively, always taking into consideration the interests and views of all Member States. However important these questions are, we must never lose sight of the fact that the primary and central task of the United Nations is the maintenance of . peace. This Organization is the only political and diplomatic instrument available to the family of nations for that purpose. We in Nepal therefore feel that our overriding concern should be the preserving and strengthening of the United Nations as a viable instrument for peace.\n103.\tAs I come to the close of my statement, I should like, on behalf of my Government, to pay a special tribute to U Thant for his service to the United Nations during the last particularly trying and difficult 10 years. He has served the United Nations with unmatched devotion and at great personal sacrifice. He has given the United Nations a leadership which has been the source of pride to my Government. As our Secretary-General he is involved in the cause of peace so deeply that in my country, as I am sure in other countries, he has come to be identified completely with the United Nations itself. By behavior and deed and by thought and action, he has symbolized in his person the lofty aims and objectives of the Charter. A devout Buddhist, he has lived up fully to the message of peace, compassion and tolerance, the message given to the world by the Prince of Peace, Gautama Siddhartha, over 2,500 years ago. Although he has denied the role himself, U Thant has nevertheless become the symbol of the moral conscience of mankind. We have all read his personal reflections on the 10 years of his service to the international community and have been greatly moved by the profound dedication which he has brought to his task. Indeed, no one can fail to be so moved by the deep personal commitment of U Thant to the cause of peace and justice in the world. My Government respects his wish to retire at the end of his current term, but we in Nepal are all confident that, should his services be needed in the cause of peace, he will not hesitate to place the welfare and well-being of the international community above his own. My Government would very much like him to stay for the time being as Secretary-General, but in whatever capacity he remains he will always be a moral guide and a source of inspiration to us.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n27.\t  Mr. President, your unanimous election to the presidency of this annual session of the United Nations General Assembly is a just tribute to your ability and to your merits. It is a personal honor to you, Sir, as well as an honor to your great country, whose stability and wise policies elicit our sincere admiration. My delegation is all the more pleased at your election since we have been able on several occasions to appreciate your efforts on behalf of peace and the various initiatives you have promoted in order to achieve or restore peace. We therefore congratulate you most sincerely and wish you all success in your task.\n28.\tIn congratulating you, Sir, my delegation also wishes to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro, for the positive contribution which he made in the difficult task of presiding over the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n29.\tThere is another duty which my delegation performs enthusiastically each year: that of reiterating our great respect and admiration for our SecretaryGeneral, U Thant, whose tireless efforts for peace have been manifest throughout the ten years that he hap been guiding this great Organization.\n30.\tMy delegation comes to this twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly with somewhat more hope than in past years. It is true that the great problems of the world are still far from settled. Universal peace has not yet been restored, and the clash of arms has not yet been stilled in certain parts of the world. The progress achieved during the past year, while somewhat slight, has nevertheless been encouraging and leads us to feel that new and positive developments may be achieved and that a better international climate of discussion and negotiation may come about.\n31.\tAmongst the encouraging signs which gratify all those who aspire to peace and security and who quite often are innocent victims of the hostility of others is the prospect of a normalization of the relations between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China.\n32.\tThe Kingdom of Laos, an immediate neighbor of China, welcomes the visit that the President of the United States plans to make to Peking. Regardless of the subjects that may be discussed and the results that may be attained, we wish to add our humble voice in expressing the hope that those conversations will promote an international relaxation and will help to restore peace in that area.\n33.\tAnother encouraging event which in the opinion of my delegation might well promote more positive developments is the long awaited atmosphere of tranquility and realism that prevails during discussion of the admission of a great country to this Organization namely, the People's Republic of China. We believe that there is a general feeling that this debate will produce a positive result rather than an atmosphere of ostracism and confusion. Regardless of the positions that have been taken in the past, it is better not to recall points of past divergence, but rather to lay emphasis on the present relaxation of tensions and to build for the future for, indeed, this event can no longer be postponed. The main characteristic of our Organization is its universality and, as everyone is aware, that objective can never be attained so long as the 700 million people of China do not participate in its work. This gap is all the more significant, since that country and people not only have the inherent right to have a voice in international affairs, but our Organization can make great progress only if that country and people acting in respect for the Charter and Member States agree to cooperate sincerely and loyally with the United Nations. This people has a rich cultural heritage and a vast country of great possibilities. Their achievements deserve our respect and admiration. Of this my Government and delegation are firmly convinced.\n34.\tAt the appropriate time, therefore, we will state our support for the admission of the People's Republic of China to our Organization. In accordance with the considerations I have just mentioned, and in harmony with the spirit which prompts us, we would hope that that country would occupy a permanent seat in the Security Council.\n35.\tIn speaking of the universality of the United Nations, my delegation is gratified at the admission this year to the United Nations, by unanimous votes, of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar. On this memorable occasion I should like to extend to those three new Member States the warm and sincere congratulations of the Royal Government of Laos, and assure their delegations that my delegation will always be ready to cooperate with them in our common task and in harmony with the spirit of our Charter.\n36.\tIt is true that violence is very often contagious, and that peace is indivisible. The sparks of one conflict may well cause conflagrations elsewhere. The settlement of one conflict always has a favorable effect on general relaxation. Bearing that in mind, the world has taken note of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971, which makes it possible for a settlement to be reached on the status of the city of Berlin, whose citizens have seen their rights and hopes jeopardized for so long by the \\\"cold war\\\" theory. We trust that this agreement will lead to the neutralization of that sensitive point of confrontation of different blocs and different ideologies.\n37.\tAgainst that positive background we might also mention the signing of the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Means of Mass Destruction on the Seabed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof (resolution 2660 (XXV)]. The sea is an element of particular importance for life on our planet, It is for that reason that the constitutional organs of Lac* have immediately proceeded to ratify that Treaty so as to expedite its entry into force and its implementation.\n38.\tAll those positive events which I have mentioned, despite their great number and importance, should not divert our attention from the vast task which remains to be accomplished. There are still armed conflicts both open and latent which continue to afflict the world or to threaten a delicate balance. There are the universally recognized principles whose application has been rejected or ignored by certain States for their own selfish interests. And there are also resolutions which have been adopted after ripe reflection which have not been implemented. There are still millions >of people who have been denied self-determination and the fulfillment of their longing for freedom. Colonialism and apartheid have not disappeared, although at each session of the General Assembly these items are included in the agenda.\n39.\tIn the Middle East, despite collective persevering efforts, unfortunately it is not yet possible to see a sure way to peace and mutual tolerance. Without wishing to offend any of the parties, we would hope that this question could be settled having regard for the existence of both the old as well as the new communities of that region. So much remains to be done in that area to promote progress for the peoples who live there, that their friendly collaboration becomes a necessity. Over and above the vituperation, the pooling of technology and the harnessing of goodwill would make the region once again a land of milk and honey and cause roses to bloom again in a vale once blessed by God.\n40.\tOur views are the same with respect to the problems that affect another area of Asia. In Laos we have followed with anxiety and compassion the massive exodus of people. We understand their misfortune, since one fifth of our own population has the status of refugees. The crisis now seems to be subsiding and it is fortunate that this is so.\n41.\tIn IndoChina the war afflicting that area for several decades is not yet near an end. It will not end as long as the Democratic Republic of VietNam, supported materially and morally by powerful States, does not abandon its desire for expansion and hegemony. A ray of hope has just appeared; we hope that it will be followed by results and that the forthcoming SinoAmerican negotiations will bear fruit and prevent a return to the unfortunate historical past.\n42.\tRegardless of the new order that may be agreed upon by the negotiators, it is important that the countries of that region be heard on any policy which involves their sovereignty, individuality, development, traditions and legitimate aspirations.\n43.\tThe Kingdom of Laos, whose neutrality has been solemnly declared and guaranteed, convinced as it is of the tightness of its choice of nonalignment and peaceful coexistence, bears no part of the responsibility for the IndoChinese conflict. To be more precise, it has no part in the VietNamese conflict, because it was in VietNam that the conflagration began. But my country has undergone, and continues to suffer from, the repercussions of that conflict, not to mention the insults that have been directed at us in the slanderous propaganda which in certain countries has been raised to the status of a national institution.\n44.\tThe party responsible for the paradoxical situation in Laos is the Democratic Republic of VietNam and that country alone. By indoctrinating the Pathet Lao dissidents and b y committing the crime of arming them, that country has turned the Pathet Lao into a group of rebels against the Royal Government and has prevented them from negotiating a settlement with our Government so long as their nefarious objectives are not achieved. When hopes for a reconciliation with the Pathet Lao appear, such hopes are immediately dashed by the dictatorial attitude of their North VietNamese protectors.\n45.\tIt is North VietNam which has demanded that the Pathet Lao ministers should leave their seats in our Government for fear that their integration into a national community might deprive North VietNam of accomplices and means of coercion.\n46.\tThe Royal Government over which I have presided for more than 10 years sincerely wishes a reconciliation with the Pathet Lao. The seats in our Government which their ministers have abandoned are still vacant. They can reoccupy them at any time. Personally;, I have never ceased to make the Pathet Lao offers of negotiation, provided such negotiations are not accompanied by prearranged conditions, exceptions, or declarations which border on ultimate,\n47.\tAt this very moment I can assure the Assembly that the representatives of my Government are ready to meet representatives of the Pathet Lao anywhere in order to begin concrete negotiations.\n48.\tTo demonstrate the full extent of our sincerity I have even offered and I reiterate this offer to neutralize the Plaine des Jarres as soon as those negotiat'ons begin and thus to assure the Democratic Republic of VistNam, which attaches so much importance to that are?, that the Plaine des Jarres will not be used to harbor bases which may threaten its security.\n49.\tLaos has never departed from its positive policy of strict neutrality and good neighborliness. At the time of the onset of the Lanson 719 operation, the Royal Government, in a solemn declaration, condemned without exception all those who, exploiting its military weakness, had deliberately chosen to use its territory as a battle field. However, it must also be observed that the primary responsibility for this lies with the Democratic Republic of VietNam, for indeed, were it not for the illegal presence of its troops in Lacs, the United States and South VietNamese forces would, in all likelihood, never have entered the area.\n50.\tFor more than two decades the Democratic Republic of VietNam has waged war in Laos and has fomented disturbances there. Recent events show that it has even begun an escalation of these activities.\n51.\tIn that context, the attack against LouangPrabang last March shows the true intentions of the Democratic Republic of VietNam with respect to Laos. It was the political regime, the constitutional foundation of Laos itself, which was the objective of the attack on the Royal City. And by threatening the life of His Majesty the King who resides there, the Democratic Republic of VietNam is trying to destroy the permanence of our kingdom and the very substance of our national existence.\n52.\tThis challenge by the Democratic Republic of VietNam has reached its highest point at the present time. In February 1971 it publicly congratulated its soldiers who were fighting in Laos, which shows that it is deliberately flouting international law and international agreements.\n53.\tIt is high time to end these iniquitous acts, which undermine the very basis of international life, to end the . aggression and wrongs of all kinds committed by the Democratic Republic of VietNam against Laos.\n54.\tIt is imperative for all international bodies which are mindful of the need for peaceful coexistence and for the signatories to the Geneva agreements who are responsible for their application, to decide at last to assume their fundamental responsibility.\n55.\tThis is the wish, this is the appeal that the Royal Government and people of Laos make to the world. May these exhortations be headed!\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "132.\tMr, President, may I, on behalf of our delegation, congratulate you on your election to the high post of President of this session of the General Assembly and express our confidence that you will discharge your high responsibilities successfully,\n133.\tWe should also like to express our profound respect for the Secretary-General of the United Nations who is making great efforts, which we all appreciate, to turn our Organization into a genuine instrument for the peace and security of peoples,\n134.\tWe are living in an age of immense historical change. The peoples who are building socialism and communism, the peoples who have freed themselves or are now freeing themselves from colonialism and national and social oppression, and the peace-loving and democratic forces of all countries are now exercising a decisive influence on the whole course of world development. And of course there is hardly a single Government which would not take this into account to some extent in its approach to international affairs.\n135.\tSince the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the various trends in the foreign policies of States have become more pronounced. Yet the predominant trend which has been reflected in the debates at this session is the striving for a relaxation of international tension on the basis of the peaceful coexistence of States having different social systems.\n136.\tThe consistently peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is contributing increasingly to the normalization of the international climate. The foreign policy program of peace and friendship between peoples, which was announced at the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has become a document of genuine world-wide significance. It is both wide in scope and realistic in its approach, and its implementation will promote the solution of urgent topical problems in the interests of a further relaxation of tension and the establishment of a stable and lasting peace.\n137.\tThis program, which was welcomed warmly by the people of the Ukraine, has confirmed the steadfast determination of our country to persist in its foreign policy line aimed at peaceful coexistence, the solution of difficult problems through negotiations, and at the same time the repulsing of aggression wherever it may occur.\n138.\tThe practical measures taken by the socialist countries on behalf of the whole world bear witness to the fact that they are strictly and unswervingly fulfilling their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and in the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV fj). \n139.\tIn our opinion the primary task of the United Nations and all States at this time is to implement the provisions of the Declaration and thus help to attain the main objective of the United Nations, to ensure universal peace and security. This means, first and foremost, to halt aggression as soon as possible and restore peace where it has been disrupted.\n140.\tIn voting for the Declaration, the Members of the United Nations have solemnly reaffirmed that it is their duty to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of any other State, and that the territory of a State shall not be the object of military occupation.\n141.\tIt is only natural that the overwhelming majority of delegations, in their statements during the general debate, should have devoted so much attention to imperialist aggression in Indo-China.\n142.\tThe real objectives of the United States in that region have, of course, been clear to many from the very outset. But the well-known developments of recent months have finally exposed the falsifications that have used the umbrella of anti-communism as a cover for aggression. How appropriate, in this context, are the words of the great Lenin, that in the capitalist world \\\"the most important questions of war and peace and the problems of diplomacy are decided by an insignificant handful of capitalists, who deceive not only the masses, but often deceive Parliament too\\\".\n143.\tThe determination of the peoples of Indo-China, struggling for their legitimate right to determine their own fate, is unswerving. Their resolve cannot be shaken by further military provocation, even by the massive bombing of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam which occurred literally a few hours before the beginning of this session of the General Assembly. Every act of this kind only serves to strengthen opposition to the aggressor.\n144.\tNor will the attempts of the ruling circles in the United States to achieve their objectives through maneuvering behind the backs of the peoples who are fighting for their independence or through new and widely publicized diplomatic activity meet with success.\n145.\tThe only realistic way for the United States to get out of the impasse which it has itself created is to withdraw its troops immediately and to halt the aggression. A constructive and reasonable basis for a solution to the Viet-Nam problem is to be found in the new seven-point program of the Provisional Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam, which has been welcomed by world public opinion and the Governments of many countries.\n146.\tThe Ukrainian SSR will continue to participate in the efforts of the socialist States to provide effective support and assistance to the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and will consistently and resolutely side with the liberation movements in South Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia.\n147.\tIn order to improve the situation on the Asian continent, particularly in the Far East, the United Nations must put an end to the interference in the internal affairs of Korea under cover of its flag.\n148.\tThe withdrawal of United States and other foreign troops from South Korea and the dissolution, of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea are what is required now. Guided by this principle, the delegation of the Ukraine has once again co-sponsored the relevant proposals on matters relating to Korea. It is with regret that we note that a decision to postpone consideration of these matters until the next session has been Imposed on the Assembly. This has been done under the pretext of promoting the contacts recently established between the Red Cross organizations of North and South Korea. Yet the withdrawal of foreign troops and the dissolution of the aforementioned Commission would not only not hinder, but would in fact promote, mutual understanding and easier contacts between the two parts of this divided country.\n149.\tThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in a statement issued by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, strongly condemned the removal of these two items from this session's agenda and insisted that the United Nations should immediately take steps to ensure the withdrawal from South Korea of the aggressive forces of United States imperialism which have been occupying South Korea under cover of the United Nations flag, and dissolve the so-called United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. That is the opinion of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n150.\tAs many speakers here have already pointed out, one task of primary importance is to eliminate the hotbed of military tension in the Middle East whose continuous smoldering threatens to escalate into a major conflagration.\n151.\tFor over four years, Israel, relying on United States support, has been sabotaging the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) refusing to withdraw its troops from the occupied Arab territories, conducting a planned policy of \\\"developing\\\" these territories, or, in other words, openly annexing them, and provoking an aggravation of tension in the region. Ruling circles in Israel disregard United Nations decisions, reject the peaceful proposals made by the Arab countries, and paralyse the efforts of the United Nations, its Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Ambassador Jarring, to achieve a peaceful settlement in the Middle East.\n152.\t'\tIn order to attain its objectives, Israel and its protectors resort to all possible means in order to undermine the unity of the Arab nations and weaken their resolve to eliminate the consequences of aggression.\n153.\tIn order to divert attention from their expansionist policy and also in order to ensure financial, military and political support in the future, the Israeli leaders have launched anti-Soviet and anti-Arab campaigns through Zionist lobbies in a number of Western countries, in particular the United States. In the course of these campaigns, diplomatic missions have been subjected to acts of provocation and hooliganism that are incompatible with the elementary norms of civilized society.\n154.\tOf course, it is common knowledge that Israel's policy would not be so defiant if it did not enjoy the support of, in particular, the United States of America. It is characteristic of the situation that there is such a distribution of roles between Washington and Tel Aviv. While the Israeli agrees, rs are developing the territories they have seized, United States ruling circles are covering up the aggressor's acts by diplomatic maneuvers and claiming that they are playing a self-styled role as peacemakers while in actual fact they are encouraging the aggressor.\n155.\tThe representative of Israel, speaking from this rostrum a few days ago [1946th meeting], was so generous in his \\\"peace-loving\\\" attitude that he suggested as many as five ways that he alleged would lead to peace. But he omitted one way, the most direct and the surest way to peace in this region, namely the one contained in the well-known Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967.\n156.\tBut time is not working in favor of the aggressor. The legitimate struggle of the Arab peoples for the return of the lands occupied in June 1967 is gaining increasing support throughout the world and at the United Nations. Their political, economic and military position is improving. The Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation recently concluded between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic, signed at Cairo on 27 May 1971, strengthens the position of the Arab countries and is an important factor for peace in this region.\n157.\tThe Ukrainian SSR supports the just cause of the Arab peoples and feels that the United Nations and all its Members should take every opportunity, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, to force Israel to reach a peaceful and just political settlement of the Middle East conflict as soon as possible, and withdraw its troops from all occupied Arab territories.\n158.\tDuring the general debate at the Assembly, many delegations have remarked on the favorable trend towards a detente on the continent of Europe, the importance of which extends beyond the boundaries of Europe and exerts a considerable influence on the fate of peace and security throughout the world.\n159.\tHistory reminds us that in our time, in the lifetime of a single generation, two world wars have broken out in Europe. As we all know, those wars took over 70 million human lives, 50 million of them in the Second World War,\n160.\tThe Soviet Ukraine, which lost many millions of lives in the war unleashed by Hitler's Germany, has a vital stake in the strengthening of European and international security. Expressing the will of our people, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine, Mr. Peter Efimovich Shelest, declared in a statement on 23\nJune 1971 to the youth of Kiev: \\\"The most important, the most rewarding and the most noble task we have to do, in the name of the countless victims, and to ensure the happiness of all people and of future generations, is to prevent a repetition of the tragedy of the past. We must build a really durable peace that will last for many years and many decades.\\\"\n161.\tThe people and Government of the Ukraine welcome the fact that there is growing trust and mutual understanding between European countries. Proof of this can be seen in the expansion of friendly co-operation between the Soviet Union and France and in the development of mutually advantageous relations between the socialist countries and many countries in Western Europe. We think it reasonable that the detente in our continent is based on the recognition of European realities, namely the inviolability of the present frontiers and the existence of two German States. The conclusion of treaties with the , - :ai Republic of Germany by the Soviet Union  and the * People's Republic,  and the four-Power agreement ^n matters relating to West Berlin  give hope for the future of Europe.\n162.\tThe peace-loving policy of the German Democratic Republic is actively promoting the establishment of a reliable system of European security. The realities of our time confirm-as an ever growing number of States are realizing-that a durable peace on the continent of Europe without the participation of the German Democratic Republic is inconceivable.\n163.\tThe idea of collective security, which through the initiative of the socialist countries has taken the form of a specific political program, is commanding ever wider support. The proposal of the socialist countries for the convening of an all-European conference is based on the current situation on the continent and the fundamental interests and aspirations of all European peoples. No one disputes the usefulness of convening such a conference in principle; its tasks are clear, and there are no objections as to who should participate in it.\n164.\tAll the preconditions now exist for proceeding to specific preparations for such a conference..\n165.\tThe Ukrainian SSR supports the idea of convening such a conference and believes that, given the goodwill of the participants, it can do a great deal to strengthen European security and to expand co-operation in the economic, trade, scientific, technical and cultural fields on a basis of equality and mutual benefit.\n166.\tWhile we feel optimistic about the future of Europe, we are not forgetting that there are certain circles which are impeding a detente by resorting to far-fetched pretexts and even to provocative action, as has been seen lately in some countries. Naturally the danger posed by the forces of revanchism and militarism to the process of normalizing the situation in Europe cannot be discounted.\n167.\tHowever, it is not those forces which are now determining the state of affairs on the European continent. The necessary conditions for the establishment of genuine collective security and a stable peace do exist here. It is the duty of the Governments and peoples of all European countries to translate the existing possibilities into realities. This requires increased efforts in the search for a stable and lasting peace in this region, which in its turn would promote the strengthening of universal peace.\n168.\tIt is hardly necessary to prove that the path to a lasting and secure peace on our planet lies through general and complete disarmament. The problem of disarmament has been discussed in the United Nations literally from the earliest days of its existence, and it is not the fault of the socialist countries that the progress achieved in this sphere has been far less than the interests of the strengthening of the security of peoples require. Rhetoric, unsupported by action, will not build a durable peace or establish relations of trust between countries, A constructive approach and a desire to co-operate and seek mutually acceptable solutions to the disarmament problems under discussion are essential.\n169.\tLong experience of disarmament negotiations shows that delays in finding solutions to questions related to the halting of the arms race inevitably lead to more difficulties. It is essential to intensify negotiations on general and complete disarmament and at the same time reach agreement on partial disarmament measures.\n170.\tIn this context, the important new initiative taken by the Soviet Government on the convening of a world disarmament conference with the participation of all States of the world is particularly timely. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Mr. Andrei Andreevich Gromyko, has spoken of this emphatically and convincingly in his statement here at the 1942nd meeting. We are firmly convinced that a world disarmament conference would hasten agreement on urgent major disarmament questions. Although some people here have been skeptical about the idea of convening such a conference, it is clear that the idea is gaining increasing support.\n171.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR welcomes the fact that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has completed its work on the draft convention on the prohibition, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction [AI8457-DC/234, annex A], An agreement to prohibit biological weapons will be another valuable step forward in disarmament. Our delegation feels that at this session, the General Assembly, in approving the above-mentioned Convention, could also call upon all States to find a solution as soon as possible to the question of prohibiting chemical weapons and, to this end, to refrain from any acts that might hamper the conclusion of agreement on this issue.\n172.\tThe advance towards the final elimination of colonialism is irreversible. But the imperialist forces and international monopolies are not abandoning the attempt to stifle the national liberation movement. They are seeking to perpetuate the rule of the colonialists primarily in southern Africa and to resuscitate that rule in overt and covert forms.\n173.\tThe President of Mauritania, Mr. Ould Daddah, speaking on behalf of the Organization of African Unity, drew the attention of our Assembly [1938th meeting] to the urgent problems of Africa and particularly to the pressing hoed for the total liberation of the continent, the struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination. The President called the remaining colonies in African territory \\\"lands that are still occupied\\\", thus emphasizing the fact that colonialism poses a constant threat to peace and security in that continent.\n174.\tMore than 15 per cent of the territory of Africa has been turned into a colonial preserve. Over 30 million Africans are suffering from exploitation, racism, apartheid and other inhuman forms of colonialism. Slave-like conditions are maintained in the colonies in order to secure vast profits for the monopolies of the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other Western States.\n175.\tThe peoples living in the southern part of the African continent have in fact come up against a particular kind of collective colonialism, against a conspiracy to which not only South Africa, Rhodesia and Portugal but also the United Kingdom, the United States and some of their NATO allies are parties. In the last year alone, the investments of international imperialist monopolies in the economy of South Africa amounted to $1,000 million. Portugal's colonial wars against the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), the systematic acts of aggression against Guinea and Senegal, the violation by the United Kingdom and other Western countries of the United Nations embargo on deliveries of weapons to the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia and the expansion of trade and economic co-operation with those countries, the attempts to impose a \\\"dialog\\\" with the racists of southern Africa all these are individual links in a single chain which is to be used to strangle the national liberation movement of the peoples.\n176.\tThe repeated violations by the colonialists of the sovereignty of independent States are proof that until there is not a single colonial regime left in the African continent, until all the colonialists' troops and military bases are withdrawn from this region, the peaceful and independent development of African States will be threatened.\n177.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR fully supports the just struggle of the peoples against colonialism, racism and apartheid. We think that today the need for the full implementation of the anti-colonial decisions of the United Nations by all its Members is as urgent as ever. Our Organization should promote increased support for the national liberation struggle and should hasten the approach of the day when the last colonial regime will be buried for ever in the graveyard of history.\n178.\tThe peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America are faced with the critical problem of ensuring their economic independence. The Western Powers, which forcibly chained the economies of many of the now liberated countries to their own, are thrusting on them the additional burden resulting from the instability of the capitalist economic world. The developing countries are acutely sensitive to the periodic recessions and instability and the crisis phenomena and monetary inflationary processes which are inherent in the capitalist system.\n179.\tAs a result of the policy of neo-colonialism, the foreign indebtedness of the developing countries exceeds $60,000 million. For example, in Latin America 87 per cent of the new loans is now being used to pay off debts from previous loans, while in Africa the figure is 75 per cent and in eastern Asia it is over 50 per cent. Payments for so-called aid from Western Powers have risen during the first Development Decade more than three times as fast as the output of the gross national product and more than twice as fast as the export earnings of the developing countries.\n180.\tIt is the fault of the Western countries that the principles of international trade approved by the first session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have not been applied. The Western States continue to adhere to restricted trade groupings and to discriminate against other countries.\n181.\tIn the opinion of the Ukrainian delegation, specific measures should be taken at this session to ensure the application of progressive principles in international trade and economic co-operation, without discrimination and on the basis of mutual benefit.\n182.\tWe understand the actions of those developing countries which, in order to affirm their economic independence, are making fundamental social and economic changes, asking the colonialists to pay compensation for the age-old exploitation and plunder of their national wealth, taking into their own hands control of their national resources, nationalizing the most important branches of their economies and demanding an end to the continuing looting of the developing countries by imperialist monopolies.\n183.\tIn keeping with its international duty, the Ukrainian SSR will continue to make its contribution to the general efforts of the Soviet Union and the States in the socialist community to help developing countries to establish their own economies and develop their own cultures.\n184.\tLet me just remind you that our Republic exports industrial equipment and other goods to over 60 developing countries. Ukrainian specialists are participating in the construction of 190 industrial enterprises and cultural projects in various parts of the world. Over 3,000 young people from Asia, Africa and Latin America are studying at - higher educational institutions in the Republic.\n185.\tThe Ukraine maintains scientific and technical links with 60 countries in the world. Every year over 500 Ukrainian scientists travel to other countries to exchange experience with foreign colleagues on various aspects of science and technology. In turn the Ukraine welcomes over 1,000 foreign experts and scientists every year. The Ukrainian SSR also gives technical assistance to developing countries on a multilateral basis, through the United Nations Development program.\n186.\tThe international situation does not give us reason to feel complacent or satisfied. The United Nations must intensify its efforts to strengthen peace and security. It is only on this basis that we can successfully solve problems in the economic, social and other fields.\n187.\tThe achieving of real universality in the United Nations would be of great significance in further enhancing its authority and effectiveness. We are glad to see that the majority of States Members of the United Nations support this approach. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR is in favor of the immediate admission to the United Nations of the two German States, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.\n188.\tThe restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is long overdue, although some States have only recognized this more than 20 years too late. In so doing, some individual countries, in particular the United States of America, are trying to keep the Chiang Kai-shek delegation, which represents nobody, as a Member of the United Nations and for that purpose they advance one argument, among others, relating to the fact that the Ukraine and Byelorussia are Members of the United Nations. The logic of such comparisons reminds us of the logic of a well-known Ukrainian proverb which runs something like this: \\\"This man can't tell the Crimea from Rome or either from a priest's bald dome\\\".\n189.\tNow can you compare the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist State, which was created in 1917 by the free will of its people and voluntarily joined the mighty federation of the new socialist type formed in 1922 by previously oppressed peoples-the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to part of the territory which legitimately belongs to China and which was forcibly torn away from it by the Chiang Kai-shek clique with the support of the imperialists? The international legal personality of the Ukraine is affirmed in the Constitution of our Republic and the Constitution of the Soviet Union and is recognized in international law. Those who resort to such comparisons do so, not because they are ignorant people, but because they recognize the weakness of their \\\"two Chinas\\\" policy in whatever form it is presented and try to use completely untenable arguments.\n190.\tIn conclusion I should like to say that every State Member of the United Nations must make a maximum contribution to the solution of all problems facing the United Nations. The Ukrainian SSR, as always, will be among those which will spare no effort to strengthen peace and security, to rebuff the forces of aggression, and to combat colonialism and racism; it will be among those which favor active international co-operation in all areas.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "66.\t Mr. President, on behalf of the Romanian delegation and on my own behalf, may I offer you our sincere congratulations on your election to this important post and express the conviction that under your guidance the work of this session will be crowned with success.\n67.\tAt the same time, I should like to express the thanks of the Romanian delegation in the outgoing President, Mr. Edvard Hambro, who, by his tact, skill and good humor contributed so much to the work of the last session.\n68.\tI should like also to take this opportunity to express again to the Secretary-General of the United Nations U Thant our deep respect and our great appreciation of his untiring activities in the service of the United Nations, of understanding and co-operation among peoples, of peace and of security in the world.\n69.\tWe also address our congratulations to the new Member States which at this session have joined the great family of the United Nations.\n70.\tThe work of our session is being followed with * attention by the peoples of the entire world, which are aware that the items on the agenda concern their vital interests and the prospects for the development of mankind on the road of peace and progress; they rightly expect results. Our debates and the decisions we are going to take can make valuable contribution to the historical mission of the United Nations, to the extent that we all demonstrate the necessary political will and take into account the legitimate aspirations of the peoples, the realities of today and those of tomorrow. For its part the Romanian delegation, acting on the instructions of its Government, will do its utmost to ensure that the present session achieves as much as possible.\n71.\tThe participation of the Socialist Republic of Romania in international life and its position on the major problems of the modern world flow from a careful analysis of the realities and the phenomena of our time which reveal unprecedented changes, the expression of the broad and uninterrupted confrontation between the old and the new of the irreversible march of mankind towards a better and juster order. Above all, we have in mind the emergence and growing influence of the world socialist system, the progressive abolition of colonial domination, the accession to independence of a great number of new States, the full range of the technical-scientific revolution, and the ever more active participation of the peoples in social and political life and in the solving of international problems. These innovations undoubtedly also exercise an increasingly powerful positive influence on international relations.\n72.\tWith all its energies and creative capacities committed to a vast program of construction, the Romanian people very much wants international conditions of peace and co-operation in which to realize its aspirations. As a socialist country, Romania naturally places at the center of its foreign policy the development of friendship and multilateral co-operation with all the socialist States. At the same time, acting in the spirit of peaceful coexistence, it is continuously extending its co-operation with all the States of the world, regardless of their social systems.\n73.\tOne of the predominant realities of today's world is the irresistible affirmation of the peoples' will to decide their own destinies to be masters in their own land. Peoples are rising up in resolute defense of freedom and dignity, of the right to determine their future by themselves, without outside interference, to advance unhindered on the road to peace, prosperity and civilization. They firmly oppose the imperialist policy of force and diktat, and oppression and domination in any form. They are claiming, more and more vigorously, the right ;o dispose freely of their countries' wealth and to use it for their own development.\n74. It is the firm belief of the Romanian Government that any infringement of the national prerogatives of one people gravely affects not only that people's vital interests but also the general cause of peace and civilization itself. The nation, the nation-State, have a particularly important role to play and will have for a long time to come. Only co-operation among free and independent nations can guarantee international peace and security. It is therefore essential that inter-State relations be placed on a new and healthy basis, on the principles of sovereignty and national\nindependence, full equality of rights and mutual advantage, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, and non-recourse to the threat or use of force. These are universal principles which should govern relations among all States of the world and be strictly observed by all and towards all. Their unswerving application is the sine qua non for developing normal inter-State relations, for eliminating sources of tension and conflict in international life, and for guaranteeing every people's security.\n75.\tMy country believes it is a primary obligation of all States to refrain from the use or threat of force, from coercion and constraint, from any act generating tension, and ensure the settlement of disputes by exclusively peaceful means. In this respect, a great responsibility also rests with the United Nations, As the President of the State Council of the Socialist Republic of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, recently stated, the United Nations:\n.. must make absolutely sure that nowhere in inter-State relations is there ever again resort to the use or threat of force; it must act vigorously to ensure that States' declarations of principle do not remain a dead letters, but are consistently followed by deeds.\\\"\n76.\tThe Romanian Government is deeply concerned at the persistence, in various parts of the world, of the imperialist practices of interference in the affairs of other States, of armed conflicts and aggressive wars that bring sufferings and heavy losses to peoples and endanger the peace of the world. Romania calling for an immediate end to the war against the Viet-Namese people, as well as to the armed intervention in Cambodia and Laos. The restoration of peace in that part of the world requires the total withdrawal of the troops of the United States of America and its allies from Indo-China; respect for the inalienable right of the Viet-Namese, Laotian and Khmer peoples to solve the problems of their existence by themselves, without any outside interference.\n77.\tWe also support the seven-point proposal of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam, which provides a serious, reasonable basis for a political settlement of the Viet-Nam conflict. We also support the initiatives of the Royal Government. of National Unity, the United National Front of Cambodia, and the Patriotic Front of Laos.\n78.\tOur country wants to see a political settlement of the Middle East conflict in the spirit of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). This means that the Israeli troops must be withdrawn from the occupied Arab territories, the independence and territorial integrity of all States in the area must be assured and the problem of the Palestinian population must be solved in conformity with its national interests.\n79.\tThere is no doubt that a speedy settlement of the conflicts in Indo-China and the Middle East in conformity with the vital interests of the peoples and those of peace and security would make a significant contribution to the policy of co-operation, understanding and detente throughout the world. No people can consider itself secure k peace is disturbed in one region or another of the world, if upheavals and armed conflicts still occur. Hence the special importance of the duty incumbent on all States, big or small, and on the United Nations, to act vigorously to maintain peace and strengthen international security.\n80.\tRomania attaches great importance to the work of strengthening international security and makes an active contribution to all measures aimed at eliminating hotbeds of tension and conflict, consolidating the climate of detente, and promoting peaceful co-operation among countries and peoples. We consider that the United Nations should play a bigger role here and make a more effective contribution to fostering the policy of peace and security, at the same time acting more firmly to prevent war, stop aggression, bring about the political settlement of interState disputes, and defend the principles of the Charter. The consistent attainment of these objectives requires concerted and consistent efforts from both Member States and the Organization.\n81.\tAs emphasized in its reply [see A J8431, sect. II] to the letter of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Romanian Government understands the great importance of the Declaration on the Strengthening of Inter-national Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], co-sponsored by Romania. Solemnly reaffirming the purposes and principles of the Charter, as a basis for the relations among all States, and the obligation of States to observe them strictly, the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security constitutes a political document to guide both the actions of all Member States and the activities of the United Nations in discharging the great mission of maintaining peace and strengthening security in the world.\n82.\tThat is why the Romanian Government considers that the debate initiated at this session by the USSR concerning the problem of strengthening international security must lead to measures to eliminate all the hotbeds of tension and conflict and to ensure peace and security in the whole world.\n83.\tAs a European country, Romania is vitally interested in the establishment on the continent of relations that will guarantee the security of every people, ensure the right to develop freely and strengthen contacts and links on many levels, and is working hard to that end. At the same time, our country is working to bring about effective measures of military detente and disarmament in Europe and to end its division into opposing military blocs. With the growing impetus to detente and co-operation, the military blocs appear more and more an anachronism, a permanent source of distrust and suspicion, an obstacle on the road to the rapprochement among nations. The creation of a durable system of security in Europe, permitting the peaceful and unhampered development of every nation, will necessitate the dissolution of the military blocs, namely, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and, simultaneously, the Warsaw Treaty Organization, a proposal repeatedly put forward, as you know, by the Socialist countries.\n84.\tWe note with satisfaction the improvement of the political climate in Europe, and the progress in eliminating the vestiges of the last world conflagration and of the ensuing cold war. We see this as the result of the efforts of all the peoples of the continent, to which Romania has made an active contribution, which come from their decision to live in peace, good-neighborliness and harmony. The development of intra-European relations points up the importance and timeliness of bilateral political agreements, to eliminate for all time any sign of the use or threat of force, and the need to settle existing problems exclusively by peaceful means and to develop wide inter-national co-operation in the interest of general peace and the prosperity of every people. Noteworthy here are the treaties between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany,  and between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  -whose ratification would be of particular importance-the talks between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the negotiations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and the agreement on West Berlin. \n85.\tThe Romanian Government considers that it is the duty of all States concerned to act decisively to build security in Europe and turn it into a continent of co-operation and peace. The attainment of these objectives would serve the interests not only of all the European countries but also those of all States for it is an essential factor in the stability and peace of the world. An important step in this direction would be the early meeting of an all-European conference on security and co-operation, in which all the countries concerned would participate with equal rights. Preparatory multilateral meetings should be started immediately, without further delays or conditions, so as to provide a solid, practical basis for the conference.\n86.\tRomania attaches particular importance to relations of peace and good neighborliness in the Balkans. It was there that many past conflicts broke out, originating not so much in the direct problems among the States of that region, as in the confrontation of interests of the great imperialist and colonialist Powers, which have always tried to stimulate and to perpetuate conflict and to divide the Balkan peoples in order the more easily to rule them. History attests that the Balkan peoples have always had to coexist peacefully, to know one another and to co-operate closely in defense of their vital interests, and that only when they acted together could they advance along the road to national liberation and progress.\n87.\tThe transformation of the Balkans into an area of peace and understanding, free of nuclear weapons, would be in the interests of all the, Balkan peoples and must be the result of their joint endeavors. Romania, which submitted proposals to this effect as far back as 1957, believes that concrete steps are both necessary and possible, bilaterally and multilaterally, and will do its best to ensure that the Balkans become a zone of friendship and peaceful collaboration among peoples and that peace, security and cooperation are established in the whole of Europe.\n88.\tIf the United Nations is to do its important work effectively, it must ensure that all States of the world have an opportunity to take part in the discussion and solution of the problems facing mankind. Disregard of this fundamental necessity most flagrantly, in the arbitrary exclusion of the Peon's Republic of China from the United Nations-has done great harm to the Organization and weakened its capacity for acting. This profoundly abnormal and harmful situation, which is in obvious contradiction with reality, must be remedied without further delay. The positive process whereby many countries have normalized their relations with the People's Republic of China itself points to a trend whose deep political significance must be adequately reflected in the attitude of the United Nations towards the legitimate rights of that State in the Organization.\n89.\tThe Romanian delegation considers it especially important to display realism and political lucidity and to act in a spirit of high responsibility towards the major interests of the Organization and the requirements deriving from the very principles that lie at its basis, in order to restore to the People's Republic of China the seat-usurped by the envoy of Chiang Kai-shek-to which it is entitled as a founding Member of the United Nations. The participation of the. People's Republic of China in international life and in the activities of the United Nations is in the interests of all peoples; it constitutes a factor of great importance for the cause of progress and peace in the world, and is an essential condition if the United Nations is to play a larger role in finding viable solutions to the great international problems.\n90.\tThe Socialist Republic of Romania which as in previous years is a co-sponsor of the item concerning the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations [A/8392], strongly urges the immediate solution of this problem. The just way, in conformity with the Charter which is to restore to the People's Republic of China all its rights in. the United Nations, is for the General Assembly to recognize formally the incontestable reality that there is only one China - Taiwan belonging to the Peopled Republic of China-and that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people.\n91.\tAt the same time, we favor the admission to the United Nations of the two German States-the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and other countries arbitrarily kept out of the Organization.\n92.\tGuided by the basic principles of the Charter and of international law, our country s on this occasion as in the past, calls for the withdrawal of the foreign troops stationed in South Korea, the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, the cessation of all interference m the Korean people's affairs, respect for its right to decide by itself its path of development. We support the eight-point program for the reunification of Korea, adopted this year by the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, for putting an end to the artificial division of Korea. It is regrettable and altogether unjustifiable that, in spite of their urgency, the important questions regarding the withdrawal of the United States troops and of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea, and the dissolution of the purported United Nations\nCommission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, are not to be considered during the present session.\n93.\tGeneral disarmament, and above all nuclear disarmament, is still an especially important and urgent task facing the entire international community, an imperative condition of progress, a cause common to all peoples. The arms race, which has reached huge proportions, is a heavy burden on the peoples; it affects their economic and social progress and constitutes a permanent danger to world peace and security. Given the magnitude and unprecedented pace of the arms race, given the danger which nuclear weapons represent to the very existence of mankind, the results of disarmament negotiations, notwithstanding their importance, cannot be considered satisfactory and are far from meeting the expectations of the peoples.\n94.\tTo put an end to this disturbing state of affairs,- it is necessary that all States, as well as the United Nations, act with greater firmness and perseverance to secure a halt to the arms race and real progress towards disarmament. The banning and destruction of nuclear weapons and of all weapons of mass destruction cannot any longer be postponed. The complete abolition of such weapons without further delay is the most pressing demand in the field of disarmament . In our opinion, the disarmament negotiations must be given fresh impetus, and move from general discussions to the adoption of practical, effective disarmament measures,\n95.\tAs it has already had the opportunity to state in this forum and in the Geneva Disarmament Committee, the Romanian Government believes it is of the utmost impor-tance for promoting detente, trust and co-operation among all nations of the world, that partial measures be earned out, such as the freezing and reduction of the military budgets of all States; firm pledges in the form of an agreement to abstain from the use or threat of force, and from interference, in any form and in any circumstances, in the internal affairs of other States; renunciation of military maneuvers on the territory of other States; a ban on the establishment of new military bases and the placement of new weapons on foreign territory; measures to dismantle foreign military bases; withdrawal of troops within national frontiers; establishment of nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world; and dissolution of military blocs.\n96.\tRespect for the legitimate peace and security interests of all nations is an essential condition if the problems of disarmament, or any other major international problem, are to be successfully resolved. No problem involving the fate of all peoples, whatever its nature, can be settled by certain States or certain groups of States alone. All States, irrespective of population size or territory, of their economic, technical, scientific and military strength, have this right; it is a duty incumbent on all.\n97.\tIn this spirit, Romania has firmly stated its support for a general conference on Disarmament, with the participation of all States, to tackle the cardinal problems of disarmament, above all those concerning the banning and liquidation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Our country also considers it necessary that an adequate framework be created so that all interested States may participate in the work of the Geneva Committee and\nthe Disarmament Commission of the General Assembly may be reactivated, thus enabling all Member States to make a direct contribution,\n98.\tPeaceful co-operation among all States, irrespective of their social systems the only reasonable and realistic way of organizing international life-is today an objective necessity for the progress of each country and for the flowering of human civilization. At the same time, it is an essential condition for a climate of detente and rapprochement among peoples, the material foundation of peace and the strengthening of security in the world.\n99.\tEconomic, technical and scientific co-operation based on full equality of rights should benefit all partners and contribute to the development of every country and to the progress of the international community in its entirety. Broad and fruitful international co-operation can develop only after the elimination of all restrictions, all discrimination, all artificial barriers to the normal circulation of material and spiritual, values created by peoples. In our view, the United Nations should make a substantially greater contribution to the removal of obstacles to trade, and to ensuring that every nation has free access to the fruits and the benefits of modern science and technology.\n100.\tThe economic and social advancement of the developing countries, the reduction and elimination of the gap that separates them from the industrialized States, represent nowadays an essential condition for general progress.\n' We consider that it is high time to take vigorous measures to do away with under-development, to support and the advanced nations should be the first to do so-the developing countries' efforts towards progress. The United Nations and the Member States have the duty to carry out the measures adopted for the Second United Nations Development Decade, measures from which all developing countries, irrespective of their social system or geographical region, have the right to benefit\n101.\tRomania is deeply committed to and firmly supports the peoples' struggle against colonialism and neo-colonial- ism for the recovery cf their freedom and national independence. We condemn the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination practiced by the leadership of the Republic of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, and the colonial oppression in Namibia, Angola, Mozambique and other Territories.\n102.\tAll States, as well as the United Nations, must act vigorously to ensure respect for and complete implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, to prevent the revival, in any form, of the' domination of one State by another, of the neo-colonialist policy aimed at subjugating the peoples and despoiling their wealth.\n103.\tWe appreciate the attention the United Nations and its various bodies have given thus far to the problems of youth. In view of their importance and complexity, we are convinced that they should be constantly under review by the Organization. The natural concern of the young generation to see peace, equity and justice reign in the world of tomorrow makes it a trusty ally in promoting the noble purposes and principles of the Charter. The United\nNations, the specialized agencies, and the whole inter-national community are called upon to make their contribution to the education of youth in the spirit of high humanistic ideals of peace, understanding and friendship among peoples, to its training and participation in creative activities; they should see to it that young people are enabled to participate fully in building the society in which they will have to live.\n104.\tIt is our opinion that the United Nations should periodically organize meetings on problems peculiar to youth, solemnly proclaim the rights of youth, and consider how the Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace, Mutual Respect and Understanding be-tween Peoples [resolution 2037 (XX)], adopted upon the initiative of Romania and of other States, is being carried out.\n105.\tTo find solutions to the many and complex problems on our agenda will certainly require sustained effort on the part of all. We are convinced that goodwill, the spirit of co-operation and a constructive approach to the issues can lead to correct and viable decisions that will satisfy the peoples' hopes.\n106.\tIn conclusion, I should like to express my delegation's hope that the present session will help to enhance the United Nations capacity to act so that it may play a more active role in international life, to base relations among all States on the universal principles of the Charter; to ensure respect for the fundamental obligation of all States to refrain from the use or threat of force and from any kind of constraint or coercion in inter-State relations; to ensure respect for the right of every people to decide its future by itself; to develop broad co-operation among peoples, and to encourage the efforts of mankind towards peace, security and progress.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "204.\t May I be allowed, on behalf of my delegation at this twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly, to extend to the President my warmest congratulations upon his election to this high post. In addition to your numerous personal qualities, you are\nfrom a country Indonesia which is dear to us for more than one reason. For Bandung 1955 evokes in the mind of every African an era when the Afro-Asian world, united and in solidarity against colonialism, animated by the same vigilance against the domination of peoples and the enslavement of the third world, undertook the reconquest of its dignity. We are indebted to your country and to the people of Indonesia and its leaders who have shown such perspicacity and have understood that the past united us and that our strength in our struggle depended upon our solidarity.\n205.\tSince then the spirit of Bandung has remained alive, because it has led to the independence of most Afro-Asian countries and has enabled them to consolidate their national sovereignty.\n206.\tDestiny, which links Asia to Africa, going on beyond our two continents, has been joined here in our Organization with the pragmatism and rationalism of Europe and thus has achieved the universality of the Charter.\n207.\tBut, speaking of the Afro-Asian world, you will allow me to turn for a moment towards that other illustrious Asian, the Secretary-General, U Thant, whose numerous and undeniable qualities have won him a place at the head of this world Organization. The news reached us of the quasi-irrevocable decision of U Thant to abandon his functions as Secretary-General for personal reasons. We are saddened at the thought of his departure. Who in the world does not recall and will not long recall his fine and laborious efforts to achieve a detente in Europe, and the consolidation, of peace in the Middle East and in the Far East, thus making a great and noble contribution to the cause of humanity?\n208.\tFinally, I would be gravely remiss if I did not congratulate the outgoing President, Mr. Hambro, for the clairvoyance and the brilliance with which he conducted the debates of this Assembly.\n209.\tWe have just celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization of the United Nations. Just as after a holiday season one might be tempted to see in this twenty-sixth session an interval where we restore our strength.\n210.\tThe celebration was a time when we could all examine our Organization and draw up a list of its failures and successes and plan better conditions for the attainment of the objectives of the Charter.\n211.\tDrawing up a program of action [resolution 2621 (XXV)] for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)] and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations *' [resolution 2625 (XXV)] and the International DevelopmentiJtfategy for the Second United Nations Development\\\" Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] constitutes the basis for our future action.\n212.\tUnder resolution 1514 (XV) most of the African and Asian countries represented here today in the Organization of the United Nations wer\u00ab able to attain their independence and accede to international sovereignty, but it was also in the implementation of that resolution that our Organization experienced some of its severest tests and bitterest disappointments.\n213.\tIs it not true, in effect, that, in defiance of international morals and deliberately disregarding the condemnations of the United Nations, South Africa, Portugal and Rhodesia, assured of impunity, continued to perpetrate the ignoble policy of racial discrimination and exploitation of the black man? No one overlooks the grave threat of these practices to international peace and security.\n214.\tLately we have noted with satisfaction a certain thaw wherever the great Powers have decided to intervene to establish peace, whether in Europe, in the Near East or in Viet-Nam. The African continent, unfortunately, is still the\ntheater of Fratricidal struggles where the inspiration of colonialism is not always absent, The positive results of negotiations on the status of Berlin and the initiative of the United States Government for a rapprochement with the People's Republic of China are facts which show that goodwill and perseverance can lead to the broad highways of peace.\n215.\tIn the Near East, although the situation does not encourage exaggerated optimism, the parties involved seem to want to achieve a lasting peace acceptable to all. We need only recall the hope which they place in the Jarring mission and the favorable welcome they have given to the initiative of the 10 wise men of the Organization of African Unity to send the mission of four Heads of State to Egypt and Israel so as to find a solution to the crisis. The Government of Dahomey would join the many voices heard here in wishing full success to that mission.\n216.\tWho would deny the discreet and unflagging action of the United Nations to create the psychological conditions which made these results possible? But, then, is it not time to ask what are the causes of the powerlessness of the Organization in seeking a solution to the problems of decolonization and racism on the African continent?\n217.\tWe might have believed that, according to the democratic principles of Western civilization, Portugal, in the wake of the European march towards decolonization, would have recognized the right of peoples to self-determination and would have abandoned the illusory legal fiction which would have the Tagus River find its origin in the mountains of Kilimanjaro.\n218.\tWe might have believed that the numerous appeals to reason, the condemnations and economic sanctions I have mentioned here Would have led South Africa and Rhodesia to renounce an ideology which is repellent and mystifying, However, it seems that none of these measures will dissuade those who have decided to flout morality and the respect of the human person.\n219.\tFinally, we might have believed that, confronted with such a challenge, the United Nations would, in a search for realism and honesty, have imposed respect for the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter to which we all adhered.\n220.\tThe facts show that cur Organization has not always been effective. But what explanation can we give for this? Everyone realizes that the colonialism which we have so often denounced has hidden support which is essential to it. Everyone knows that the economic sanctions decided upon by the Organization would have had beneficial effects if the profit motive, which has become the leit-motiv of a harsh and ferocious world, had not won out over respect for the human person. Everyone knows that a certain amount of un-confessed trade has encouraged regimes which we can scarcely approve or support.\n221.\tEverything happens n if the problems of the small peoples dM not concern the big countries, but who can say that Urn peace of the rich will not one day be upset by the great misery and poverty of the poor? Let us be careful.\n222,\tWas it not our awareness of this gap between the rich and the poor which led our Assembly 11 years ago to proclaim the First United Nations Development Decade [resolution 1710 (XVI)], Of course, we cannot be proud of the results obtained during the First Decade, because at our twenty-fifth session we noted that the gap between the rich and the poor, far from closing, has widened, and so poverty throughout the world has become even greater,\n223,\tThus, in a gesture of indignation, our Assembly proclaimed the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], I hope this proclamation, a true act of faith, will always be borne in mind in the years to come.\n224,\tIf, as the International Strategy and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development provide, there could be some arrangement far a policy of basic commodity prices, we think that the developing countries would thus be encouraged in promoting their development.\n225.\tAs to assistance by developed countries to developing countries, we trust that the progress of the negotiations on disarmament will lead to a positive conclusion, and make it possible to devote the resources thus freed to international co-operation and the advancement of the poorer peoples.\n226.\tWe appreciate the assistance which is given to us now and all the assistance which we will receive in the future to improve the destiny of our people and raise their standard of living.\n227,\tThroughout the whole world everyone is talking about the admission into this Assembly of a great people, namely the People's Republic of China. This problem is of world-wide dimensions and importance and has understandably aroused and excited world public opinion. How many words have already been spoken and how many more will still be spoken! For is it not true that it is neither decent nor realistic to confine in isolation and to go on ignoring any longer the existence of about 800 million human beings? Who can say that it is fair deliberately to exclude from the international \\\"club\\\" a country that represents one quarter of the world's population? As for us, we believe that the world will be built through the efforts of all men united in solidarity in the great crusade, the crusade for peace, Thus the Government of Dahomey is in no way opposed to having the People's Republic of China seated in our Assembly.\n228.\tBut if it is true that the construction of our world requires all the energy and all the intelligence possible, if it is true that admission to the United Nations has never been a function of the size and importance of the country concerned, then in the name of what sacrosanct truth are we passively to accept the exclusion of the Republic of China from the great universal family represented by our Assembly?\n229.\tIt is here that we should recall that for more than 20 years the Republic of China has loyally participated in the solution of numerous and difficult problems that have arisen in the United Nations. And, may we add, in its participation it has never spared either time or effort in assisting us.\n230,\tThe 25 years of the United Nations' existence have furnished irrefutable proof that our planet possesses all the material resources and all the human potentialities required to create a world of happiness and prosperity.\n231,\tThe arms race inflicts on humanity a painful and needless hemorrhage. It gives rise to a gigantic waste of money that might be much better used in the fight against the many diseases that afflict humanity, in improving unequal standards of living, in bringing solace to the poor of the world.\n232,\tIt is high time that the resources of the earth were enjoyed by all who inhabit it; that the luxury and comfort enjoyed by some no longer served to insult the dignity of those in need who aspire only to work and make a fair profit to enable them to lead a decent life.\n^33. It is time that those who have been isolated by circumstances should now join the family of the United Nations.\n234.\tIt is time for our Assembly to cease being a debating society and to become a place where we \\\"an all pool our energies and where everyone can gird his loins for the great march, the march to peace and development.\n235.\tIn the face of so much misunderstanding, intolerance, brutality, stubbornness and enmity among peoples, I sometimes recall a phrase from a song which one of my school-teachers taught me. It is quite simple, and we might perhaps all do well to ponder it: \\\"The sun that shines upon us was not put there to see us weeping for ever.\\\"\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t  Mr. President, my delegation, which I have the honor of leading here for the first time, is happy to avail itself of this opportunity to express to you the deep satisfaction we feel at your election to the Presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n2.\tIt is a particularly agreeable task for me to associate myself with all the speakers who have preceded me to the rostrum and to address to you, on my own behalf and on behalf of the members of my delegation, our heartiest congratulations.\n3.\tIn electing you to the Presidency of the General Assembly, Sir, the Assembly wanted to show that it wished to entrust the delicate duty of directing and bringing to a successful conclusion the work of this very important twenty-sixth session to an eminent statesman and experienced diplomat such as you.\n4.\tWe are convinced that our debates, which have always been distinguished by great moderation and by the high level of the statements made, under your skillful and conciliatory direction will preserve the same characteristics of serenity and balance and will proceed in the spirit of mutual respect and confidence that is indispensable to the dignity and the success of meetings as prestigious as those of our Organization-meetings which for three months will attract the attention of the world because they hold the hopes of mankind, which is the victim of its own contradictions, torn by conflicts and obsessed by fear, but which longs for peace and happiness.\n5.\tThe experience which you have accumulated during a long and brilliant political and diplomatic career, Mr. President, constitutes in our view the guarantee of the final success of our work. Your personal qualities and proven competence will allow us, I am sure, to overcome all the difficulties which may lie in our path. We would venture to hope that our joint efforts will assist you in fulfilling your arduous and delicate task. You may be assured of the great esteem in which we all hold you.\n6.\tThat is why I express once again the hope that all delegations aware of the importance of the role which they must play will be ready to co-operate fully and thus contribute to the success of the task you have undertaken. Those are our warmest hopes.\n7.\tNeedless to say, those wishes go to the Vice-Presidents and to all the members of the Bureau who in their capacities will be called upon to play important roles in the progress of our debates and in the success of our work.\n8.\tI am happy to pay a well-deserved tribute to the President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly for the remarkable work he accomplished during our last session, upon which the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization conferred \u2022 added importance and prestige. Mr. Hambro demonstrated great skill and virtuosity throughout that unforgettable session. Thanks to his great knowledge of his role, and to his great skill and dynamism, President Hambro managed to bring a refreshing ardor to the Assembly which permitted us to complete all our work successfully within the allotted time. It was a brilliant success for a brilliant diplomat.\n9.\tBefore stating the points of view of my Government concerning the essential subjects before us, I should like to greet the new States that have been admitted to our Organization. I speak of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar. On behalf of the delegation and the people of Gabon, it is my pleasant duty to welcome those new Members to our great family of nations.\n10.\tLast year we celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations. The commemoration of that historic event gave rise to numerous manifestations throughout the world, but it was here at Headquarters that it met with its veritable apotheosis.\nA/PV.1945\n11.\tIndeed, many heads of State and Government did not hesitate to make long trips to associate themselves personally with the activities of the commemorative session. Those heads of State and Government, the majority of whom came from countries of the third world, felt that their physical presence was not only the best contribution they could offer to the community of nations on that solemn occasion, but that it constituted also an important manifestation of their faith in the Charter and of the hopes which +hey themselves as well as their countries had placed in the United Nations.\n12.\tThe Chief of State of Gabon, President Albert Bernard Bongo, was one of those pilgrims who came in faith and hope, However, speaking of the United Nations since its creation in 1945, President Bongo could not help but let his bitterness be felt when he stated:\n\\\"Thus, after these 25 years of existence, the United Nations presents us with a balance sheet which is characteristic of all human endeavors; that is to say, it is both negative and sometimes positive,\n\\\"On the basis of idealistic aspirations and generous intent, appreciable progress has been made, but when viewed with the results obtained, how many lost opportunities and how many bitter disillusionments there have been! ...\n.. We still live under the influence of, which can be seen here and there in many phonon of unjust discrimination. We still live under the influence of a certain past, of hegemonies and egoisms of all kinds which maintain inequality among men and various parts of the world.\n\\\"In tills connexion, one can only be surprised and shocked that the United Nations should have two aspects: that which shows an interest in certain parts of the world by trying to the extent possible to restore peace, and that which shows a deliberate lack of interest in the fate of other men\t\n\\\"...\\\"\n\\\"... Rather than striving to apply the Charter which they [the great Powers] signed, are they not above all interested in defending their interests, in maintaining or even spreading their influence? ..[1867th meeting, paras. 105-U1.J\n13.\tToday as yesterday, the delegation of Gabon continues to wonder about the reasons for the contradictions which paralyzed the Organization and seemed to frustrate the most generous initiatives taken here.\n14.\tWhether it be in the field of peace and security, whether it be a question of international co-operation and the struggle against under-development, when we take up the problems relating to the restoration of the dignity and freedom of peoples under foreign domination, the situation is scarcely different from what it was 25 years ago. Bloody confrontations take place throughout the world; the armaments race continues and broadens, multiplying the risks of a general conflagration. Millions of human beings continue to suffer under the yoke and domination of foreign minorities seeking power and wealth. Thus it seems difficult to say that we are living in a world of justice and peace.\n15.\tIn such a situation it is highly desirable that greater effort should be made to overcome injustice and put an end to the bloody confrontations which ravage certain regions of the world. In this regard, and more particularly as regards the Middle East, we feel that the Jarring mission should receive the support of all of us so that it may be carried out without hindrance, The United Nations should, consequently, reactivate that mission and issue a new appeal to the conscience of the belligerents-to their desire for peace-so as to bring them to devise new procedures and new working methods. Thus only can Ambassador Jarring fully carry out his role as mediator and make a positive contribution to bringing about an end to that extremely explosive and dangerous conflict and a return to peace in that part of the world.\n16.\tThe settlement of the Middle East conflict should be sought, need 1 repeat, within the framework of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). That resolution, which was unanimously supported by the General Assembly, was also officially and publicly accepted by the two camps. Thus is constitutes a basis for balanced and realistic negotiations.\n17.\tTo extinguish these hotbeds of war and to do away with all the armed conflicts which plague the world's nations is the very first objective which we must achieve on the road to peace and security.\n18.\tThe peoples of the world cannot live in peace unless they feel secure. When one thinks that the military arsenals of the great Powers are increasing every day with the addition of new, more powerful and more terrifying weapons; when we note that many small countries are also engaged in the arms race, we experience grave doubts. The great Powers, which play such a, decisive role in the affairs of the world and which alone produce all those armaments and are responsible for their dissemination: are they being sincere with themselves and with others when they speak of peace and call for disarmament?\n19.\tIn any case, the attitude of these arms merchants makes us doubt that they are sincere. The production, accumulation and dissemination of armaments show us that we must work against the folly of these arms merchants. We must guarantee the security of others.\n20.\tIt is the duty of the United Nations to intensify its efforts and its actions in this field so as to bring Member States to realize and carry out an agreement leading to general and controlled disarmament.\n21.\tNegotiations already undertaken so as to achieve agreement as to limitation, control and prohibition of certain arms, both nuclear and biological, deserve our support. We consider, however, that the measures envisaged are insufficient, since they only involve specific aspects of the problem.\n22.\tIn the opinion of our Government, disarmament should be total and general, that is to say, all production must be stopped, all stockpiles must be destroyed. If these measures are to receive and bring about their full effect, they should be provided with all adequate controls.\n23.\tThere is a long road ahead of us before we attain this ideal; that is to say, that general and complete disarmament will not occur tomorrow. However, we can hope that it will be so, and we must undertake this difficult task. That is the way men are; they always attempt the impossible.\n24.\tThe peace and security which we call for, the justice and happiness to which we aspire, are common wishes which nature has given to all men to share. They have not been reserved for any particular category of men. They belong to all human beings. To ignore this truth leads to the very worst aberrations. That in the twentieth century foreign minorities, because they believe they belong to a superior race, should deprive of their natural rights other human beings-this is what cannot be accepted. That these minorities, coming from another age, deaf to all the other nations of the world, should refuse to restore rights and freedoms to unhappy peoples which they maintain under their domination that is intolerable and unacceptable.\n25.\tThe policy of apartheid imposed by the white minorities in South Africa and Rhodesia is profoundly revolting. Such a senseless policy can only engender hatred among men and lead to violence and chaos. In such a hypothesis, the white settlers of Africa are mortgaging their future.\n26.\tTo persist in wearing blinkers, as Portugal insists on doing, is but a sign of political senility and can only lead to decadence and then to downfall. Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) are not Portuguese provinces; they are African lands. Soon these countries will attain their independence and will come to join their brothers countries. It is not Portugal that will be able to stop this. The wheel of history will not be stopped; it will end by crushing Portugal, if that country does not understand that its destiny is to be found in friendship and co-operation with Africa, which is ready to forget the past and to look only ahead.\n27.\tFor centuries colonial Powers have used the resources of these countries, and these riches were destined for distant metropolitan cities. At the same time, the unfortunate overseas countries which were sometimes called colonies were abandoned to their own destiny.\n28.\tIt is in this context of under-development that many third-world countries, especially in black Africa, were given their independence. They had insufficient means, and thus the leaders of these young States had to work prodigies, to construct the nation, to equip the country and to educate and feed the people and at the same time assume their international obligations.\n29.\tIn order to face up to such an overwhelming burden, they had to develop means of action so as to increase trade, to produce more so as to increase foreign income and to favor foreign investments. This was something which they had to do if they were to achieve their development.\n30.\tIn view of such great problems and so as to bring about, as .far as possible, some improvement in the grave situation of these under-developed countries, the international community launched in 1961 the First United Nations Development Decade, which at that time gave rise to great hopes.\n31.\tThen the years passed. In the opinion of most of the countries concerned, the First Development Decade failed to attain the objectives which it had established. The measures envisaged in the field of international trade, which were to bring to those countries producing raw materials supplementary income, were not fully implemented. These countries, which expected a substantial increase in their incomes because of an increase in their exports and because of stability of prices, had to trim their sails quickly. The export products met with tariff obstacles everywhere. At the same time, they were getting further and further into debt.\n32.\tFor their part, very few developed countries agree to make the capital outlays necessary to meet the target setting 1 per cent of their gross national product as the yearly amount to be transferred from their resources for the benefit of the under-developed countries.\n33.\tThe First Development Decade, therefore, was considered by many countries as a partial failure.\n34.\tThe General Assembly, during its last session, in resolution 2626 (XXV), proclaimed the Second United Nations Development Decade beginning on 1 January 1971. That resolution defines the international strategy for development during the 10 coming years and establishes the goals and objectives and advocates the measures to be taken. Once again it is an action program which will maintain the trade of the developing countries and favor their industrialization so as to overcome their backwardness and raise their standard of living.\n3t>. The measures to be taken are identical to those advocated under the First Development Decade, without forgetting the rate of transfer of resources of 1 per cent of their gross national product of the developed countries to the developing countries.\n36.\tJust as in the First Decade, the promises in this new Strategy have given rise to great hopes, but, in considering the past, we cannot help experiencing a certain amount of fear. The Strategy which has just been adopted is still quite Utopian and will be so if it is not rapidly and completely translated into facts.\n37.\tIn this connexion, the disturbance in the monetary system, certain protectionist measures, certain restrictions in assistance to the third world seem to contain serious threats for us. For our part, we have sincere hope that the nations of the world will desist from their egotism and devote themselves to attaining the objectives of the Second Development Decade. The success of the Strategy depends upon the will and sincerity of our actions. If all the clauses are honestly implemented, then we can hope for a complete success. Otherwise the failure might be heavy with consequences.\n38.\tThe world then will find it difficult to achieve peace, so long as the minority holds most of the wealth with the majority continues to suffer from hunger and live in poverty.\n39.\tPeace cannot be established until a minimum of justice exists, and justice does not consist alone of granting to individuals the enjoyment of their civil and political rights. It is also the right of every man to be able to have food, health and education.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "199.\t  On behalf of my Government, it is my pleasant duty to tender to you most cordial and sincere congratulations both for the honor done to you and the responsibilities entrusted to you by the General Assembly of the United Nations in electing you to preside over its twenty-sixth regular session. May I assure you, moreover, that yw will find in my delegation, all the co-operation that you may need in the performance of your lofty functions.\n200.\tAt the same time, I would ask you to convey to your predecessor in the Chair, Mr. Edvard Hambro of Norway, the testimony of Paraguay's deep recognition of the brilliant manner in which he presided over the previous session.\n201.\tWith the remembrance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations the commemoration of which gave rise, within and outside the Organization, to a recapitulation and evaluation of its accomplishments in the quarter century of its existence, to the examination of its current situation and the quantitative assessment of prospects for action in the near and distant future still fresh in our memories, my first words are aimed at reiterating, without reticence or reservation, the unswerving faith of the Republic of Paraguay in the United Nations.\n202.\tIn the opinion of my Government, the tenets, the principles and the purposes of the United Nations, as enunciated in the Charter, are today as valid as they were in 1945. These tenets, principles and purposes define norms of national and international conduct, the scrupulous and universal observance of which is and will continue to be the best guarantee for the maintenance of a just international peace and security; for the regulation of relations between States, through mutually agreed, accepted and respected norms, in which each enjoys full sovereignty, in which each and all nations, regardless of their political, economic or geographical size, is juridically equal and in which the international community, acting harmoniously, promote social progress, economic development and man's well being, irrespective of the land in which he was born, the place in which he lives, the color of his skin, or the religion he professes.\n203.\tWe know full well that in the time that has elapsed regrettable weaknesses have become apparent in our Organization; that there have been many frustrations and even, in given circumstances, a demonstration of the complete inability of the Organization to act, although the actions we expected of the United Nations were essential and urgent. Tins realistic recognition of the fact does not imply that we have lost the courage or the faith to which I have referred. It is indicative, on the other hand, of the differences that exist between our aspirations and what is feasible at present. It shows, too, the need to redouble our efforts to ensure universal respect for the Charter and to move forward decisively in our endeavor to make the world we live in perfect.\n204.\tPeace is the comer-stone on which the structure of international security rests. Its preservation is thus the first of the obligations of its Member States. It is almost unnecessary to emphasize that in speaking of peace we do not give this word or the concept it defines the narrow and limiting meaning of the absence of wars, but rather a dynamic and fruitful meaning that is inseparable from justice.\n205.\tOn the other hand, the preservation of peace and the consolidation of the structure on which international security must rest is necessarily a collective task in' which each and every one must make a contribution. We are fully aware of the extraordinary value for the maintenance of international peace and security, of the nature of relations between the great Powers and, in particular, between the two super-Powers; but that importance, however great, does not mean, nor can it mean, that it is exclusive. The active and dynamic peace we have in mind, that we hope to see reigning in the world, can only be real and effective if all the members of the international community make their contribution, even though the contribution of countries whose political, economic and demographic potential is very limited by comparison with that of other States having much greater resources and having achieved a different stage of development and whose contribution therefore may appear to be small.\n206.\tIt is this conviction that impelled us in 1970, when the General Assembly considered the item on its agenda relating to measures for the strengthening of international security, to join with other States in the geographic region to which my country belongs, to give our support in order to imbue the Declaration that was in th process of preparation with the true character of a historic discussion of singular importance. The result of that contribution, added to that of other Members of the United Nations, was the relevant resolution contained in document 2734 (XXV), which was adopted with a single dissident vote and a single abstention. Needless to say, it embodied ideas and principles that reflect the common thinking of Latin America. May we incidentally point out, without boasting but without false modesty, that we consider it an honor to have co-sponsored that resolution.\n207.\tIt would be improper at this time and on this occasion to make a lengthy quotation of the provisions of the aforesaid Declaration. But as I come from and represent a developing country, I would be failing in an elementary duty were I not to express, or rather to reiterate, the view we have been upholding that there is a relationship, which is not merely close but indissoluble and inseparable, between international security, disarmament and the development of countries, so that, and here I quote the words of the Declaration: \\\"... any progress made towards any of these objectives will constitute progress towards all of them\\\". The aforesaid reference does not merely seek to recall the past. Were it so, it would be unwarranted. The ami it pursues is quite different.\n208.\tThe preservation of peace, as I have said, is a collective responsibility. The Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security represents the will of the community of Members gathered in the United Nations. Its provisions range from a solemn reiteration, with a clear sense of re-dedication, of the cardinal principles of the Charter to pressing exhortations. We adopted the Declaration in good faith. In so doing, we undertook individually and collectively the obligation to abide by its letter and its spirit. Further, we assumed a duty to ensure its universal and strict implementation. It is this latter obligation that determines the need for a periodic and impartial examination of the degree of observance of its provisions. Let us do this each year, without hesitation or fear, conscious of the fact that the stricter we are in this examination, the better we shall preserve peace in justice and the better we shall serve both the collective interests of all and our own national interests.\n209.\tI have mentioned one of the most important resolutions of the twenty-fifth session. I must now mention another decision that is also truly historic. I am referring to the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, unanimously adopted in 1970 by acclamation [resolution 2626 (XXV)].\n210.\tThe 89 co-sponsors of the document submitted to the General Assembly, after protracted and difficult negotiations with the representatives of the industrialized States, knew full well that the Strategy that had been prepared so arduously did not constitute \\\"an adequate expression of the aspirations of the developing countries. Nor does it contain an assurance that the policy measures contained in it constitute even the minimum that should be done in order to realize the goals and objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade.\\\" But at the same time we were fully aware of the fact that the Strategy was and is \\\"the best possible reflection of the present stage of the collective conscience of mankind in one of the most crucial areas of organizing human society.\\\"10\n211.\tThe Strategy, which seeks to regulate relations between industrial States and developing States during the decade that has jurt opened, although it does not truly contemplate the legitimate aspirations of the latter, does constitute the first organic and systematic plan at the world level to establish principles and norms for international co-operation and effective mechanisms that will make it possible to reduce and eventually eliminate the great disparities that exist in our time in the two parts into which the world has been divided, taken from the standpoint of the degree of development and distribution of wealth as well as the living standards of the people and prosperity.\n212.\tNothing would have pleased us more than to come to this Assembly, on this first anniversary of the adoption of the Strategy, with the specific hope that the dawn of better days had arrived for most of the Members of the Organization and, of course, for most of the world population; in other words, for those of us who constitute the great mass of underprivileged peoples; for those of us who aspire to break the artificial barriers that have been raised and that\nseparate the world into two fundamentally different groups of countries, those which have too much and those which have too little. We would have wished to find in this world panorama the signs of a reduction in those great differences which separate the States of the North from the States of the South; we would have wished to see the hope of better days in the development of relations between both sectors of the world; we would also have been happy to point out that, as political colonialism disappears, conditions had become propitious to eliminate from the face of the earth the economic colonialism to which our countries are subjected whether they have an essentially agricultural economy or produce\tproducts. All these countries\nare in the incipient process of industrialization, but lack the essential national capital for their economic and social development, and all of them suffer the consequences of an unfair system of trade exchange which makes it impossible to improve their living standards.\n213.\tBut we come to this rostrum on the first anniversary with the profound and understandable concern, which stems from the recent events that we have witnessed in the * international monetary field, and in the field of trade. On this point I refer specifically to the 10 per cent tax on imports, wherever they may come from, that is to say, from the industrial or the developing world, which was initiated a while ago by the United States Government.\n214.\tWe understand the reasons that determined this measure, in other words, the deterioration in that country's balance of payments. But we must point out immediately that our developing countries, and particularly those of Latin America, have no responsibility for that deterioration. To the contrary, our trade, individual or collective, with the great Power to the north has been characterized by a chronic unfavorable balance of payments. In other words, the Government of the United States, by imposing that surtax on manufactured goods and not taking into account considerations relating to the origin of such imports, has placed on an equal footing the developing countries and the industrialized countries. At a recent meeting held in Panama, the Foreign Minister of my country, in referring to this 10 per cent surcharge, said that the worst injustice that could have been done was to put on an equal footing those who did not have the same possibilities, and that under such a policy the powerful became ever more powerful and the poor became even poorer. Moreover, he said that it is essential to seek solutions which while being effective and legitimate were not harmful under the guise of a non-existent equality since the absence of discrimination among unequal States-in terms of economic power-was simply unfair.\n215.\tIn the face of this dangerous situation for our economies which in themselves are so weak, the States of Latin America have found that their only possible strength lies in unity of thought and action; a unity that had its first important manifestations in the Consensus at Vina del Mar of May 1969 and which recently was reiterated unanimously in Bogota and Panama.11 Our only strength lies\nin our unity ; we must recognize that individually we are too weak and that the possibility of our being heard and heeded lies in speaking with a single voice in the great international assemblies.\n216.\tThese reflections apply especially to the new opportunity for dialog between the industrialized and the developing countries which will take place next year in Santiago, on the occasion of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We attach the greatest importance to the forthcoming ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 to be held in Lima at the end of 'this month, at which time the developing countries will seek mutually acceptable formalities which will enable them in turn to speak with a single voice in Santiago. Perhaps, as at no other time, this is the right time to say that in union there is strength. For us, the Latin American States, the meeting to be held also in Lima which will precede the meeting of the Group of 7713 will also be of paramount importance.\n217.\tI believe at this juncture I can speak with authority. To achieve that unity of action, on more than one occasion we have had to renounce legitimate aspirations. I must recall that my country is not only one of the developing countries, but also at the same time it is one of the only ones on this continent which, apart from its development problems and its lack of financial capacity or foreign aid, must suffer problems derived from its situation as a land-locked country. Throughout our national history our unswerving determination and our unceasing efforts in all organizations and in all assemblies have been directed towards our obtaining the establishment and recognition of certain principles of international law, in particular those which relate to the unfavorable geographic situation of States that do not have a coastline. We must recognize with regret that in this connexion international co-operation has not given the expected results. We do not of course want a system of this kind to continue and for that reason we continue to lay claim to certain rights for legal, historic and political reasons.\n218.\tIn expressing these thoughts I have in mind too the special participation of land-locked countries in the exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, which we believe would be fair compensation, which would in no way affect the interests of the coastal States.\n219.\tI have referred thus far to some of the items to be considered by the General Assembly under your guidance, Mr. President. I have not mentioned others because the position of my country has been spelt out repeatedly and is well known, and also because in the debate on each of these questions we shall have an opportunity to reiterate our views.\n220.\tI must point out that decisions adopted by the General Assembly have not always commanded our support. When we have had dissident views we have expressed them.But we wish to state that in our capacity as a loyal\nMember of the United Nations in the past we have accepted and we continue to accept in the present the decisions adopted by the majority of the Members of the international community in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.\n221.\tOur Organization has been enriched by the admission of three new Members whose presence in this Assembly of free nations of the world we welcome joyfully: Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar, to which Oman will be added shortly. My country extends to them the most cordial greetings and we offer them our most brotherly co-operation.\n222.\tI have only very little to add.\n223.\tU Thant has stated repeatedly in the past months and in categorical terms his firm decision not to continue in his lofty functions as Secretary-General after the expiration of his present mandate. We respect his decision and, although the time has not yet come for the tributes that this great man of universal stature deserves, I should like in a very few and sincere words to express to him the gratitude, recognition and appreciation of my Government and my delegation for the great task accomplished by him over a period of 10 years at the head of one of the most important organizations in the world, for his outstanding services in favor of the preservation of international peace and security and for his efforts in favor cf developing countries.\n224.\tIn conclusion, and following the usual practice adopted by my delegation, I should like in summary to give an idea of the efforts made by my country in the domestic field. We are continuing our great task of consolidating our economic infrastructure, of improving social conditions and living standards and perfecting national institutions that are characterized by the free play of political parties in a climate of peace, order and respect under the rule of justice. There is obvious progress being made at all levels of our national life, and this progress is undoubtedly the result of a healthy government policy carried out by that great statesman who presides over the destiny of Paraguay.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "30.\t Mr. President, it augurs well for the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly to have you in the Chair to preside over its deliberations. The overwhelming endorsement which the world body gave to the unanimous recommendation of the Asian countries bears irrefutable testimony to its esteem for you, as well as its confidence in your great ability and ultimate wisdom. For we all know in Asia of your dedicated efforts to promote regional understanding and solidarity among the Asian nations, and, thanks to your sagacity, it has been possible to put an end to harrowing difficulties among a few South-East Asian nations. I personally recall that, because of your keen qualities of understanding and persuasion, the differences between neighbor States were successfully composed. My country, Thailand, was fortunate to play host for South-East Asian reconciliation and for a neighborly entente cordial.\n31.\tMr. President, you have also won our respect and admiration for your effective conduct of the foreign affairs of your great nation, the Republic of Indonesia, through a crucial period of its history, which brought its presence back to the international scene with renewed vigor and strength. As one of Indonesia's closest friends and neighbors, Thailand is highly gratified at the honor bestowed by this Assembly on one of Asia's most distinguished sons.\n32.\tI should like also to convey our deep appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Edvard Hambro, for his deft guidance of Assembly deliberations in the past year. His efficient manner, coupled with his genial charm and sympathetic understanding, enabled the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly to proceed to its conclusion on a productive and harmonious note.\n33.\tThe delegation of Thailand has great pleasure in extending its sincere congratulations to the delegations of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar, whose countries were, on the opening day of the present session, unanimously admitted to membership in the United Nations. We are indeed proud and happy to have the representatives of those three Asian States seated among us, and we are confident that their contribution to the future work of the Organization will redound to the credit of their respective nations.\n34.\tNearly a year ago, the hopes and aspirations of the international community were raised and strengthened by the commemorative part of the twenty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly. The session itself was recognized as a significant milestone in the Organization's history, as it was attended by a large number of heads of State or Government, who pledged their continued loyalty to the purposes and principles of the Charter and renewed their determination to make the United Nations a more effective instrument of peace and progress.\n35.\tThe twenty-fifth session also produced a string' of declarations and resolutions which may, we hope, produce results in practical and concrete terms.\n36.\tIn the Middle East, a tenuous cease-fire is still preserved, but, despite a number of initiatives and probings in past months, prospects for a long-lasting and just peace remain uncertain. The main suffering continues to fall on the Palestinian refugees, whose daily existence and future well-being should be the central problem of all concerned. While we are conscious of the fact that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Jarring, and the four big Powers, together with the parties directly involved in the conflict, have assiduously attempted to make a forward move in line with Security Council resolution 242 (1967), we sincerely hope that the relevant resolutions, including the latest one on the status of Jerusalem, resolution 298 (1971), will receive adequate implementation.\n37.\tIn Viet-Nam, the tempo of the war has slowed down considerably. However, the related wars in Laos and the Khmer Republic, which have known a lull during the monsoon season, may be intensified again with the arrival of the dry season. Foreign troops which were sent in to help defend the Republic of Y-;?t-Nam are being withdrawn at a faster rate than in years before, as that country is increasing its defense capability. But the North VietNamese regular troops continue to remain in Laos, in the Khmer Republic, and in South Viet-Nam, against the wishes of the peoples concerned, and there is as yet no indication when those foreign troops will be withdrawn, if at all.\n38.\tThe talks in Paris also remain at a deadlock. While new proposals and meaningful adjustments of positions have come mostly from one side, willingness to negotiate seriously has not clearly emerged from the other side. What we can hope for is that significant developments In Asia in the next few months may give an impetus to a movement toward peaceful discussions of the problem by the parties directly concerned.\n39.\tIn East Pakistan, humanitarian concern should be directed towards relieving the tragic hardship facing the refugees. The international help which has been generously forthcoming may strengthen the role of this Organization and its specialized agencies.\n40.\tHowever, all is not lost in Asia. Wherever there is a dark cloud, there may also be a silver lining. The announcement, both in Peking and Washington last Inly, of a forthcoming visit by the President of the United States to the People's Republic of China has engendered widespread comment and expectation. Euphoria seems t,o prevail in certain quarters, while caution has been voiced by the more seasoned elements on both sides of the Pacific. We in Thailand also entertain hopes that the commendable steps taken by the leaders of those two countries will contribute to the relaxation of tensions and produce salutary effects on the peace and security of Asia and the world.\n41.\tHowever, we dare hope that that meeting and the ensuing discussions will carefully avoid affecting the interests of those who will not be present at the gathering. Rather, the dialog may profitably aim at seeking to resolve problems of peaceful coexistence and constructive co-operation, and thus constitute a turning-point in the tumultuous state of the world. Particularly the nations in Asia will feel reassured if no understanding or agreement which may result from the encounter is construed, tacitly or otherwise, to imply recognition of any party's paramount power or influence over a given area, as was customary in the past. What Asia urgently needs is to erase and do away with the obsolete concepts of domination and spheres of influence and substitute for them the healthy and beneficial principle of mutual co-operation among equal partners, encompassing all nations, large and small. The interests of all should be safeguarded, and the furtherance of the interests of some should not be at. the expense of others. Only in such manner would the cause of international peace and security be truly served.\n42.\tAs we are all aware, this session of the General Assembly will witness an important event. I am referring, of course, to the question of the representation of China in our Organization. In this connexion, I am pleased to state that my Government has decided to support the representation of the People's Republic of China in both this Assembly and the Security Council. In so doing, the Thai Government is prompted by the desire to see the relaxation of tensions throughout the entire length and breadth of Asia and particularly in South-East Asia. It is also our hope that many Asian, and indeed world, problems will thus have a better chance to be resolved and consequently that the prospects for peace in our part of the world will be further enhanced. Once the People's Republic of China joins the United Nations, it will; like the rest of the membership, have to uphold the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, particularly the obligations to respect the sovereignty and independence of other Members, as well as practice the policies of neighborliness and peaceful coexistence, and refrain from interference in the internal affairs of others-for instance, by supporting the so-called national liberation movements in other countries.\n43.\tWhile Thailand has reached an important decision to support the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, my Government is also in favor of the continued membership of the Republic of China. This should not be construed as meaning that Thailand follows the so-called \\\"two Chinas\\\" theory. We do not. On this contrary, we strictly adhere to the generally accepted principle of international law that the principal attributes of a sovereign State are the integrity and unity of the sovereign entity. If, however, we support the representation of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, the reason is that Thailand has had friendly and normal relations with the latter and there is no valid justification to do away with them. On the other hand, Thailand up to now has not had any official relationship with the former.\n44.\tIn fact, as we see it, the situation of divided countries, either in Asia or elsewhere, stems from certain anomalies of international life. This, in our opinion, represents not a permanent situation but rather a temporary one which may in due course be settled and returned to normalcy in the future.\n45.\tThe China question is no different from questions concerning other divided countries. It is indeed a fact that both Peking and Taipei firmly adhere to the concept of \\\"one China\\\". Other countries, such as Thailand, likewise believe in the unity and integrity of all sovereign States, and it is to be hoped that time will bring an accommodation to the conflicting claims of the parties concerned. They are the sole competent parties to work out their own problem and strive to find a solution thereto. Consequently, the position of the Thai delegation should be explained solely by the requirements of present political realities and the existing facts of international life and not by any theoretical considerations.\n46.\tOn that basis, we have every reason to appreciate the efforts of the four big Powers in concluding the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971. By such an agreement it is hoped that a solid basis for a satisfactory Berlin settlement has been established to the benefit of peace and stability in Europe and the world. It may also be a concrete step towards the strengthening of international security as enunciated in the Declaration on that subject adopted during the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. This action by the four Powers seems to vindicate the hopes of the Thai delegation in initiating an amendment,  subsequently revised and approved as paragraph 13 of the Declaration, to the effect that permanent members of the Security Council would be called upon to intensify their efforts to discharge, in conformity with the Charter, the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Thai delegation is, therefore, gratified that the four Powers have carried out their obligations in a manner worthy of the confidence reposed in them by the Charter of the United Nations. In this connexion, the Federal Republic of Germany should be commended for its efforts and determination to seek solutions and arrangements which may strengthen peace and stability not only in and around Berlin but for the central and eastern areas of Europe as well.\n47.\tThe question of disarmament continues to receive maximum attention from the international community, and yet world military expenditures have sky-rocketed to the awesome level of over $200,000 million per year. There is, therefore, an urgent need to make even more determined and concerted efforts to adopt meaningful and effective measures, including prohibition of underground nuclear testing, which will contribute to both nuclear and conventional disarmament.\n48.\tThe work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has not made too significant progress this year. The basic weakness of that body, of course, lies in the absence of two nuclear Powers, the People's Republic of China and France, from its deliberations. However, we are pleased at the concrete steps taken in connexion with an agreement on bacteriological weapons.\n49.\tThe Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America appear to have made some progress. The sober and congenial atmosphere surrounding the Talks gives an impression that some of the unwarranted fears and suspicions between the two super-Powers may slowly and gradually be diminishing. This is indeed a welcome sign and augurs well for the future arms-control negotiations. If such an atmosphere can be maintained and coupled with the more positive and co-operative attitudes of other nuclear Powers, a world disarmament conference, as proposed by the Soviet Union, certainly deserves the active support of all countries of the world.\n50.\tWhile there has been a perceptible slowing down in the pace of decolonization in the past few years, the world Organization can justifiably be proud of its record in this important field of activity. The work is, however, still unfinished, and the situation in the southern part of Africa continues to defy practical solutions. The Manifesto on Southern Africa, which was endorsed overwhelmingly by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth session [resolution 2505 (XXIV)], povided a much-needed impetus to the movement\tresolution of the problems. The efforts, however, produced no result. The colonial Powers remain adamant in the face of very strong views held by the international community against racial oppression and the denial of tlje right of self-determination.\n51.\tThe advisory opinion given by the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia^ is a new element. Now that the illegality of such presence has been established by the international tribunal, it is hoped that this new development will encourage the Security Council, which is at present considering the question, to devise a fresh and effective approach to the problem.\n52.\tAs we are entering the Second United Nations Development Decade, we remain conscious of the extent and gravity of the economic and social ills which are still plaguing the developing countries. Such basic problems as the technological gap, the population explosion, international trade and development and the transformation of traditional societies into modern ones continue to exist and to grow into almost unmanageable proportions.\n53.\tThe problem presented by technology is that, in spite of the growth of modern techniques and ideas, there remains an increasingly wide gap between the industrially developed countries and the rest of the world. In fact, technology in the advanced countries is now developing so fast that it is outstripping the ability of any but the most advanced nations to keep up.\n54.\tThe two resources which the less developed countries have hitherto been able to offer, namely, their raw materials and their cheap but unskilled labor force, are precisely two of the commodities which modern technology is rapidly replacing. No one can tell how much more difficult these basic problems will become in the future. Therefore, the United Nations should pay greater attention to this problem and see what course of action should be pursued in order to narrow the technology gap.\n55.\tIt is regrettable to note from past experiences that a deeper commitment to international assistance and a more positive attitude towards international trade and development have not been forthcoming from a large number of the developed countries. In the field of shipping, for instance, the liner conferences should take into account the views of the developing countries and co-operate more genuinely in working out a truly equitable pattern based on the principles of equality and mutual consultation. Particularly, they should accept the principle of equality of treatment in regard both to the shippers and to the shipping lines of the developing nations.\n56.\tFurthermore, some developed countries continue to encourage the uneconomic production and sale of com-modities which compete unfairly with those emanating from developing countries. They should be persuaded to discontinue government subsidies which introduce elements of unfair competition into normal commercial transactions, resulting in serious harm to the interests of poorer nations. Again, some developed countries should make genuine efforts to see to it that the trade and economy of developing countries are not adversely affected and a depression of world market prices is not brought about by the continual and untimely disposal of production surpluses or strategic reserves. We believe that only through the sincere demonstration of political far-sightedness on these matters can international understanding and mutual cooperation between developed and developing countries be achieved in consonance with the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.\n57.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to be held in Stockholm in June 1972 promises to be a world-wide campaign and an international and integrated plan of action to avert an environmental crisis. While the ecological ill effects are more keenly felt in industrialized countries, it would indeed be inadvisable for developing countries to maintain a complacent attitude towards their own environmental problems. Population explosion, unplanned deforestation, urban problems and the polluted countryside are encountered in the underdeveloped world as well as in the industrialized nations. At the same time, the planners of the Conference should also be mindful of the legitimate desire of the developing States that any measure, national or international, to combat environmental problems, should in no way impede the economic development process in those countries.\n58.\tThis year may indeed be called the year of the Asians. My delegation has already extended its warmest welcome to you, Mr. President, and to the representative of the three new Asian Member States. There is, however, another Asian personage whose name evokes sincere esteem and deep admiration around the world. UThant, the distinguished Secretary-General, has been in the service of the United Nations for 10 years. His tenure of office is said to be coming to an end. And while many of us here would be happy to see him continue ia his important position, the Secretary-General's personal wishes will have to be respected.\n59.\tThe delegation of Thailand would like to take this opportunity of expressing its most grateful thanks to the Secretary-General for the services he has unselfishly and devotedly rendered to the Organization. UThant's integrity, independence and charm have indeed endeared him to all of us, and the prestige of the office of Secretary-General has been further enhanced by his personal attributes and dedication to the cause of international peace, understanding and co-operation. We wish him all the best and a well-earned rest after a decade of tireless efforts in discharging the responsibilities of an office that UThant himself has referred to as one of the most difficult and most rewarding in the world.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "3.\t  Mr. President, it is my privilege to extend to you the warm congratulations of the delegation of Burma, as well as my own personal congratulations, on your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Our sense of satisfaction on your election has been enhanced by our confidence that your wide experience in the affairs of the community of nations will prove to be particularly valuable in discharging the heavy responsibilities that lie upon you as President of this Assembly. We are hopeful that, with the benefit of your wise counsel and able guidance, the General Assembly will be able to consider constructively the very important issues that face it in a year characterized by significant developments in the relations between nations, and that it will act positively in order to provide both the impulse and the momentum towards achieving true international understanding and international co-operation.\n4.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to convey my delegation's sincere appreciation to Mr. Edvard Hambro who, as President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, assumed the major responsibility for organizing the work of the commemorative session of the Assembly so that it might be imbued with lasting significance.\n5.\tThe United Nations has from time to time come in for searching criticism; yet mankind continues to put its faith in the world Organization. An international organization of a universal character has indeed become a necessity of modern international life and there is no alternative to the United Nations.\n6.\tIt would of course be unrealistic ta expect the United Nations, which is but a product of the nation-State system and is in no sense a supra-national organization, to remain aloof from the conflicts of national interests and of power politics which exist today and which are bound to arise in the future. It is, therefore, obvious that the United Nations can succeed in the pursuit of its noble purposes only in proportion as Member States become willing to subordinate whatever conflicting political or ideological interests may still divide them to the common purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n7.\tIt is a truism that peace and security are the consequence of man's noblest achievement, a generally accepted system of law; and Member States of the United Nations are committed to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained. Yet the United Nations system of peace and security, which envisages the collective enforcement of the rules of international law by the community of nations, has never had much of a chance to operate. The result has been that the basic purpose of the world Organization to maintain international peace and security through effective collective measures remains largely Utopian.\n8.\tThe virtual failure of the United Nations system of peace implies the pertinacity of balance-of-power politics. Mankind has to stake once again the maintenance of international peace and security on a precarious balance of power which is mainly a bipolar balance. In this situation, while the possibility of total war is minimized, the dangers of local conflicts have become magnified. The world has thus had occasion to witness the phenomenon of limited wars for limited objectives, to which States other than super-Powers become direct victims. However, there is always present in such limited wars the risk of escalation into a total war, which even super-Powers cannot hope to escape.\n9.\tFortunately for the world, the two super-Powers, despite their ideological incompatibility and their unresolved conflicts-mostly indirect in certain parts of the \nworld, particularly in Europe, East Asia and the Middle East, have developed a strong common interest in preventing the outbreak of nuclear war. It therefore continues to be in the national interests of both to prevent or limit international conflicts in places where both are directly or indirectly involved and where the conflicts might escalate into nuclear war.\n10.\tThere are also encouraging signs that significant external and internal pressures operate on both the superPowers to re-examine their relationships and their legitimate interests and commitments and to determine to what extent they can co-operate in the maintenance of international peace and security rather than persist in fruitless yet costly confrontation.\n11.\tWhile, over the next decade or so, the effective responsibility for international peace and security may continue to rest very largely with the two super-Powers, either in co-operation or in competition, or in some ambiguous combination of the two, it is becoming increasingly clear that it is not within the power of the super-Powers alone to bring about by peaceful means a lasting adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which today cause international tensions and which might lead to breaches of the peace and imperil the security of all.\n12.\tIt has been in the cards for some time now that other centers of power will arise in the world, centers which can provide an element of flexibility for the bipolar balance of the present and even transform it, in the course of time, into a multiple or world balance of power. This is all the more likely as the world today is experiencing a revolution with respect to the place and meaning of force in relations between States. Major Powers are finding themselves in a paradoxical situation in which the development of very destructive weapons operates as a de facto restraint on the use of military power. With the advent of nuclear weapons in particular, military power seems less meaningful in State relations.\n13.\tAccordingly, it seems to the delegation of Burma that a view of world politics based on the balance of power affords too narrow a perspective for comprehending the sweep of history and the forces which have shaped and will continue to shape international political behavior in our age. The consideration of State relations would, in our view, be more meaningful if the focus of attention were not merely on power but also on the sources and well-springs of values and goals which today unite and divide nations.\n14.\tIt cannot be denied that there is a growing community of shared values among nations, and this is at least equally as significant as the revolutionary changes in the place and meaning of force in inter-State relations. Increasing co-operation among nations and even integration in some cases would therefore seem to be the trend of the future, and the United Nations may yet play an increasing role in spear-heading international co-operation not only in promoting the economic and social advancement of all peoples but also in safeguarding international peace and security.\n15.\tIn this changing international situation, it is highly significant that the United States of America and the\nPeople's Republic of China have come to adopt a realistic approach to the question of their relationship and, hopefully, to the various issues that have divided them. This development may well have far-reaching implications not only for the peace and stability of East Asia but also for the world generally.\n16.\tLet me now turn to the subject of disarmament.\n17.\tIn the time that has elapsed since the last Assembly, the international arena has been marked by fresh initiatives which give u reasonable basis for hope that the impasse in disarmament negotiations will at last be ended.\n18.\tAfter a year and a half of bilateral negotiations at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] concerning the limitation of offensive and defensive strategic nuclear weapon systems, it is gratifying to note that the two major nuclear Powers have reached an understanding on the framework of future negotiations by agreeing to secure early agreement on the issue of defensive anti-ballistic missile weapons, while making parallel progress on the limitation of offensive weapons. Burma hopes that the impulse generated by this welcome first step will prove productive in the entire scope of the negotiations.\n19.\tAt the same time it is a disturbing fact that the same nuclear Powers are vigorously pushing ahead in the qualitative improvement of nuclear arms, concurrent to their efforts in SALT, thus placing no brake on the current arms race. As weapons develop in effectiveness, they also tend to outgrow current possibilities of control and pose completely new problems for negotiations. Such developments militate against the reaching of solutions. In the light of this concern, surely it would not be asking too much to urge the two nuclear Powers to co-operate and halt their nuclear arms race as an urgent matter.\n20.\tAmong other things this means the complete cessation of all nuclear weapons tests. A comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty is the most important disarmament measure needed to help dispel some of the factors that fuel the arms race and to establish a climate for further progress in disarmament negotiations.\n21.\tThe current session of the General Assembly will soon consider the draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction [A/8457-DC/234, annex A], proposed by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. This convention, in our view, would operate as a disarmament measure for those few Powers which actually possess\\\"\\\" stockpiles of such weapons or have accumulated a vast fund of knowledge for their fabrication. Burma has all along advocated that the banning of chemical and bacteriological weapons should preferably not be mutually exclusive; we have co-operated in the banning of bacteriological weapons as an initial component of a larger process towards the ultimate elimination of chemical weapons.\n22.\tAt present, international efforts in the disarmament field are concentrated in SALT, meeting alternately at Helsinki and Vienna, and in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. It is not impossible that the recent opening of possible negotiations on mutual troop reductions between the contending blocs in Europe might yet add another arena to disarmament negotiations. All in all, the mere fact of negotiations being carried out somewhere or other would appear to offer the prospect of being interesting and of yielding possible movement in the disarmament field.\n23.\tThe improvement in the situation in Berlin serves to highlight this thinking. The four-Power talks succeed in obtaining agreement on Berlin.  Burma welcomes this happy turn of events as signifying an important and encouraging turn for the betterment of inter-European relations. The Berlin accord paves the way for more meaningful negotiations on the problems of European security and for the solution of broader questions affecting world peace in general.\n24.\tThe question of an international sea-bed area and of a conference on the law of the sea to be held in 1973 will again, this year, call for the concentrated attention of the Assembly. Burma recognizes the importance of the forthcoming conference. In order to ensure a constructive approach towards reaching a just and widely acceptable solution of all outstanding problems, prior systematic preparations for the conference are essential.\n25.\tA heartening aspect is that the Assembly will again be able to register yet another step in the development of international space law. After eight prolonged years of negotiations, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has now achieved a widely acceptable draft Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects [A/8420, para. 32]. This is the first space agreement of direct advantage to \\\"non- space\\\" nations. Burma supports, in principle, all United Nations efforts for the progressive formulation of international space law as serving the common interests of the international community.\n26.\tWhile on the subject of space, the delegation of Burma would like to pay a high tribute to the memory of those pioneers in space, American and Soviet, who, in their selfless and courageous exploits, have made the ultimate sacrifice for country, the world and all peoples. Our full admiration and appreciation goes to those others who, at similar risk to their lives, are piercing the secrets of space so that the world may be richer in knowledge and experience.\n27.\tI now turn to the question of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in our family of nations. This matter is of great importance to the world community. The People's Republic of China contains almost a quarter of the human race, and it would be unrealistic for the United Nations to continue to prevent it from taking its rightful place amongst us by creating the \\\"two-China problem\\\". The carving out of a portion of the territory of an existing State to create artificially two Governments for a single territory is not morally right. Therefore the delegation of Burma recognizes the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legal Government of China.\n28.\tLet us decide, therefore, once and for all on the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, based solely on the principles of the Charter and the realities of the situation and without emotion based on political influence or ideological differences. The delegation of Burma fervently hopes that in this way international peace, security and co-operation will once again prevail when we have solved this problem of representation successfully and truthfully.\n29.\tThe delegation of Burma has always felt that under the conflicts in Indo-China lie all the while the deeper and ultimately decisive conflicts between more powerful outside Powers. While such outside interference can prolong and aggravate the conflicts in Indo-China, we are of the view that any indigenous group or faction in Viet-Nam, or in Cambodia or Laos, which is able to mobilize and maintain effective popular support by meeting to a sufficient degree the political and economic imperatives of the evolving society will ultimately prevail. No outside Power can hope to prevent such a group from gaining power in the country, even if it so desires, and even if it is willing for a time to pour out human and material resources to, that end. In the last analysis, therefore, it is lot for outside Powers, but for the people of Indo-China themselves, to work out the kind of political settlement they want, which outside Powers should respect.\n30.\tThe continuation of tension in the Middle East is a matter of profound and abiding concern. Our position on this is too well known to bear any reiteration. It is our earnest appeal that all interested parties will continue to persevere in the search for a peaceful and mutually acceptable solution and that contending parties will exercise the greatest of restraint. We believe that a just and equitable solution could be reached on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which is broad enough to provide a sound basis for a political solution to the problems of the Middle East.\n31.\tLet me now briefly deal with the twin evils of colonialism and racial discrimination with which we have, been seize.d for more than 25 years and which have persistently defied solution in some parts of the world, particularly in southern Africa, causing enormous human misery. A continuation of this situation obviously cannot but have serious international repercussions. The delegation of Burma appeals to all the Powers which have given their support to these minority regimes in southern Africa to co-operate with the United Nations so as to bring a speedy solution to the problems.\n32.\tTurning now to the question of the economic development of the less developed countries, it is gratifying to note the important role the United Nations has been playing in this area over the years. Organizations such as the United Nations Development program are also becoming increasingly active in providing technical assistance. It is our hope that the United Nations will continue to expand and strengthen its programs of multilateral economic assistance and that further efforts will be made to make these development programs more available to meet effectively the needs or the less developed countries in the days to come.\n33.\tNow that the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade has been agreed upon [resolution 2626 (XXV)], it is of utmost importance that ways and means of implementing the strategy and tactics of development, so to speak, should be immediately formulated and put into practice. Member countries should have the political will to co-operate and to bear their responsibilities so that the high ideals and goals of the Second Development Decade will become a reality. In the view of my delegation, the continuing and increasing disparity in living standards between the developed and developing countries do not portend well for international peace and security, and indeed it would be a major tragedy if these inequalities lead to a serious North-South confrontation. Rapid progress in the economic field is therefore necessary to lessen international tensions, and it is our hope that the impending difficult economic problems that are facing the developing countries will be settled in a spirit of international co-operation, understanding and mutual benefit.\n34.\tThe world today is confronted as never before with new problems and new issues that transcend geographic and ideological borders and call for a new dimension' of international co-operation. Whether the United Nations will be able to rise to this historic opportunity and play an increasing role in spearheading international action to meet these unprecedented challenges of our era will depend on each and every one of the Members of the world Organization.\n35.\tBefore concluding, the delegation of Burma would also like to take this opportunity of extending a very warm welcome to four new Members to our Organization the Kingdom of Bhutan, the State of Bahrain, the State of Qatar and the State of Oman. We are confident that our family of nations will be further strengthened by their presence.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "71.\t Mr. President, by your leave, the delegation of Togo to the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations associates itself with all those who have preceded us at this rostrum to extend to you the warm congratulations of our Government on the occasion of your brilliant election to the presidency of our Assembly. Our work, under the guidance of a man of your competence, having such vast experience in international affairs, will, we are sure, be carried out in an atmosphere of serenity and effectiveness.\n72.\tWe also wish to say to your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro, how much the delegation of Togo appreciated the tact, authority and patience with which he guided the work of the twenty-fifth session.\n73.\tWe would certainly be failing in our duty were we not to express to the Secretary-General, U Thant, our great admiration for his indefatigable devotion to the cause of all nations. We are not unaware of the many difficulties in his endeavors, but we know, too, that he gives the best of himself in facing them. We wish him much courage and excellent health so that he may, for some time still, be in charge of our Organization, because, more than ever, it needs his long experience and his great wisdom. We are convinced that with his acute awareness of his heavy responsibilities, he would not hesitate for a second to continue his lofty mission unless absolutely imperative reasons prevent him from doing so.\n74.\tExactly a year ago our Organization celebrated its 25 years of existence. Speaking from this same rostrum [1849th meeting], I recalled the problems to which the Government of Togo devotes special attention: in particular, decolonization, apartheid, disarmament, China, Viet- Nam, the Middle East, the economic problems of the developing countries and so on.\n75.\tThe same subjects remain the major concerns of our Organization at its present session, because on their solutions will largely depend peace and security in the world,,\n76.\tThe international political situation, which until lately was not very promising, today has aroused some hopes, particularly as a result of the measures taken since the month of April 1971 by the Government of the United States to normalize Sino-American relations. Furthermore, the decision of President Nixon to go to Peking before May 1972 constitutes definite proof of a policy of detente. It is difficult for us to imagine how there could be peace of any kind in Asia without the\\\" participation of the People's Republic of China, a nation of 750 million people. It is with relief that we welcome the realism of the United States policy towards Peking.\n77.\tThe problem of the admission of the People's Republic of China to our Organization seems now to have been\ntaken up in a more realistic manner, and my delegation can not but rejoice at this. Indeed, for several years my Government has unceasingly advocated its admission, and, what is more, as a result of a clear and unequivocal position taken recently by the Central Committee of the Rassemblement du peuple togolais, it has pronounced itself in favor of the recognition of Peking. The realism which led my country to take account of the existence of 750 million people should also prompt us to be mindful of the fate of the other 14 million people who have so far been represented in our Organization.\n78.\tAccordingly, the delegation of Togo whole-heartedly hopes that the question of China will finally find a definite and equitable solution, because it is quite obvious that a certain number of problems among them those of disarmament and Viet-Nam cannot be solved if that great country is kept away from the talks where these questions are discussed.\n79.\tIndeed, the problem of disarmament is one of those which requires that China be closely associated with a solution. China's admission to the family of the United Nations would assuredly make it become more conscious of its legitimate responsibilities by giving it the feeling that the international community wishes to see it finally play the part conferred on it by its position in the world.\n80.\tThe solution of the Viet-Nam tragedy also depends on the happy outcome of the Chinese problem. No one is unaware that peace in Viet-Nam presupposes an understanding with North Viet-Nam and co-operation with the People's Republic of China. It must be hoped that with this happy outcome the Paris talks will have some possibility of reaching a positive result.\n81.\tMow, everybody knows that at the present time the monetary crisis in the Western world and in the countries which are tied to it by trade is caused largely by the ruinous expenditures incurred by the Viet-Nam war and which daily create a greater imbalance in the balance of payments of the United States. It is, therefore, time for that country to make a gesture, which would be rewarded. We must all sincerely hope that Washington, which so courageously has embarked on a new approach to the Chinese problem, will find in the international community the necessary encouragement and in itself the necessary resources to pursue the policy newly embarked on, which is so promising.\n82.\tThe entire world continues to be concerned with the tragedy of the Middle East. Since the last session of the General Assembly no serious evolution has been observed. The cease-fire has expired, and war can, therefore, break out at any time, thus creating a grave danger to international peace and security. Today, like yesterday, we cannot but give our support to the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and to the United States peace proposal known as the Rogers plan, despite some shortcomings due to the fact that the Palestinian problem has not been expressly mentioned. Once again we call on the two parties concerned to overcome their divergences. We believe that, in this regard, the mission of the Organization of African Unity, with Presidents Senghor, Ahidjo, Mobutu and Gowon, which will shortly go to Israel and Egypt, may be of great usefulness in the quest for a\nsolution to this grave crisis, and it is to be hoped that the goodwill of the two parties concerned will contribute to the success of these meetings.\n83.\tAnother threat to world peace is the problem of decolonization. Here too, since the last session of the General Assembly no progress has been recorded. On the contrary, Portugal unceasingly and inexorably pursues, but also with a certain risk of a burning failure, its anachronistic war of reconquest, sowing destruction and death everywhere, in Guinea (Bissau), Angola and Mozambique, and carrying criminal effrontery to the extent of attacking brotherly countries such as Senegal, Guinea and Zambia, encouraged because of the powerlessness of our Organization to apply the sanctions provided for under the Charter. My delegation wishes to reiterate from this same rostrum our position of the twenty-fifth session, in particular, that military aid and economic support of the countries friendly to Portugal must cease, and that international organizations, and the United Nations in particular, should resolutely decide to isolate Portugal as long as it scorns the elementary rules of human rights and the fundamental principle of the freedom of peoples to self-determination as provided for in the Charter.\n84.\tAnother humiliation inflicted on Africa is the odious practice of apartheid, an abject racism erected by the authorities of Pretoria into a system of government and extended to Namibia in total defiance of resolutions of the international Organization. South Africa continues to occupy with impunity the Territory of Namibia, in spite of the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, and persists in refusing admission to that Territory to envoys of the United Nations.\n85.\tAnother example of a racist regime that is equally dismal is that of Salisbury, which also continues to defy international opinion and seems to become more entrenched as time goes by. How could it be otherwise, since the countries which alone can give a minimum of effectiveness to the United Nations resolutions are.the very ones violating these rules, despite the lofty moral declarations of intent, although it is touch and go whether they : re Pharisees or cynics. It is high time for the international community to follow a minimum ethical standard; otherwise it will wither away.\n86.\tIn this connexion the problem of South Africa remains one of the concerns of our Organization and its Member States, This is why we have for some time been witnesses to heated debates on the question of determining whether, in order to induce the apartheid country to revise its policy, force has to be used, particularly by giving assistance to the liberation movements, or \\\"whether we should have a dialog with Pretoria. On this point the position of my Government is perfectly clear: a dialog with South Africa is only possible if the white minority previously agrees to a dialog with the black majority.\n87.\tOne may indeed wonder what would be the use of a dialog with Pretoria if the latter continues to flaunt its utter contempt for the black population for which it does not recognize even the most elementary human dignity. But no one would have the temerity to claim that he possesses a\nmonopoly of truth in this area, and all opinions without exception, provided they are sincere, should be heard and respected. It is only in this way that an equitable solution can be found to this tragedy of inequity.\n88.\tI would not wish to close this chapter without expressing the feeling of my delegation with regard to the German problem, which is of the greatest concern to my country because of the ancient bonds of affection woven by history. These bonds mean that the legitimate concerns of the German people are also ours. This is why we most sincerely hope that the relations of trust which are beginning to be established between the Federal Republic of Germany and the countries of Eastern Europe particularly because of the recent Germ l-Soviet treaty and the German-Polish treaty will create the best psychological conditions for a rapprochement between all Germans.\n89.\tTo go on now to the crucial problem of underdevelopment, I cannot forget that the delegation of Togo last year stressed that we were disappointed with the insignificant results obtained in the First United Nations Development Decade and this despite all the resolutions and recommendations adopted by our Assembly since 1960.\n90.\tOn the eve of the Second Development Decade, allow me to express once again the concern of my Government at the increasingly pronounced deterioration of the economic situation in the world: deterioration in terms of trade, an international monetary crisis, a substantial reduction in the aid of the \\\"have\\\" countries to the developing countries, etc.\n91.\tThe present economic situation creates enormous problems for the developing countries.\n92.\tThe international monetary crisis, for example, by introducing the most total confusion in the exchange market., gravely jeopardizes the already meager chances of the developing countries, which are struggling to narrow the ever widening gap between their economies and those of the rich countries.\n93.\tThe decisions taken in the last months by the rich countries floating currencies, protectionist measures of all kinds-were taken without much regard for the economies of the developing countries; purely national interests have guided the promoters of these policies. But the developing countries are aware that they will be the first victims of such measures. They fear that the world has once again entered the era of protectionism, of trade and monetary war, of restrictive practices which characterized the 1930s and led to a considerable contraction in international trade.\n94.\tWho would stand to suffer most from a decline in international trade, if not our countries which by nature are destined to export their primary goods on the world market?\n95.\tThus we are faced with new and serious difficulties at a time when international public aid, instead of rising to attain the targets set by the highest international authorities, is constantly reduced. Faced with this situation, characterized essentially by a toning down in international solidarity, our countries cannot remain indifferent for long.\n96.\tThe reestablishment of an international monetary order based on the principles of justice and equity must be sought as a matter of extreme urgency and with the full and complete participation of the poor countries. The quest for. a solution in this field cannot be the exclusive domain of the great Powers because the international monetary order concerns us all.\n97.\tFurthermore, the problem regarding the stabilization of prices for raw materials must cease resembling a sea serpent to become a meticulously studied reality, one likely to lead to a speedy solution acceptable to the developing countries.\n98.\tFinally, international assistance must no longer be considered by the rich countries as a privilege which may lightly be renounced in case of need; it must become a pressing obligation for all, in the name of human solidarity and dignity.\n99.\tDespite our faith in real international co-operation, all of that does not allow us to augur a better future for us, the poor countries, at least for tire 1970s.\n100.\tAnd yet, the new International Development Strategy, adopted last year [resolution 2626 (XXV)J, should make it possible for the poor countries, through economic and social development and progress, to ensure for their populations a minimum standard of living compatible with human dignity.\n101.\tIn fact, this Strategy provides inter alia that these countries will, energetically mobilize their resources and financial means with a view to their development during the 1970s; that the developed countries will endeavor to carry out by 1972 a net annual transfer of resources of at least 1 per cent of their gross national product, so as to enable the underdeveloped countries to attain an average annual growth rate o*' their gross national product of 6 per cent; and that international agreements on the most important commodities will be concluded.\n102.\tUnfortunately, tills Strategy, like those which are to come, will remain a dead letter; it will at most constitute a declaration of intent whereby the industrialized countries will continue to widen a little more the gap which divides them from the young non-industrialized States.\n103.\tHie caution and reservations contained in resolution 2626 (XXV) on the new Strategy, as well as the evolution of the world economic situation in 1971, are in themselves sufficient to allow us to see clearly that die third world has once again been taken in.\n104.\tFurthermore, the concerted action advocated in the new Strategy has political implications; it would accordingly be difficult to determine the attitude of each Government taken separately.\n105.\tSome will think that we want to see the first results of the Second Development Decade in no time at all. To them we would reply that we really are in a hurry to lead our countries out of their economic slump.\n \n106.\tNow we bitterly note that the assistance of the wealthy countries to Africa remained stagnant from. 1960 to 1967, and then declined from 1968 to the present.\n107.\tParallel to this, we are anguished at the decline in the prices of our basic commodities while the prices of manufactured products from the rich countries continue to rise, and we agree with the view that the deterioration in the terms of trade is the greatest economic scandal of the century. Nevertheless, our disenchantment with all these accumulated injustices and the persistence of the systematic exploitation of the poor by the rich fail to plunge us into despair. On the contrary, we are more than ever resolved to continue the struggle against under-development so as to create the basis for our genuine economic independence.\n108.\tSince 1967, the year in which political stability was restored in Togo, some remarkable achievements have placed our country genuinely on the road to progress, thanks to the tireless efforts of our young and dynamic Head of State, General Etienne Eyadema, and to the valuable assistance of friendly countries.\n109.\tFrom 1966 to 1971, the total budget of Togo rose by almost 70 per cent. Our balance of payments in 1968 showed a surplus of 795 million CFA francs; that of 1969, a surplus of 3,700 million CFA francs. During the same period, the rate of coverage of our imports by our exports rose from 60 per cent in 1965 to 85 per cent in 1970.\n110.\tTied in with this, Togolese national production, in the course of our first five-year plan, achieved remarkable growth, thanks to State intervention which, by itself and through public organizations, invested close to 10,000 million CFA francs. Agricultural production, the basic strength of our economy since it represents 44.5 per cent of our gross national product, is constantly on the rise. This key sector has an aw rage annual growth rate of 9 per cent.\n111.\tAs will be observed, the Togolese economy has succeeded in crossing the difficult shoals of balances: we are at present at the cross-roads and in search of the indispensable ways and means for our economic take-off. But that take-off cannot be achieved under favorable conditions unless the wealthy countries give up their arbitrary fixing of prices for our raw materials and for their manufactured products; unless they stop their unbridled competition with our commodities by means of reprehensible trade practices; unless they realize that international peace must of necessity proceed from a fair distribution of goods and an equitable remuneration for our efforts. For after all, as Secretary-General U Thant emphasized during the United Nations Day celebration in 1969, \\\"we all belong to the same human race\\\".\n112.\tIt would be unfair to end my statement on an unduly pessimistic note. My Government therefore wishes to pay a tribute to the countries of the European Economic Community, particularly to France and the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as the United Nations Development Program and the specialized agencies of the United Nations, especially the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and others, all of which have been unsparing in their\nefforts to assist us in overcoming hunger, poverty and ignorance.\n113.\tWe sincerely hope that many other countries will follow suit and help us to become real \\\"developing\\\" countries not, as an eminent economist rightly but humorously remarked, \\\"under-developing\\\" countries. This cannot be achieved unless, in our so-called consumer society of intemperate selfishness, development is regarded as an instrument in the service of man and of all men. Man is ever at the center of the systems of philosophy prevailing in all parts of the world. It would be reassuring if, in their daily activities, in the day-to-day exercise of their heavy responsibilities, statesmen were to keep in mind what Albert Camus rightly and most aptly observed, namely that \\\"unless men can refer to a common set of values, recognized by all anJ every one, then man will become incomprehensible to man\\\". Let us meditate on that thought.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "38.\t  I should like, on behalf of Australia,, to extend my congratulations to Mr. Adam Malik, upon his election as President of the General Assembly, Indonesia and Australia are close, not only geographically, but also in our governmental and personal relationships. We are aware of the courageous and energetic role which the President has played both at the time of Indonesia's independence and since. We value his efforts in fostering the development of a sense of community and a pattern of co-operation in South-East Asia. He will recall our own active co-operation with his initiative in calling together the Djakarta Conference on the question of preserving peace in the Khmer Republic in May 1970.\n39.\tWe welcome the Assembly's decision this year to draw its President from Indonesia. We believe that Mr. Malik especially merited this honor. We have no doubt that he, as President, will uphold the high standards established by his illustrious predecessors, and not least by his immediate predecessor, Ambassador Hambro of Norway, who graced the office of President with such notable distinction throughout the twenty-fifth anniversary year of the United Nations.\n40.\tWe are conscious that this is the last session of the General Assembly that will be graced by the presence of our greatly respected and esteemed Secretary-General. I should like at this time to express my Government's warm regard for UThant and its high appreciation of the dedicated service that he has given to this Organization throughout his 10 years in office.\n41.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to welcome most warmly Bahirain, Bhutan and Qatar to membership in the United Nations.\n42.\tOur President assumes the presidency at a time when the problems which face us are especially complex and troublesome. These problems are not made here; and, sadly, acceptable solutions are not found here as often as we could wish. But we believe that, by exercising patience and tolerance and by seeking to find what is in the interests of all, this Assembly can continue to do much towards increasing international understanding.\n43.\tBecause it is of special concern to my country, I should like first of all to speak about the Asian and Pacific region. There are many problems in this area that are new and pressing, and many which, with goodwill and understanding, we might well be able to bring nearer to solution.\n44.\tIt is true that in some parts of South-East Asia today situations of misery and tragedy persist. Fortunately, it is also true that in other parts of the region there exist not only peace and stability but a good prospect that this peace and stability can be preserved, in spite of the threats and challenges which are present. This is so particularly in the case of our nearest neighbors-Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. All are well acquainted with dangers and threats. All have taken, and are taking, imaginative measures to construct political, economic and social defenses not only against those dangers they have known in the past, but also against those which perceptive leaders can foresee for the future.\n45.\tI referred a moment ago to the r ile of our President in the development of a sense of community in South-East Asia. The Charter itself recognizes the value that may flow from regional arrangements. There are several such arrangements that hold promise. The Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN], for example, has not sought to cut a figure on the world's stage. But it has sought to cut and is cutting a swath through old prejudices and problems in South-East Asia. There is developing in the region a sense of common .interest and a readiness to tackle the region's problems on the basis of that interest, The sense of community being established and the machinery that has been created to service it provide new promise of future stability and progress. Australia is not a member of that Association, but it is a sympathetic and interested observer.\n46.\tWe are ourselves a member of the Asian and Pacific Council [ASPACJ, which is also making a valuable contribution towards neighborly understanding and co-operation. We firmly believe that regional developments of this kind, together with such other organizations and programs as the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, the Asian Development Bank, the Mekong Valley Scheme and the Colombo Plan for Co-operative Development in South and South-East Asia help to secure peace and to promote prosperity in the area and, indeed, help to strengthen the position of the United Nations. In saying this I have in mind that Asia and the Pacific are of increasing significance to the stability of the whole world order.\n47.\tIt is the great wish of my country to see conditions created that will remove suffering and allow people to progress to better standards of living in greater security. In Asia, as elsewhere, we know how dependent, political and economic stability are upon one another. We are unlikely to achieve stable economic progress in the area while countries are subject to threats and political subversion from outside. We realize, of course, that we cannot effectively advance the welfare of the developing countries unless the world economy as a whole including especially that of the most advanced countries is healthy and dynamic, unless the frontiers of production and trade are constantly moving forward.\n48.\tIn Indo-China the war that has torn the area for so long still continues. There has been some decrease in the scale of fighting, but the earnest desire of the Australian Government-and most other Governments-for a peaceful and just settlement has not yet been realized. The policy of my Government has been to support every initiative genuinely designed to end the destruction and hardship this conflict has caused,\n49.\tUnhappily, we do not yet have any indication that the leaders of North Viet-Nam are prepared to keep their troops within their own borders and to leave the other countries of Indo-China to determine their own future, and while North Viet-Nam maintains its present policies Australia will continue to give such help as it can to the Governments and peoples of the Republic of Viet-Nam, the Khmer Republic and the Kingdom of Laos in their struggle to survive and to exercise their own choice of their system of government and their way of life. The progress that has been achieved in the security situation of the Republic of Viet-Nam has now enabled the Australian Government to announce that its combat forces will be withdrawn by the end of this year. Our aid program will continue, and we shall continue to support genuine efforts to achieve a just and peaceful settlement.\n50.\tI want to stress my Government's hope that once a settlement is reached it will prove possible for many nations outside IndO-China to join in a program of reconstruction and development for the war-ravaged peoples of this area, including the people of North Viet-Nam. That is most important. The United Nations, although it has been unable to play any effective peace-keeping role in Indo-China, could then be a major channel for economic and social aid to the area.\n51.\tAs other speakers have mentioned, millions of refugees have in the last few months moved from East Pakistan into India, creating a tragic human problem so vast that no one of us single-handed can deal with the situation. I do not try to canvass the events that have caused this exodus. Views may differ on that subject. We have ourselves regarded the events in East Pakistan as essentially an internal problem to be solved by the Pakistan Government. But the refugees must be cared for and as soon as possible returned to their homes.\n52.\tAlong with many others, the Australian Government and people have already made a contribution to helping the refugees. We shall continue to watch the refugee situation with close concern and to help where we can. But we believe it calls for continuing action by the United Nations with the full backing of its Member States.\n53.\tMay I turn now to the area of the South Pacific. On many islands scattered over d vast expanse of ocean live upwards of 4 million people. Great stretches of sea have divided them and have at the same time and for centuries been the Highroad between them. We perceive in this area a growing sense of community with the modern world and a desire on the part of the peoples of this region to join together to help one another.\n54.\tMembers of the Assembly will be aware that there has been in existence for many years a South Pacific Commission comprising representatives of Governments within, and traditionally involved in, the area. This Commission meets annually to consider ways and means of promoting the economic and social welfare of the island peoples. But perhaps not all members are' ware that the Governments of the South Pacific islands this year took the initiative in meeting, together with Australia and New Zealand, in a new and separate forum to discuss a wider range of common problems, including political issues. It is called the South Pacific Forum. New Zealand acted as host to its first meeting last August. Australia will have the honor of playing host to the second meeting, which is expected to take place early next year.\n55.\tI mention this development because it furnishes another illustration of regional self-help. Also, I wish to remind Member States that special problems face these countries because of their small size and the vastness of their ocean setting.\n56.\tIt will be difficult for them to cope with these problems alone. Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France and the United States have long been engaged in providing assistance to them, and I believe that will continue. But there is a need for other Members and for the agencies of our Organization, which have indeed already become involved to some degree, to study what further help may be required in the future.\n57.\tPapua and New Guinea, which Australia continues to administer and in which this Organization has a special interest, as half of it is a Trust Territory, stands between South-East Asia and the South Pacific, The territory is already a member of the South Pacific Commission. When it achieves nationhood it is expected to join the South Pacific Forum.\n58.\tThe Papua and New Guinea House of Assembly has now decided that internal self-government should be attained between 1972 and 1976, if it should be made clear during the elections to the House of Assembly early next year that that is what the people wish. My Government has endorsed that view and has made it clear that after full self-government it will be for the Government of Papua and New Guinea to determine when it wishes to have full independence.\n59.\tIn view of the importance of the 1972 elections, my Government is pleased that the Trusteeship Council has accepted an invitation to send a visiting mission to observe them.\n60.\tI turn now to the question of China. We believe that there has in recent times been evidence of a change of attitude on the part of the People's Republic of China, and, as the representative of a country whose future is closely associated with the peace and progress of the Asian and Pacific region, I want to reaffirm here that we will welcome the development of a more fruitful relationship between the People's Republic of China and the international community as a whole.\n61.\tWe have ourselves been trying to increase contacts between Australia and the People's Republic of China for many years. For years we have had substantial two-way trade with it and we hope that contacts between our two countries will continue to grow to the enhancement of mutual understanding.\n62.\tWe have welcomed the news of the forthcoming visit to Peking by the President of the United States. We hope that this visit will help to usher in a new era in international relations. \n63.\tWe want the People's Republic of China to join us here in our efforts to realize the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Our position on this has been made quite clear. We think the People's Republic of China should be represented in the United Nations. It is also our view that it should occupy a permanent seat in the Security Council. We have joined in co-sponsorship of a draft resolution [A/L.633J, now before the Assembly, which seeks to achieve these two objectives.\n64.\tIn other words, we accept and advocate the acceptance by others of the realities of the China situation. But, of course, one of the realities is that the Republic of China is and has been since the beginning of the Organization a loyal and responsible Member. In our view there should be no question of expelling it.\n65.\tThe claims of the People's Republic of China and of the Republic of China are at present irreconcilable: each claims to be the sole Government of China; each claims jurisdiction over territory that is in fact controlled by the other. So far as de facto control is concerned, the reality is that the People's Republic of China controls the mainland and the Republic of China controls Taiwan. We consider that this reality should be reflected in the decisions of this Organization by providing for the representation of both.\n66.\tWe are conscious of the fact that the Republic of China governs 14.5 million people, more than the population of Australia-and, in terms of population, Australia is by no means one of the smallest Members of this Organization. We believe that any resolution which would result in depriving the Republic of China of representation in the United Nations is an important question under Article 18 of the Charter. We think that all Members, particularly small Members, need to reflect upon this point. In these circumstances, we have ourselves decided to co-sponsor a draft resolution before this Assembly to have such a question declared to be important [A/L.632].\n67.\tI have spoken earlier on our efforts to assist other countries of the Asian aiid Pacific region, which is one of special concern to us. I do not wish to convey the impression that our efforts are now, or will be in the future, limited to that region. Members will be aware that we have, either directly or in concert with others or working with specialized agencies, tried, according to our ability, to help developing countries in other areas. Indeed, our aid has recently passed the figure of 1 per cent of our gross national product.\n68.\tWe subscribe to the objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade, which contemplate a reinforcement of our efforts and the accelerated advancement of those who need advancement most. But all- of our accomplishment and our hopes will be placed in jeopardy if we cannot order the world economy so that it operates smoothly and dynamically. I say this because we are now confronted with an economic situation of more gravity than we have known for decades. I do not think that there is any reason to believe that we shall not meet and deal with this situation. But we must approach our problems with care, we need to safeguard those economic blessings we have won with such effort in the past; and we need to use whatever means are available to us, including those within the United Nations system, to bring us through to calmer economic waters.\n69.\tWe all know that the developed countries have found it more difficult in recent years to maintain stability in their domestic economies at the upper level of economic activity. The struggle with inflation has been almost as troublesome as was, in an earlier period, the struggle against deflation. These domestic troubles have inevitably had their impact on international economic relationships. The international currency system has come under strain, and some adjustments may now be needed. The great movement towards liberalization of trade has slowed; some fear that it may be reversed. I believe we have learned too much to permit those fears to be realized, but they should not be ignored. Too much depends on this.\n70.\tUntil we can achieve stability in the domestic economies of the developed countries, the risks of economic distress will be present for all of us. Until we can firmly establish a sound international currency system and a health} and dynamic international trade, both the developed and the developing countries could suffer serious distress. Markets could shrink; capital flows could be reduced; international economic aid, which in some cases has already tended to be reduced, could fall still further.\n71.\tPerhaps this twenty-sixth session of the Assembly might be an occasion for us to renew, however informally, our will to seek co-operative solutions to the world's economic problems. This does not mean that we should intrude into areas in which other international bodies are energetically engaged in seeking solutions, whether in the field of the currency system or the field of trade. But we should move forward in a practical way in those agencies which operate within the United Nations structure. The Australian delegation hopes that the proposals now before the Assembly to reinvigorate the Economic and Social Council will be accepted. We hope too that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, when it meets in Santiago in April next year, will address itself to major matters that can be classified as ripe for settlement.\n72.\tI have referred to proposals to reinvigorate the Economic and Social Council. One of those proposals is to establish a new committee on science and technology. We welcome this decision.  At the twenty-fifth session of the Assembly we co-sponsored the draft resolution which became resolution 2658 (XXV), on the role of modern science and technology in development . However, I feel bound to say that we have had some reservations about the way in which many of the United Nations organizations have become separately involved in this field. In general, the machinery seems to have grown up ad hoc rather than in accordance with any considered plan. The result has been a proliferation of committees and organizations with consequential problems of co-ordination. Care will obviously be needed to ensure that any new committee does not become merely an additional element of confusion and complexity, through its own round of meetings, working groups and seminars and its own weight of documentation and increased demands on an already overburdened Secretariat.\n73.\tThe General Assembly is in the midst of preparations for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held in Stockholm next year, which could have far-reaching effects on man's need to use, not to abuse, the natural endowments of this planet. Although Australia is not a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Conference, we have followed, and to the fullest extent possible participated in, the United Nations' work on this subject. We believe there is a need to create greater awareness of our objectives. Given this recognition, it may be possible to devote a greater share of the resources produced by economic policies of growth to our common advantage.\n74.\tWe do not see attempts simply to reverse or slow down the process of economic growth as a particularly constructive or realistic approach. There is an essential need for balance in our approach. Preservation of a benign human environment in all its aspects must be a constant aim. At the same time it should be seen as an essential part of the developmental process, and not as an element inhibiting economic growth.\n75.\tIn my remarks to this Assembly today, I have given some emphasis to matters affecting the region in which we ourselves live. At the same time I am very fully aware of the other great issues that many representatives have raised.\n76.\tNone of us can ignore, for example, the grave situation in the Middle East, which continues to defy solution, or again, the serious problems of southern Africa. We are all too painfully conscious of the lack of progress towards agreement on improving the United Nations machinery for keeping the peace. I have not, in the course of this statement, referred to the complexities of disarmament or to the progress made on the question of the peaceful uses of outer space. The search for comprehensive agreements to define the law of the sea and the use of the resources of the sea-bed could command a whole chapter itself.\n77.\tAustralia is deeply conscious of these other issues. We stand ready to play our part, where it seems there is any useful part for us to play. Finally, I take the opportunity to affirm this belief: that, with all the limitations which time and circumstances have revealed, the United Nations still remains the best repository so far devised of the finest\nhopes and aspirations of mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "88.\t Mr. President, having been in office as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands for a relatively short time, I cannot suppress a sense of awe and humility in addressing this august body for the first time. But any trepidation I might feel is dispelled by the pleasure and satisfaction of seeing you, Sir, in the Chair of this Assembly. Allow me to pay you the respects of my Government and my delegation upon your election to the highest office the General Assembly can bestow. I should like to associate myself with those previous speakers who have from this rostrum addressed warm congratulations to you and pledged their cooperation and support in your heavy task. In view of the friendly relationship so happily existing between our countries at the present time, as demonstrated by the recent successful State Visit by Her Majesty the Queen and His- Royal Highness the Prince of the Netherlands to your country, I venture to add a personal good wish for a fruitful and smooth session under your guidance: banjak rezeki [much luck].\n89.\tI should also like to express our appreciation for the splendid work done by your distinguished predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, who not only presided over the historic twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly with great dignity and competence, but has also, between the last session and the present one and in many parts of the world, espoused the cause of the United Nations,\n90.\tWe are living in a world of increasing contradictions; that '-'as been said before. All nations are becoming ever more dependent on each other for the advancement of their well-being. This increasing interdependence inexorably results from old and modern developments.\n91.\tEconomic changes within nations or groups of nations have world-wide consequences. The technological break-through does not halt at national frontiers. The threat of nuclear annihilation is of concern to the whole of mankind, as are the inroads on environmental well-being. The suppression of freedom of thought and political liberty is still with ib. The continuing imbalance between rich and poor, between \\\"haves\\\" and \\\"have-nots\\\" with respect to population pressure, is a cause of deep concern.\n92.\tAll those factors necessitate action on a world-wide basis to achieve a peaceful and orderly adjustment and underline the interdependence of the world. Which world?\n93.\tWhile, for the well-being of its peoples, the world depends on the strengthening of our co-operation, the Netherlands Government-like many others-observes with growing concern a number of regrettable developments which indicate disintegration, Within many nations tensions are growing and from time to time erupting in bloodshed and sorrow. No one can be indifferent to such strife, misery and anguish, and the world has the right and the duty to ask what went wrong and why.\n94.\tWe condemn all denials of human rights including apartheid. My Government's hope of eliminating the apartheid policies by means of a continuing dialog is in keeping with the spirit and the basic philosophy of the Charter. The Netherlands delegation will play its part in the deliberations of this Assembly on measures to combat apartheid and other forms of violation of human rights; indeed, we cannot remain silent in the face of them, wherever they may occur. The machinery available to the international community at present cannot essentially facilitate or promote the universal observance of human rights. Therefore, the Netherlands Government fervently hopes that this session of the Assembly will, as a step in the right direction, decide to create the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as recommended by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 14 (XXIII).\n95.\tTensions within nations-tensions also between nations. The world has little to be proud of as the record of violence and discord is examined. Tensions, between nations and between groups of nations persist and erupt violently from time to time, differing sometimes in character or scope, but remaining very much alive.\n96.\tIn spite of these negative tendencies there are, in our view, also some significant improvements in the international situation. In this respect, the Netherlands Government particularly welcomes the impending enlargement of the European Economic Community not only as a development in the interest of the European peoples themselves but also as a positive step forward for the world as a whole. The Community's recent decision to introduce a general system of trade preferences for all developing countries illustrates its interest in and understanding of the needs of less developed countries, although I realize that that decision does not solve all their problems. The larger and the stronger the Community, we feel, the better will Western Europe be placed to promote world trade, economic development and, therefore, peace and stability in the world.\n97.\tOther aspects of recent political developments in Europe are equally worthy of note here, as they are bound to have world-wide repercussions. Matters of European security particularly are under active consideration. The Netherlands Government has been engaged in discussions on European security for some time and will continue these consultations. Aware that substantial progress on the future of the divided city of Berlin is one of the prerequisites for any multilateral conference on European security, my Government welcomes the results of the four-Power negotiations and expresses the hope that they will soon lead to a final and satisfactory agreement.\n98.\tBut no European security, and therefore no stability in the world, is possible without peace in the Mediterranean and, to be more explicit, in the Middle East. Inversely, progress on peaceful settlement in the Middle East will undoubtedly facilitate progress on European security. The great Powers, as permanent members of the Security Council, and the parties directly concerned, bear a heavy responsibility for taking a constructive approach to the search for a solution to the divisions in that sensitive area of the world. Looking forward to such an approach, my Government feels that a degree of optimism on further favorable developments in Europe is not out of place, since the repeated attempts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to arrive at consultations with the Eastern European countries on mutual and balanced force reductions now seem to find favor with the Soviet Union and its allies. We particularly welcome this ray of hope, because, in our view, any hint of possible progress in the fields of arms control and arms reduction will facilitate the work entrusted to the United Nations in this field under the Charter.\n99.\tAll these are welcome signs. As the representative of a European Power, I have highlighted some European developments of note, but in other parts of the world we also discern encouraging signs of growing international co-operation.\n100.\tI could cite many examples: Latin America', a continent in which the Kingdom of the Netherlands, present through its components Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles, is so directly interested; Africa; and other parts of the world. I shall mention just one example: the Association of South-East Asian Nations, of which organization your country, Mr. President, is such an outstanding member.\n101.\tIn general, however, the developments in international co-operation are too few in number, too weak in the face of the tremendous problems confronting us, too limited in scope for the interests of the world as a whole. Disintegration within nations, disintegration of the relationships between nations, unfortunately, outweighs the progress we have made.\n102.\tInterdependence on the one hand, and our inability to stem the tides of national and international strife on the other hand, face us with the question of how we should react.\n103.\tWe should set ourselves an ultimate goal, a fixed policy which will be an expression of our interdependence and of our will to overrule our divergences. It is my firm opinion that we will have to find that ultimate answer in a world executive, controlled by a world legislative. I am not advocating abandoning national identities, but, indeed, in their own interest to adapt them to common rules applicable on a world-wide basis in those fields where national or regional arrangements are no longer adequate. Here in the United Nations we shall, by our common decisions and by the authority we give to our institutions, go forward step by step on this undoubtedly arduous and long path. We should, however, fail in our responsibilities towards humanity, and particularly towards future generations, if we would not plan our future actions on the basis of a firm belief that the United Nations must become, and indeed is on tV>e way to becoming, a world authority.\n104.\tIn following this policy, our guiding principle should be modesty. By means of modest advances we should try to make the United Nations more workable and more constructive, Our deliberations should always have clear objectives and debates should be directed towards decisions which should be guidelines for national policies.\n105.\tIn view of our ultimate goal, I should like to stress three prerequisites: first, the universality of the Organization; second, adequate procedural methods for our work; and third better selection of the fields of action for this Organization.\n106.\tOur first task is to achieve, as soon as practicable, the universality of the United Nations, as you, Mr. President, in your opening address to this Assembly [1934th meeting] so rightly stressed.\n107.\tIn this respect I wish to emphasize that the Nether-lands, which has had diplomatic relations with the people's Republic of China for more than 20 years, looks forward to welcoming the People's Republic at this session of the Assembly, As was stated in the recent Speech from the Throne:\n\\\"For the lessening of political tension in the world, my Government deems it indispensable that the People's Republic of China participate in the deliberations of the United Nations.\\\"\n108.\tI take this opportunity also to welcome the three new Members who were admitted to the United Nations last week: Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar. Their presence in this hall will contribute towards the better attainment of the Charter's purposes.\n109.\tSecondly, I wish to stress the necessity of purposeful methods, both institutional and procedural, in order to make optimal use of the talents and resources available to us. It may be considered of minor importance, but I should like to welcome the report of the Special Committee on the Rationalization of the Procedures and Organization of the General Assembly. The consensus which existed in that Committee seems a good omen for our future activities,\n110.\tThirdly and in view of various reports of Governments and pJvate institutions, I am aware that such thoughts are shared by many-I am of the opinion that we, the Members of the United Nations, should concentrate our activities on those matters, even modest ones, which open possibilities for world-wide progress. In that respect there is plenty of room for improvement. The Members of the United Nations should always ask themselves, when they are planning to put items on the agenda of the General Assembly or of other United Nations organs, whether results may be expected in a reasonable time; whether they are not squandering time, talents and resources on questions which can only be tackled usefully in some stronger and more united international structure of the future. Even this modest approach would leave the United Nations, today, with plenty of important work to do. We need a selective choice of activities Which ones am I thinking of?\n111.\tConcrete progress can be made within the framework of the United Nations towards world-wide international co-operation for development. This is one of the most important forms of co-operation in which the United Nations is actively engaged. In your opening address, Mr. President recalled that, a year ago, we proclaimed the 1970s as the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] and that, at the same time, we adopted the International Development Strategy which should guide us to secure its objectives. Those of us who were present at that historic session will remember the general and unanimous sense of purpose and dedication expressed by all delegations which pledged their support for this grand design. However, the first year of the Decade has gone by and the time has now come to decide on action.\n112.\tOn behalf of the Netherlands Government, I can assure you, Mr, President, that we shall continue and strengthen our efforts to attain the objectives of the Second Development Decade along the lines of the Strategy agreed upon last year.\n113.\tAn important factor in maintaining the dynamic character of our co-operation for development will be the periodic review and appraisal of achievements and short-comings. Many organs of the United Nations family will be called upon to play their roles in this procedure, each in its own sphere of competence, with special emphasis on the essential part played by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in the fields of trade and aid. In the opinion of my delegation, the Economic and Social Council, under the provisions of the Charter, is specifically designated to co-ordinate all necessary reviews and to prepare a comprehensive report for the General Assembly. At present, the Council with its limited membership may not be regarded as sufficiently representative to play this role in a satisfactory fashion. The Netherlands delegation, therefore, welcomes and supports the recommendation adopted by the Council this summer in its resolution 1621 A (LI) that the General Assembly prepare the necessary measures in order to increase the Council's membership.\n114.\tWhile discussing these problems of economic co-operation, I also want to express our grave concern about the present monetary crisis in the world. We hope that wisdom will prevail and that all parties concerned will be willing to contribute to the solution of this baffling problem. Otherwise, it would be difficult to avoid serious impairment of world trade, with particularly grave consequences for the developing countries. Their continuous economic growth depends to a large extent on their ability to maintain and increase their export to the profitable markets of the developed countries. The interests of all concerned should, therefore, be taken into account, not only in the short-term decisions, but also in the long-term negotiations on any revision of the monetary system.\n115.\tConcrete progress can be made within the framework of the United Nations when this session will give human rights all the attention they deserve in the interests of the dignity and worth of the human person. In .this respect I wish to reiterate the Netherlands' strong support for the creation of the post of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights by the Assembly at this session.\n116.\tAlso, my Government is in favor of the progressive development of the humanitarian institution of territorial asylum, which my country has applied consistently during the course of the centuries. It is well known that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees considers ll highly important that the Declaration on Territorial Asylum [resolution 2312(XXII)] be strengthened by the adoption of a convention ruling this subject. My Government, too, would welcome such a step.\n117.\tMankind has from its very beginning, been plagued by natural disasters, which have wrought immeasurable sufferings and hardship to millions. It is one of the most hope-giving expressions of solidarity among the peoples of the world that in recent times there has appeared an ever-growing awareness that the international community should give all the help it can afford to give whenever a natural disaster strikes.\n118.\tThe United Nations, embodying the community of nations, can and should play a central part in mobilizing and co-ordinating relief activities, as well as in undertaking and promoting studies for the prevention, control and prediction of natural disasters. Concrete progress within the framework of the United Nations would be the adoption of the recommendation by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1612 (LI) that the Secretary-General should appoint a disaster relief co-ordinator. The Netherlands will give its full co-operation to ensure the smooth functioning of all such arrangements and will continue to make available, in the event of natural, and also man-made, disasters, its contributions through the appropriate channels of the United Nations system.\n119.\tWe are witnessing a new disaster in South Asia. We hope that a United Nations presence in Pakistan will enhance the efficacy of the relief operation of the international community. Who hope as well that a substantial flow of resources, provided in response to the appeal by the Secretary-General, will be channeled to Pakistan and II Jia, as the prevailing situation is a very serious set-back in the development of those countries.\n120.\tIn the future, when the function of the disaster relief coordinator has been established, I hope that, wherever feasible, his assistance will also be called upon in the case of man-made disasters.\n121.\tConcrete progress is urgently needed in formulating an action plan to protect our environment. In June 1972, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to be held at Stockholm will have to take important decisions which will have great impact for the world at large. Let us come to Stockholm well prepared.\n122.\tThis session of the General Assembly will be faced with some important decisions in this respect, particularly on the preparation of a general declaration on the human environment. I promise the full co-operation of the Netherlands, convinced that world-wide action through the United Nations is essential in this field,\n123.\tWars, even more horrifying than natural disasters, have been and are another scourge of mankind. General and complete disarmament under adequate international control should remain our firm goal; but here, too, I should like to counsel modesty in order to achieve concrete progress. It has not been huge international gatherings, but the quiet expert framework of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva that has made it possible to break the back of many highly technical and complex disarmament problems. For this reason the Netherlands Government attaches great value to the continuation of the proceedings of this negotiating forum. I express the hope that in a not too distant future all nuclear Powers will participate in the work of this Committee.\n124.\tIt is with pleasure and satisfaction that we have taken note of the most recent result of the Committee's deliberations, that is, a draft Convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction [A/8457-DC/234. annex A]. My country is co-sponsoring this draft convention and I hope that this General Assembly will endorse it unanimously. In this context it seems appropriate to me to emphasize that this draft convention-albeit important in itself-is only a first step that will have to be followed by similar measures in the field of chemical weapons.\n125.\tIt is also my pleasure to announce that the constitutional procedure for ratification by the Netherlands of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] will start during the current session of the Netherlands Parliament.\n126.\tI emphatically recommend as a field for concrete progress the activities of the United Nations to end colonialism. The world must eradicate, as soon as possible, the last remnants of an era which definitely belongs to the past. The Netherlands will give its full co-operation to the search for peaceful solutions for the problems of southern Africa, whether they concern the Portuguese colonial territories, Namibia or Rhodesia.\n127.\tIn the view of my delegation the key-word in our activities is \\\"peaceful\\\". In this respect, I should like to express the appreciation of the Netherlands Government for the decision of the Security Council in its resolution 284 (1970) to ask for an advisory opinion on Namibia from the International Court of Justice.\n128.\tLikewise, we welcome the wise and useful opinion of the Court, with which I am happy to say we in the Netherlands have the very best relations. My country accepts the conclusions of the Court as a guideline for its policies. We are hopeful that its opinion might stimulate all organs of the United Nations, in conformity with the provisions of Article 96 of the Charter, to engage the Court more often in questions which it might with profit review. In this way it will be possible to lift controversial issues out of the sphere of \\\"emotional and political passion onto the plane of objective juridical deliberation and advice.\n129.\tThose are some of the questions which the Assembly might tackle here and now with profit, and to which my delegation will therefore address itself with energy and in concert with others.\n130.\tSome time ago our Secretary-General U Thant-to whom I want to pay a warm tribute at the concluding stage of his eminent career as the world's top international civil servant-said on the occasion of United Nations Day 1970:\n\\\"The world is bursting out of its narrow political vestments. The behavior of many nations is certainly inadequate to meet the new challenges of our small and rapidly changing planet. International co-operation is lagging considerably. The United Nations, this hesitant, almost reluctant instrument of nations for world peace and unity, can only succeed if its constituent Members support it, love it, give it their best and want it to succeed. It will fail if Governments scoff at it and continue to tread their isolated, divisive and selfish paths.\\\"\n131.\tLast year Member States rendered an account of what they had made of the United Nations. But they also looked ahead and rededicated themselves to the ideals of San Francisco and to the aims and purposes of the Charter.\n132.\tToday it cannot truthfully be said that the world presents a rosier picture than it did last year thanks to the activities of our Organization. The world is rightly shocked and angered by the abject misery of millions of people caught in cruel political strife they did not want but could not avert. The peoples of the United Nations are disheartened when they hear about renewed tensions in areas where United Nations activities had restored a measure of peace and quiet. They are indignant because the end of colonialism is not yet in sight and because racial discrimination is still the official government policy in a small area of our planet. They shake their heads in disbelief when they hear that some States, although rightly concerned about racial discrimination and apartheid, at the same time oppose the creation of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. To put it in a nutshell, the peoples of the United Nations fail to understand why their representatives in New York do not match their words with deeds.\n133.\tAnd yet gloom should not prevail in these halls. I see a lofty goal ahead: gradually the United Nations must be developed into a world authority. The attainment of this goal will take time-much time. Every concrete, common decision we take is a step in the direction of our ultimate aim.\n134.\tI have tried to outline some of the fields in which, in the opinion of the Netherlands, constructive steps can be taken. To those who would object that such steps would \\\"depoliticize\\\" the United Nations., that they are limited to a pedestrian, technical level, and that they do not deal with the burning political questions of our time, I should like to put the question: what responsibilities and tasks should Governments assume-on both the national and international levels-to make this world a better place for our citizens to live in? Surely it is the task of Governments to promote, nationally and internationally, conditions favorable to human well-being. Politics in themselves do not create a better world. It is the objective-or, if you want, the vocation-of politics to create conditions which would enable man in freedom and responsibility to make a greater contribution to the happiness and well-being of himself and his fellow men.\n135.\tIf the Members of the United Nations dedicate themselves to the tasks they can do in the present world situation, if they are realistic in their aims while keeping ultimate goals in mind and if this Organization does not fail in vigor and perseverance, it can, and it will, make progress.\n136.\tThe tasks facing us are great and all-embracing. We must therefore arm ourselves with patience, courage and determination.\n137.\tThe Netherlands delegation faces the General Assembly in that spirit and will, with the Almighty's indispensable blessing, make its contribution to a successful twenty-sixth annual session.\n"

        "file_text": "116.\t Mr, President, it is with great pleasure that 1 associate myself with the speakers who have preceded me and address to you my warmest felicitations and those of the Lebanese delegation and express our deep satisfaction in seeing such an eminent representative of our continent presiding over the present session of the General Assembly , The valuable experience which you have acquired during your brilliant career and your great qualities as a statesman assure us that you will conduct our debates with competence and authority,\n117.\tIt Is a pleasure for me also to pay a tribute to Mr. Hambro, who exercised the functions of President of the last session with such competence.\n118.\tI should like to pay a special tribute to Secretary- General U Thant, who brings to the fulfillment of his lofty functions his qualities of heart and spirit, his wisdom, his fairness, and whose untiring efforts to promote international peace and security fully deserve our deep gratitude and confidence.\n119.\tI join those speakers who have preceded me at this rostrum in expressing satisfaction at the admission to our Organization of Bahrain. Qatar and Bhutan, a satisfaction which Lebanon shares. My country will co-operate fully with these three new Member States, to which we are bound by traditional links of friendship.\n120.\tA year ago our Organization celebrated its twenty- fifth anniversary. That was a special occasion when illustrious representatives of Member States reviewed the balance sheet of a quarter century and, examining their conscience in a world-wide sense, and guided by the purposes-and principles of the Charter, congratulated themselves on the success and achievements, but also noted the lacunae and recalled the deficiencies. In the solemnity and fervour of that occasion, with renewed faith in the noble ideals of our Charter, new hopes arose, hopes for a better world corresponding to a greater degree to the aspirations of humanity thirsting for peace, progress, freedom and justice.\u2003\n121.\tBut beyond this glimmer of hope, great tasks were darkening and still darken the horizon of our universe. Conflicts and injustices are being perpetuated and new centers of tension arise.\n122.\tIn our region, the Middle East, we are at the very heart of a most poignant tragedy-which has continued since the very creation of the United Nations. It is the tragedy of the people of Palestine, robbed of their country and evicted from their homes by the use o* violence. This tragedy, which was born of a flagrant injustice more than 20 years ago, continues to shake our region and to inflict upon our population destruction and suffering. Since June 1957, territories belonging to three States Members of the United Nations have been occupied by Israeli forces, and since that date Israel has continued to sabotage all attempts at a political settlement, continuing its military occupation, multiplying its aggressions and subjecting the inhabitants of the occupied territories to a regime of coercion, violence and terror, defying law, equity and the most elementary humanitarian principles.\n123.\tThe situation in Jerusalem is for us a subject of deep concern. The horizon of that city, so peaceful and holy, familiar to millions of human beings, is today disfigured. A systematic plan aimed at depriving Christendom and Islam of their inalienable rights to the Holy City is applied with obstinacy. Pressures of all kinds are exerted on the Christian and Moslem population to force them to expatriate themselves. By expropriation and confiscation, the occupier seizes property which does not belong to him and whose historic and spiritual value is often beyond estimation. He carries out massive destruction, construction of new habitations, in order to present the international community once again with an accomplished fact. But the same community has categorically condemned the acts which have been undertaken by Israel and has declared that they are illegal and invalid. Several resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council have been adopted in that regard.\n124.\tThe Security Council's most recent resolution, resolution 298 (1971), adopted on 25 September 1971, is eloquent in that respect. That resolution expresses the firm will of the international community to oppose categorically the acquisition of territory by force and any modification of the sacred and universal character of the Holy City.\n125.\tEverywhere, in Gaza, in Sinai, in Golan, and on the banks of the Jordan, we find the same affecting spectacle of tortures, demolition, destruction of homes and of whole villages, deportations and expulsions of inhabitants, expropriations- and confiscations-all of them contrary to the international conventions and to resolutions of the United Nations.\n126.\tIt is true that Lebanon and Israel are still bound by the General Armistice Agreement of 1949; yet Lebanon considers that it is directly concerned in the establishment of a just, equitable and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n127.\tFor the establishment of a peace, Lebanon is convinced that it would be vain .o seek an equitable and lasting solution without the total evacuation of Israeli forces from the territories occupied since June 1967, and without due respect for the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n128.\tLebanon also considers that until that solution has been achieved, the services, which are already insufficient, provided by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency to the Palestinian refugees, cannot be reduced without grave consequences, and therefore appeals to all Governments to make up the deficit of the Agency by voluntary contributions, Is it necessary to reaffirm once more the responsibility of the international community as a whole in the creation and perpetuation of this human drama, as well as its obligation to alleviate the situation and, in fact, to put an end to it?\n129.\tAt a moment when I am speaking of the conflict in the Middle East, how can I fail to recall and to stress that my country has suffered and continues to suffer from Israeli aggressions under the most fallacious pretexts which entail loss of human life, the lives of innocent civilians, destruction of property and migration of populations? The Security Council has been repeatedly seized of these complaints by Lebanon.\n130.\tSince June 1967 efforts aimed at bringing about a political settlement have been exerted by the United Nations, by the four great Powers and by other countries. These efforts have been sabotaged by Israel.\n131.\tBy its delays, its evasions, its refusals, Israel has in fact brought the mission of M?arring to a dead end, Has it not already created in the Middle East a state of tension which threatens international peace and security, a situation which is being aggravated day by day?\n132.\tIt is not enough to speak of Israel's defiance of the United Nations and the international community. It is essential to put an end to it.\n133.\tThe United Nations has on several occasions been seized of complaints aimed at putting an end to actions of Israel that violate international law and relevant resolutions adopted by the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. Invariably the international community has condemned Israel. It has been condemned for its aggression against Lebanon and for its behavior in Jerusalem and in the other occupied territories. Its policies and actions have always received condemnation, and severe warnings have been addressed to Israel, On some occasions even very specific threats have been formulated to invoke and apply more effective procedures.\n134.\tUnfortunately, all those resolutions have remained dead letters. Israel has never complied with them. It continues to act as though the United Nations did not exist, or as though its resolutions had never been adopted. Our Organization is therefore confronted with a situation involving the risk of its losing all the credit it still retains-not only in the eyes of States but also in the eyes of world public opinion,\n135.\tThe choice must be made: to be or not to be. For a country such as Lebanon, which is attached to peace and international order, and which places its hopes in the\nUnited Nations, the alternative Involves no hesitation, The United Nations should not allow any of its Members to scorn and continue scorning its decisions. How can the United Nations allow a representative of a Member State to describe a Security Council debuted on Jerusalem as a scenario? And how can it allow a Minister to say that General Assembly resolutions are us predictable as they are insignificant'/ And how can it allow another Minister to declare that his country will refuse to apply the resolutions of the United Nations even If they are adopted unanimously'?\n136, As recently as 26 September 1()71, the Israeli Government rejected resolution 298(1971) on Jerusalem, adopted on the previous day by the Security Council, and declined in the most categorical terms Its absolute refusal to implement it,\n137.\tThe practice of the last 2$ years has unfortunately drawn our Organization away from certain principles of the Charter of the United Nations, The first signatories of the Chatter, the founders of the United Nations, certainly wanted to create a powerful Organization that would be effective and capable of ensuring a new international order, They certainly endowed the Security Council with powerful means of maintaining international peace and security,\n138.\tIn case of a threat to the peace, the Charter, in Chapter VII\u201e contains provisions on the possible application of sanctions. That Chapter must now be invoked by us and be the center of our concern, because we have unfortunately arrived at a position where only the possibility of applying sanctions can produce salutary results, It is, in our view, high time for the United Nations to react vigorously to obtain respect for international order and also to safeguard its own prestige and authority. If the United Nations fails to do so, I am afraid that international law will become void of any meaning and content and will be entirely supplanted by the law of the jungle. And if force eventually wins in inter-State relations, what nation, no matter how strong it may be, can say it will always be sheltered from insecurity and aggression?\n139.\tLebanon, certainly, is a small country. But far from being ashamed of that we claim, on the contrary, on behalf of small States, as a matter of pride and confidence, the privilege of having linked our destiny to law, of having identified our own cause and our own security with the cause of law.\n1445. Hie acuteness of the drama in which we of the Middle East live cannot make us overlook the state of international relations in the rest of the world, nor the great political, economic and social problems still confronting our world on the threshold of the decade.\n141. Hie representatives who spoke before me expressed from IMS rostrum their concern at the armed conflicts still persisting In various parts of the world. However, timid glimmers of hope appear on the horizon. Prospects of settlement appear in the light of recent contacts among Interested Powers. Lebanon can only rejoice* at all the efforts undertaken in that direction, and we hope and wish that these efforts may bring about a just peace that ensures the primacy of the principles of our Organization and its universality, and also takes into account the political realities and the legitimate rights of peoples,\n142,\tLast your the Assembly solemnly affirmed, in its Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [molution 2734 (XXV)J> the fundamental principles that must guide States In their conduct, It is important to see that those principles are applied and translated into deeds,\n143,\tDespite the undeniable achievements and efforts of the United Notions in the field of decolonization, peoples continue to struggle to achieve recognition of their national identity, to accede to freedom and independence. Some timid progress in the negotiations on disarmament, partial agreements and special arrangements recently made - evident signs of the will to attain a detente between antagonistic blocs are welcome, but cannot make us forget the arms race; In history, an arms race has always preceded great conflicts, We are still very far from general and complete disarmament.\n144,\tToday, the peace of the world rests mainly on reciprocal fear and a balance of terror,\n145,\tIt would be Illusory to aspire to bringing about true international peace without radically confronting the poignant problems of underdevelopment, because it is inadmissible for hundreds of millions of people to continue to live under inhuman conditions, a prey to ignorance, sickness and hunger.\n146,\tOne certainly cannot ignore or minimize the actions undertaken by the United Nations and its various agencies on behalf of economic and social development, but the road before us is still long and difficult because the gap between the standard of living of the developing countries and that of the developed countries is getting wider. Just as a great disparity in the standards of living of the nationals of a country is a source of domestic instability, a great disparity in the standards of living of States is a source of international instability. That is why Lebanon hopes that the next United Nations Conference on Trade and Development will erase the feelings of apprehension which the last such Conference has aroused.\n147,\tThe participation of the People's Republic of China in the work of the United Nations will consolidate intentional co-operation, security and peace. It will no doubt contribute to the realization of the objectives and ideals of our Organization.\n148,\tRecent developments in relations between India and Pakistan are a matter of grave concern to us. Lebanon, which maintains traditional relations of friendship and co-operation with both India and Pakistan, is convinced that every effort must be exerted to normalize relations between those two great countries 2nd to find a solution to the humanitarian aspects of the situation.\n149,\tIn our world-ever more dominated by the imperatives of power, military or economic, by the narrow demands of national selfishness, implacably caught in servitude to material progress-Lebanon, a small, peaceful \ncountry, firmly believes in the primacy of law and of moral and spiritual values.\n150. Situated in a region which was the cradle of the three monotheistic religions, a region at present suffering the ravages of violence resulting from a misguided mysticism of force and racist domination, Lebanon is the land of spontaneous democracy, a country in which several communities coexist in a climate of tolerance, freedom and close co-operation.\n13\n151. This is why we are firmly convinced that the full and complete implementation of the purposes and principles of our Charter depends upon the place that is to be accorded to these values. It is under these conditions only that we can achieve some day the golden age of humanity, that ancient dream of all mankind for a future of peace and progress in freedom and justice.\n"

        "file_text": "50.\t Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to express my most sincere congratulations to you on your highly deserved election to preside over the deliberations of the twenty-sixth session of this august Assembly. You have given much of your time to the work of the United Nations, especially when you served as chairman of your country's delegation to the regular sessions of the United Nations General Assembly from 1966 to 1970 and as special envoy of your President to the commemorative twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Sir, the remarkable skill you have displayed as a negotiator, especially in difficult situations, attests to your expert mediating capability. We are confident that the work of the Assembly will progress with much expertise during your tenure of office.\n51.\tMy delegation also wishes to record its deep appreciation of the excellent leadership given by the outgoing President, Edvard Hambro of Norway, during the historic twenty-fifth session of the Assembly and throughout the year that has just elapsed.\n52.\tTo be topical, may I also take this opportunity of recording my Government's sincere appreciation of the sterling services rendered by Mr. Ralph J. Bunche, Under-Secretary for Special Political Affairs, whose retirement on health grounds has just been announced. We fondly remember his historic visits to Africa in the 1950s and we testify to his devotion to the cause of international peace since the founding of this Organization. My delegation prays for his speedy return to perfect health and for his happy retirement.\n53.\tFor my part, it gives me particular pleasure to come here this year as leader of the first delegation to arrive from Sierra Leone since it matured into a Republic on 19 April 1971.\n54.\tOur sincere congratulations go to the Governments and peoples of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar, whose delegations are now seated among us and from whose wisdom we hope to benefit in the work of the various committees of the Organization. We are proud to have recommended their admission to the General Assembly in the first place, and to have voted in their favor when the matter was decided in this august body a few days ago [1934th meeting).\n55.\tOne of the uncertainties now hovering over the future of this Organization is the appointment of a successor to the Secretary-General, who has indicated his intention to retire after completing, at the end of this year, a most illustrious term of office.\n56.\tSecretary-General U Thant has given towering leader-ship, greater in scale and longer in time than any of his predecessors. He has occasionally suffered frustrations because of the intransigence of disputing parties. In spite of all this, however, he has steered the Organization along a course which has brought peace, prosperity and progress to, millions of people all over the world. My Government wishes to thank this very great international civil servant for the successful endeavors in which he has been involved over the past 10 years, and we should like to give him our best wishes for his future which, we hope, will always be linked in some way with this Organization in its struggle for international peace and security.\n57 Perhaps our greatest tribute to this distinguished international statesman after a decade of dedicated service to humanity is to pause and re-examine with critical determination the major problems bedeviling our Organization, so that from his successful record we may derive new inspiration to seek satisfactory and lasting solutions.\n58.\tIn this process of re-examination we cannot adequately review all the problems confronting us. Nor do we need to concentrate, at this crucial period of our Organization's history, on problems that are narrowly regional, Our concern is the larger interest of all mankind, and it is against this background that I wish to make brief comments on the international scene and the role of this Organization within it.\n59.\tPerhaps one of the most serious threats to the success, if not the very existence, of the United Nations is to be found in the Middle East conflict. The struggle between the Arabs and the Jews has rocked the Organization to its very foundations and given much cause for alarm. As my Government sees it. solutions must be found to five interrelated problems before this conflict can be resolved.\n60.\tThe first problem is what we believe to be the genuine fear by Israel that its Arab neighbors want to throw the last Israeli into the sea and to obliterate any trace of the existence of the territory of Israel from the map of the Middle East. Secondly, there is the equally genuine fear by the surrounding Arab countries that Israel is only interested in pursuing an expansionist policy which will ultimately threaten the very foundations of Arab existence. Thirdly, there is the grave question of the resettlement of the Palestinian Arabs. Fourthly, there has recently arisen the complaint about the Judaizing of Jerusalem. And finally, it is of paramount importance to secure the joint co-operation of both parties to the conflict if a lasting solution is to be found within the framework of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n61.\tI need not elaborate upon the first three problems, namely, the fear expressed by the Israelis, the equally genuine fear of the Arab States, and also the resettlement of the Palestinian Arabs. The fourth point concerning the Judaizing of Jerusalem calls for some elaboration, since it is so topical.\n62.\tJerusalem has been for quite a long time now the center of important religious faiths of the world, namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam. To the Jews, Jerusalem is the city of promise. Judaism, however, is practiced by only a very limited sector of the world's population. To the Christians, Jerusalem embodies the very heart of their religion. Christians are found in practically every quarter of the globe, and the city of Jerusalem houses a number of their Holy Places. In like manner, Islam, which is practiced by the vast majority of southern Asians, Africans, the inhabitants of the Arab world, and also by some Europeans and Americans, sees in Jerusalem the center of much of its holiness. Jerusalem, therefore, has an international significance which practically no other city of the world can ever have.\n63.\tSince the six-day war and the occupation of the whole of Jerusalem by Israel, the world has witnessed the Judaizing of Jerusalem. It is reported that the serenity of the Holy City is fast losing its charm by unrestricted measures to urbanize and populate the hitherto sacred areas with Jewish settlements. This process, in the opinion of my\nGovernment, is taking the Arab-Israeli conflict further afield to affect the conscience of many people practicing the international religions of Islam and Christianity.\n64.\tThis Judaizing process must be controlled and even brought to an end if the entire Christian and Moslem world is not to rise up and proclaim a holy war against Israel. For the preservation\\\" of international peace it is therefore important that Israel should immediately desist from this Judaizing process and restore to the Holy City of Jerusalem its peaceful and sacred surroundings and above all its sanctified charm, which should not be marred by tall residential Jewish edifices, factories and other constructions completely alien to religious worship and the sacred character of the Holy City. It is our hope that Israel will agree to make Jerusalem not only accessible to adherents of all three faiths but also expressive of the atmosphere built up by Christianity and Islam over the centuries.\n65.\tAs regards the fifth basic problem-that is to say fostering joint co-operation by the two parties concerned to work out a programme for lasting peace-the Government of Sierra Leone is conscious of the part being played by various institutions to assist the parties to reach an amicable settlement. The Secretary-General appointed the 'Jarring mission to get the parties to talk to one another. After the near stalemate of a year ago, when Israel withdrew from the talks, hopes were restored in January of this year with their resumption.\n66.\tThe great Powers have themselves-singly sometimes, but often jointly-tried to devise or even to impose a settlement. More recently, the Organization of African Unity added its own initiative by the appointment of a 10-man mission to mediate between the parties to the dispute.\n67.\tAll these efforts do not seem to have borne much fruit, Israel has persistently refused to withdraw from the occupied territories as required by resolution 242 (1967), and neither the United Nations nor the great Powers have been able to shift it from that position.\n68.\tIt is the view of my Government that Israel should make a move. Sierra Leone cannot endorse the acquisition of territory by war during this latter half of the twentieth century. Israel should, therefore, agree in principle-I repeat, in principle-to remove or withdraw to the boundaries that were defined by the mandate.\n69.\tIt will then be up to Israel to utilize the Jarring mission to work out whatever modifications of its borders it considers necessary because of recent experience so as to ensure its future defense, particularly by suggesting adjustments in the Gaza Strip, by putting forward proposals about the future of Jerusalem, by securing essential guarantees for access to the Gulf of Aqaba from the port of Elath, and by pressing for the carving-up of possible neutral territory in the Sinai peninsula. It is even understandable that it may want some assurance that Sharm El Sheikh will not again be used to close the Gulf of Aqaba. But these are details to be negotiated with its Arab neighbors and with the assistance of the Jarring mission, and they ought not to stand in the way of Israel accepting the principle of withdrawing from all occupied territories.\n70.\tAt the same time the Sierra Leone Government would counsel that the surrounding Arab States should continue to exercise patience and understanding. We welcome the formation of the new Federation of Arab Republics. We note that one of its principles is unanimity in matters pertaining to defense. My Government fervently hopes that the newly formed Federation will actively continue the policy of seeking a non-military solution rather than putting an end to all hopes of solving the conflict by preparing for an imminent and inevitable battle. For the past three years-or even longer-the entire world has been witnessing the many concessions the Arab States have been making to reach a solution. Thanks to their continued patience and understanding the cease-fire has been in existence for over a year now. It is the fervent prayer of the Sierra Leone delegation that that statesmanlike patience will continue to be exercised until a just and lasting solution is achieved.\n71.\tWe are particularly happy to record that the Organization or African Unity has tried to assist in finding a solution by recently adopting a resolution to set up a goodwill committee to act as mediators. A special 10-man mediation team of eminent Presidents of African States has accordingly been formed and has started upon its arduous but inspiring task by designating four African Heads of State to act on behalf of the members.\n72.\tMy Government looks forward to the support of that mediation team by the United Nations General Assembly. It is, indeed, our belief that this small beginning might be expanded into a United Nations team to embrace the entire United Nations family. We shall accordingly propose that during this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly we may decide to establish a top-level United Nations mediation commission of, say, 16 eminent Heads of State to contact the parties to this dispute and see how best they can bring them to the round table to settle their differences. Without in any way going at this stage into the details of this proposal, we hope that we shall be able to find, say, four Asian leaders, two East European leaders, two West European leaders, and four American and Latin American leaders none of them coming from the great Powers to join forces with the four African leaders already selected, all 16 of whom may be commissioned to mediate this stubborn problem with a view to bringing the parties together at the round table and so make the work of the Jarring mission fruitful and successful without any further delay.\n73.\tIt is, of course, essential not only to create conditions for peace but also to bring about peace and make it lasting. It is therefore the hope of my delegation that the General Assembly will give urgent consideration to constituting another peace-keeping force, to be deployed along the explosive sections of the Arab-Israeli borders for a minimum period, on the condition that no single State of the area can unilaterally have the right to request its partial or total withdrawal during the predetermined period. This peace-keeping force should be removed only if all I repeat, all the parties agree its presence is no longer necessary in any particular area.\n74.\tI now turn my attention to the doctrine of the universality of the United Nations, a doctrine which has gained much in importance during the term of the present Secretary-General, There are signs that most of the icy obstacles to the full implementation of this doctrine are now thawing. It is the hope of my delegation that we shall this year give concrete expression to this doctrine by restoring to the 850 million inhabitants of the People's Republic of China their lawful rights in the several organs of the United Nations.\n75.\tMy delegation has over the years advocated the right of the People's Republic of China to membership in this world Organization. We have stressed the importance of having within its fold a country which represents a quarter of the earth's population and which is also a nuclear Power. Time and again we have stressed the injustice and lack of political realism which keeps 850 million people from being represented in this body. We have drawn attention to the fact that Peking's absence from the United Nations has severely weakened the Organization's ability to grapple realistically with the major problems of the world. We welcome the change of heart on the part of many important and influential Members of this Assembly who have realized the injustice of their policy vis-a-vis the People's Republic of China over the years and are not afraid to set the record straight. As a matter of fact, we heartily congratulate them for their courage in correcting this narrow, partisan and discriminatory policy which has existed for 21 long years.\n76.\tIn terminating the exile of the People's Republic of China, we must avoid creating further Chinese problems, such as two Chinas or one China and one Taiwan, at this stage. For several years, the voting results in the General Assembly have demonstrated that our Members have endorsed the principle of one China. The regime of the Republic of China in Taiwan has, at the same time, always alleged that it is the true Government representing the entire Chinese people. Similarly, the Government of the People's Republic of China has maintained that it represents the whole of China, Taiwan being merely a province of China. Neither party appears to have changed its policy regarding one, and only one, China.\n77.\tThe policy of the Sierra Leone Government, then, can be only that of recognizing one, and only one, China, while at the same time realizing that two separate Governments have been competing for sovereignty over that one China. We, as a non-aligned nation, consider that we would be meddling in the internal affairs of the single friendly country of China if we were to start promulgating or advocating that there were two Chinas, one on the vast mainland, and the other in the territory of Taiwan. And. unless one or both competing Chinese Governments shift their position from one China to two Chinas, we fail to see on what justification the outside world, or the United Nations for that matter, can arrogate to itself the right to impose the doctrine of two Chinas. After much consideration, it is now the policy of the Sierra Leone' Government to recognize the Government of the People's Republic of China as the de jure Government of the whole of China, and we therefore advocate that the Government in Peking should take the Chinese seat in the General Assembly, in the Security Council and in every other relevant organ of the United Nations.\n8\t\n78.\tThe Government of the Republic of China has for the past 25 years been permitted to sit in this Organization as the Government of China, Now, the view of the Sierra Leone Government-and, we trust, of the great majority of the Members here-is that the Government of the Republic of China no longer has the right to be admitted here as the de jure Government of the entire country known as China, a country for which certain express provisions are laid down in the Charter of the United Nations. Under such circumstances, it is OUT hope that the representatives of the Government of the Republic of China will agree to retire with the same grace with which they have hitherto been permitted to attend previous sessions. And if they refuse to retire peacefully, then they may have to be expelled.\n79.\tThe doctrine of universality does not concern only China at this moment of United Nations history. A related and similar problem which has for quite a long time now exercised the United Nations is the problem of the divided States of Germany, Korea and Viet-Nam. The hope has always been entertained by my Government that these divided States would become unified,\n80.\tIn the case of Germany, the problem is the t it was divided as a result of the last world war. However, we from the developing countries are satisfied that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Government of the German Democratic Republic as well have pursued internationally acceptable policies relating to peace, progress and the development of the world community. We feel that the isolation of Germany from this international forum ought to be brought to an end.\n81.\tWe have followed with keen interest the progress of the four-Power talks on Berlin which commenced on 26 March 1970. We welcome the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971, and we wish to commend the efforts of the Powers concerned, particularly the spirit of give-and-take exhibited during the discussions without which the aforementioned agreement would not have been possible. This agreement marks a welcome beginning, and it should be the hope of all of us that the current discussions between the two German States relative to implementation of the principles in the agreement will be successfully completed.\n82.\tOne needs hardly restate that a solution of the Berlin question is necessary, not only for the German people but also for all mankind, as this would greatly contribute to the achievement of European security and world peace. With the evident entente in East-West relations, my Government hopes that all obstacles in the way of the admission of representatives of the people of Germany to this world assembly will soon be removed so that we can welcome them to their rightful places.\n83.\tAs regards the great country of Korea, I must also emphasize that my Government wishes to see the peaceful reunification of both parts within the shortest possible period of time. The war in Korea has long come to an end and we share the view that all foreign troops must be removed from the country, so that the reunification process can be worked out by the Koreans themselves at official levels just as welcome social exchanges are now taking place at the Red Cross level.\n84.\tMy Government is happy to note that, after several years of armed conflict in the Indo-China peninsula at the cost of the lives of hundreds of thousands of people- combatants and civilians alike-enlightened world opinion has now reached the conclusion that the war cannot be won without a resort to massive doses of nuclear arms. This realization has led to a deescalation on the part of the war efforts of the foreign Power mainly involved. We have advocated a cessation of the bombing of North Viet-Nam, which has caused so much suffering and deprivation to an entire generation in that land, and we have stressed the usefulness of negotiations. Therefore the cessation of bombing by the United States and the resumption of talks in Paris, coupled with the gradual withdrawal of contingents of foreign troops from Viet-Nam, offered the right type of atmosphere for serious parley.\n85.\tWe are, however, disturbed at the lack of progress being made at the Paris peace talks, and we urge all parties concerned to approach the problems involved with a fresh outlook of reasonableness and goodwill. Above all, we urge that there should take place as speedily as possible a complete exchange and repatriation of all prisoners of war captured by either side.\n86.\tBut little will be achieved that is lasting unless the settlement takes into account the political realities of the situation. It must give due consideration to the close kinship between North and South Viet-Nam, the community of language, civilization and interest that exists. Unless such a step is taken and carried out, peace in that area will be difficult to come by.\n87.\tBut while hopes are raised that at last the war is being deescalated in Viet-Nam and that the next 12 months will see the gradual reduction of United States military personnel and combatants in that area, a sudden turn of events seems to give the lie to these hopes and to raise serious doubts in the minds of many that the United States seriously intends to withdraw its presence completely.\n88.\tUnder the pretext of reducing or virtually eliminating all threats to the safety of United States combatants, and in order to help speed up their withdrawal, the United States Government has thought fit to extend the conflict to Laos and Cambodia two neighboring countries which it accused of providing sanctuaries for the Viet-Cong and North Viet-Nam regulars. Parts of Laos are being subjected to intensive bombing and gun-fire which take a toll of the lives of innocent men, women and children and sometimes animal and vegetable life without discrimination. We consider it unjustifiable that the Kingdom of Laos should be denied the actual exercise of sovereignty over parts of its own territory. What is true of Laos is also true of Cambodia, where foreign intervention is causing irreparable loss to life and property, and basic human rights and respect for human life and dignity are being trampled underfoot by all sides. It is our hope that good sense will prevail, and that the United States Government will leave the people of those countries to pursue life in the way they think best.\n89.\tNo examination of present-day world problems will be complete if we do not express our concern about the possible escalation of the current India-Pakistan tension in the Bengal region and the constant flow of refugees who continue to flee from East Pakistan into India.\n90.\tWe congratulate the Secretary-General for the masterly way in which he has faced up to the realities of the situ? \\\"on. His memorandum of 20 August to the President of the Security Council provides that body with a balanced assessment of the situation. His quiet diplomatic move and his great concern for the sufferings of the refugees resulted in increased international assistance and, within the Secretariat, in the' setting up of the Office for Inter-Agency Affairs as a focal point.\n91.\tThere have been conflicting reports as to the root- cause of the present tension. Our friends in India blame it on repressive policies within Pakistan, whereas our friends in Pakistan insist that the trouble has continued because India has been encouraging dissident elements in East Bengal.\n92.\tIt seems to us that there is a definite need for a United Nations observer goodwill mission to be sent to the area to find out the facts and inform this Organization about what is really happening, since this event is of a scale worse and more disastrous than anything which has occurred in that area since the founding of the United Nations. There is a definite danger of a violent eruption which could be averted by such an observer goodwill mission. Here we believe that the way out may be found by the Secretary-General's utilizing the joint efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. My delegation would commend both Commissions for the admirable services they are rendering in the cause of humanity.\n93.\tI have indicated that I do not intend to be parochial. I shall, however, mention some of the endemic political ills of Africa, which are all well known.\n94.\tOn the question of decolonization, we had hoped that the change of Government in Portugal would have led to a reappraisal of that country's policies of colonialism concerning Guinea (Bissau), Cabinda, Mozambique and Angola. It is with regret that we observe, however, that entrenched interests in Portugal have prevented the taking of the steps necessary for the realization of African independence in those Territories. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the military attacks being made by Portugal against our neighbors in the Republics of Guinea and Senegal. We cannot be passive onlookers while Portugal uses its association with certain Western nations as a cloak to continue to live in the glories of art imperialistic past, when other nations in Western Europe have long ago abandoned this negative policy,\n95.\tWe continue to be concerned by the help being given to Portugal and to South Africa by their NATO allies in supplying arms which are used for the subjugation of Africans and for making unprovoked attacks on African States. Although members of NATO have denied this, yet it is known that arms given for the defense of Western Europe are being used in Africa under the foolish and untenable idea of the Portuguese Government that this is an extension of the defense of metropolitan Portugal and Western Europe against world communism.\n96.\tWe have noted with keen interest the statement of the Government of West Germany in frankly admitting that some of the arms supplied for NATO defense have been used for wrongful purposes in southern Africa. We look forward to the same frankness from other members of the Western European alliance, and hope that they will take immediate steps to halt the flow of military aid to Portugal.\n97.\tRhodesia has reared its head again in a new and ugly guise, and the initiative of the Government of the United Kingdom in reopening talks with the illegal regime in Rhodesia has some rather disquieting undertones, particularly .as the United Kingdom is now seeking admission to the European Economic Community. There should be no excuse whatever, in our opinion, for the lifting of sanctions against Rhodesia until self-government by majority rule has been established in that territory.\n98.\tIn Namibia we are faced with a new type of colonialism in which a people is held in subjection not only in defiance of the concepts of human justice and equality, but also in flagrant breach of international law.\n99.\tMy Government has noted with great interest the decision reached by the International Court of Justice on the question of Namibia.  We have observed some dissenting views, but it would be less than just if the Republic of South Africa and its friends do not take immediate steps to implement the handing over of Namibia to the United Nations for its rapid preparation for independence. The British have done this in the case of the Cameroons and Tanzania; the French have done so in the case of Togoland and the Cameroons; the Italians in the case of Libya and Somalia; and the Belgians in that of Rwanda and Burundi. The proximity of Namibia to South Africa does not mean that it should fall into a separate category. It means rather that the South African Government should long ago have transformed the Mandated Territory into an independent, friendly and allied Government, rather than keeping it indefinitely under a ruthless dictatorship.\n100.\tBy maintaining an illegal presence in Namibia in defiance of the decision of the General Assembly, by holding on to that Territory in complete disregard of the decision of the International Court of Justice, by dismembering the territory into homelands, by introducing apartheid into territory that is truly international and by refusing to co-operate with the United Nations Council for Namibia, the South African regime has not only proved itself unworthy of all trust, but has clearly called into question its own qualification for continued membership in the United Nations. We can only renew the constant annual appeal to the friends of South Africa to co-operate with the rest of the enlightened world by isolating South Africa economically, politically and culturally as a means of bringing it to its senses. We further appeal to those \\\"friends\\\" to ensure an immediate and an effective United Nations presence in Namibia.\n101.\tMy delegation wishes to stress that there can be no solution of the problem of Namibia unless an effective\nUnited Nations presence is assured. We are convinced that this is the essential next step and that it cannot be taken without the joint effort and co-operation of the permanent members of the Security Council. We therefore appeal to them to close their ranks on this issue, to respect the recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, to facilitate the inception of United Nations administration of the Territory, and thus help to bring the benefits of independence to the Namibians in the shortest possible time.\n102.\tIf the United Nations wants to administer the Territory effectively this cannot be done by remote control. The United Nations must be present as administrator either through some agency it has created or through an administering authority it has appointed, so that the vacuum created by South Africa's departure is immediately filled.\n103.\tThe information available to my delegation reveals that certain of the permanent members of the Security Council already have sizable investments in Namibia. It is only right that those investments should be protected, particularly if the Governments concerned respect the authority of the United Nations and are willing to co-operate with this Organization.\n104.\tMy delegation will therefore propose that the Security Council should take urgent steps to ensure the appointment of an administering authority, under the direction of the United Nations Council for Namibia, to take over immediately from the South African Government. This administering authority would, in my delegation's opinion, be much more effective if it includes all the permanent members of the Security Council.\n105.\tThe envisaged termination of the South African administration should involve the simultaneous withdrawal of South African troops and police officers from the Territory. In order to safeguard good administration, it is essential to consider the creation of a United Nations police force to take over from the South Africans, which would be directly responsible to the administering authority. It is our belief that serious attention should now be given to the creation of such a United Nations police force with the assistance of the Member States of the international community. Countries which might render such assistance would no doubt include the permanent members of the Security Council, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, Nigeria, the Republic of Guinea, the Central African Republic, India, Japan, Mexico, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Canada.\n106.\tMy delegation wishes to stress that we have no complaint against individual South Africans residing in Namibia, only against the racist regime of South Africa. Accordingly, my Government does not envisage that the transfer of the administration of Namibia from South Africa to the United Nations should involve any expulsion of individual South Africans, whether they are in business, in agriculture, in railways, in trade and industry, in mines or even in their own individual enterprises. Individual South Africans can remain and contribute to the development and welfare of the Territory as long as they accept and respect the over-all responsibility of the United Nations administration.\n107.\tThe United Nations administration cannot operate in a vacuum. It will be essential for it to be supplied with the funds to ensure efficient administration. My delegation is satisfied that the economic resources of Namibia, if properly utilized and managed, can provide sufficient revenues for the maintenance of this administration until it is, in the near, future, transferred to the Namibians. However, certain development projects ought to be undertaken quickly such as the infra-structural improvement of the areas populated by the indigenous Namibians, as well as the implementation of policies aimed at developing the political consciousness of the Namibians. For the attainment of these objectives, it will be necessary to provide adequate funds which can also be utilized in meeting to some extent the expenses of the United Nations administration. My delegation appeals, therefore, for the provision by the United Nations of adequate funds for Namibia from the general budget.\n108.\tThe ultimate objective of this exercise must be to prepare the peoples of Namibia for nationhood within the shortest possible period of time. To this end it is our belief that free elections should be undertaken in the Territory within a period of, say, one year after the United Nations assumes administrative control. For such elections to be really free, basic human and democratic rights should be guaranteed. All political prisoners banished from Namibia and now serving sentences in Robben Island and other prison fortifications in South Africa should be released and sent back to their country. All political leaders now in exile from Namibia should be encouraged, if they so desire, to return home. The people of Namibia should be enabled freely to cultivate their political consciousness along democratic lines as they themselves think fit. There should be a period of political tutelage so as to allow the population to settle down and forget the repressive era of South African rule. It is the firm belief of my delegation that the Namibians will, under such conditions, freely develop and express their own ideas about self-determination.\n109.\tOn the question of apartheid my delegation wishes to emphasize that the question of race relations is one which concerns almost every State Member of this Assembly, whether in the form of outright racial discrimination or discrimination against certain groups. It has, however, reached the point in South Africa where the official Government of that country has adopted it as an active measure of policy. We cannot reconcile the expressed desire of the Prime Minister of South Africa to forge alliances with African Member States with the inhumane and brutal methods of torture and repression being used within his own country against the non-white population. We know through our contacts that there are wise and progressive black leaders in South' Africa who are willing to enter into dialog with its Government. \\\"Charity begins at home\\\", and we should see evidence of this in South Africa before those of us from outside engage in any meaningful negotiations or dialog with the minority Government of that country.\n110.\tNo discussion of the South African problem would be complete without a reference to the policy of the sale of arms to that country by some major Powers in the United Nations. By its own actions, South Africa has already forfeited all claims to international trust and respect.\nConsequently, in spite of whatever assurances may be given by that Government, there is every reason to conclude that all arms supplied to such a regime will, directly or indirectly, contribute to the strengthening of apartheid and encourage that regime to embark on further repressive and military adventures against the gallant fighters of the liberation movement.\n111.\tThe maintenance of international peace and security is a grave problem confronting the world at this time of history.\n112.\tWhen the Assembly in 1969 decided to proclaim the 1970s as the Disarmament Decade [resolution 2602 E (XXIV)J, my delegation gave the move its whole-hearted support. It did so in the hope that the grave dangers of the arms race, both nuclear and conventional, which have continued to afflict our world, would be checked, with the added benefit that the vast amount of money badly needed for development purposes would be released from arms purchases.\n113.\tSome progress, however modest, has been made in the field of nuclear disarmament. Additional progress has also been made in declaring Latin America a nuclear-free zone by the adoption of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America.  We note with relief the progress made in the field of controlling the production and use of chemical and biological weapons, and note that a growing number of nations have ratified or ? seeded to the Protocol.  We likewise welcome the progress that is being made by NATO and Warsaw Pact groups to eliminate the unnecessary arms burden in Europe, and are encouraged by the decision taken by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America to concentrate this year in the bilateral Strategic Arms Limitation Talks on effecting an agreement for the limitation of the deployment of anti-ballistic missiles. We also support the proposal for a world disarmament conference at the level of the United Nations. After all, a nuclear holocaust would affect not only the super-Powers but also all the other nations of the world. We therefore advocate that the super-Powers should recognize that the peace-loving nations of the earth have an equally potent interest in disarmament and peace research.\n114.\tFinally, having reaffirmed the Sierra Leone Government's faith in the capability of the United Nations to handle many problems in the political sphere, I wish to speak in similar terms about our hopes for economic and social development.\n115.\tMy Government warmly endorses the proposal to establish an international university,  and has suggested that consideration should be given to setting up such an institution at the graduate level. Our reasons for this are principally to prevent a duplication of existing institutions and, at the same time, to be able to study in depth problems which are capable of being solved only at the international level-especially those of the environment, development and population expansion. Such an institution, if carefully planned and administered, with campuses in a number of countries, could become \\\"centers of excellence\\\" and help to prevent problems of \\\"brain drain\\\" so common in many of our developing nations.\n116.\tIn the wider context of world trade, the Sierra Leone Government is profoundly disturbed by the wide gulf still existing between the developed and the developing worlds. While it must be our aim to reduce that gulf and to integrate all the economies of the world into a functioning system of world production and trade in which all can play their full part, the trade of developing countries continues to fall as a proportion of world trade. This is not a subject on which we can complacently let events take their course; so it is the view of my Government that this endemic problem should receive the fullest attention. Ways and means should be investigated to formulate effective policies end reach meaningful solutions.\n117.\tAs a result of the somewhat disappointing achievements of the First United Nations Development Decade, much thought has been given during the last few years to ways in which the United Nations development system can be made more effective. In this connexion, we welcome the genesis of the new country programming system on which future technical aid will be based. We all must hope that the objectives of country programming will be achieved. Let us be resolved to co-operate to the full with the United Nations system and with bilateral donors to obtain the greatest benefits from the aid provided.\n118.\tHowever, the heart of the matter, as far as my Government is concerned, is the amount of the aid which is available for the developing countries. It is our hope that the target set for the aid contribution of the donor countries of 1 per cent of their gross national product will soon be achieved. Except for one country whose contribution to the third world in 1969 was at the level of 1.24 per cent of the gross national product, many of the developed countries appear to be dragging their feet over what we expect to be their reasonable contributions. As a result, the amount of aid available to the developing countries is manifestly inadequate.\n119.\tWe urge the developed countries to make realistic aid contributions to the developing countries rather than waste the resources of the earth on expensive space explorations and senseless armaments build-up. According to figures at our disposal, it was estimated in 1969 that the advanced countries spent $US178 billion on armaments, which was about 14 times what they contributed in aid. The figures for 1970 are not available to my delegation, but we doubt whether there has been any significant change in the pattern.\n120.\tThe cost of space exploration is universally admitted to be unreasonably very high. The cost to the United States of America, for instance, of sending astronauts to the moon for a single mission is higher than the national incomes of most developing countries. Although it is hoped that space exploration may in the long run yield substantial dividends to scientific development, the general view still holds that too much money is being unprofitably spent on space exploration. Part of this money could well be spent on more aid to developing countries which are in dire need of development funds to implement their several development programs.\n121.\tAs a result of past experience, we would suggest that, during the Second United Nations Development Decade, special attention should be given to the expansion of the industrialization of the developing countries, and the promotion and diversification of their export trade, particularly in manufactured and semi-manufactured goods.\n122.\tWe therefore welcome the continued important role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ and we hope that it will increase its efforts in promoting the international trade of the developing countries. May I then take this opportunity to appeal to the developed members of UNCTAD to focus their attention on the continuing need of the developing countries to expand their several economies, to expand their international trade, and to obtain the desired support necessary for the achievement of self-sustained growth.\n123.\tVery closely connected with trade is the universally recognized insufficiency of international liquidity. Our feeling is that in the past there has been too much emphasis on the technicalities of the form of liquidity, and too little on monetary discipline, and this seems to be substantiated by the recent developments affecting the United States dollar. No mat' r how intelligently a monetary system is designed, its efficacy cannot replace sound monetary policies.\n124.\tWe believe that discipline should start at home, by setting our own houses in order. We therefore feel that Member countries should, each and every one of us, try to get rid of our inflationary practices and try to improve on the balance-of-payments situation. The United States dollar, despite its present apparent instability, still remains the major currency of the world, the backbone of many monetary systems, and the very basis of international trade and payments. As things stand to date, a stable and strong dollar means a stable and strong international monetary system, and a shaky dollar means a shaky system.\n125.\tIt is therefore the urgent and sincere desire of the Sierra Leone Government that the international community should find ways and means of rescuing the position of the United States dollar as the catalyst of world exchange, and also of reducing the consequential pressures on that currency by speculators abroad and inflationary tendencies at home.\n126.\tWe cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the instability of the United States dollar will have profound adverse effects on world trade. This can be evidenced by the efforts of the 10 major industrialized nations Europe and Japan to come to an understanding as to their own reaction to the recent United States monetary policy. It stands to reason, therefore, that if the above industrialized nations-all of which are developed countries-are scared stiff about the repercussions the United States move can have on their own currencies and trade, how much more should the developing countries be apprehensive of the adverse effects of an unstable American dollar?\n127.\tWe do not deny the fact that it is legitimate for the major countries who play the principal part in resolving international monetary and financial problems to consider their own national interests first, but we would suggest that far-sighted solutions should only be sought which would allow full weight to be given to the overriding interest of the whole world in free and unfettered trade. It would be disastrous if short-sighted and parochial policies were adopted which were inward-looking and protectionist of the interests of any or all of the major Powers. Much more so is it iniquitous for the major Powers to utilize their economic strength, gained from past ignorance in the developing countries, to perpetuate the untenable axis of metropolis and satellite through the strategy of economic force or military might.\n128.\tI want to conclude by making this appeal to all the nations here represented and, indeed, to all the leaders of humanity: Let us strive indeed, but let us all strive together, towards a common ideal-a brighter and a better tomorrow in a world where our children will live in peace, will enjoy material progress, and will in their turn hand over a great cultural heritage to succeeding generations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, Egypt, which has with your country and your friendly people the closest ties of history and culture and \u00a3 a common struggle, is truly happy to see you assume your high post as President of the General Assembly. It is also a great pleasure for me to congratulate you on the assumption of your high office. With the outstanding qualities that you possess you will indeed guide this session to important achievements.\n2.\tYou succeed in this high office Edvard Hambro of Norway, whose name will remain linked with the historic declarations adopted last year under his able leadership. These declarations will continue to be of great value to the United Nations order and to co-operation among States.\n3.\tTen years ago the United Nations lost Dag Hammarskjold. Today, after 10 eventful years through which U Thant has guided the United Nations with unique ability and integrity, all who know the Secretary-General should rejoice in the success he has achieved and the values with which he has enriched the traditions of his office. The courageous stands which he has adopted in defense of world peace and in upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter have added to the importance of the high office of Secretary-General. The United Nations has had grave experiences during this period, and U Thant has steadfastly remained the voice of peace and reason and the defender of the Charter. We hope that these words which I speak now are not a farewell and that he will agree once more to carry the burdens and responsibilities of his post in the cause of the United Nations to which he is dedicated.\n4.\tOn 2 September 1971 the peoples of Syria, Libya and Egypt took a historic step for unity. After a national referendum in the three States, the Federation of Arab Republics was born. This Union will no doubt increase the chances of success of the three States in their struggle to attain their aspirations and to achieve peace based on justice.\n5.\tSince the Asian-African Conference, held at Bandung in 1955, the People's Republic of China and Egypt have maintained diplomatic and friendly relations. Today, we are happy to see the People's Republic of China on its way to occupying its seat in the United Nations. We shall support the invitation to the People's Republic of China to assume its rightful place in the world Organization as the sole representative of China. We shall oppose any attempt to cast any doubt on this fact or to derogate from the full and legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in accordance with the Charter.\n6.\tThe admission of Bahrain, Bhutan, and Qatar and the imminent admission of Oman to the United Nations constitute another important victory for the principles of universality and the sovereign equality of States. The independence of Bahrain, Oman and Qatar is an important step which will undoubtedly contribute to the progress of the Arab peoples. We look forward to co-operating with the new States. We are confident that they will contribute positively to the work of the United Nations.\n7.\tWe welcome the recent important developments in European relations, particularly their positive impact on strengthening European security and in fostering co-operation between Eastern and Western Europe. However, we note with regret that the fundamental problems of the peoples of the third world remain unresolved. These problems tend to multiply with the passage of time in both the economic and political fields. This is due particularly to the insistence on the part of certain Powers on continuing a policy of force and domination.\n8.\tIn Africa, the colonialist and racist regimes of southern Africa are still pursuing their policies of oppression, exploitation and intimidation against the indigenous African populations. The racist Government in South Africa, the illegal regime in Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonialists in Africa have constituted among themselves a colonialist and racist alliance parallel to the racist Zionist aggression against the north of Africa, These policies brazenly defy all human values, the great tarns of history , and the destiny of our civilization. Resistance to these policies should not be confined to their victims in Africa; it is rather a collective responsibility. The international community should be asked not only to withhold aid to such regimes but also to take effective action to bring them into the fold of civilization.\n9.\tIn Asia, it is indeed a source of deep regret to see the war in Viet-Nam being pursued despite the opposition of \nworld public opinion to the continuation of aggressive actions against the Viet-Namese people.\n10.\tWe support the heroic struggle of the Viet-Namese people, which will be inscribed on glorious pages in the annals of history. We firmly support the Viet-Namese people's legitimate demands for unity, for the exercise of their right to self-determination and for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Viet-Nam. We believe that the program submitted recently by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam constitutes a reason-able basis on which to end the war in Viet-Nam and to enable the Viet-Namese people to realize their national aspirations.\n11.\tEgypt has followed with its heart and soul the painful events that took place in Pakistan last spring. We are confident that Pakistan will overcome this crisis in a manner that will safeguard its national unity. We appreciate the immediate efforts exerted by the Government of India to meet the situation arising from the inflow of a large number of Pakistani refugees into Indian territory. We believe it is imperative that wider international efforts be made to help the people and the Government of India cope with the enormous human burden they are now shouldering and to assist the Pakistani refugees to return to their homes.\n12.\tOn 5 June 1967, Israel launched its aggression and occupied Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian territories. Ever since, it has followed a policy aimed at imposing its expansionist ambitions on the Arab countries. This is in pursuance of its ultimate objective of establishing a \\\"Greater Israel\\\" between the Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Iraq. Israel's insistence on territorial expansion emerged as the sole obstacle frustrating efforts to carry out resolution 242 (1967), adopted by the Security Council on 22 November 1967. It is that policy of expansion which is at present the most dangerous factor threatening peace in the Middle East. The Arab peoples are conscious of the history of Israel's expansion. The road between the first Zionist claim in 1917 to permit Jewish immigration into Palestine and Israel's insistence today on annexing Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian territories is vividly remembered by every Arab citizen.\n13.\tThe people of Palestine were the first victims of the Zionist movement. They were evicted by force from Palestinian cities and villages. When Zionism benefited from international circumstances to which the Palestinians were not a party, a United Nations resolution partitioning Palestine [resolution 181 (II)] was adopted. Israel, how-ever, expanded beyond the boundaries established by the partition resolution. It committed unforgettable massacres against the Palestinian people and pursued its policy of expulsion by force against them. It was then that, some Arab States responded to the call to help the Palestinian people defend themselves. But the Israeli forces had already under their control a large part of the Palestinian territory beyond the boundaries established by the partition resolution. From those areas, Israel committed one aggression after another against the peoples of Palestine and the neighboring Arab States.\n14. In 1956 Israel attacked Egypt and occupied the Sinai peninsula, and its then Prime Minister declared that the\nEgyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement was \\\"dead and buried\\\", and that the Sinai had been annexed to Israel. This aggression did not bear fruit, because of Egypt's resistance and the firm opposition of the international community.\n15.\tThe 1967 aggression was along the same lines and in the same pattern: aggression, occupation, expulsion of the inhabitants, and an attempt to impose a fait accompli.\n16.\tThe 1967 war will not be Israel's last aggression if Israel succeeds in holding the spoils of this one. Success will undoubtedly tempt Israel to pursue further its expansionist schemes to create that \\\"Greater Israel\\\", as long as it believes that it can rely on outside support in its aggressive policies against the peoples of the area.\n17.\tThe other side of the Zionist policy of expansion manifests itself in Israel's practices of massive expulsion of the inhabitants of the occupied territories and systematic demolition and destruction of houses, civic centers and entire villages. These are amongst the gravest of crimes and are prohibited by the Geneva Conventions. They are also in contravention of a whole series of United Nations resolutions.\n18.\tResolution 298 (1971) just recently adopted by the Security Council, on 25 September 1971, which urgently called upon Israel to rescind all previous actions aimed at annexing occupied Jerusalem, was the third on that subject adopted by the Security Council. Israel has once again rejected the resolution, and did so on the very day it was adopted.\n19.\tIn addition to those resolutions, the General Assembly has adopted 24 resolutions on the rights of the Palestinians. The Security Council, as well as the General Assembly, has adopted several other resolutions calling on Israel to allow displaced persons to return to their homes in the occupied territories. There were 13 more resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, calling upon Israel to respect the rights of the civilian inhabitants in the occupied territories in conformity with the fourth Geneva Convention. \n20.\tIsrael has adamantly, by word and deed, rejected all these resolutions. It has continued to establish settlements in the occupied Arab territories on the debris of the Arab homes it destroyed. Last summer it launched a major aggression against the Palestinian refugees in the Gaza sector and transferred thousands of families by force from destroyed refugee camps to the Sinai peninsula in occupied Egyptian territory.\n21.\tThe crimes which Israel is committing against the Palestinian people and Other inhabitants of the occupied Arab territories belong to the same category of crimes as those which the Nazis perpetrated against the Jews and many others in occupied Europe, crimes which were considered repugnant to the human conscience and whose perpetrators were tried as war criminals. These crimes led the civilized nations to conclude the 1949 Geneva Conventions, to which Israel is a party, and which it refuses to\nhonor. Indeed, Israel denies its obligations under the law of war as it denies its obligations under the law of peace.\n22.\tThe Arab peoples who have lived the tragedy of the Palestinian people will continue to defend and support the inalienable right of every Palestinian to return to his home and to cultivate his land. The responsibility of the United Nations towards ue Palestinian people, which is a legal, moral and historical responsibility, will be unfulfilled until all the resolutions adopted on the sacred rights of the Palestinians have been faithfully and effectively implemented. A just and lasting peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without the realization of these rights.\n23.\tThe leaders of Israel convinced themselves that, by ' launching the 5 June 1967 aggression and by occupying\nArab territories, they would force the Arab countries to surrender to their expansionist demands. The same self- conviction dominated the leaders of Nazi Germany when they invaded Europe. They, too, felt that they could dictate their conditions to Europe through military con-quest. It was the resolve of the invaded countries in Europe to stand up and resist that eventually led to the defeat of the invader and the liberation of the then occupied lands. Egypt has refused and will continue to refuse to surrender to Israel's expansionist ambitions. Egypt's steadfastness is an integral part of its determination to liberate every inch of the territory occupied by Israel as a result of its aggression of 5 June 1967.\n24.\tHaving failed to impose capitulation on the Arab countries as a result of its aggression in June 1967, Israel today strives for the fragmentation of the settlement by seeking to conclude separate agreements which would enable Israel to continue its occupation and to impose acceptance of the status quo. That is, basically, what Israel is seeking through what it has recently called a \\\"Suez Canal agreement\\\". In fact, Israel's objective is territorial expansion it intends to use this interim agreement as a springboard for further aggression. The experience of over 20 years has inured the Arab world to such things; it cannot again be dragged into such a trap. But it is important that the General Assembly be made aware of this fact.\n25.\tIn 1949 the Arab States concluded interim agreements with Israel. These were the General Armistice Agreements. Under these Agreements Israel occupied large areas of the territory of Palestine which were not allotted to it under the 1947 partition resolution. Shortly after the conclusion of these agreements the Arab States and Israel concluded the Lausanne Protocol of 12 May 1949. However, instead of withdrawing to its assigned boundaries according to the partition resolution, Israel moved farther and occupied by force the Palestinian demilitarized zones, expelled the United Nations observers and forcibly evicted the inhabitants of these zones. Subsequently, Israel launched its 1956 aggression against Egypt and unilaterally declared the abrogation of the Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement. Later, it launched the 1967 aggression against Egypt, Syria and Jordan, and renounced the Armistice Agreements with those three countries. Israel has used the interim agreements as a means of consolidating a de facto situation resulting from its aggression and a stage from which it commits further aggression or the road of territorial expansion.\n26.\tThe Foreign Minister of Israel made a statement here on 30 September [1946th meeting] in which he asserted that in a condition of peace Israel would not withdraw from all the occupied Egyptian territory. In the same speech he invited Egypt to enter into an interim agreement. This interim agreement would not provide for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Egyptian territory. The Foreign Minister of Israel also proposed that international arrangements be established to supervise the interim agreement to be signed by Egypt. In short, Israel invites Egypt to sign an interim agreement in which Egypt would accept the continued Israeli occupation of its territory under the protection of the international community. If Israel seeks today aii interim agreement, it should fulfill its obligations under the 1949 Armistice Agreement, which was concluded under the auspices of the Security Council and which Israel cannot unilaterally abrogate. If, however, it is permanent peace that Israel seeks, then it should agree to implement Security Council resolution 242(1967) and respond positively to Ambassador Jarring's aide-memoir of 8 February 1971 [A/8541, annex I], which defines the first step towards the full implementation of the Security Council resolution.\n27.\tIsrael cannot impose on the Arab States a third alternative: new interim agreements which would secure the continued occupation of the territories it seized in June 1967. Peace cannot coexist with occupation. This was very clearly stated in the address made by the President of Egypt to the nation on 16 September last. Any interim steps should lead only to the full implementation of all the provisions of the Security Council resolution under the auspices of Ambassador Jarring and the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 5 June 1967.\n28.\tWhen the General Assembly met in the fifth emergency special session in the aftermath of the June 1967 Israeli aggression, two main trends dominated its deliberations. The first trend emphasized the need for the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all the occupied territories on the understanding that the Middle East crisis would be subsequently resolved. The second emphasized the necessity of the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all the occupied territories as part of a general settlement of the Middle East crisis. Not one single draft resolution was submitted to the General Assembly which did not provide for the withdrawal of the Israeli forces to the lines existing prior to 5 June 1967.\n29.\tWhen the question was later considered by the Security Council, the Council opted for the second trend, which called for a comprehensive settlement which would bring about a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. This was embodied in Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n30.\tThe most cogent expression which reaffirms that the withdrawal is an integral part of permanent-peace is found in resolution 242 (1967) itself, which emphasized in one sentence:\n.. the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in security.\\\"\n31.\tThat resolution was not adopted in a vacuum. It was adopted unanimously after long and arduous consultations in which the four major Powers and the parties concerned participated. At that time it was the United States more than any other Power which insisted that the settlement should be comprehensive and should embody all the ingredients of the Middle East conflict. The United States firmly opposed the return to interim arrangements on the ground that such arrangements would not terminate the state of war. Any attempt to depict Security Council resolution 242 (1967) as condoning territorial expansion is in flagrant violation of the Charter and the provisions of the resolution itself. In fact it serves only to reveal the colonial intentions of the perpetrator. The theory of territorial expansion which Israel promotes today means the following: any State wishing to expand into the territory of another State need only invade that State, occupy its territory and impose its territorial demands by force of occupation and on the basis of the allegation that every war leads to territorial changes. But there is no acceptable justification whatsoever for territorial expansion,,\n32.\tIsrael's allegation that its security could be achieved only through expansion is a negation of common sense. If a State believes that it can achieve its security at the expense of the territory of another neighboring State, why then should not the neighboring State attempt to expand in the territory of another State also on the- basis of \\\"security\\\" and why then should the same pattern not be -repeated by all other States?\n33.\tThe greatest guarantee of security is peace based on justice. This could be reinforced by a system of guarantees under the auspices and the supervision of the Security Council. It was ironic to hear the Foreign Minister of Israel strongly advocating the establishment of international arrangements to supervise an interim agreement which would secure Israel's occupation while at the same time vehemently rejecting guarantees to be provided by the Security Council to protect permanent peace in the Middle East.\n34.\tWe are almost at the end of the fourth year since the Security Council adopted resolution 242 (1967). Through-out these last four years, Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, has been making patient and consistent efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in accordance with resolution 242 (1967). All these efforts have been frustrated by a single obstacle: Israel's refusal to withdraw from the territories it occupied as a result of its aggression of 5 June 1967.\n35.\tWhen the Jarring mission came to its first deadlock, France proposed early in 1969 that the four permanent members of the Security Council should hold talks with a view to assisting Ambassador Jarring and should work to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).3 This initiative by France was accepted by us. It was rejected by Israel.\n36.\tIn June 1970 the United States advanced what has become known as \\\"the Rogers initiative\\\" which contained\n3 See Official Records of the Security Council, Twenty-fourth Year, 1468th meeting, para. 39, three elements: first, implementation of the Security Council resolution; second, the nomination by the parties of representatives to maintain contact with Ambassador Jarring in order to carry out the resolution, and third, a cease-fire to be observed for 90 days to facilitate the task of Ambassador Jarring.\n37.\tWe accepted the United States initiative in July and appointed our Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York to enter into contact with Ambassador Jarring. On 4 August 1970, Israel announced its acceptance but immediately started to procrastinate in its contacts with Ambassador Jarring. On 6 September 1970 it declared its withdrawal from these contacts.\n38.\tOn 8 February 1971 Ambassador Jarring took iiis well-known initiative in accordance with which he concentrated on one zone of the conflict and planned subsequently to move on to other zones. The Jarring initiative of 8 February was a decisive milestone. The response to that initiative determined the willingness and seriousness on the part of Egypt and Israel to carry out their obligations under Security Council resolution 242(1967). Ambassador Jarring requested Israel to make a specific commitment to withdraw its forces from Egyptian territory to Egypt's international frontiers. He requested Egypt to offer a corresponding commitment to enter into a peace agreement with Israel provided that Israel withdrew its forces to Egypt's international frontier.\n39.\tUpon receiving the clarifications which it requested from Ambassador Jarring, Egypt, on 15 February 1971, communicated its acceptance of his initiative. On 26 February, Israel rejected Ambassador Jarring's initiative and declared that it would not withdraw to Egypt's inter-national frontiers as requested by Ambassador Jarring. It might be appropriate at this juncture to refer to the Secretary-General's report. He stated:\n\\\"I wish ... to note with satisfaction the positive reply given by the United Arab Republic to Ambassador Jarring's initiative. However, the Government of Israel has so far not responded to the request of Ambassador Jarring that it should give a commitment on withdrawal to the international boundary of the United Arab Republic.\\\" \n40.\tThe representatives of the four permanent members of the Security Council supported Ambassador Jarring's initiative and expressed satisfaction with Egypt's response. They asked that Israel give a similar reply. The representatives of the four permanent members of the Security Council requested, the United States representative, Mr. George Bush, to convey this position to the Secretary-General.\n41.\tOn 5 March 1971, the Secretary-General issued an appeal to Israel to reconsider its position and respond to Ambassador Jarring's initiative. He said:\n\\\"I appeal... to the Government of Israel to give further consideration to this question and to respond favorably to Ambassador Jarring's initiative.\\\" \nIsrael rejected this appeal. The Foreign Minister of Israel, on 30 September, repeated this rejection when he asserted that Israel would not withdraw from all the occupied territory of Egypt in accordance with the Jarring aide-memoir. He stated:\n\\\"In the framework of a peace settlement with Egypt, Israel would withdraw from the cease-fire lines. We have never asserted that in a condition of peace it would be necessary for our troops to remain in all of the Sinai Peninsula or even in most of it.\\\" [1946th meeting, para, 95. J\nIt is quite obvious that the Foreign Minister of Israel utilized considerable linguistic dexterity and word play; yet the one and only meaning to be drawn from this statement is Israel's determination to annex part of Egypt's territory.\n43.\tIn pursuance of our efforts to secure the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the territories occupied after 5 June 1967, President Anwar El-Sadat proposed last February an initiative which provides for the implementation of Security Council resolution 242(1967) and the withdrawal of Israeli forces in two stages. President El-Sadat declared that, upon Israel's withdrawal to the lines of the first stage, Egypt would be willing to accept a cease-fire for a period of six months, during which Ambassador Jarring would prepare a time-table for the implementation of all the provisions of the Security Council resolution. During this stage Egypt would start clearing the Suez Canal with a view to opening it for international navigation. Egyptian forces would cross the Suez Canal to assume their national responsibilities on the eastern bank of the Canal and to preset the Canal and the Egyptian cities on the Canal.\n44.\tThe second stage would then follow. Israeli armed forces would be withdrawn from all the Arab territories occupied after 5 June 1967, and the remaining provisions of the Security Council resolution would be fully carried out in conformity with the time-table prepared by Ambassador Jarring.\n45.\tIsrael rejected this initiative, as it had previously rejected the Jarring initiative. This rejection was expressed once again by the Foreign Minister of Israel on 30 September, when he declared that Israel would not withdraw from all the occupied Egyptian territories. Moreover, the Israeli defense Minister stated on 19 September:\n\\\"Israel should keep Sharm El Sheikh, the Golan heights of Syria, and the Gaza Strip among the territories captured in 1967, at the same time keeping troops on the Jordan River\\\"-that is, the west bank of the Jordan under Israel's military control \\\"and retaining new settlements in the occupied areas.\\\"\n46.\tSince the official announcement of its expansionist policy of annexing occupied Egyptian territory, the Israeli leaders have launched an active campaign aimed at resurrecting the principle of military conquest as a means for the acquisition of territory belonging to other States. This principle lay at the root of the whole colonial system and led to almost all the wars that had occurred before the emergence of the United Nations.\n47.\tThe Prime Minister of Israel, in her bitter attack on the Charter principle of non-acquisition of territory by force, had the audacity to refer to that Charter principle as \\\"immoral\\\", as reported in Time magazine of 30 August 1971. The Prime Minister of Israel made the statement before one year had elapsed since the unanimous adoption by the United Nations of the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, which spells out the provisions of that basic principle of the Charter. The Declaration states:\n\\\"The territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force. No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.\\\" [See resolution 2625 (XXV), annex.]\nIt also declared:\n\\\"Every State has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate the existing international bound-aries of another State or as a means of solving inter-national disputes, including territorial disputes and problems concerning frontiers of States\\\" /ibid.].\n48.\tThese fundamental norms of international law were reflected and further emphasized in the historic Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security adopted the the General Assembly last year [resolution 2734 (XXV)], in order to emphasize their importance in the maintenance of international peace and security. Israel's insistence on expanding and annexing Arab territories is a categorical rejection of peace in the Middle East. It is also a clear manifestation of its determination to pursue war and to undermine the basic principles laid down by the peoples of the United Nations for the establishment of a civilized international order and for the maintenance of world peace.\n49.\tIsrael's policy of military expansion, its attempts to revive the colonial principle of military conquest, its refusal to agree to permanent peace, and ic consistent defiance of the United Nations resolutions are Si' policies for which Israel finds no support whatever in the international community.\n50.\tThe United States, which provides Israel with military and economic assistance, has repeatedly rejected the principle of military conquest as a means of acquiring the territory of other States. The United States has, moreover, declared its support of Ambassador Jarring's aide-memoir of 8 February, which calls for Israeli withdrawal to Egypt's international borders and the conclusion of a peace agreement.\n51.\tIn the course of his speech to the General Assembly on Monday [1950th meeting], Mr. William Rogers reaffirmed the posit ion of the United States stated by him in a speech on 9 December 1969, in which he said:\n\\\"... in the context of peace and agreement on specific security safeguards, withdrawal of Israeli feces from Egyptian territory would be required.\n\\\"Such an approach directly addresses the principal national concerns of both Israel and the United Arab\nRepublic. It would require the United Arab Republic to agree to a binding and specific commitment to peace, It would require withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from United Arab Republic territory to the international border between Israel and Egypt which has been in existence for over a half century.\\\" \n52.\tWe note that this position corresponds to the Jarring initiative of 8 February 1971, which was accepted by Egypt on 15 February, We also note that in his speech Mr. Rogers called for a step towards complete and full implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We consider any attempt to transform such a step into a separate agreement as one of the impediments which Israel has often used to frustrate the realization of peace in the Middle East.\n53.\tThe United States, however, has continued to provide Israel with military and economic aid. At a time when Israel is actively laboring to annex the occupied Arab territories, this support by the United States does not represent merely a retraction of its previous commitments, including its commitments under the Charter, but it also enables Israel to pursue its policy of frustrating the implementation of the Security Council resolution and of continuing its aggression against the Arab countries and its defiance of the United Nations .\n54.\tThere is a basic contradiction between the repeated assertion of the United States of support for the Security Council resolution and its actual policy of providing military and economic aid to Israel, in spite of the latter's rejection of the Jarring aide-memoir and its insistence on territorial expansion.\n55.\tAs a great Power and a permanent member of the Security Council, the United States bears a heavy responsibility and assumes definite commitments with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security. Hence, the United States and the other big Powers should strive for the realization of the steps leading to the achievement of permanent peace in the Middle East.\n56.\tWide and important sectors of the international community have defined their position and announced their full support for Security Council resolution 242 (1967), and have called upon Israel to co-operate with Ambassador Jarring and to respond positively to his aide-memoir. I should like to refer, in particular, to the fair resolution adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity on 22 June 1971 at Addis Ababa.  In that resolution the African leaders called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from all Arab territories to the lines of 5 June 1967; expressed their full support for the efforts of the Special representative of the United Nations Secretary-General to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and his initiative for peace of 8 February 1971; reaffirmed their solidarity with the United Arab Republic and appreciated its reply of 15 February to Ambassador Jarring's initiative as a practical step for establishing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East; deplored Israel's defiance of that initiative and called upon Israel to respond to that initiative.\n57. The African leaders did not confine themselves to the adoption of that important resolution. They requested the President of Mauritania, Moktar Ould Daddah, in his capacity as Chairman of the eighth session of the OAU Assembly, to consult with the other Heads of State to exert their joint influence to secure the full implementation of their resolution. As a result of these consultations, a committee was established under the chairmanship of President Moktar Ould Daddah composed of the Heads of State of Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Senegal, Mauritania, Nigeria, Cameroon, Kenya, United Republic of Tanzania, the Ivory Coast and Liberia.\n58 . Egypt declared its acceptance of the implementation of the resolution adopted by the OAU Assembly. We shall co-operate with the committee of our African Heads of State led by President Senghor with a view to ensuring the success of its mission and in order to carry out the collective will of Africa's Heads of State. In deference to this effort Egypt will not request the discussion of the item entitled \\\"The situation in the Middle East\\\" [item 22] in accordance with its established priority on the agenda of the General Assembly, and will await the results of this mission.\n59.\tThe support for Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and the Jarring initiative of 8 February, is indeed universal. Besides Africa's support, Asian States, non-aligned countries, the socialist countries and Western European countries have, on many occasions, strongly supported Ambassador Jarriij's efforts. We are also confident that the Latin American countries, which contributed to laying the foundation of the principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force, will no doubt reject Israel's attempts aiming at the acquisition of lands through military conquest and will actively support the Security Council resolution and the efforts of Ambassador Jarring to achieve permanent peace in the Middle East.\n60.\tSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967) is firmly based on two inseparable foundations, permanent peace and full withdrawal. Ambassador Jarring's mission is an integral part of that resolution. There are two roads before us which would lead to the full implementation of the Security Council resolution and to the establishment of permanent peace in the Middle East: first, the implementation of President El-Sadat's initiative, to which I referred earlier in my speech; and, second, Israel's agreement to enter into a peace agreement in accordance with the aide-memoir of Ambassador Jarring of 8 February 1971. Egypt has responded positively to that aide-memoir. It remains for Israel to take the same step, thus enabling Ambassador Jarring to resume his contacts. I would be ready to meet with Ambassador Jarring to discuss with him the implementation of the contents of his aide-memoir. I am ready to do this today.\n61.\tMoreover, we agree that the Security Council should lay down security arrangements to guarantee peace and security and to ensure the non-renewal of aggression in the Middle East. These arrangements include the establishment of demilitarized zones on both sides for equal distances and the establishment of an international force to supervise peace in the area.\n62.\tIsrael's refusal to withdraw from the territories it occupied as a result of its aggression of 5 June 1967 is a constant threat to peace. Firm international action is now imperative to force Israel to comply with the basic norms of the Charter. The Security Council, particularly its permanent members, bears at present a great responsibility for peace in the Middle East.\n63.\tThe achievement of permanent peace is the most genuine guarantee for security in the Middle East. Territorial expansion does not guarantee the security of any State. Expansion is not the path to security, but it surely is the road to war. There is a fundamental fact which stands out as clearly as the sun, through all the efforts made, through all the projects submitted and through all the accumulated United Nations records on the Middle East. That fact is summed up in the following words: peace in the Middle East depends on Israel's renunciation of its policy of expansion. If Israel announces today that it will withdraw its forces to the lines existing prior to 5 June 1967, peace would be achieved forthwith in the Middle East.\n64.\tThe leaders of Israel would be indulging in self- deception if they convinced themselves that they could force the people of Egypt to surrender an inch of Egypt's territory, in any form or under any name. In the valley of the Nile the people of Egypt offered as' a heritage to the human race a civilization of peace. In peace and in tolerance they built their progress. More than once in their long history they stood up to invaders. The invaders were repelled and Egypt remained throughout history.\n65.\tToday the people in the valley of the Nile, while looking forward to peace so as to proceed with the tasks of construction and to meet the challenges of progress, are also committed vis-a-vis the past, the present and the future to stand up to invaders, tc protect the land of Egypt and to insist that peace must rest on justice.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "164.\t Mr. President, it is a particular pleasure to congratulate the new President of this Assembly. You come to us, Sir, as one of the most distinguished statesmen of South-East Asia, from a great country of that region, and with qualities that will serve us admirably during one of the most important assemblies in the history of this Organization. It is also a pleasure for me to pay a tribute to the previous President of the Assembly, Mr. Hambro of Norway, who presided so well over a session marking another significant juncture in the lifetime of the United Nations.\n165.\tThis session of the General Assembly, meeting under the guidance of an Asian President, is one which will be marked by a degree of preoccupation with matters relating to that most populous of regions which has not always been characteristic of this Organization. For New Zealand, a country of the South Pacific on the fringes of Asia but a full partner, for all that, in many aspects of the increasingly intensive co-operation among the great majority of countries in this region, this will be welcome.\n166.\tIt means that in the first instance the Assembly will, as we hope, at last come to grips in a realistic manner with the position which the People's Republic of China should occupy in the Organization. My Government, along with most of those Governments represented here today, has welcomed the hopeful developments which have taken place in relationships with Peking since the Assembly last met, and particularly during the last few months. The announcement of President Nixon's intention to visit China at some time before May of next year and the preliminary talks which preceded that announcement, no less than the actual visit when it eventuates, have the quality of events which leave their mark on the history of human affairs. They portend the end of an era. Whether it is the beginning of a new order depends on the efforts which will be made by all concerned. For the present we are in a period of transition and of adjustment of relationships which calls for\ndifficult decisions on the part of Governments, but particularly on the part of those whose future is intimately bound up with the destinies of Asia.\n167.\tFor many years my Government, which in 1961 proposed the inclusion in the Assembly's agenda of an item on the question of the representation of China in the United Nations, has been concerned with the achievement of a solution to the problem of Chinese representation that would be both just and reasonable. We have spoken in favor of the seating in the United Nations of the People's Republic of China. We have also wished to see fair recognition of the reality of the situation, which is the existence of two Governments in full control of their respective territories. Here there is a separation of authority as distinct as there is in the case of what are known as the \\\"divided States\\\", but with the essential difference that the entity, China, is already a Member of the United Nations. The Secretary-General has argued strongly in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization that the admission of the divided countries should not be linked to the problems resulting from their division [Aj8401IAdd.l, para. 104]. My delegation may not be entirely convinced that that is so, but since the argument has been advanced, a fortiori it must apply in the case of two Governments, in control for two full decades of different parts of the territory of what was a founding Member of the United Nations. The legitimacy of either Government is not a matter for the Assembly to determine in the circumstances of the case, where both Governments enjoy wide recognition among United Nations Members. It is for the Assembly rather to make clear that a resolution of the basic conflict lies with the parties concerned, while providing for the seating of both in the Organization.\n168.\tThis is fair; this is reasonable; this is, above all, common sense. That is why my Government, which shares with many others the desire to see the representatives of Peking seated in the Assembly and exercising the powers which should fall to them in the Security Council, has joined in sponsoring a proposal to this effect[A/L.633].\n169.\tGreat Powers have great capacity to achieve good, or equally to inflict damage. Rapprochements involving great Powers must always be welcomed for the relaxation of tension which should accompany them. Yet it is important, and it is the responsibility of this Organization to ensure, that the rights of the less powerful should not be ignored or swept away in the interests of an accommodation among super-States, or between a super-State and the rest of the world community. My delegation believes that this consideration is one to which due weight should be given when the Assembly embarks upon the substantive discussion of this problem.\n170.\tIt is, indeed, the peculiar quality of the General Assembly that, as the Secretary-General stated in paragraph 95 of his introduction, it \\\"offers the smaller and the medium Powers not only a voice, but also a way of influencing the course of events far in excess of what was previously available to them\\\". This is a significant statement, like a number of others made in this year's\nintroduction, particularly in part one, to which I wish to pay a warm tribute.\n171.\tMy Government believes that the smaller Powers, into whose ranks we have the pleasure of welcoming Bahrains Bhutan, Qatar and soon Oman, have a special role to play both within the United Nations and outside. They bring a different perspective to world affairs which can serve as a useful balance to the interests of larger Powers,, while in many cases they enjoy relationships with such Powers which enable them both to understand the objectives of the latter and to exercise some influence upon them.\n172.\tThe necessity for this three-way relationship between the great Powers, small countries and international institutions has been dramatically evident in recent weeks in the international monetary situation. It is a fact of life we recognize, that the economic weight of the great industrial Powers has a major impact on molding the character of the international monetary system. In the present unstable situation it is the major Powers that must undergo the restructuring needed to restore equilibrium. Naturally it is those Powers that will have a major role in the negotiations that are necessary to lead to long-term international monetary stability.\n173.\tAt the same time, it is essential that the great Powers recognize that -their economic decisions can profoundly affect the economic stability of the smaller nations, many of which do not have sophisticated monetary systems and the resilience to ride out major upheavals. I repeat what I said at the meetings in Washington last week that it is an unfortunate fact that recent measures taken by major countries which to them seemed reasonable and legitimate-may have damaging repercussions on the economies of small nations whose problems were neither perceived nor discussed.\n174.\tNew Zealand welcomes the improvement in the climate for constructive discussion. While we understand the reasons for the actions of the United States Administration, we firmly believe that all nations, large and small, that are intimately concerned with these events should consider each other's difficulties. We are confident that they will recognize the duty each has to the international community to reach a reasonable compromise before further serious damage is done not only to international trade but also to the institutions that have served us well since Bretton Woods. We are encouraged, therefore, that the International Monetary Fund unanimously recognized that, whereas the present international monetary situation contains the dangers of instability and disorder in currency and trade relationships, it also offers the opportunity for constructive changes in the international monetary system, and in particular it called upon its members to collaborate with the Fund and with each other in order, as promptly as possible, to establish a satisfactory structure of exchange rates, together with the reduction of restrictive trade and exchange practices.\n175.\tAmong other problems confronting small countries is their position in world trade and in relation to large economic groupings, which may so easily develop marked protectionist characteristics. In this debate last year, the leader of the New Zealand delegation spoke of the threat which hung over New Zealand's economic future as negotiations were engaged on the entry of the United Kingdom, its largest export market, into the European Economic Community [1853rd meeting, para. 197]. He said that in a very real sense the role of regional groupings ia world trade was on trial in this test case. He also said that ft would be tragic if, as a result of enlarging the European Economic Community, one of the world's most efficient agricultural producers were to be driven to the wall.\n176.\tI owe it to this Assembly , and to the countries of the Community, as well as to the Government of the United Kingdom, to record on this occasion the satisfactory outcome of these negotiations from New Zealand's point of view. Having disposed of this area of uncertainty in its immediate trading future, New Zealand is now in a better position to plan ahead, to move forward on the basis of sound economic growth and to play its full part in world trade and development and, with it, in the Second Development Decade.\n177.\tRegional economic groupings are a fact of international life. They have much to offer to smaller countries by providing the advantages of a market-place of new dimensions. The development of wider opportunities for trade and development throughout many of the countries and territories of the South Pacific is one of the important goals sought by the Heads of State or Government of Western Samoa, Nauru, Fiji, Tonga and the Cook Islands, who joined with the representatives of Australia and New Zealand in the South Pacific Forum held in Wellington in August this year. A second such meeting will be held in Canberra in the first half of 1972, and preparatory work is under way among officials. Co-operation is envisaged over a wide range of fields of practical interest. Combined with the continuing work of the South Pacific Commission and the welcome and increasing commitment of United Nations agencies to the area, we believe these activities should have a significant impact at the development level.\n178.\tThere was another aspect of the growing sense of South Pacific awareness at the recent meeting. This was the unanimous feeling of concern expressed by this group of small countries that, despite the opposition voiced over the years, they should still be faced with the intrusion, as they saw it, of a great Power into the area for the purpose of conducting atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons. Why, they asked, if the hazards are as slight as France claims, should it not test nearer home?\n179.\tIn this and in other ways in recent months a growing impatience has been revealed among countries in and bordering the Pacific. An even wider range of concern has been shown in recent discussions in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the limits of National Jurisdiction. While we welcome the fact that this year's test series has been cut short after five explosions, this is apparently only a temporary relief. What we wait to hear is that this will have been the last series to be conducted in our Pacific area. In saying this, my\ndelegation is not unmindful of the arguments that France is not a party to the partial test-ban treaty; that it is, after all, only following the path of other nuclear Powers which continue to develop their potential through underground testing; that there is no agreement on measures of nuclear disarmament; and that the People's Republic of China also continues to test in the atmosphere. My delegation will advocate at this session, as it has done in the past, the ending of all nuclear testing, including underground testing. But meanwhile no atmospheric test can escape the condemnation of those who have signed the partial test-ban treaty and who constitute a great majority of this Assembly.\n180.\tThe meeting of the South Pacific Forum to which I have referred brought together all the independent or self-governing countries of the South Pacific. Apart from Australia and New Zealand, none has a population of much more than half a million or a land area greater than 7,000 square miles, and the majority are decidedly smaller. Yet in every case, whether the country concerned had been a Non-Self-Governing or Trust Territory, the right to self-determination had been recognized and freely exercised, and the transition had been a peaceful one in what we like to think is the Pacific way. Nor, so far as New Zealand's remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories of Niue and the Tokelau Islands are concerned, will that right of free choice be denied when the peoples concerned wish to exercise it. The problems which remain, unlike those in some other parts of the world and notably southern Africa, do not relate to this principle: they are simply, in these tiny islands, the problems of size, resources and general viability. It has been a matter of disappointment to my delegation that the bodies concerned with questions of decolonization have not as yet fully studied the special problems inherent in such small Territories. Rather, they have been understandably anxious to assert the basic principles to which my delegation, having voted in favor of resolution 1514 (XV), also subscribes. My delegation has nevertheless been encouraged by the trend of the constructive discussion which took place this year in Sub-Committee II of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\n181.\tThe Assembly will be interested to know that the New Zealand Government, which has long expressed its willingness in principle to receive a visiting mission, has during this year's consideration of Niue and the Tokelaus, invited the Special Committee to send a small mission to both Territories in 1972. It thus continues a pattern of co-operation with the United Nations in the field of decolonization which at different times has involved United Nations presence both in the former Trust Territory of Western Samoa and in the Cook Islands. It is confident that, when a mission of the Special Committee visits Niue and the Tokelau Islands next year, this will be an important element not only in ascertaining the attitudes of the local populations but also in deepening understanding in the United Nations of the conditions in these small Pacific islands. The Secretary-General has provided an excellent summary of the question in paragraph 304 of his introduction where, speaking of small Territories, he says:\n\\\".,. the problems involved in their decolonization are nevertheless complex and call for individual solutions which must stem from the full and freely expressed wishes of their peoples and, at the same time, take account of realities.\\\"\n182.\tOnce the right to self-determination has been recognized, the search for a realistic solution to the problems of Non-Self-Governing Territories can begin and the United Nations can assist in the process. But there remain those Territories, in particular Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea, in respect of which that right continues to be denied; and in Southern Rhodesia the problem is overlaid with racial discrimination and apartheid-type policies which deprive large segments of the population of their most elementary human rights. Here, as on the even more arduous question of South. Africa itself, the approach in the United Nations must of necessity be a consistent one: no doubt must be left as to where the international community stands on the principles involved, and its condemnation must be firmly stated where these principles are denied.\n183.\tIn determining its position on the various draft resolutions on questions relating to southern Africa which will be before the present session, the New Zealand delegation will wish to give full weight to this moral imperative. It was for this reason that New Zealand recorded an affirmative vote earlier this year in the Economic and Social Council on its resolution 1591 (L) on apartheid, on which it had previously found it necessary to abstain in the voting on draft resolution V in the Commission on Human Rights. It is at the same time impressed by the view expressed by the Secretary-General in the section of his introduction entitled \\\"Concluding Remarks\\\" where, in the light of his long experience, he states in paragraph 143:\n\\\"It is however a weakness when resolutions are adopted which have no prospect of implementation, and the authority and prestige of the world's greatest deliberative body is thereby eroded.\\\"\nIt will be our endeavor in our discussions with the sponsors of resolutions on this topic and during the formal deliberations on them, to ensure that these wise words are given full weight.\n184.\tNew Zealand's view on the questions of apartheid and raciL? discrimination will be set out more fully under the appropriate items on the agenda. I should wish to place on record during this debate, however, my Government's stated intention to proceed to the ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)J as its major contribution to the International Year. For this purpose, the Government has introduced into the legislature a Race Relations Bill which is currently at the committee stage. We hope it will be enacted in time to allow ratification to take place before the end of this year. Our examination of the situation in New Zealand showed that, in practice as in law, substantial conformity with the provisions of the Convention already exists. A Race Relations Act, which establishes complete legislative compliance with this key international instrument, will nevertheless constitute an important landmark in the evolution of New Zealand's multiracial society, as well as an unequivocal rejection of all doctrines or political systems based on concepts of racial superiority.\n185.\tRacial discrimination is but one aspect, although a highly important one, of the broader problem of the defense and promotion of human rights. As New Zealand completes two successive terms of membership in the Commission on Human Rights, we can reflect on the gradual but definite progress which has been made. Looking back over the range of human rights instruments which the United Nations has developed over a longer period, we see legitimate grounds for satisfaction with the development of a substantial legal framework in this field. My delegation has considered for some years that what is now required is an institution which can assist in the promotion of human rights in order to enable the Organization and its Members to give effect to the commitments entered into under Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter. The proposed office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is, in the view of my Government, well conceived to meet this need. This office would provide, moreover, the means of exerting a positive influence on human rights questions, free from political considerations. Let us at this session finally come to grips with this issue. Let us discuss amendments to the terms of reference set out in resolution 1237 (XLII) of the Economic and Social Council so as to enable broad agreement to be reached. Let us strive to remove the doubts which a number of delegations have felt about this proposal. Agreement on this issue would represent an important achievement for this session and for the furtherance of respect for human rights everywhere.\n186.\tA major item involving human rights in the highest degree has not been separately included on the agenda of the present session, although the Secretary-General has dealt with it in cogent and eloquent terms in paragraphs 177 to 191 of the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization. I refer to the situation in East Pakistan.\n187.\tThe upheaval that has taken place there, causing perhaps the largest refugee problem in modern times, cannot simply be ignored by the Assembly. The consequences that continue to flow from that tragedy have been beyond the resources of both India and Pakistan to cope with and still demand urgent international attention. The United Nations has therefore been called upon to assume an important role in focusing attention on the human desperation involved and in co-ordinating and channeling aid to alleviate the distress.\n188.\tNew Zealanders have been concerned most at the human aspects of the problem the bloodshed and suffering and the far-reaching dislocation which the crisis has caused to the livelihood of both India and Pakistan. But we are also increasingly worried about its implications for the peace of the sub-continent. We have some understanding of the intensity of feelings that have led to this situation and that threaten to increase the human misery if a solution is not found soon, and we have some appreciation of the difficulties that have so far prevented a political solution from being achieved.\nthe problem. The humanitarian aspects were considered on two occasions this year in the Economic and Social Council. New Zealand took a part in having the question raised, because of the responsibility which we felt that body owed to the refugees themselves and to a shocked public opinion throughout the world. Those discussions served to emphasize, however, that in the absence of a durable political settlement very little can be achieved beyond meeting the immediate day-to-day needs of the refugees,\n190.\tShortly after the discussion in the Economic and Social Council the Secretary-General drew the attention of members of the Security Council to the situation in East Pakistan and its implications for international peace and security. That action, in our view, was both timely and a proper exercise of the powers of initiative of the Secretary-General. My delegation wishes to pay a tribute to him for having taken this step and for having set forth at length in paragraphs 124 to 137 of his introduction a concept of the role and powers of the Secretary-General which my delegation takes this opportunity to endorse.\n191.\tIn welcoming the Secretary-General's initiative in a public statement, the New Zealand Prime Minister, Sir Keith Holyoake, observed:\n\\\"The essential problem of reaching a political settlement in East Pakistan is one that only Pakistan's own leaders can solve.... But if one is to be reached a climate of confidence must be established., and this requires the co-operation of the Government of India. The Governments of India and Pakistan have so far acted with caution and restraint towards each other. Statements are, however, being made by political figures on both sides that cannot but undermine the positions of the two Governments and add to the tensions between them,\\\"\n192.\tThis deteriorating situation was described graphically by the Secretary-General in his message to the President of the Security Council when he said:\n\\\"... I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the time is past when the international community can continue to stand by, watching the situation deteriorate and hoping that relief programs, humanitarian efforts and good intentions will be enough to turn the side of human misery and potential disaster\\\".\n193.\tA durable solution can be arrived at only by negotiation and compromise between all the parties directly concerned, and not by further assertions of force. Substantial progress towards a settlement has so far not been achieved largely because of the tension that has developed in the area. That tension, in turn, has arisen in part from desperation at the apparent absence of any hopeful sign of a political settlement being reached in consultation with the elected representatives of East Pakistan. This is the crucial problem the Secretary-General was referring to when he spoke of \\\"a series of vicious circles which largely frustrate the efforts of the authorities concerned and of the international community to deal with the vast humanitarian problems involved\\\"[A/8401/Add.l, para. 184].\n189. We have therefore been anxious to see that the United Nations should bring its influence to bear fully on\n194. The United Nations has a heavy responsibility for maintaining international peace and security in the area\nwill not have fulfilled that responsibility simply by attending to the daily physical needs of the refugees, immense though these problems alone have become. As the New Zealand delegation said in the Economic and Social Council on 16 July, \\\"the dictates of humanitarianism do not cease with the provision of food and shelter. They extend to the long-term future of the unfortunate refugees and particularly their right to return of their own free will to their homes in conditions which promise them a normal life as citizens participating fully in their society.\\\"9 It is in this area of the problem that the United Nations can exercise a beneficial restraining influence, encouraging the leaders on either side to seek an acceptable accommodation and to act out of a sense of broad humanitarian concern for the interests of the refugees themselves, on whom the greatest burden of all has fallen.\n195.\tI do not wish to labor, in connexion with the question of East Pakistan any more than in relation to the war in Viet-Nam and the widened Indo-China conflict, the failure of the United Nations to play any real part at the political level. The shortcomings of the Organization in the area of peace and security were widely discussed during the twenty-fifth anniversary session. There are a variety of reasons for this state of affairs, residing mainly in the will of Member States to use the Organization and their concept of their interests outside it.\n196.\tOne element, however, which it should lie within cur power in this Assembly to rectify, is the state of the Organization's finances. This problem, arising from its involvement in peace-keeping activities, is intimately related to its future capacity in that area.\n197.\tWe are grateful to the Secretary-General for his frankness in stating that \\\"there exists no real basis for optimism or for the expectation that an over-all and comprehensive solution is imminent or likely to be found in the foreseeable future\\\" [ibid., para. 119]. I submit, however, that we should nevertheless, during this session, face up to this complex of problems with all the seriousness that we can muster. My delegation, for one, is willing to see negotiations engaged on the basis put forward by the President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [A/8497], More specifically, New Zealand, as a bond-holder, is prepared to see its bonds included in a negotiated package on the basis of a reduced face value, as well as to see waived such credits as might stand to it in the peace-keeping accounts of the Organization. It is New Zealand's expectation and hope that all other Members will join, in their various ways, in a united effort to save the Organization from the bankruptcy which is so clear and present a danger to it. This is surely a year when the United Nations is at the cross roads of history. Let us equip it for a vigorous future.\n198.\tI would like to join previous speakers in expressing our very high regard for the Secretary-General, U Thant, as he completes his final term of office. It was indeed a difficult inheritance to which he succeeded many years ago and he has performed with unexampled steadfastness,\n9 This statement was made at the 1783rd meeting of the Economic and Social Council, the official records of which are published in summary form.\nhonor and devotion the essential task of holding this Organization together over the ensuing period. We have all expected much of, as well as imposed much on, our Secretary-GeneraL May I say for New Zealand that our debt of gratitude to him is very high indeed.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, I wish, on behalf of the Uganda delegation, to add my voice to those who have congratulated you on your having been elect' ; to the high office of President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I have no doubt that under your wise guidance the present session will be a great success, and I can assure you, Mr. President, of my delegation's full cooperation and support.\n2.\tI wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Edvard Hambro, the distinguished Norwegian diplomat and jurist, who so ably presided over the last historic session during which the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations was commemorated.\n3.\tAllow me now to pay a special tribute to the distinguished outgoing SecretaryGeneral, U Thant. In 1953, Mr. Trygve Lie, the first SecretaryGeneral, when handing over his post to his successor, Mr. Dag Hammarskjold, described the job as \\\"the most impossible job in the world\\\". This, then, has been U Thant's task, which he has so ably shouldered for the last 10 years. Through the strength of his personality and selfless statesmanship, and by means of what has been described as his \\\"quiet diplomacy\\\", he has guided the world body through numerous critical crises, some of which were threatening the very basic principles on which our Organization is founded. I can only say that U Thant has served the world community with complete devotion and dedication and has proved to be a man of unquestionable integrity.\n4.\tMy delegation would like to seize this opportunity to welcome to membership of this Organization the States of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar.\n5.\tThis is the first time since the change of government in Uganda, in January of this year, that I have had the honor\n of addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations. The main purpose of this visit, therefore, is to reaffirm the undying faith of the new Government of the Second Republic of Uganda in the purposes and principles of the United Nations as contained in its Charter.\n6.\tOn 15 March 1971 the Uganda Government issued a formal statement on the foreign policy of the Government of the Second Republic of Uganda, and with your permission, I should like to quote a passage which touches upon this Organization:\n\\\"The Government of the Second Republic of Uganda attaches great importance to Uganda's membership of the United Nations and its affiliated international organizations and will continue to work in collaboration with Uganda's brethren in the rest of Africa to ensure that the United Nations and other world bodies are employed for the promotion of international peace, justice and the prosperity of ail nations.\n\\\"Uganda further believes in the universality of the United Nations and will fight for human rights the world over.\\\"\n7.\tIt is unfortunate that, 26 years after its foundation, our Organization has paid only lip-service to the principle of universality. The exclusion of the People's Republic of China has been a great setback in the realization of the aims and aspirations of this great Organization. The Uganda Government has, since the attainment of statehood, found no difficulty whatsoever in establishing full diplomatic relations with the Government of the People's Republic of China, and it is in that spirit that we should all welcome the change of heart on the part of a number of Member States, including superPowers like the United States, and the consequent improvement in their relations with the People's Republic of China. It is in the same spirit of optimism that on 20 July of this year the President of Uganda wrote to the President of the United States of America and to the Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China, expressing his sincere hope that the proposed visit to Peking by the United States President will go a long way to promoting good relations, not only between the United States and the People's Republic of China, but also throughout the world.\n8.\tMr. President, I dare to suggest that the world is at the threshold of great things and that, like your predecessor, you will be accorded the great opportunity of presiding over yet another historic session which will mark the reunion of nations when the People's Republic of China takes its rightful seat in the United Nations.\nA/PV.1943 and Corr.l\n9.\tMy delegation is therefore opposed to those highly sophisticated and complex procedures which have been \ndevised to secure dual representation a situation to which both Chinas stoutly object. It is our fervent hope and prayer as a peace-loving nation that everything will be done to resist the efforts of those who would prolong the deliberate exclusion from the international community of the great nation bf the People's Republic of China, comprising one fifth of the world's population.\n10.\tIn the same policy statement the Government of the Second Republic of Uganda declared that, in accordance with article III, paragraph 7, of the Charter of the Organization of African Unity, Uganda would pursue a policy of nonalignment with regard to all power blocs. Our Government further affirmed that it would continue to respect all the international obligations and commitments undertaken by the previous Government.\n11.\tOne of the cardinal principles of the Charter of the United Nations is: \\\"All Members shall refrain in their international' relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State...\\\". In strict conformity with that principle, Uganda believes that all nations should determine their own destinies as free peoples, including the projection and protection of their interests. We also believe that each country has a right to choose and remove its leaders or to follow its own system of government without external interference of any sort. In spite of that important principle, certain Member States of this Organization have taken it upon themselves to assume the role of arbiters and judges in the internal affairs of other Member States, That is a most unfortunate development which we hope will stop forthwith. Uganda strongly believes in, and will adhere to, the principles I have enunciated,\n12.\tHaving briefly touched upon the foreign policy of the Government of Uganda, I should now like to deal with a few of the issues before the General Assembly.\n13.\tThe issue of decolonization and the evil policy of apartheid of the Government of South Africa are of very serious concern to us in Uganda as well as to the rest of Africa. The obligation to promote the advancement of colonial peoples towards self-government, as acknowledged by the Charter, was given added impetus in 1960 by the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. Furthermore, I wish to reaffirm my country's strong support of the Declaration adopted, by the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session on the program of action for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Uganda fully agrees that \\\"the further continuation of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations [is] a crime which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations ... and the principles of international law\\\" [resolution 2621 (XXV)]. Uganda also supports the inherent right of colonial peoples to struggle by all necessary means at their disposal against those Powers which suppress their aspirations to freedom and independence.\n14.\tNotwithstanding the fact that a large proportion of the time and energy of the General Assembly has for the last five years or so been taken up with the problems of Zimbabwe, Namibia and the Territories under Portuguese\nadministration, no effective solution has yet been found and the future points to no brighter prospects.\n15.\tPerhaps nothing illustrates more vividly the helplessness of this Organization and the lawlessness of certain Member States than the case of Namibia. It is tragic to conceive that economic considerations on the part of South Africa's major trading partners should have stood in the way of justice and fair play and should for so long have been the main determinant of their political policies.\n16.\tWe welcome the recent advisory opinion on Namibia by the International Court of Justice  and hope that it will be followed by concrete action on the part of this Organization. The intransigent attitude the South African regime continues to take should leave this Organization in no doubt of that regime's intentions. Uganda views with great concern the failure of the United Kingdom Government to solve the problem of Zimbabwe. That is a responsibility that Government must shoulder. The Unite J Kingdom cannot, therefore, desert the people of Zimbabwe but must do all in its power including the use of force to bring about majority rule in that country without further delay.\n17.\tMy delegation condemns the continued defiance of international opinion by Portugal. Africa can no longer tolerate the manner in which our brothers in the so-called Portuguese Territories are being oppressed under the colonial yoke of Portugal. It is a well-known fact that Portugal is a poor country which cannot afford the expensive war now going on in its colonies in Africa. It is also a fact that Portugal gets military assistance from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO], of which it is a member. What is most disheartening is that the NATO countries held their recent meeting in Portugal, thus publicly demonstrating their support for the Portuguese colonialists in their oppression of the African peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). My delegation demands that the members of NATO put a stop to giving assistance to Portugal and instead use their good offices to bring about self-determination in the Territories under Portuguese administration.\n18.\tA matter that calls for outright condemnation by all peace-loving nations is the sale of arms to South Africa. My delegation condemns the United Kingdom's decision to consider resuming the sale of arms to the minority racist regime of South Africa contrary to the embargo imposed by the United Nations. My delegation equally condemns those countries that are secretly and quietly selling arms to, and encouraging the manufacture of arms by, South Africa. The Government of the Second Republic of Uganda would at this juncture like to appeal to the big Powers to do all possible to bring about a change in southern Africa.\n19.\tUganda is very much concerned about what is happening in the Middle East and in SouthEast Asia. We support the efforts made by the big Powers and all concerned to bring about the establishment of peace in those areas. We support Security Council resolution\n242 (1967) on the Middle East as a basis for the establishment of peace in that area. It is our hope that the good work started by Ambassador Jarring, Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral, will be continued and that he will receive the necessary cooperation from all parties concerned.\n20.\tUganda supports decision of the last summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity  to set up a special commission of African States to mediate in the Middle East conflict and also welcomes the mission of the Committee of the four African Heads of State to visit both Israel and the Arab Republic of Egypt to gather firsthand information before reaching a decision on the best means of achieving peace in the area. The fact that both Israel and Egypt have welcomed the visit of the Organization of African Unity Committee to their respective countries shows a genuine desire to end this continuing conflict. This is a most welcome development that my country wholeheartedly supports.\n21.\tOn South-East Asia, it is our hope that the Paris peace talks will soon come to a meaningful conclusion. We also welcome the decision by the United States to withdraw its forces from the area, as that will greatly ease the present situation.\n22.\tAs the country with the second largest refugee population in Africa, Uganda felt sufficiently moved by the serious refugee situation fast developing in India to contribute a sum of $14,000 out of its meager resources. It is the hope of the Uganda delegation that a solution will soon be found to this serious situation, which is threatening peace and security in that part of the world.\n23.\tLike any other peace-loving State, Uganda supports the efforts of the United Nations and the big Powers to bring about disarmament. Uganda supports the positive moves already made in that direction, and prays that the present Strategic Arms Limitation Talks will come to a successful conclusion. Uganda welcomes the efforts of the four Powers to reach a draft agreement on Berlin and notes with satisfaction the breakthrough already made in the negotiations aimed at relaxing tension in Europe.\n24.\tI should now like to make a few comments on social and economic matters. Uganda, as a developing nation, is striving hard to raise the social and economic conditions of its inhabitants. Unfortunately, the law of the jungle still prevails in international economics and trade, and every nation continues to fend for itself without anybody caring for the underprivileged. The terms of trade are so heavily weighted against the developing countries that, like Alice in Wonderland, they have economically got to run ever so fast just to keep where they are. On the other hand, there are numerous capital intensive countries which increasingly enjoy favorable balances of trade and untold wealth for their people. All efforts on the part of this Organization to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor countries have proved ineffective and futile. Besides, the world is experiencing a serious crisis in its monetary system, and the third world has been the innocent and helpless victim of the system. Economically speaking, the world is on a collision course.\n25.\tIt is the hope of my delegation that the developed countries will, in the interest of world peace and their own security, do all that is possible to liberalize their trade with the developing countries and increase their aid instead of reducing it. It is the bounden duty of this Organization to devise an economic formula that will reflect the brotherhood of mankind and the vital interdependence of nations.\n26.\tMr. President, as I conclude my address, I should like to wish you and the honorable representatives a productive and successful session.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to congratulate Mr. Malik on his election to the high and responsible post of President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n57.\tIt is quite natural that differences should exist between the various plenary meetings of our Organization. There have been sessions which have been dominated by questions relating to the struggle against colonialism, sessions which have taken place in an atmosphere of acute international conflict, and other sessions which have been held at times when there has been a definite relaxation in international relations.\n58.\tThe present session could be the start of a new phase in the life of this Organization, a new page in its annals. Not only the documents of last year's twenty-fifth anniversary session, but above all the existing conditions of contemporary development make it possible for our Organization to concentrate more this year than ever before on the solution of the questions for which it was established, namely the questions of peace and security.\n59.\tThe paramount and fundamental mission of our Organization is to prevent the outbreak of war. Czechoslovakia has always helped to guide the United Nations in that direction and wishes to continue to do so in the future. We value the United Nations and are confident that it will be able to play the role entrusted to it by the Charter. At the same time we must recognize that, unless acute international political problems are solved and unless decisive steps are taken to eliminate hotbeds of tension and strengthen international security, it will be impossible to solve the problems of mutual co-operation successfully.\n60.\tThe active defense of peace is one of the main objectives of Czechoslovak foreign policy. We have stated this in the past and it was clearly reiterated from the rostrum of the Fourteenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Peace is necessary to us, as it is to the other socialist States and to all peace-loving peoples. This is not an expression of weakness but an understandable desire to ensure tranquility in the lives and creative work of men. This, Mr. President, why we attach such great importance to our Organization's activities in the maintenance of international peace and the suppression of aggression. It is this which was the primary concern of the peoples of the world when they established the United Nations. And it is this which concerns them today, as has been shown by the spontaneous response to the peaceful initiative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which was proclaimed at the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n61.\tAllow me now to explain here the views of the Czechoslovak Government with regard to several of the main problems of the contemporary international situation and ways of resolving them.\n62.\tThe Government and people of Czechoslovakia are particularly interested in securing lasting peace and security in Europe because of our bitter experiences in the past and our desire to create favorable conditions for the socialist development of our society. We hold that an improvement in the situation in Europe, especially the signing of an agreement on the establishment of a common European system of collective security, would be an important contribution to the cause of maintaining and strengthening peace throughout the world. This would give the peoples of Europe a feeling of relief and confidence. It would also open the way to a significant broadening and intensification of trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural links. Czechoslovakia is deeply interested in the mutually advantageous development of such co-operation and also wishes to participate in the solution of such common European problems as the \\\"development of transport, the preservation of the natural environment, the exploitation of energy resources, and the broadening of co-operation in such fields as public health.\n63.\tIt is a question of taking advantage of practical possibilities. Improvements in relations between European States have already helped to create the conditions for the construction of a high-capacity gas pipeline from the Soviet Union which cuts across my country and will be useful to many States. European rivers, particularly the Danube and the Oder, are far from being fully utilized as sources of electric power and above all as transport water-ways connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the Black Sea and the north with the south.\n64.\tSpecialists from the European countries could even sit down together tomorrow and begin work if the necessary political conditions for this were created and if artificial obstacles were not constantly placed in the way of mutual understanding.\n65.\tIn its desire to strengthen peace in Europe, my Government is participating actively in efforts to convene a conference on questions relating to European security and co-operation. The conclusion of an agreement on West Berlin  has removed one obstacle which has been used by NATO States virtually to block any possibility of progress in negotiations regarding -the preparations for such a conference. We hope -that the way will now be open for the convening j>f the conference and that it will be held in the near future.\n66.\tSince the conclusion of the agreement on West Berlin and the agreements concluded with the Federal Republic of Germany by the Soviet Union  and the Polish People's Republic,  which have had such a favorable influence on the atmosphere in Europe, the pressing need for full recognition of the German Democratic Republic by all States and the need to eliminate discrimination against it in the United Nations and other international organizations have become even more apparent, particularly since the German Democratic Republic is co-operating actively with the forces struggling for the implementation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n67.\tWe should like to express the hope that present developments in Europe will also have a favorable influence on our negotiations with the Federal Republic of Germany concerning the normalization of relations. We are sincerely interested in seeing these negotiations with our western neighbor come to a successful conclusion. This will, however, make it necessary for the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany to take the same stand with regard to the shameful Munich Diktat and to recognize it as invalid from the very outset.\n68.\tIn future, too, we feel that the disarmament negotiations, which offer distinct possibilities of achieving further positive results, will be an important area of United Nations activities. We set particular store by the broad new program of the Soviet Government on disarmament questions. We see that program as a basis for further realistic negotiations both in the Committee on Disarmament and in this General Assembly.\n69.\tWe have before us a specific draft resolution on the convening of a world disarmament conference. The convening of such a conference, in which all States of the world would participate, would be appropriate and timely. In our opinion, the conference would assess the present status of the disarmament talks, single out the key problems standing in the way of real progress towards the achievement of general and complete disarmament, and do as much as possible to facilitate the settlement of those problems,\n70.\tIf we assess the development of the disarmament talks in recent years, we cannot say that the negotiations which have taken place so far in various forums have failed to produce any tangible results. Ci the contrary, we can observe a number of positive steps. The Committee in Geneva has already prepared several draft Treaties on partial disarmament measures which have subsequently been adopted by the General Assembly and which have already been signed and ratified by a considerable number of States,\n71.\tThus year we expect that the General Assembly will be able to consider and approve another significant document the draft Convention on the complete prohibition and destruction of bacteriological weapons. We believe that the conclusion of such a Convention would be a positive step which would carry us forward in the disarmament negotiations. At the same time, however, we shall have to continue to work persistently on the prohibition of chemical weapons, too.\n72.\tWe are prepared to participate actively in the implementation of other partial disarmament measures as well, but at the same time we should like to stress that several Treaties concluded in previous years have not yet been fully implemented. I am referring mainly to the fact that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons on the Sea-Bed have so far not been signed and ratified in such a way as to have truly universal force and effect, as their meaning and purpose require.\n73.\tIt is clear, therefore, that some positive steps are being taken in the field of disarmament but by no means enough to satisfy us. We have so far made no progress mainly on the key questions relating to effective disarmament, above all in the field of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union was therefore quite right in giving top priority to the need for efforts by the five nuclear Powers to achieve positive results towards banning and eliminating nuclear weapons. The responsibility of the nuclear Powers is beyond question and that is why their active participation in the solution of these problems is also necessary.\n74.\tIn view of these considerations and in view of the present-day reality, we support the convening of a world disarmament conference, We should like it to become a forum in which all States, particularly all the nuclear Powers, could make a contribution to the realization of effective disarmament commensurate with their responsibilities,\n75.\tOne of the most dangerous hotbeds of international tension is still the United States aggression in the IndoChinese peninsula. Despite the fact that they have suffered a whole series of military, political and diplomatic defeats in that area, the aggressive forces of the United States are attempting by means of their so-called policy of Vietnamization to breathe life into the Saigon regime, which they support for the purpose of suppressing the national liberation struggle in IndoChina.\n76.\tThe proposals submitted by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam provide a reasonable basis for the solution of the IndoChina question in the interests of the right of States and peoples to decide their own fate; we support those proposals.\n77.\tThe past year has also failed to bring a solution in the long-suffering region of the Middle East. The Arab countries, victims of brutal armed aggression, have shown amazing patience and responsibility, The goodwill to achieve progress in the peaceful settlement of problems in that region has repeatedly been shown in the constructive approach and many of the statements of the representatives of the Arab Republic of Egypt. Israel, as we all know, has always reacted negatively. Even the initiative Egypt has taken in attempting to open the Suez Canal to international navigation has failed to elicit the appropriate response.\n78.\tIsrael, whose responsibility for the present situation is beyond the slightest doubt, has so far done nothing to give even a hint of willingness to meet the efforts of the Arab countries half way. In addition, the world is entitled to expect Israel's supporters to recognize their exclusive responsibility and use their authority and influence to convince the Israeli representatives that their position is untenable and inadmissible. Instead, they are even further strengthening Israel's aggressive potential, thereby encouraging it to remain obdurate. Thus, events are again leading to a situation which threatens to end in a new military conflagration.\n79.\tOur delegation believes that at this very session the time has come for the General Assembly fully to recognize our Organization's responsibility for the implementation of the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 [242(1967)]. We must ensure that the necessary conditions are created in the Middle East for a lasting peace which would respect the legitimate rights of all the peoples living in that area.\n80.\tThe time has also come to take decisive steps to normalize the situation in the Korean peninsula. There can be no peace m that area as long as the southern part of Korea is occupied by troops under the United Nations flag. The withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and the dissolution of the United Nations Commission is an urgent task which our Organization must carry out in the interests of settling the Korean problem. In this connexion, the latest proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the peaceful reunification of the country deserve our attention and full support.\n81.\tCzechoslovakia has always actively supported the inalienable rights of peoples to self-determination and independence. We shall therefore continue consistently to be on the side of the national liberation struggle in colonial and dependent Territories.\n82.\tThe economic instability in the capitalist world at the present time is marked by a slowing down of the rate of industrial -growth and an increase in the number of crises and in inflation; this not only aggravates social conflicts but also heightens the unevenness in the development of individual countries. We are witnessing attempts to cure the disorders of the Western monetary system at the cost of restricting international trade, including trade with developing countries.\n83.\tThere is no doubt that the restrictive measures introduced by the main Western countries in connexion with the present crises in the world monetary system are causing a substantial deterioration in the conditions for effective participation by developing States in international trade and the international division of labor. Such actions sharply contradict the document on the Second United Nations development Decade and are thereby seriously threatening its implementation.\n84.\tIn these circumstances, the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development will soon begin at Santiago. This Conference is to review the development of world trade and adopt recommendations for the further development of international economic relations. We believe that the main purpose of the Conference should be to promote the creation of normal conditions for international trade. We hope that the Conference will also assess at its true value the significance of trade between countries with different social systems and that it will condemn the antiquated practice of the Western Powers of using trade as an instrument of their global policy, a practice which creates artificial obstacles to the development of world trade in general.\n85.\tCzechoslovakia welcomes the fact that the United Nations has also recently begun to consider the problems of the human environment. As the initiator of the conference of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on the problems of the environment, Czechoslovakia is prepared to participate fully in its work.\n86.\tThe Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, adopted at last year's session of the General Assembly [resolution 2734 (XXV)], and the very course taken by that session have caused Member States to give some thought to ways of improving the work of the Organization and enhancing its prestige, which has been weakened by activities inconsistent with the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter. Time is the best test of human endeavors and of the viability of ideas and time has also tested the viability and purposes of our Organization. This test has shown that the principles upon which the United Nations is based are still valid today. The main purpose-to save mankind from the scourge of war and promote mutual international co-operation in all fields of human endeavor remains unchanged.\n87.\tIn this sense the Czechoslovak Government welcomes all ideas and all initiatives designed to improve the work of the United Nations and is prepared to co-operate in the noble effort of creating peaceful conditions for human happiness on this planet.\n"

        "file_text": "78.\t  May I take this opportunity to convey to you, Sir, the congratulations of the Government and people of Tanzania on your unanimous election to the Presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that, with your great experience and wisdom, you will steer the proceedings of the Assembly to a successful completion. Our profound admiration goes to your distinguished predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, who as President of the historic twenty-fifth session guided the Assembly's deliberations with so much wisdom, talent and efficiency. We also wish to pay a special tribute to U Thant, our distinguished Secretary-General, who for the last 10 years has served our Organization with utmost diligence and dedication and has won the admiration and respect of all of us.\n79.\tAs the Organization enters its twenty-sixth year of existence, one of the many problems that confront it, and indeed all the Members, is that of ensuring that it is equipped with adequate financial and manpower resources to carry out the large number of programs and the responsibilities now being undertaken by the Organization. No organization can exist without being provided with enough financial resources, and the Secretary-General has reminded the States Members of the United Nations of the chronic financial difficulties that the Organization is facing [A/8401 Add.l, paras. 117-123]. These difficulties are not the result of a lack of sound management by those whose unenvied task it is to administer the finances of the United Nations; they have been created by the Member States themselves. Therefore a solution to this problem will have to come from Member States. The question is not whether\n, the Organization has power to tax individual Governments against their own will; rather, it is, and indeed it has always been, whether we, as Member States, are prepared to make the necessary political decisions to equip the Organization with the financial resources it needs, not merely to survive, but also to perform its many functions and responsibilities.\n80.\tThe great issues of equality and human dignity which have figured in the general debate in the past remain as pressing as ever. In spite of clear and outright condemnation by the United Nations, and by all the peoples of the world, the evils of colonialism and racial discrimination still afflict millions of people in the world. In Africa and elsewhere, racial and colonial problems are getting worse. In South Africa and Namibia, as well as in the Portuguese colonies, white regimes led by a handful of racists and fascists have intensified measures designed to perpetuate the enslavement of the African populations. And in Zimbabwe, the United Kingdom is engaged in secret negotiations with the rebel authorities, the objectives of which can only be the further betrayal of the interests of the African people, who, ironical as it may sound, the United Kingdom has sworn to defend and protect.\n81.\tThe General Assembly at its commemorative twenty- fifth session once again reaffirmed its condemnation of colonialism in all its manifestations, and unequivocally condemned the evil policy of apartheid as a crime against the conscience and dignity of mankind, The adoption of the program of action for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 2621 (XXV)fwas hailed by mankind as a further indication of the determination of the international community to engage in an all-out war against the evils of man's inhumanity to his fellow man.\n82.\tYet, all those who have been guilty of these crimes continue to practice their tyranny and oppression of millions of innocent people. South Africa, in spite of its energetic protestations that it is willing to live in peace with other African countries, has actually refined its oppressive apparatus against its own black population. In that unhappy land, more people are hanged yearly than anywhere else in the world. The prison population is the highest in the world in proportion to the entire population of the country. Mass arrests, demolition of houses, evictions, torture of the worst kind, have become the South African way of life. Indeed, we can only say that members of the racist South African regime no longer are rational human beings.\n83.\tBy their actions of organized violence against the human person they have in fact turned themselves into despicable monsters. For, let it be clearly understood, rational beings are endowed with certain characteristics, among them those of compassion, love and respect for the sacredness and dignity of all human beings. This is what binds us all, and it is a bond that cuts across all barriers of language, race and color. The South African white racists, by their actions and their warped belief, do not share in those characteristics. Their political creed is based on the philosophy of hate; their economic system is supported by a system of slavery; and their religious creed has been distorted so as to support and give credence to their philosophy of hatred and organized violence against the human person, his spirit and his mind. That, in brief, is the nature of the racist regime in South Africa.\n84.\tIt should be realized, then, that when that regime's leaders talk about the black man in that land being unable to govern, it is in fact they who have lost their ability to lead other people. That is why the people in South Africa have been fighting and protesting all along; that is why countries like Tanzania have supported this struggle; and that is why the United Nations and all its Members should redouble their efforts to deal with South Africa. For in opposing and condemning the South African system we are doing justice to our sacred duty, and we are true human beings, recognizing that all of us are inseparably bound together on the small earth we rightly call ours. If we hesitate, we will bring upon ourselves the kind of destructive evil that the world not long ago so heroically fought against-Hitlerite fascism.\n85.\tIt is in that context that we have viewed the recent pronouncements in South Africa and elsewhere about that country's willingness to live in peace with other African countries. To us in Tanzania the issue is clear. The white racists of South Africa have come to terms with the majority of the people in that country. It is the people of South Africa who must have righted the wrongs done to them. Yet South Africa has not shown any signs that it is prepared to treat its black people as human beings. Indeed, what South Africa is asking is that the outside world should leave it alone to pursue with impunity its diabolical program of violence and oppression of millions of defenseless African people. There is no other motive.\n86.\tThe obligation of the rest of the world is therefore clear. We must not relax our vigilance nor fail to take measures which must end the human tragedy in South Africa. South Africa should be completely outlawed from the community of nations-for it must not be allowed to behave as an outlaw at the same time as it enjoys the rights and privileges of a law-abiding nation. That would make a sad mockery of the Charter of this Organization and would place in jeopardy the principles on which all humanity operates and co-operates. South Africa cares very little about those principles, or about the Charter of the United Nations and what it embodies.\n87.\tSouth Africa's attitude t, the United Nations can be seen in the manner in which it has refused to comply with the Assembly's decision to terminate the Mandate over Namibia. In that country South Africa has moved systematically to introduce the same rule of tyranny and repression which already exists within its own borders, in spite of the clear and outright protest and condemnation by the entire world community. And now the International Court of Justice in its recent ruling has confirmed, in an advisory opinion,  the illegality of South Africa's continued presence in Namibia,\n88.\tBut it is not South Africa alone which is guilty in this matter, for some of those who have publicly condemned South Africa's actions are the very ones who continue to honor, respect and recognize in principle South Africa's illegal rule in Namibia.\n89.\tA tremendous impetus to the development of the rule of law in the international community has been given by the Court's elaboration of the rules regarding the responsibility of international tribunals and those governing the conduct of States when faced with an illegal act or a series of illegal acts committed by a State of the international community. What should be the attitude of the international tribunal? Should it turn a blind eye to the illegal act? Should it wink at it, ignore it, or flinch from it? No, said the International Court of Justice. No court of justice worthy of the name can flinch from pronouncing upon a State which has committed an illegal act the doom or fate which its consequences legally entail.\n90.\tAnd what about other States, members of the inter-national community? May they ignore the illegal act of the delinquent State? May they feign indifference to the violation of law and justice, or even become parties to it-aiders and abettors, so to speak, of the illegal act? Not in the least, replies the International Court of Justice. It is the duty of all other States members of the international community to refuse to live with the illegality; to refuse to tolerate the continuing violation of legality; and to insist that the recognized culprit return to the course of action which peace, honor and justice in international relations demand.\n91.\tI shall not burden this discourse with further analysis of, and comment on, the significance of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in elaborating those basic rules of international conduct. I would, however, particularly refer the attention of representatives to those parts of the opinion in which the right of self- determination is placed clearly and incontestably among those which must be respected by all States members of the international community. It is the hope of my delegation that the international community will apply those rules in dealing with the illegal presence of South Africa in Namibia.\n92.\tThe same kind of senseless inhumanity continues to be practiced in the Portuguese colonies of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), and the United Kingdom colony of Rhodesia. Indeed, the white minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonialists are determined to work and co-operate together so that the rule of terror and the enslavement of the African populations under their control will never cease. It is a tragic\nsituation the more so when one realizes that those minority regimes have managed to do what they are doing only because of the strong support given them by powerful allies.\n93.\tEven at the risk of repetition it should be noted that Portugal is a small impoverished European Power, and if it were not for the backing of its allies, Portugal would have granted freedom to its colonial peoples a long time ago-not willingly, but because of complete defeat by those who have been fighting against Portuguese oppression for more than ten years. That that has not happened is not because the freedom-fighters are less determined than they need to be; it is because, instead of fighting Portugal alone, they have now to contend with the formidable resources placed at the disposal of the Lisbon authorities by their NATO allies.\n94.\tLet me add, in particular, that France, contrary to its which national tradition of championing the cause of liberty, equality and fraternity, has continued to demonstrate its contempt for the rights of the black man. It has now decided that the arms it has been selling South Africa should be augmented by allowing that country to manufacture, under license, Mirage fighter planed. In that respect France has now distinguished itself as one of the freedom- fighters* most dangerous enemies,\n95.\tIn Rhodesia too the racialist oppression of the African majority continues and, indeed, intensifies month by month. And now, once again, \\\"talks about talks\\\" are taking place in Salisbury between the representatives of the United Kingdom Government and the administration of the minority Smith regime. The United Nations cannot remain uninterested in those developments, and Africa at least cannot fail to be worried by them.\n96.\tFor the Rhodesian issue is not just a matter of legal niceties; it is a question of fundamental importance to the daily lives of something like 5 million inhabitants of Rhodesia, The real issue at stake is whether, and if so when, the principles of human equality, human dignity and human freedom are to prevail in that Territory. Rhodesia is governed by a white minority. Its black population is denied political, economic and social rights, which are possessed by its white population. Further, it is a colony of the United Kingdom-even though one which is in rebellion against the British Crown. For many years that is, since before Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of Rhodesia's independence-Tanzania has been demanding that the United Kingdom should accept in the case of Rhodesia the principle which it applied in virtually all its other colonies which were advancing to independent nationhood, that is, the principle of independence based on majority rule.\n97.\tThe logic of this demand is unassailable- It is no use saying that you are committed to the principle of majority ride if you concede independence before it is achieved. For once a country is independent its Government can do what it likes, quite regardless of any promises it has made beforehand. That is the meaning of sovereignty, The Government of an independent Country is constrained in its actions only by the power its people have over it and by its assessment of the response, in power terms, which other nations will make to any of its decisions. It is not restrained by anything else, not even by promises it made before independence. And in Rhodesia at this time it is not only political power which is concentrated in the hands of the white people; that minority also controls the economy of the nation and, for all practical purposes, its military force as well.\n98.\tTo concede independence to the present regime in Rhodesia is therefore to accept a Government over which the majority of the population has no effective power, and in circumstances where that majority is not even equipped to defend itself by economic or other peaceful action. Nor would an independent Rhodesia under minority control have much reason to fear an effective adverse international response to the perpetuation of its racial tyranny. For not only does it have the impotence of the international community in relation to South Africa as an example to inspire it, but it may also reasonably assume that a Government which would not enforce its own legal authority is unlikely to do more than make sad noises about developments after that legal authority has been relinquished.\n99.\tBut successive British Governments have refused to accept the principle of NIBMAR, that is, No Independence Before Majority Rule. Instead they have taken their stand on what they call the \\\"five principles\\\". On those principles they have stated that they would be willing to come to a \\\"settlement\\\" with Ian Smith and his supporters* They involve guaranteed, unimpeded progress to majority rule; guarantees against retrogressive amendments to the Constitution; an immediate improvement in the political status of the African population; progress towards ending racial discrimination; and the British Government's satisfaction that any proposed basis for independence was \\\"acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole\\\".\n100.\tThe \\\"five principles\\\" are not what Africa and this Assembly have been calling for. But Tanzania is now worried as to whether the United Kingdom Government is really going to insist even upon those principles. For it appears that the United Kingdom Government's \\\"talks\\\" with the Smith r^me are intended to work out some camouflage for an entirely new definition of the words \\\"majority rule\\\", or \\\"the people of Rhodesia as a whole\\\", or \\\"guarantees\\\". Certainly it is difficult to imagine what else this continual return of the representative of the United Kingdom to Salisbury could mean other than a search for impediments to majority rule which would satisfy Ian Smith while allowing the United Kingdom Government to pretend they did not exist.\n101.\tLet me make it quite clear, therefore, that to us \\\"majority rule\\\" can only mean the majority of all the people of that country, regardless of color, race, education, income, sex, tribe, or any other distinction between human beings which the ingenuity of man is able to devise. And the opinion of the \\\"people of Rhodesia as a whole\\\" must mean the opinion of all the people of the country after they have had a direct and free opportunity to judge the issue and speak for themselves.\n102.\tIf the situation in southern Africa is painfully tragic and explosive, the state of affairs in the Middle East and Indo-China is no more consoling.\n103.\tThis is the fifth year since the territories of three States Members of this Organization were forcibly occupied by foreign forces. And in spite of the urgings and the appeals of the international community, there has been no visible sign that the aggressor is prepared to abandon the fruits of its aggression. The continued occupation of Arab lands by Israeli military forces not only is a brutal injustice to the Airab States concerned but, above all, also constitutes a contemptuous disregard for the principles and the purposes for which our Organization stands,\n104.\tIf peace and justice are to reign in that area, it is absolutely imperative that territorial expansionism should not be condoned and the legitimate rights of the Palestinians should be recognized and respected. In the interest of international peace and security, this Organization must attempt new initiatives in its efforts to see to it that justice is done in the Middle East.\n105.\tThe misery and suffering of the people of IndoChina, and more particularly of Viet-Nam, continue unabated. It is very deplorable that, notwithstanding a number of public pronouncements that the war in that area was being de-escalated, the Viet-Namese people continue to be subjected to systematic killings by the United States and allied forces.\n106.\tIt should now be clear to all that heroic Viet-Nam will not succumb to the dictates of foreign designs. The resistance and tenacity of the Viet-Namese are a matter of pride to the third world and indeed to all those who value freedom and human dignity. Is it not now time that those who thought they could subdue Viet-Nam by military might took serious and concrete measures to rectify their errors? How many more innocent lives are to be sacrificed before the Viet-Namese are allowed to decide their own destiny? The Tanzanian Government is convinced that the solution to the Viet-Nam war lies in the legitimate and serious proposals made by the National Liberation Front of South Viet-Nam-proposals which we fully support. For generations the Viet-Namese have never known peace. Is it too much to ask that these people be now allowed to enjoy that peace which we all cherish and which it is the basic purpose of the United Nations to uphold? Only the total withdrawal of foreign forces from the land will give the Viet-Namese that opportunity. Yet peace and freedom in Viet-Nam are, and must be, interlinked with the peace and freedom of the whole area of South-East Asia. If there is to be a durable peace in Indo-China, it is absolutely essential that the people of Cambodia and Laos also be left alone to decide their own destiny. It is an intolerable anachronism that in this day and c.ge there should be nations which still arrogate to themselves the role of international policemen.\n107.\tWe find that anachronism also in Korea, where the United States and its allies continue to have military forces in the southern part of the country. However, the Korean situation is disturbing in another way also; for there the name of this Organization is being misuse^ to further imperialist interests. In demanding the total withdrawal of foreign military forces from South Korea, Tanzania is not only supporting the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people for national unification, which aspirations are definitely frustrated by the presence of those forces. Equally important, we are demanding that the name of this\nOrganization should not be abused or misused to serve the selfish interests of certain Powers. In this connexion, my delegation wishes to reiterate its disappointment at the unfortunate decision taken by this Assembly at, its 1939th meeting to postpone to the twenty-seventh session consideration of the items related to the withdrawal of foreign forces now occupying South Korea and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea.\n108.\tThe conscience of the world has been stirred by the tragic events affecting the people of the eastern part of Pakistan. To the miseries of flood have been added those of civil disruption, mass exodus and epidemics of dread diseases. Any of these misfortunes by itself would have been enough to try the spirit and tax the resources of the people and Government. Coming as they have done, one after the other, within a harrowingly short period of time, they have caused untold grief and suffering to millions. We sincerely hope that the international community will not relax its efforts to relieve the suffering of those people and that their return to their homeland will be speedily ensured.\n109.\tProgress towards the goal of general and complete disarmament continues to be disappointingly slow. The treaty concluded last year, concerning the non-emplacement of nuclear weapons on the sea-bed,  is the latest in a series of partial disarmament measures which began with the 1963 test-ban treaty.  A common characteristic of these measures is that they nibble at the edges of the problem rather than going straight to the center. Another characteristic is that the measures prohibit all States from pursuing courses of action which the major Powers no longer consider necessary in order to develop or maintain their military domination. Always these measures, when presented to the smaller nations for acceptance, are accompanied by promises from the major Powers to continue efforts to attain the more lasting and desired goal of general and complete disarmament.\n110.\tWhat progress has been achieved towards that goal since the last session of the General Assembly? There has been agreement among the major powers on a draft convention prohibiting only biological or bacteriological weapons in warfare,  despite the insistence of an overwhelming majority of smaller States during two successive years' discussion that such a prohibition should be extended also to chemical weapons. This leaves States free to continue to use the napalm and pesticides which cause mass destruction of the lives and crops of Viet-Namese peasants and of villagers in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau).\n111.\tAlso there has been, we are told, a \\\"breakthrough\\\" in bilateral talks between the major Powers towards the limitation of intercontinental ballistic weapons, that is, in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. What this means to the major Powers is disputed: the parties themselves apparently attach different significance to the event, What it will mean to most of the smaller States is likely to be in the nature of symbol or gesture, since we have not the capacity even had we the will-to manufacture or deploy such weapons in the near future.\n112.\tI must confess that my Government felt some alarm when we had a recent proposal for a conference of select participation to discuss general and complete disarmament [A/8328]. The participants at such a conference would apparently be limited to five Powers. The rationale for such a proposal one could appreciate, namely, that the five Powers possess in themselves the capacity to destroy the world completely in a nuclear holocaust. However, general and complete disarmament involves more than the prohibition or reduction of nuclear weapons; and it involves all States, not only a handful of major Powers.\n113.\tMy Government has therefore been relieved to hear the latest proposal of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It indicates a moving away from the stage in which it was assumed that whatever was good for the major Powers was good for the rest of the world. If a conference to discuss general and complete disarmament is to be convened, it should have the participation of all States. Its chances for success would thereby be greatly enhanced but, what is more, the chances for implementation of any agreements resulting from such a conference on disarmament would be even greater.\n114.\tThe economic situation m the developing countries is not getting better. The slow and declining rate of economic growth of the developing countries, on the one hand, and the rapid increase in the economic growth rate of the developed countries, on the other, continues to enlarge the disparity between these two groups of countries. Last year at its commemorative session, the General Assembly launched the Second United Nations Development Decade. Like the first Development Decade, the Second Development Decade seeks to redress the ever-widening disparity between nations.\n115.\tYet, it is also true that what is facing the developing nations is not so much a problem of lack of planning, nor is it a lack of development decades. The problem, as we see it, is one of lack of meaningful political commitment to world development by the developed countries. For if the developed countries were serious, they would work to change the existing pattern of international trade and development, which favors developed countries very much more than the developing countries. Only if this is done will the developing nations be able to reap the benefits of their efforts and ensure a self-sustaining growth of their economies.\n116.\tIt is a sad fact-but still a fact-that the problems Which led to the proclamation of the first United Nations Development Decade have not been effectively solved, nor have the various recommendations and resolutions adopted by the General Assembly been fully implemented. It is the hope of my delegation that, during the period of the Second Development Decade, the developed nations will exhibit a new spirit of co-operation. By means of such co-operation, appropriate solutions could be found to the problems of world trade and development in the interest of all peoples; but this depends on a recognition of the need to solve immediately the urgent trade and development problems of developing countries.\n117.\tIt is also the hope of my delegation that these and other issues will be discussed adequately at the forthcoming third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to be held in Santiago, Chile, in 1972,\n118.\tLast year a majority decision to restore all the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations was again frustrated by procedural maneuvers on the part of those who kept on insisting that, before the representatives of that country could sit in all the organs of the United Nations, a two-thirds majority would have to be obtained. The events of the past few months vindicate the position taken by Tanzania as well as by the majority of the members of the Assembly. We believe, as we have believed all along, that the General Assembly has no alternative but to restore to the representatives of the People's Republic of China their seat in the Organization. It is gratifying to note that even some of the opponents of the People's Republic of China have now accepted the realities of the legality of the Government of the Chinese people. It is ridiculous that this should have taken 21 years.\n119.\tIt is, therefore, the hope of my delegation that the issue of restoring to the People's Republic of China all its rights will be decided once and for all at this General Assembly. May I take this opportunity to make it clear that my Government rejects categorically the so-called two- China policy. The issue which is before the Assembly remains, as it has always been, the question of who should represent the 800 million Chinese people in the United Nations.\n120.\tIt has never been an issue of admitting a Member to or expelling a Member from the United Nations. Taiwan is a province of China, and since the rightful representatives of the people of China take their seat in the organs of the United Nations, there can be no room for those who hitherto have pretended to represent China.\n121.\tIn conclusion may I express the warmest congratulations of my Government to the three new Member States, Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar. We have no doubt that the presence of these three countries, with their rich traditions and ancient civilizations, will enrich the deliberations of our Organization and contribute to the continuing search for international peace and security.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "181.   Mr. President, may I, on behalf of my delegation and the Government and people of Fiji congratulate you on your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly; and in so doing I should like to assure you, Sir, of the full co-operation of my delegation. Your election is well deserved and my delegation is confident that under your presidency the affairs of this august body will be conducted in the same able, wise, efficient and pleasant manner which has characterized your outstanding career.\n182.\tI should like to express our appreciation for the great contribution made by your immediate predecessor, Ambassador Hambro of Norway, whose qualities as President of the General Assembly last year and as a leader of high repute and integrity are well known to all of us.\n183.\tMy delegation would also wish to join previous speakers in expressing high regard and appreciation for the services loyally and faithfully rendered by our Secretary- General, UThant, to the United Nations and to the countries and peoples all over the world. Amongst the patient, sincere and honest toilers for world peace and international understanding his name must rank very high.\n184.\tFiji attained its independence almost exactly a year ago today. One of its first acts as a sovereign State was to become a Member of the United Nations. So it is that as with many of the other newer nations in the world our experience of independence and our experience as a Member of the United Nations are of equal duration.\n185.\tOur acceptance into the world body gave us an immediate opportunity to exercise the independence we had achieved, to attempt to gauge the role we might be able or expected to play and to try to ascertain the directions in which we might move and the contribution we might make. It has also brought us face to face with the reality of our situation and we have had equally to recognize the roles that we cannot or must not play, the directions in which we cannot move and the contributions that we cannot make. It has been a rewarding experience-at times exhilarating, at others sobering.\n186.\tIt has been no easy task for a nation as small and as new as Fiji to grapple with the complexities of many of the issues with which we have been confronted- some of which have been exercising this Assembly almost from its inception but we have been sustained by the unfailing encouragement and the understanding attitude which we have encountered from our friends, both old and new, within the world Organization. I should like to take this opportunity to thank them all for their help and forbearance.\n187.\tThis Assembly has welcomed in its midst a number of small nations in the past few years, including Fiji, We have already had the opportunity at this session of welcoming three new Members, Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar, which, by the areas of their territories and the numbers of their populations, must also be classed among the small nations of the world. Fiji had the very great honor and pleasure of co-sponsoring the candidature of one of them, Bhutan, and of supporting the candidatures of them all.\n188. The question has often been raised whether there is truly a place in this Assembly for us, the small nations. In spite of the difficulties-some of which I have mentioned- which confront us in participating fully in the activities of the Organization, the answer from the small nations and, we are pleased and encouraged to note, from many of the major Powers as well must emphatically be that there is a place for us and that there is a role which we can play.\n189.\tThe great virtue of this Organization, from the point of view of the small nations, is that it is the one international forum in which our voice can be raised on terms of equality with all others. The great strength of this Assembly must reside in the esteem in which it is held and in the respect which its resolutions command, an esteem and a respect which it is in the interests of us all, both great and small, to strengthen and preserve. In a world where many of the great international issues can be expressed in their most simple terms as conflicts of interest between just two or three of the great Powers, the opportunity which this Assembly gives to small nations to speak on these issues in the course of debate, the need of the main protagonists to pay heed to the equal voice which the Charter of the United Nations accords to each Member regardless of size and the moderating influence which even small nations can thus bring to bear to minimize the possibility of these conflicts of interest degenerating into open hostilities  those are all factors which point to the small nations as being an important element in the preservation of international stability.\n190.\tWith the object of better acquainting this Assembly with the role which appears to be emerging for Fiji after just one year of independence and of membership in the United Nations, I should like to dwell briefly on some of the issues where my country feels it might have a small contribution to offer and on some where it feels it has a definite interest to pursue.\n191.\tFiji is very conscious of being not only a small nation but also one of the smallest States Members of the United Nations. It is conscious too of being among those countries commonly referred to as \\\"developing countries\\\" whose constant preoccupation must be the development of their economies, a task often complicated by rising population and the rising expectations of their people.\n192.\tFiji's view must also spring, of course, from the two inescapable elements of its geography and history. Comparatively speaking, we are an isolated nation, a group of islands set in mid-Pacific. Although we are not so poor in land resources as are some of our Pacific neighbors, our more than 300 islands comprise but 7,000 square miles. The ocean which surrounds us therefore exerts a dominating influence on our environment and our outlook.\n193.\tOur recent history is one of more than 90 years as a colony of the British Crown. That has left many legacies, one of which is a society composed of several races. Besides the indigenous Fijians and Rotumans, there are Indians. Europeans, Chinese and people from other Pacific Islands. All live together harmoniously despite differences of race, religion and culture, and it was this happy state which was responsible for our peaceful transition from our colonial status to independence some 12 months ago.\n194.\tIn wishing to make a positive contribution to the work of the United Nations, we have therefore been glad of the opportunity to take part, as a member, in the work of the Special Committee on colonialism.  With our recent direct experience as a colony and as a small nation ourselves, we feel that we may have some little insight into the problems of the remaining colonial Territories, many of which are even smaller than us and have populations which are already placing a great strain on their meager natural resources. In addition, a considerable number of them are situated in our own part of the world. Whatever may be the inherent evils of the colonial system, and whilst it must be the duty of this Organization continually to remind the metropolitan countries of their obligations and responsibilities towards the Territories under their control, the solution to the problems of these remaining Territories will not be easily found. They must be approached with the understanding of their very special and peculiar problems, and the pace of constitutional change must be in accordance with the wishes of the people themselves. That has been, and will continue to be, the burden of Fiji's submissions to the Special Committee whose deliberations on these problems, we venture to hope, we may have been able to assist in some small way during the past year of our membership.\n195.\tAnother issue which underlies many of the questions which come before this Assembly is that of racialism. As we have all seen in its manifestations in many different parts of the world, it is an issue capable of arousing the deepest and it must be said-the most sincere of emotions. It is unfortunate, however, that these emotions, however sincere, often lead to a situation where it is impossible for any communication to take place between the two sides in the issue.\n196.\tIt is our firm belief that progress towards an amelioration of racial divisions and racial strife in the world can only come to pass when every effort is made to maintain contact and communication and to resolve differences on a basis of mutual understanding.\n197.\tWe in Fiji, with our multiracial society comprising two major races and a number of substantial minorities, feel that we have some practical experience in this field and by virtue of this may well have a useful contribution to make. We have attempted to make such a contribution and will continue to do so whenever a suitable occasion offers.\n198.\tI have already mentioned the very special position of the sea in determining Fiji's outlook. We are an oceanic people dwelling in an oceanic archipelago. The sea and the land of Fiji are entirely interdependent. Our people look to the one as much as to the other as elements of their environment. The sea is conceived, not as separating the many islands of our archipelago, but as joining them. It is our roadway. It has ever been a source of sustenance to our people, and to many of them it is the major one. As increasing population puts more and more pressure on our limited resources on land, we must look more and more to the development of marine resources, including submarine mineral resources, for the support of our people.\n199.\tFiji has accordingly been most interested in the preparations being undertaken by the sea-bed Committee for an international conference on the law of the sea which it is proposed to hold in 1973. Fiji attended the recent meeting of the sea-bed Committee in Geneva as an observer. Our representative addressed the Committee at its 62nd meeting and presented a statement setting out Fiji's aims and aspirations, Fiji hopes that the international community, through the 1973 conference, will at last give full consideration to the position of oceanic archipelagos, of which there are a considerable number, and will make adequate provision for them in the law of the sea. Fiji hopes that the moderate claims it is making in regard to territorial waters and to exclusive fishing rights will be sympathetically viewed in the light of their importance to it as a developing country.\n200.\tIn all these matters it is Fiji's earnest hope that the greater developed nations will strive to achieve a true understanding and appreciation of the needs of countries such as Fiji and will not take advantage of their size and power to deny to the smaller developing countries the opportunity to make use of the marine resources which surround them. To do so would seriously prejudice the likelihood of these developing countries improving their lot by their own efforts and would perpetuate their dependence for aid on the developed countries, a situation which can be desired neither by the one side nor the other.\n201.\tA natural consequence of the importance of the sea to Fiji's people has been our deep concern-in common with many other Pacific nations and indeed with other United Nations Member States, great and small, whose representatives have spoken before me during this session on this vital subject -at the renewal by France in 1971 of atmospheric nuclear testing on Mururoa Atoll. On this occasion our independent status enabled us for the first time to protest in our own right at the contamination of the atmosphere and of the sea which these tests must cause and at the subjection of the peoples of the South Pacific, against their will, to increases in the levels of radio-activity which, no matter how small, must be regarded as potentially hazardous to health. Fiji also associated itself with a joint protest made by our New Zealand friends on behalf of all independent South Pacific countries following a resolution at a meeting of Pacific Heads of Government, the South Pacific Forum held at Wellington from 5 to 7 August. We are, therefore, gratified that the French Government has now seen fit to call a halt to these tests, We are confident that France, which has in so many ways demonstrated its concern for the less privileged nations, will be sufficiently sensitive to the feelings which the tests have aroused that it will make this halt permanent and final. At a time when problems of pollution and environmental management are increasingly occupying the attention of the world, and when the vast majority of States have subscribed to the partial test-ban treaty of 1963,  we are sure that the Members of this Assembly will not wish to \u00abfve our confidence misplaced.\n202.\tOne of the most significant functions of the United Nations from the point of view of the developing countries must obviously be its role as a source of multilateral aid, Fiji has of course been receiving assistance from the United Nations developmental organs for a number of years. Through the agency of the United Nations Development program, a number of activities are being undertaken in Fiji. We are deeply grateful for this assistance, which is making a solid contribution to the solution of our problems as a developing country. We would, however, sound one note of warning. While we fully understand the need for such bodies to ensure that their funds are expended to the best advantage, nevertheless they should guard against a tendency to try to impose conditions which are incompatible with the independent sovereign position of even the smallest country.\n203.\tFiji has welcomed the growing tendency of late for a number of United Nations Development program projects, besides catering to Fiji's own needs, to be designed as regional ones, aimed at meeting the common needs of several South Pacific territories. Regional co-operation in the South Pacific is very close to our hearts in Fiji and it is a subject to which I should like to return later in these remarks.\n204.\tThe past year has seen the doors of many great international organizations, both inside and outside the United Nations family, opened to membership by Fiji. Because of our limited resources, one of our tasks has been to try to distinguish those which are relevant to us and in which we can usefully participate. It is no easy task, and it is one which must continue to occupy us for some time to come. Important as our membership in some of these organizations may be, our sense of geographical identity has led us to place great emphasis on the development of our relations with our immediate island neighbors. We have close relationships with some of these territories dating back many centuries before European entry into the Pacific. It has been deeply satisfying for us to renew these relationships as independent modern States and to rediscover our common heritage and the community of interest that we share. Regional co-operation is not new in the South Pacific; the South Pacific Commission has been in existence since shortly after the Second World War and is developing more and more as an institution representative of the interests of the Pacific territories rather than those of the founder metropolitan Powers, namely, Australia, France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, which none the less continue generously to bear the main burden of its budget.\n205.\tWe are pursuing the aim of regional co-operation in other fields also. We have in Fiji the regional University of the South Pacific serving 10 English-speaking countries iii the region. There is the Pacific Islands Producers' Association, which is concerned with fostering commercial cooperation and in solving joint inter-island shipping and transportation problems.\n206.\tA most significant development was the meeting in August this year in Wellington of the South Pacific Forum. The Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, as members know, referred to this body in his -statement earlier this afternoon. This was an inaugural meeting of the leaders of \nindependent South Pacific countries, and it was kindly hosted, at the request of the Pacific countries, by New Zealand. This was the first meeting of its kind, but was so successful and revealed so many new avenues for consultation and co-operation, that it will be repeated next year when Australia has kindly offered to be the host. The Pacific voice in world affairs will always be a small one, but there are encouraging signs that it will become increasingly harmonious and at least distinctly audible. These endeavors are all directed towards solving our problems by self-help and mutual assistance through a process of consultation and discussion. We, and those of our neighbors which have emerged as sovereign States, have all achieved our independence through this process.\n207. Our Prime Minister, Sir Kamisese Mara, when addressing the Assembly at the commemorative session last year, referred to the philosophy underlying the process as the \\\"Pacific way\\\" [1876th meeting, para. 205], I humbly commend the \\\"Pacific way\\\" as a philosophy deserving of wider application. It is one which distills into a simple phrase the ideals upon which the United Nations was founded. It is the main contribution which we in the South Pacific have to offer to the world at large, and it is the main contribution which my delegation will be offering to the deliberations of this Assembly during this twenty-sixth session."

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, on behalf of Nicaragua, I greet you and congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. In you, Sir, we greet a distinguished statesman of an outstanding nation, who, on many counts, is worthy of universal appreciation and respect. We understand the pleasure which the Republic of Indonesia must have when one of its most outstanding sons has assumed, amid the applause of the worlds the severe responsibility of presiding over this session of the Assembly, as a recognition of your personal merits and civic virtues, and in honor of the devotion which your country has for the noble and just causes of mankind.\n2.\tThrough you we pay a tribute to all those peoples who have not yet achieved their freedom, Your high office, signifying as it does the greatest degree of equality, is the best guarantee which oppressed peoples have that the United Nations will be watching out for their rights.\n3.\tWe should also like to greet your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro, who wisely presided over the work of the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session, and in so doing honored his well-respected international personality.\n4.\tThis session marks 10 years of meritorious service on the part of Secretary-General U Thant. The most brilliant leaders of the world hold deep sympathy and undying gratitude for this man. His, concerns and his efforts have led him to all parts of the world where there has been a need to be satisfied or a problem to be tackled. In Nicaragua we were also honored to receive him as a messenger of peace. We are particularly fond of remembering his visit and our Head of State, President Anastasio Soinoza, as well as all Nicaraguans, have special feelings of admiration, gratitude and friendship for hie:.\n5.\tWith gratitude and deep emotion, I must say that our country gladly goes along with the well-deserved tribute paid to U Thant by the nations on the eve of his voluntary retirement from his honored post, a post which he honored by his devotion. I think that the best tribute to his efforts would be to adopt resolutions that carry out the philosophy and guidance which he bequeathed to us in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8401/Add J].\n6.\tIt is our task to find a successor to U Thant who will be worthy of his dedication as a statesman, someone who, like him, will keep alive his faith and be willing to struggle so that the ideas and purposes of the United Nations might cover all parts of our globe with his mantle of peace.\n7.\tDuring the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, when the President of my country made use of this forum to add his voice to those of the leaders of the world who were celebrating the great event, a question was asked of the Assembly: \\\"... what would have happened in the world had the United Nations not existed? \\\" And he told us:\n\\\"Let us therefore strengthen what cost so much sacrifice to create. Let us be untiring in our search for peace. Let us be understanding to realize that it must be based on justice. Let us build peace, devoid of prejudice and ambitions, a peace filled with understanding and good faith\\\"\n8.\tPrompted by the feeling of our President, who was expressing the faith which the world has in the United Nations, we think that the twenty-sixth anniversary is the proper occasion to repeat our faith in this world Organization, which has entered its maturity with new vigor and which is now enriched by new blood with countries which, after having achieved their freedom, are co-operating in the great task of furthering international peace.\n9.\tLet us extend a welcome to Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar, whose presence is a stimulus to the new nations which are coming to share the experiences and responsibilities of our \ntimes in a common effort to preserve, for progress and freedom, the new generations of mankind.\n10.\tNicaragua is carefully observing what the big Powers are doing to solve, through mutual agreement, the problems of the world. The leaders of these Powers wish to shoulder the enormous responsibility of deciding the fate of millions of human beings who are today living and who will be living in the future.\n11.\tThe Government of Nicaragua, wishing, as it does, to contribute to this universal task, a task which cannot and must not be delegated to others, calls upon all the States Members of this Organization to take a more active role in its tasks so that we can share in this way the responsibility of determining our own destiny.\n12.\tOur Government understands that the budgetary burdens imposed by our Organization on the big Powers do not give these Governments preferential rights and, as our countries progress, this economic burden should be shared by us,\n13.\tThe United Nations is a productive investment which goes beyond the ideals of peace and brotherhood. It has practical aspects of great value for our developing nations, which very often lack capital and the necessary technology to move ahead. Our Organization is bringing about the closing of this gap between the developing and the developed countries and producing sure benefits for those of us who are contributing to its maintenance and operation.\n14.\tMy country has received from the United Nations and its specialized agencies economic and technical assistance for the development of various programs of public administration. This is assistance whose influence has been felt in a beneficial manner throughout the national economy. We have hopes that the request made for the competent organs to study the feasibility of channeling the San Juan River and its adjacent zones will make possible for the abrogation of the Chamorro-Bryan Treaty,  which marks an historical landmark in the relations between Nicaragua and the United States of America, and this will be not only a cause of patriotic satisfaction for our citizens, but would also make it possible to transform the San Juan River into a development project which would benefit the peoples of Central America and increase their opportunities of trading with the rest of the world.\n15.\tThis project for building a canal is part of the general program which the Government of Nicaragua has for making the most efficient use of its water resources, a use which has begun with hydroelectric dams at the Tuma River and the growing use of the living resources of our seas.\n16.\tOn this last point my Government believes that the international community has an interest in two aspects of my country's position on questions of the sea.\n17.\tIn accordance with the fishing law of 1958, Nicaragua has for several years been exploiting the living resources of the territorial sea in a zone 200 miles wide. In the same way explorations have been undertaken to determine the mineral resources of the continental shelf over which we have been exercising full and uninterrupted possession and sovereignty.\n18.\tWe shall be participating in the conference on the law of the sea with a realistic attitude and shall maintain our country's already recognized right of exploitation of an area of 200 miles in width and over the adjacent zone for reasons of health and defense which have been determined with the closest adherence to the practices which exist among States. We believe that the Geneva Conventions ought to be revised to fix the extent of the territorial waters and the continental shelf, leaving it up to the contiguous States to determine, through treaties, the corresponding marine borders.\n19.\tThe developing countries, as their technological capacity increases, must resort increasingly to the exploitation of resources of the territorial seas, and of the soil and the subsoil of its seas and oceans. Nevertheless, there will have to be readjustment between the desire to have wide areas in the sea and the continental shelves for strictly nationalist regions, and the demands of the international community, which has declared as a benefit and common property a zone of the sea and of its soils and subsoils the size and limitations of which have not yet been determined.\n20.\tNicaragua considers this action of the international community to be very hopeful. It will offer unsuspected possibilities for co-operation among States through a system of exploitation which will promote intergovernmental enterprises and will also make it possible for the international community to give justice to those countries which are less favored economically through a fair use of the benefits resulting from exploitation under an inter-national regime.\n21.\tThere exist at present among States situations of manifest and unjust inequality of opportunities which have produced extraordinary advances for a few sectors of peoples of the world and progressive under-development for the vast majority of its peoples. This is a situation which must be corrected. If the international regime over the seas does not incorporate the germ of a more just world order, it will make no difference whether it is 200 miles or nothing, since the same regime among States will produce the same inequalities.\n22.\tThe important thing is that the conference on the law of the sea should give impetus to the creation of an order of relations among States which will make a reality of the dream of development and offer a real equality of opportunity to the peoples of the world. Towards this pragmatic alternative all efforts of the Government of Nicaragua will be directed at the conference. We, as Nicaraguans, will try at that conference to see to it that these goal are crystallized through international action and by me offered by the United Nations as an institution which  nations among States, an institution which is supposed to avoid unilateral actions which have tended to defend special economic and social interests rather than the interests and needs considered vital to mankind.\n23.\tNicaragua has always based its international policies on a recognition of the same right in other States which we demand for ourselves. The tradition of Nicaragua of using peaceful means, arbitration and constructive dialog goes back to the first years of our independent life. Numerous treaties and conventions have defined our jurisdiction and sovereignty, and there is not an inch of our territory which has been added through conquest, nor has there been arbitrary action on the part of our Government to the detriment of the interests and rights of other peoples.\n24.\tPossibly it was in recognition of what I have just said that the States Members of the United Nations, with the invaluable support of the Latin American group, honored Nicaragua with the designation of non-permanent member of the Security Council, the presidency of which it was thus able to assume in the person of Ambassador Guillermo Sevilla Sacasa, one of the most outstanding sons of our country.\n25.\tConscious of the great work of Ambassador Sacasa and the praiseworthy manner in which he has carried out his responsibilities in strict compliance with the legal traditions of our country and in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, my Government would like to pay public tribute to him in the same way in which he has paid tribute, so fittingly, to other great men who have made of their lives, as has Mr. Sacasa, living examples of dedication to justice and devotion to peace and total service to the good of all.\n26.\tThis is a good opportunity to pay a tribute, as the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, to the correct manner in which other members of the permanent mission of my country to the United Nations have carried out their own delicate tasks.\n27.\tOur contribution to the efforts of the United Nations, to its aspirations and philosophy, has not been limited to words and actions in the international field. We think that justice begins at the level of States when we cause to flourish in them a just internal order and when we educate new generations in the principles of solidarity, equality of opportunity and co-operation among individuals. The international panorama reflects these actions and attitudes and the values by which peoples are able to live among themselves within the juridical framework of their own States.\n28.\tNicaragua therefore has maintained and does maintain in its full meaning the fullest observance of rights and the broadest civil liberties. Our respect for freedom of conscience, information, and the full exercise of civic participation of our citizens ha. gone beyond laws and is found in all forms of life. Reliable evidence of this fact can be found in the stability of our institutions and the free exercise of political interests and permanent dialog, which we have instituted as a definite means to serve our own development.\n29.\tIn accordance with the pure ideals of the Charter of the United Nations, political groups in Nicaragua enjoy absolute freedom to join together in a search for their own goals, and dialog and co-operation have been characteristics whose development we have stimulated since the earliest days of our independence. The people of Nicaragua have favored a two-party political system; nevertheless, our laws give the right to any democratic and peace-loving group to assist through its own philosophy in guiding and even reforming the development of national life. Examples of this assertion are abundant in our history, and on various occasions political parties have governed jointly in order to favor a climate of peace and co-operation among citizens.\n30.\tConsistent with that tradition, the two major parties of Nicaragua recently signed a political convention before the diplomatic representatives of 'many of the world's nations. Their top leaders, the President of the Republic, Anastasio Somoza, as the head of the Liberal Party, and Dr. Fernando Agtiero Rocha, as head of the Conservative Party, signed this convention, inspired by a desire to incorporate into our Constitution the most modem ideological currents and the most advanced principles of social justice in order to make a Teality of the aspirations of the people of Nicaragua, not as a unilateral action of the party in power, but as a result of free determination and full involvement of the nation itself in deciding and achieving its own future, with all its hopes and ambitions.\n31.\tInspired by this desire achieve and maintain the broadest participation of all our citizens, the parties signing the political convention, although together they include almost all our citizens, have made provision for safeguarding the participation of other political groupings in the coming election of deputies to the National Constituent Assembly, and have agreed to invite observers from regional organizations sufficient in number to enable the world to witness the purity of the coming electoral process.\n32.\tMy Government is pleased at the tendency of the other Governments in the world to make use of all possible means to decrease international tensions. Hie Heads of State and their cabinets have increased their negotiations and contacts in order to guide their peoples towards the desired goals of peace, freedom, justice and progress. The leaders of the great Powers and their diplomatic representatives have drawn closer together in attempting to resolve harmoniously the principal problems of the present world, particularly those separating their own countries. This is why we note with satisfaction such advances as the incorporation of the People's Republic of China into the international order, the rapprochement between the two Germanys, and the talks concerning Berlin, disarmament, the tensions in the Middle East and i??c-;e in South-East Asia.\n33.\tWe have also been attentive and interested witnesses to the efforts being exerted by Latin American political leaders to strengthen the ties of friendship and co-operation among institutional orders inspired by a plurality of ideologies. That plurality, which we have respected, is revealing of the freedom that has been implanted in the American continent as the key to its progres\\\" and development, and of the observance of the principles of self- determination of peoples and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, both of which are cornerstones of the Organization of American States.\n34.\tLoyally conforming to the political inspiration of our regional organization, the Government of Nicaragua has striven to improve present conditions in the Central American Common Market by establishing numerous bilateral and multilateral contacts in which the leaders of the Central American countries have participated with praiseworthy interest. As a result, we have seen a lessening of the differences that had separated two neighboring countries the contribution of which is essential for the success of our economic integration.\n35.\tWe have also greeted with profound sympathy the recent initiatives taken by the President of the Republic of Guatemala on the occasion of the sesquicentenary of the independence of Central America. My Government believes that positive steps should be taken to lay the groundwork for political integration of the Central American countries, as suggested by the President of Guatemala, because to do so would not only imply the satisfaction of a long-standing desire of our States, but would also establish the real basis for the final and successful outcome of the economic and social development of Central America.\n36.\tThe economic and political integration of the Central American countries should arise out of the awareness of our peoples themselves. The efforts and intentions of our leaders could very well be hindered if there has not been a previous decision on the part of the citizens of Central America. Each and every Central American should have a clear awareness and a firm will to join his efforts and aspirations within a single nationality. It is essential that we strengthen the Organization of the Central American States as a nucleus and driving force for the political unity of the isthmus, and formulate a concrete plan so that in the five countries it will be the people who will put into effect this new attempt to set up the Federal Republic of Central America.\n37.\tWith a less ambitious purpose but with no less sincerity, the Government of Nicaragua has been trying to strengthen and multiply the ties that unite it to our sister Republic of Mexico and to the entire Latin American community. To that end, the President of Nicaragua accepted the cordial invitation extended to him by Mr. Luis Echeverria, the President of Mexico, and together with members of his Cabinet and distinguished representatives of private enterprise in Nicaragua, he recently visited our sister Republic, laying the groundwork for profitable agreements for co-operation that will be reflected most certainly in benefits to our own development.\n38.\tIn essence, the Government of Nicaragua, within the context of the Latin American community, has joined in positive fashion in the political life of the continent. It has done so with full awareness of the necessity for harmonious co-operation among peoples and persuaded that violence from the right and the left must be eliminated through democratic processes, nationally as well as internationally, because we have proscribed all use of force as an instrument of policy. We firmly believe that the doctrine that seeks to make of the continent of Colombus a continent for its own inhabitants and one which will be a repository for the hope and faith of the world, is today more than ever the collective responsibility of all our peoples, one that we must carry out with prudence and firm will.\n39.\tThe Government of Nicaragua notes with satisfaction the initiative of calling a conference on European security.\nIn these times in which the security of every nation is closely tied to that of other nations, it is necessary to speak of world security. Any other conception of security would be restrictive and not in accordance with the facts of history.\n40.\tOne of the essential foundations of security is that it must not depend solely on the control of offensive and defensive weapons, but rather on the establishment of a just international order and of equally just national orders. We must wipe out. poverty, disease and inequality of educational and economic opportunities, and guarantee for every human being the satisfaction of his fundamental needs and the full development of his individuality. Such an order can be established only with the disappearance of all forms of domination by force or by economic and technological supremacy. Otherwise, unless such injustices are removed, it will not be possible to speak of the security of any nation, because the only permanent foundation for security is the one that results in justice in relations among individuals and among States.\n41.\tMy Government wishes to take this occasion, when the representatives of the world's Governments are gathered to make history, to make an appeal to all Members of this Organization, urging them to solve the old problems that afflict present-day society and that demand prompt and energetic action.\n42.\tThe problems existing on the African continent and in Asia, the proliferation of micro-States, the worsening of economic inequalities among nations all these can be the spark igniting a holocaust which it is our duty to prevent. Let us prevent it by carefully paying due attention to the principles of coexistence among States and to the right of every human being fully to enjoy his own resources and to decide his own future.\n43.\tFreedom cannot continue to be the privilege of nations which lave been able to achieve it, but a right, consecrated and assured to ,11 nations of the world. There is no human or divine justification for some countries to enjoy this freedom whereas others are kept in a state of complete deprivation of this fundamental need of human beings.\n44.\tUniversality within the United Nations can be achieved only through these means. It is not enough that new countries or old States come into the United Nations but are left out of the responsibilities and benefits. If the incorporation of the People's Republic of China, with millions of people and the immense potential of its age-old culture, is justified by the principle of universality, if that same principle also justifies the permanent membership of free peoples, such as the people of Nationalist China, whose permanence in our Organization ought to be ensured, the achievement of this principle of universality justifies acceleration of the process of decolonization, so that new peoples having received international recognition of their right to be free and sovereign can become members of the universal concert for which we are working in order to bring about the rule of freedom and justice in the world.\n45.\tFreedom alone can ensure progress and full self- realization for mankind. The misery which now affects millions of human beings in the Middle East and in Pakistan, as well as in many other areas in the world of which we know, is the result of a social order which we have set up and which requires careful and well-defined reform.\n46.\tThe United Nations has appointed a commissioner for Palestine refugees, who is administering and co-ordinating international assistance. We are convinced that a similar post should be created for the millions of Pakistani refugees who also deserve the protection and assistance of our Organization.\n47.\tBut those measures are insufficient. Human suffering bears witness that we are living in an insecure world. There can be no security if we persist in maintaining a social order which provokes such suffering, a fact which is clear evidence of the need to rectify the situation. Security ought to be universal, and must be achieved by strengthening the United Nations and by the realization of its principles and ideals as instruments which will be of its own making and which will strengthen and make more universal its scope of action. To act in any other way would be tantamount to a death sentence for the greatest Organization which man has created for the achievement of happiness for mankind and would make of the collective responsibility, which we have all freely sought, a partial decision of a group of States which has been set up outside our world Organization and the beneficial influence of the human community.\n48.\tIn the firm conviction that we are acting under the inspiration of the purest humanist principles, and hoping to see justice and reason prevail over ambition. I should like to raise my prayers to the God of Nations so that as a result of our deliberations, we may show a capacity to give future generations the hope, justice and security which we desire for ourselves.\n49.\tToday's world, our own world, is facing a situation which requires serene action and the broadest spirit of co-operation among individuals and States. We are facing it with only the arms of a fretful human spirit. We are facing a situation of change, as seen in the irrepressible progress of new values which are creating a new awareness in the world. We do not believe that by isolating ourselves or raising protective barriers, material or spiritual, we will find solutions adequate to our task. Better interaction, better co-operation, better understanding and growing solidarity are the tools which we will have to use to produce a change towards real bases of happiness, freedom and justice as the common heritage for all human beings.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "149.  Mr. President on behalf of the Italian delegation I am very happy to express our satisfaction at seeing you preside over the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly and to offer you our warmest hopes for success in your undertakings. In electing you unanimously to that post, the Governments represented here have attested to the esteem which they feel towards a statesman and an eminent diplomat as well as towards the great people of Indonesia, who are at present playing such an important role linking Asia and the fifth continent, Australasia.\n150.\tI am sure that the wisdom with which you will direct our debates will match the example given us by the President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Ambassador Hambro. I should like to take this opportunity to repeat our gratitude to him for the exceptional contribution he made to the work of the commemorative session of the General Assembly.\n151.\tMay I also endorse the tributes that have been addressed to our Secretary-General, U Thant, who has occupied his high office with dignity, reliability, and a wisdom and competence that have earned him the confidence of all Member States. In the course of a long period characterized by frequent crises and dramatic events, he has borne his burden of responsibilities with unique sensitivity. For all these reasons, we sincerely regret learning that he is retiring from the post that he has for so long occupied in the center of the world arena.\n152.\tOur work this year, therefore, is being carried out under two of the most eminent statesmen of Asia. This leads me to stress the ever-increasing role that the Asian continent is playing in the destiny of mankind. Asia is re-emerging today on the world scene, a continent inhabited by hundreds of millions of people who embody an impressive heritage of civilization and culture and are imbued with new initiatives and ideas. In the international context China already occupies a very important position. Japan has become one of the great economic Powers of our day. Other Asian States of ancient traditions are catching up on their delayed economic development.\n153.\tThese are the most evident signs of the profound change that is taking place in the balance that was established at the end of the Second World War. New centers of influence are emerging and are being added to those that already existed. I think we should be pleased and follow with interest this course of evolution. It affords great possibilities for assuring international peace and security. Since a profound modification of the existing situation is taking place, if the transition from the old balance to the new is to be accomplished without setbacks; at least three basic conditions must be met.\n154.\tFirst, in order that the dialog to be established among a much larger number of centers of world influence be not only feasible but fruitful, it is necessary for each of the centers to have the possibility of participating fully in the life of the family of nations.\n155.\tThe second condition is that this dialog draw its inspiration from the principle of peaceful co-operation and not from out and out competition.\nfew moments speak briefly about Europe-it is not sufficient in itself.\n156. The third condition is that, while the dialog among Mr. President, on behalf of the Italian delegation I am very the great centers of influence is necessary and I shall in a few moments speak briefly about Europe -it is not sufficient in itself.\n157.\tWith regard to the first condition, I should like to recall that the Italian Government has for a long time advocated the universality of our Organization, It is Consistent with that view that we trust that at the present session the Government which lawfully represents the great Chinese people, that is, the Government of Peking, will take its place in the General Assembly and in the Security Council. We stress the historic decision of President Nixon to renew a dialog that has for too long been suspended between the United States and the People's Republic of China. I trust that this development will have fruitful results for the cause of peace in the world. Within the lines of the universaUty of the United Nations, we are also gratified that a number of States which have recently acceded to independence Bahrain, Qatar and Bhutan have joined us at the opening of this session of the General Assembly. Other States are still not in our Organization, but I strongly hope that they will join us very soon.\n158.\tWith regard to the second condition that I defined earlier, I would recall what the Secretary-General of the United Nations stated in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8401/Add.l]. Indeed, he stressed the need to strengthen peace and security and, in that way, to reach increasingly effective agreements concerning both peace-keeping operations and general and complete disarmament.\n159.\tRegarding the third condition, I should like to recall that the great problems confronting the world today cannot be solved only by the efforts-even the joint efforts-of the great Powers. Each and every man must be asked to contribute to the struggle of humanity for survival, dignity, liberty and well-being. Of course we can no longer agree that there still exist certain peoples that make history and others that suffer it: the democratic conscience of the world could not accept that.\n160.\tOur Organization must therefore remain the world forum where the peoples of the world can bring their claims and where we can all work together to find the best way to solve the great problems confronting mankind. It is by beginning to create conditions of confidence and co-operation among neighboring States that we can hope little by little to establish a better order. The golden rule of the foreign policy of yesteryear was that the enemies of our neighbors were our friends. But more and more that rule is being replaced by a new one: our neighbors must be our friends. Indeed, we see more and more frequently and in more and more parts of the world, that there are close ties of co-operation and union being set up between neighboring peoples. Because they are recent and eloquent witnesses to this development may I mention on this specific point the Andean Pact in Latin America  and the Federation of Arab Republics in the Mediterranean.\n161.\tI wish to mention here the friendly relations that Italy enjoys, in a constructive spirit, with all countries- without exception that have a common frontier with it or that, bathed by the Mediterranean Sea, share a common heritage of history, culture and interests,\n162.\tI should like briefly to mention the relations of my country with one of its neighbors, relations on which the General Assembly has in the past received considerable information. Last year [1857th meeting] the Italian delegation brought the Assembly up to date on the positive result achieved from contacts between the Italian and Austrian Governments on the interpretation and the implementation of the agreement signed in Paris on 5 September 1946, Since then, concrete measures have been adopted by the Italian Government to guarantee the legitimate rights and to ensure the peaceful development of the different ethnic groups that live in the Alto Adige, and it intends resolutely to continue along the same lines,\n163.\tThe progress that has been achieved in that field has permitted a favorable development in Italo-Austrian relations, and we, for our part, hope that we shall be able to make them even wider and ensure their growing cordiality.\n164.\tRegarding relations between Italy and its neighbors some of which are its allies I should like to stress the exemplary nature of our relations with Yugoslavia which are the fruit of the will of the two Governments and the two peoples in the widest possible way to develop mutual co-operation in an atmosphere of full confidence.\n165.\tI should also like to mention the traditional ties between Italy and Malta and the sincere friendship of the Italian people for the Maltese people, as well as the efforts that my Government is constantly making in order to open up a new era in its relations with Libya.\n166.\tI feel in duty bound to add a few words regarding the union that has been set up between a number of peoples of Western Europe and which has been institutionalized in the European Economic Community, of whose Council of Ministers I have the honor at the moment to be pro tempore chairman -a Community which, although its title bears the adjective \\\"economic\\\", has nevertheless acquired an increasingly obvious political trend.\n167.\tThis work of both economic and political unification of a large part of Western Europe was born of a grand design: to have mutual co-operation replace mistrust and rivalry among the peoples of the region-two factors that have been at the root and the origin of two world wars. This Community, which has been an important, I would say, outstanding success, is open and will remain open to all the peoples of Europe that draw their inspiration from the same concept of political life and that may wish to participate in it. We trust that very soon negotiations for the adherence of the United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland and Norway will be completed. Other Governments will also sign association agreements. Hence a wide and unified economic market, composed of more than 250 million people, will have been launched.\n168.\tThis undertaking may give the peoples of Europe a better chance to have their voices heard. Can this regained influence be a danger to anyone? The answer is no. It is not and shall not be directed against any people. It is directed against war, against the burden of armaments, against famine, against under-development, against inequality, against all and any that might interfere with free and fruitful communication among all men.\n169.\tI should like to mention the considerable contribution that the European Economic Community is already making to the maintenance of peace and balance in the world. Apart from the efforts that each of the member countries may deploy on a bilateral level, the Community has facilitated the establishment of relations of a new nature between the industrialized countries and those of the third world,\n170.\tThe convention of association with a group of African countries  has been a very important step along those lines. But the Community has no intention of limiting its aid to a single geographical sector. The recent decision to apply generalized preferences to the third world stands as eloquent proof of this.\n171.\tSecondly, I wish to mention the constant contacts between the members of the European Economic Community and the United States and Canada, their friends and their allies, in order to come to a true detente with the countries of Eastern Europe. A number of bridges have been thrown across the gaps that had been opened by events, whose memories are now beginning to fade. All the Governments and peoples of Western Europe have understood and approved of the courageous initiative of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany to reestablish normal relations with the countries of Eastern Europe. As early as three years ago, in fact, they had made clear that one of the roads to detente lay in the mutual and balanced reduction of forces in the heart of the Old World.\n172.\tThe efforts of a number of years, the patient search for points cf possible agreement, and the care not to disturb the balance of forces have finally been rewarded by aft agreement that is probably one of the most significant of the post-war period. I am speaking of the agreement that will guarantee the rights of the people of Berlin. That city had stood as the symbol of a Europe divided in two, one part armed against the other. In order to progress it was necessary to do away with that line on a future of peace and co-operation; proof had to be given that the fate of 2 million men and women was not going to be jeopardized. Let us pay tribute here to the goodwill shown by the Governments concerned during the course of the negotiations.\n173.\tTrue, all is not yet settled; there are still obstacles to be overcome for the two parts of Europe, by means of free contacts between the inhabitants of both sides, to come together at last.\n174.\tIt is to progress along these lines that the conference on European security and co-operation must, after careful preparations, devote its attention. With the participation of all the countries of Europe, the United States and Canada, we hope that that conference will very soon get under way.\n175.\tIn my country we say that Rome was not built in a day: neither can security, relaxation of tension, and co-operation in Europe. Hie European conference will doubtless be a step forward, but if it engages in mere legalistic and only crystallizes the present rather than opens the door to the future, its results will not be wholly satisfactory. It is obvious that we must advance with prudence and realism, particularly in the first phase. But we should not allow the great hope of all the peoples of Europe to achieve a freer, more prosperous and open life, to get lost in the complex network of a purely formal treaty. That, even if it were unintentional, would only sanction the division of Europe.\n176.\tOn the contrary, it is only by paving the way to a new balance of which the European Economic Community would be one of the most significant components-and to more freely articulated relations among all peoples, that we can possibly hope to establish in Europe, relations based on trust, rather than on power, which would have a positive effect on the entire world.\n177.\tIf after the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on Measures to Reduce the Risk of Nuclear Warfare, signed on 30 September at Washington, and at which we are extremely gratified, substantive progress is achieved in the talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic arms limitation; and if in the course of the forthcoming year a European conference can be held along the lines that I have just outlined, then an important step will have been taken to put an end to some of the major causes of international tension. But that will not be sufficient unless we come to grips with the arms race, which at one and the same time, is both cause and effect of tensions all over the world.\n178.\tOur best hopes are placed in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. Thanks to the efforts it has made this year, a draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction has been prepared [A/8457-DCI234, annex A]. The Italian Government, which participated actively in its preparation, is gratified at that positive development. It is indeed the first true disarmament agreement arrived at since the war. All the other agreements, however important they may have been, were only non-armament agreements.\n179.\tThe Italian Government has always insisted that, together with collateral questions, the problem of general and complete disarmament should be faced. We are pleased to note that the same idea underlies the Soviet proposal to call a world disarmament conference [A/8491] to deal with all the problems of disarmament-nuclear as well as conventional. While giving this idea of the Soviet Government all our attention, we reserve our right to study the methods of translating it into reality.\n180.\tAlthough the events that I have just outlined give us reason for optimism, the presence of hot-beds of war must, by the same token, cause deep concern to all of us. In Asia, in the Indo-Chinese peninsula, the flames of battle that were kindled a quarter of a century ago are still burning. Despite the resumption of a few military actions, which still concern us, we believe that the policy of progressive military disengagement, which was lately undertaken by the United States, has not changed. Italy will continue to strive for a political solution to the problem, in accordance with the freely expressed will of all the peoples of the region.\n181.\tAnother Asian people the people of East Pakistan- has been struck by a twofold tragedy: the unleashed forces of nature, and a bloody domestic crisis. That drama, which has moved world public opinion, calls urgently for a concerted humanitarian effort on tH part of all our Governments; but, at the same time, it is indispensable that, by means of far-sighted measures, we create an atmosphere of normalcy that will allow the millions of human beings who have had to flee their homes to return to them. During Italy's presidency of the Security Council, contacts along these lines were undertaken.\n182.\tI come now to another source of tension: that of the Middle East. For 15 months now, a precarious truce has existed there. That the cannons have been silent for all this time can be attributed only to the intervention of the United Nations, to the mission of Ambassador Jarring, to the advice of moderation given to the parties concerned, and to the wisdom shown by them thus far. Indeed, I think we can detect an inclination on their part towards a search for a political solution. We must express to the United States our appreciation for the effort it has made in the last few months to obtain the agreement of the parties concerned to a partial solution to the conflict, which would be the first step towards an over-all solution, The benefits of a partial solution based on the clearing of the Suez Canal would of course be considerable, since they would contribute to establishing an atmosphere, if not of confidence, at least of coexistence between two peoples which for a quarter of a century have not known the blessings of happiness or of true peace.\n183.\tThose benefits would also be shared by a large number of other countries whose economies have been seriously affected by the closing of a vital means of communication. The coastal States of the Mediterranean, of the Black Sea, of the Red Sea and of the Indian Ocean are, in fact, suffering gravely today because of the closure of the Suez Canal which has set the clock of world maritime communications back a hundred years. This state of affairs is most damaging to the less developed countries and, therefore, an effort must be made to put an end to it as soon as possible.\n184.\tWe would hope that, when it has to deal with the question of the Middle East, the General Assembly, in its wisdom and authority, will see fit solemnly to reaffirm the principles which can serve as a basis to end the conflict in the Middle East and which can be found in Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which should be fully implemented.\n135, At the same time, a new impulse must be given to any effort to find either a global or even a partial solution to the problem. This is, I know, a far from easy task, since the peoples which must become accustomed to coexistence and to co-operate with one another have, three times in the last 25 years, confronted one another on the battlefield. But we trust that proof will be given of realism, magnanimity and realism so as to put an end to a struggle that might take a very different turn if allowed to continue unduly.\n186.\tSpeaking of tensions and abnormal situations in the world, I cannot overlook the colonial problems and the systems of apartheid, which are contrary to our concepts of law and which we consider to be incompatible with the fundamental principle of respect for human dignity. The Italian Government has always given, and will continue to give, full support to any constructive action by the United Nations for the establishment of a more democratic and more human order by peaceful means in southern Africa.\n187.\tBy the same token, during the course of the year that the United Nations has devoted to the fight against racism and racial discrimination , may I announce that Italy intends very soon to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)].\n188.\tObviously tho United Nations lacks the means to put an end to the conflicts that I have just mentioned and we know the reasons for its impotence. But though our Organization seems to lack the effective power and though its role with respect to problems affecting international peace and security very often exceeds its possibilities of intervention, it nevertheless still is the place where human conscience can be expressed. If the voice of that conscience is silenced, injustice and violations will prevail.\n189.\tAll this proves that we need an Organization where all great problems can be examined and, if possible, directed towards a solution. In fact none can deny the irreplaceable role of the United Nations. An international system in which it did not exist would be doomed to anarchy and the most serious upheavals. But our Organization must continue to strengthen itself, not only by writing all the peoples of the world, but by adopting structures and rules that will increase its effectiveness.\n190.\tI will venture prudently where, perhaps, angels might fear to tread. But I would dare say that the passage of years, the modification in the relations of the forces of the world, the new possibilities offered by science and technology, the first steps of the human race into outer space or on the ocean floor and many other factors all show that the world is changing and that our Organization must adapt itself to these changes. We believe that that adaptation should follow a twofold direction.\n191.\tOn the one hand, it should be concentrated on those problems that best lend themselves to a solution in a forum such as ours. It is true that one of the main objectives of the United Nations is to guarantee international peace and security; but it is no less true that the creation of peace cannot be limited to a mere search for a solution to the political differences that could lead to armed conflicts. It must tackle the underlying causes of those conflicts and those differences; it must lead to the establishment of an international order where social, economic and technical disparities will have been eliminated so far as humanly possible; an order in which any injury to the dignity of the human person which still exists today will- have disappeared; an order where the right to decide their own fate will be guaranteed to all peoples free from any foreign interference or any form of constraint.\n192.\tIn the spirit of the Charter signed at San Francisco all is indissolubly linked and everything is placed at the service\nof our main goal, which is the maintenance of international peace and security. But this security and this peace will be all the more stable when they set their roots in an order to whose creation the United Nations will have contributed and made more human and more just.\n193.\tIt is in that perspective and from that standpoint that my Government gives its full support to the initiatives that are intended to strengthen the procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes, to reaffirm the role of the International Court of Justice, to ensure respect for human rights and now I come to the second line of direction- to assist the regions which have, suffered delays in their economic development.\n194.\tAs far as its financial capabilities allow and within the framework of its economic system, Italy is ready, during the Second United Nations Development Decade, to contribute to the solution of this fundamental problem.of the future of humanity.\n195.\tTo achieve those goals we are convinced that it is imperative and urgent to reaffirm the role of the Economic and Social Council. We are equally convinced that if there is wider participation on the part of the members of that organ to which the Charter has entrusted the primary task of elaborating and carrying out the policies of the Organization in the economic, social and humanitarian fields, the countries of the third world will also have found the way of expressing themselves effectively and in a constructive atmosphere and of progressively achieving their goals.\n196.\tFor all the industrialized countries, this important task will be greatly facilitated by a free and open system of economic relations, where exchanges can develop without let or hindrance and within an atmosphere of stability. Here we took note with satisfaction of the assurances given by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers, in his speech to the Assembly the day before yesterday [1950th meetingJ, when he confirmed that there is no basic change in the traditional policy of the United States in international economic questions and that the United States Government does not envisage a policy of economic nationalism. The European Economic Community intends to continue its own actions along the same lines.\n197.\tHaving said all this, need I add that to be effective an organization must dispose of sufficient financial resources with which to carry out its task? A number of speakers have alluded to the difficulties of the Organization in this field and the need to confront them. Italy, whose concern over this matter was attested to concretely by an increased subscription to the bonds issued by our Organization-and in this we were not alone-hopes that all the countries that have not yet done so will make adequate and equitable contributions in keeping with their own resources.\n198.\tObviously there is also another problem, that of ensuring effective representation in the main bodies of the United Nations to those States that have the greatest responsibility in international life.\n199.\tThus the Italian Government sees the United Nations as an organization that can adapt itself as rapidly as possible to the evolving state of the world, one that possesses the necessary flexibility and is able to fulfill its tasks.\n200.\tAllow me, before concluding, to stress that the policy of the Italian Government is a policy of total support for the United Nations. Its action in the inter-national field will continue in fact to be inspired by the principles in the Charter, and it is on the basis of those principles that the hopes of mankind for a better future rest.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t  Mr. President, I should like to join those who preceded me on this rostrum and begin my statement by addressing my very sincere congratulations to you, who are such a dynamic servant of peace. Once again the international community, our community, has decided to draw on the rich experience of the great continent of Asia to guide our debates. The choice which has been made by our Assembly in asking you, Sir, to be in charge of our discussions, the serious problems for which our twenty-sixth session will have to attempt to find solutions, and the hopes which many of us have in this session to reach satisfactory solutions for most of the problems facing humanity, all these indicate the amplitude of the responsibilities which we have entrusted you with this year. Consequently, Sir, I should like to assure you that my delegation will do everything in its power to make your task as easy as possible. You may therefore be assured of our entire co-operation.\n2.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to Mr. Edvard Hambro, the previous President of the General Assembly for the masterly way in which he conducted our debates during the twenty-fifth session which, we should like to emphasize in passing, was honored by the presence of a large number of eminent Heads of State and Government who came to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization, to take stock of 25 years of activity by the United Nations, whose success has not been unmitigated, and also to broadly outline a certain strategy for the United Nations in the coming years.\n3.\tFinally, in welcoming them into the Organization, I should like to express the gratification of the Government and the people of Chad in seeing the States of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar accede to independence and become\nMembers of the United Nations. To the peoples of these three new States I should like to convey our congratulations and our very sincere wishes for success in everything they undertake to promote peace and progress in their own countries and in their efforts to ,meet their international obligations.\n4.\tTogether with my congratulations to these States, I should like to pay a tribute to the United Kingdom, for this is not its first praiseworthy act of decolonization.\n5.\tOur experience in international relations gives us some reason for anxiety and leads us to share the opinion of our Secretary-General to whom I hasten to pay a highly deserved tribute for the political courage, exemplary devotion and objective far-sightedness which he has demonstrated during 10 years of distinguished and uninterrupted service to the United Nations-expressed in the introduction to his latest report on the work of the Organization during the previous year:\n\\\"Looking back on the past ten years, I cannot help reaching the conclusion that during that period the most powerful nations have all too seldom shown themselves able to rise above the suspicions, fears and mistrust that spring from their different ideologies, different objectives and different conceptions of the best interests of the world. By and large, the rivalry of nations continued to be the dominant factor in international life. Precisely for that reason, many promising developments have not reached fulfillment, and results still remain far below the hopes and aspirations of the world community.\\\" [A/ 8401/Add.l, para. 6.J\n6.\tThe dangerously explosive situation which prevails at present in the Middle East, in South-East Asia and in southern Africa is a striking manifestation of this. All the efforts of the United Nations to find ways and means which would make it possible to apply the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) to the conflict in the Middle East to the satisfaction of all the parties concerned, have been in vain.\n7.\tIn reaffirming our support of the principle of respect for the territorial integrity of all States, and our opposition to the acquisition or occupation of the territory of other States by force, we should like to voice the hope that the United Nations will, as soon as possible, find some means of applying this resolution, or find some other solution to the problem satisfactory to all parties concerned, including the Palestinian refugees. Thus, the Organization of African Unity believes it is its duty to make a further contribution to finding a solution to tills problem. The African Committee of the 10 \\\"Wise Men\\\" chose a sub-committee consisting\nof four Heads of State who, as you all know, are to work along these lines.\n8.\tThe development of the situation in Europe, on the whole, even in the judgment of the Europeans themselves, gives us serious reason to believe that there will be a solid basis for establishing a friendly entente and, very shortly, lasting peace among all European States, based not merely on political relaxation of tension or peaceful coexistence, with all their accompanying distrust and doubt, but on economic, social and cultural co-operation which is of overriding importance to engender and strengthen a spirit of solidarity among peoples and nations. Thus it was with genuine pleasure that we heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Mr. Schumann, declare from this rostrum in the course of the present general debate:\n\\\"May we not hope that those three elements of a true political reconstruction in the very centre of Europe-the Berlin accord, the necessary arrangements between the German authorities, and the entry into force of the Treaties of Moscow and Warsaw will culminate in an agreement between the two German States? Nothing would contribute more effectively to guaranteeing the stability of the continent as a whole.\\\" [1942nd meeting, para. 63.]\n9.\tIt was equally comforting to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Mr. Gromyko, state from this rostrum during the same meeting:\n\\\"The recently signed Quadripartite Agreement on problems concerning West Berlin will serve to eliminate one of the most dangerous sources of tension and friction and to improve the atmosphere in an unhealthy area of European politics----\n\\\"In the Federal Republic of Germany, the forces which evaluate the situation more soberly and have declared themselves in favor of a policy of peace and a peaceful future are showing more confidence than in the past and gaining the upper hand. The objectives consistently pursued by the socialist States of Europe in their relations with the Federal Republic of Germany have thus become attainable.\\\" \n10.\tThus, it is in complete sincerity that we voice the hope that we shall see the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany and the representatives of the Democratic Republic of Germany seated among us.\n11.\tWe believe that the spirit, which has guided the Europeans and prompted them to give further thought to the need to create conditions of entente and co-operation among their Governments for the benefit of their peoples and in the service of international peace and security, has also inspired the American people which has succeeded in bringing its Government to agree that it is not objectively possible to convince other peoples that the United States is sincere in declaring that it is in favor of peace and international security, while it systematically refuses to allow the great Chinese people to have any voice here in the United Nations. Is it objectively possible to speak of general\nand complete disarmament or a lasting solution for any other problem relating to the maintenance of international peace and security without the agreement of the People's Republic of China? This great nation, this proud people, which in all areas has full confidence in its own potential and has no reason to envy anybody else on this earth, will, if we are not careful, make us regret our hesitation by simply making use of the complete freedom which we seem to be thus giving them.\n12.\tIf we have any respect at all for this people, we should respect their choice and recognize the legal regime it has chosen to direct its affairs. We believe that this is what inspired our elders who were present at the birth of the United Nations when they seated China as a permanent member of the Security Council. It is, in fact, a right which has been recognized as belonging to the Chinese people and its power and not to a Chinese citizen and the regime which he chose. It is, therefore, for us simply a matter of respecting a very important principle of our Charter, the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination.\n13.\tBut the respect- of this self-same principle makes it necessary for us to consider seriously the free choice of that part of the Chinese people which prefers to live in Formosa under another regime.\n14.\tThe position of my country regarding the question of the representation of China remains, therefore, as it was described last year from this rostrum by my Head of State, H.E. Mr. Francois Tombalbaye, who declared:\n\\\"That vast country is therefore an interlocutor that no one has the right to spurn or to exclude from the world system of co-operation and peaceful coexistence, because so long as it is shut out, no equilibrium can be anything but precarious and transient. But we cannot make good one injustice by perpetrating another, which is what the exclusion of Formosa, itself a founder Member of our Organization, would be.\\\" [1882nd meeting, para. 105.J\n15.\tWe recognize, nevertheless, that both sides have a free choice in the way in which they intend to solve this question and to ensure the unity of China.\n16.\tSimilarly, my country believes that, in order to ensure the universality of this Organization and to enable it to meet all the necessary conditions for the preservation of international peace and security, we should recognize that all peoples, whether they be in Viet-Nam, North Korea, or South Korea, South Africa or Rhodesia, have the right to self-determination, to choose the sort of Government they wish and to be admitted to this forum in order to make their voices heard with total respect for their freedom and independence.\n17.\tOur faith in justice and the strength of the principles to which I just referred, oblige us, however, to draw the serious attention of the United Nations to the very explosive situation which at present prevails in the southern part of the African continent.\n18.\tIt is high time that the United Nations gathered here, particularly the great Powers, those who bear the main responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, wiping from their minds any selfishness or ideological preoccupations, to deal with the problem raised by the hateful system of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa and Namibia, racial discrimination in Southern Rhodesia, and colonialism in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau) and elsewhere.\n19.\tIn all these segments of our continent the majority of black Africans are mocked, frustrated and oppressed by a white minority. Therefore, it is our bounden duty to intervene in order to ensure that the necessary conditions are met which will make it possible for democracy to be freely exercised. The question is, then, what sort of positive action we should adopt.\n20.\tShould we choose violence? We Africans would be the last to wish to be responsible for unleashing the horrors of war. We would rather wait patiently and stubbornly for the results of diplomatic action, if we could be sure that those minorities, who at present hold power in southern Africa, are, fact, wedded to the principles that all men are equal and that they should enjoy the same rights to human dignity and respect without any distinction as to color, race, religion or sex and that they are entitled, and have the duty, to participate as equal members of society in the government of their own country.\n21.\tHistory has shown us and present events confirm that violence leads peoples who indulge in it not only to ruin, but to a recrudescence of hatred, of rancor and of sorrow, which increases antagonisms and finally ends by justifying this monstrous phenomenon in the eyes of the wisest and most peace-loving of men.\n22.\tWe hope that the international community and in particular those Powers who, because of the strong influence which they can have on the way the problems of the world develop, bear the main responsibility for maintaining peace and international security, will become aware of their obligations and help us to avoid an open war on our continent, whose repercussions might well go beyond the boundaries of Africa. In reality, who would seriously dare to affirm that a conflict which we started would remain exclusively our business? We know too well how often such enterprises degenerate and are finally beyond the control of those who thought they had them in their power.\n23.\tWe believe, in all conscience, that everything should be attempted in order to make it possible for the African peoples of these countries to enjoy the rights which are granted them by the United Nations Charter, and by resolution 1514 (XV) of our Assembly and, thus, to avoid the occurrence of an armed conflict.\n24.\tUnfortunately, the great Powers who do their utmost to prevent the People's Republic of China from taking its rightful seat in the United Nations, alleging that it would not respect the spirit of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations, are also those who demand that if the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is to make its views known, it should agree beforehand to accept any solution which is imposed by the United Nations; it is these same Powers, I say, who are unbelievably tolerant of the attitude of flagrant defiance adopted towards the resolutions of the\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council by the Republic of South Africa, Portugal and the Rhodesia of Ian Smith.\n25.\tWe have done everything we can to convince the white minority in the southern, part of our continent that they and their African brothers have a common interest which dictates that they should lay aside their prejudices in order to remove their disagreements.\n26.\tIt is precisely because they refuse to heed these appeals, and because they are unaware that their common interest lies- with their black African compatriots, who, like it or not, they are condemned to live with, that the white people of South Africa and Rhodesia have brought about these outbursts of racial violence which shock mankind. The result of this is that the Africans, who are subjected to this ill treatment are using all the means in their power, including civil disobedience, boycotting and armed rebellion, to fight against a system of Government and administration which tries to deny their status as men and citizens.\n27.\tFurthermore, we all feel acute frustration, as would any man aware of the threat to peace involved in the squalor in which most of humanity lives, the tremendous riches which are swallowed up in preparations for war, while a minute fraction of this wealth would do much to help our countries, the countries of the third world, to escape' from the rut of under-development. We cannot but rise up against something which, in our eyes, constitutes a genuine waste of wealth in view of the wretchedness which is the lot of so many of our fellows.\n28.\tFor almost two years now Chad has been the President of the Assembly of Heads of State of the African, Malagasy and Mauritian Common Organization [OCAMM]. Furthermore, the Head of the State of Chad had an opportunity at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [1882nd meeting] to refer to the goals of this regional African organization which works in the spirit of the OAU, and to the results obtained in many areas and, finally, to his concern for years to come.\n29.\tOn 8 September 1970 OCAMM celebrated its tenth anniversary. This proves that despite difficult beginnings, our countries refuse to live in watertight compartments and advocate broad and complete co-operation in the fields of air transport, telecommunications, tourism, education, culture, training, education, scientific and technological research and finally in the areas of economy and development.\n30.\tThe specific conventions adopted by the members of our regional organization are at all times aimed at improving and deepening this co-operation between them, a co-operation which has been praised by all parties concerned.\n31.\tTTiese efforts which have been made 'by the 15 OCAMM countries in order to weave a vast network of solidarity have won them the sympathy of many African, European and North American countries. These efforts are also the reason for the confidence and the assistance which have been given by many international organizations such as UNDP, the ILO, UNESCO, FAO, ECA, UNIDO and the ECB which have excellent relations with the OCAMM secretariat*\n32.\tAware that nowadays International assistance, which ever its volume, can never replace developmental nation undertaken by the assisted countries, the States members of OCAMM intend to concentrate their Attention on devising and implementing a program of Industrialization on a regional basis. The studies which have been Initiated and conducted by the secretariat of our organization are just about to be completed and are to be submitted for consideration by die Heads of State at their next meeting in Togo, We believe that in adopting this program and in working for its implementation, our countries will have taken a giant stride towards economic integration, which necessarily entails increased internal trade Among the African countries,\n33.\tThe recent upheavals in the international monetary system will have been beneficial to us to the extent that they have enabled us to become aware of our individual limits as small *veak countries, powerless in the face of the great Powers, and to try and put our heads together to think up solutions to our common problems, if, order to improve the lot of our populations.\n34.\tThus OCAMM, whose activity is daily devoted to this purpose, deserves the support and assistance of the United Nations,\n35.\tI would have been remiss in my duty had I not said something about a phenomenon which affects two thirds of humanity: underdevelopment, It is a phenomenon which, according to His Holiness, Pope Paul VI* is closely linked with peace, and may even indeed be an essential element of peace. Underdevelopment has, for more than a quarter of a century now, been the subject of discussion in our august Assembly- Never has an illness been so thoroughly diagnosed by its doctor. But what has been the result of tins examination?\n36.\tPerhaps now it is time for our Organization* which is the guardian of peace and co-operation among peoples, to pause for a minute and give some thought to its effectiveness. What has it done or, more precisely, what has been done by the four or five wealthy countries, which are usually called great Powers, to allay the sufferings which are felt by more than two thirds of humanity?\n37.\tThe General Assembly, for its part, often impelled by these same great Powers, has discharged its duty by voting for resolutions and recommendations advocating and demanding justice and co-operation among peoples. But what has been the result of these resolutions and recommendations which have, generally speaking, been adopted unanimously, with characteristic enthusiasm, by Members of the Organization? Deep disappointment, a disappointment which seems to say at the beginning of the Second United Nations Development Decade that the poor countries can never calculate their development on the basis of generous promises made in resolutions, but rather on the will of the rich countries and the attention which they give\n38. But the monetary crisis which at present is of such concern to the world reveals m confirms, if there were any need to do so, that national selfishness still remains the underlying factor in our International relations. In fact, development assistance, whether bilateral or multilateral, is always a fortiori governed by this selfishness. Therefore there Is nothing more precarious and vulnerable than this assistance, based as it is on the national interests of donor countries,\n39.\tSo what has become of these excellent and pertinent recommendations which for almost 10 years now have tantalized us with the prospect of development? They have remained, as their name indicates, simply high-sounding and hopeful language. It is high time perhaps that the few countries which govern the economy of our world should set aside their selfishness and their spirit of domination, so that finally the other two thirds of humanity can recover their right to independence and dignity,\n40,\tIt is our submission that in order to do this, those responsible for failure in these attempts at development should agree to undertake with us & fundamental rethinking of the present system of assistance, possibly with the result that it may be abandoned and replaced by another aid which would not be granted but negotiated, We have come here in order to seek justice, to ensure peace and to bring about progress for the well-being of mankind. This is, I think, the main objective of our Organization, Taken in isolation in our respective countries, all our actions mt of course, designed to bring about these objectives.\n4L It was 11 years ago that we started to accumulate our own experience in international relations. However brief this period of time, it has been very enriching for us and has only strengthened our conviction in the correctness of the policy which we chose to guide our conduct both towards States individually and towards the United Nations itself. We believe that equality of States requires that their sovereignty be strictly respected as well as their integrity,, thus setting aside any interventionism, any interference and a fortiori, any misuse of power. Hie relations among peoples and nations should, we believe, be based on the principle of respect for the dignity and the essential interests of each of the parties concerned, free from any attempt at economic or ideological neo-colonialism. All men, all communities and all peoples should tie assured the right to enjoy free existence in the complete respect of justice and dignity.\n42.\tThe Organization of African Unity has among its other objectives and principles the defense of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of the States of Africa, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, the respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State and its inalienable right to independent existence.\n43.\tThe United Nations for its part has launched an appeal to all States asking them to refrain from organizing, assisting, fomenting, financing, encouraging or tolerating any subversive, armed or terrorist activities for the purpose of changing the regime of another State by violence.\n44.\tMy country, Chad, which is a member of these Organizations, respects the spirit and the letter of those principles to which I have just referred. It has always stretched out its hand to all States, without any exceptions,\n1955th meeting - 6 October 1971\t5\nin order to establish a frank and fruitful co-operation based on mutual respect between States, We have refrained from interfering in the affairs of other countries and we have practiced a policy of good neighborliness and fraternity,\n45,\tDespite this open door policy, last August my comity suffered from a mental aberration which was provoked by elements supported by a neighboring country, with which my country, Chad, has both natural and historic ties, I am referring to the Libyan Arab Republic, The panic which was to result from this was fortunately stopped In time, thus avoiding causing grief to Innocent Chad families. Newspapers devoted a great deal of space to this and it is not my Intention to dwell on these facts.\n46,\tI should simply like to demonstrate how the Libyan Arab Republic Is openly interfering in the internal and external affairs of my country.\n47,\tI said a short time ago that one of the principles of the 0AU Is respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of each State, The Libyan Arab Republic, discarding this principle, did not hide its expansionist aims on an official road map which was published in Italy in 1970. We can m with some astonishment what quite a sizable part of our national territory was included in the Libyan Arab Republic as being national Libyan soil. But our surprise and our astonishment did not stop there, The legend on this map Indicated that the international frontiers which were traced on It should not be considered as final, that they were liable to be changed, This map is readily available to everyone at the Studi Cartografici Publishing Company, via Sidoli I, Milan, and is distributed by the Fergiani bookshop in Italy, I have a copy of this map for those who would like to refer to It,\n48.\tNot content with having expansionist ideas, the Libyan Arab Republic has interfered and continues to interfere in the internal and external affairs of Chad. Our troubles with them began with the coming to power of the present Government. However, our country was among the first States to recognize it, although we had excellent relations with the previous regime, because Chad had given its hospitality to Libyan nationals who had fled Italian fascism. Some of these Libyans still live in our country in safety and have excellent relations with the Chad people,\n49.\tThe coming to power of the new Government was marked by a witch-hunt for Chad nationals. Trucks appeared on our frontiers and spilled out thousands of our countrymen who had refused to be press-ganged to fight against their own country. Most of them were stripped of everything that they had earned by the sweat of their brows. My Government, despite it? slender resources, tried to help these repatriates to take their rightful place in the Chad nation, without requesting help from the international community, in order to preserve our fraternal relations with Libya.\n50.\tBefore this masquerade, one of our countrymen, the Derdei, the customary chief of the Toubous, one of the tribes of our peoples living in the extreme north of Chad at the Libyan border, had left the country to seek refuge in Tripoli, as a result of a misunderstanding with the administration. This is nothing unusual as this kind of discontent is common among a section of our nomadic peoples. The Derdei is still in Tripoli, despite the efforts which have been made by my Government to have him reintegrated into his native country .\n51 In order to preserve and maintain the good relations which existed between our two countries, the President of the Republic, H.E, Francois Tombalbaye- even had a meeting with the Libyan Chief of State, Colonel Kadhafi.The President of the National Assembly went to Tripoli accompanied by a top-level delegation in order to try to iron out the differences between Libya and Chad, if there were any such differences. The Vice-President of the National Assembly stayed in Libya for several months for the same purpose, Furthermore, the Heads of State of neighboring countries acted along the same lines without any positive results.\n52. Not satisfied with giving financial and material assistance to the Derdei and his followers, the Libyan Government did not hide its sympathies for the so-called National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT), which it has recognized as the sole representatives of the Chad people and which uses the National Radio of Libya to spread lying propaganda, devoid of any objectivity concerning the Republic of Chad. We already knew that at any time the Tripoli Government would have to take such a decision which did not surprise us or anyone, in view of the continuing meetings in Paris of members of the Libyan Government with elements hostile to our country. Thus, last May, the Libyan Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Unity and Foreign Affairs, Mr. Mansur Kikhia, who was passing through Paris, made arrangements for the installation of FROLINAT and its leaders in Tripoli.\n53.\tWe have in our possession irrefutable documentation which proves that Chad nationals are trained in military camps in Libya near Tripoli, specifically at Habba Khadra and Fournech, under the command of Libyan officers, Roman Mokthar and Ali Mansour. The non commissioned Libyan military instructors there are Oumbar Souha, Aboubakar and Mahamat Khalil. They teach the use of automatic rifles, machine-guns, bazookas, revolvers, grenades, machine pistols and also combat tactics, ambushes, attacking convoys and so on.\n54.\tIt must be stressed here that of about 2,300 soldiers trained in Libya, only 57 are Chad nationals; they were recruited from Khartoum by the Libyan Ambassador and were conveyed to Tripoli at the expense of that Embassy.\n55.\tDuring their stay in these Libyan military camps, these recruits are fed and clothed by Libya and receive \u00a35 Libyan per month. Once their basic training has been completed, they are sent either to Sabbah or A1 Qatrun, where vehicles and caravans are placed at their disposal in order to enter Chad, they are furnished with Libyan passports which are delivered to them by the authorities in Tripoli in order to facilitate their travel. Thus in Koufra, in Libya, arms and munitions were delivered to these outlaws as follows: 4 mortars, 300 mortar shells, 6,000 bullets for rifles of British manufacture.\n56.\tThe Libyan Government continued to give them assistance in the interior of Chad. Documents which have\nbeen seized by our authorities make reference to the fact that Libya victuals these outlaws (rice and pasta) and supplies them with arms and munitions,\n57.\tDuring an operation which took place quite recently in June 1971, specifically on 17 June north of Largeau, the main town of the Prefecture of Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti, 662 weapons were recovered. These weapons were of English, Italian, Belgian and French manufacture. Investigations carried out by our relevant services have shown that these weapons and ammunition were ordered by Libya for its own services.\n58.\tThis characteristic attitude of the Government of Colonel Kadhafi in interfering in the affairs of sovereign States can escape no one's attention.\n59.\tChad, my country, is not the first State to suffer from Colonel Kadhafi's impetuosity because we still have fresh in our memories the date of 10 July, when at Skirat in Morocco, a misadventure caused deaths in diplomatic families and Colonel Kadhafi flouting the United Nations Charter and that of the Organization of African Unity, hot-headedly interfered in the internal affairs of the Sherifian Kingdom. This is a flagrant case of which all are aware, and is but one among many.\n60.\tIn our constant desire to consolidate the friendly and fraternal ties which have always existed between our two peoples, my Government has still not given up doing what it can in order to find the necessary ways and means of bringing about peaceful coexistence.\n61.\tLibya, however, is demanding that my Government break off diplomatic relations with Israel and that the French military base in Chad should be withdrawn.\n62.\tIs this not yet further proof that the Tripoli Government is interfering in our internal and external affairs? To my knowledge, 32 African countries, including Chad, maintain diplomatic relations with Israel. Some of these countries also maintain diplomatic relations with Libya and Libya has never demanded from these countries what it is demanding of Chad. Is this because of the Middle East? Since 1967 my Government has never ceased to support unreservedly, both in the United Nations and in the OAU, the relevant resolutions on this matter. Is it because of religious problems? In Africa there are States whose populations are both Christian and Moslem. These countries live in an excellent atmosphere of understanding with other countries and at no time has the religious problem arisen. I can assure the Assembly that total religious freedom exists in Chad and that the number of my Moslem compatriots who visit Mecca, the Holy Place of Islam, every year, on pilgrimage-thanks to the assistance of the Government-is constantly increasing and this is the sole concern of the Chad Government.\n63.\tThe French base in our country is there under agreements which we signed in complete liberty and sovereignty with the French Republic. Its being there has never constituted a danger to our neighbouring countries. Its withdrawal from our national soil depends solely on the wishes of the contracting parties. It is improper for the\nRepublic of Libya to negotiate the final departure of this base with the French Government in our stead,\n64.\tOur aim is simply to inform the Assembly about this dispute which has arisen between our country and Libya, and which might result in unfortunate consequences if urgent measures are not taken. The Charter of the OAU advocates the peaceful settlement of disputes by means of negotiations and mediation.\n65.\tThis brings me to the conclusion of my statement. My country has always practiced a policy of peace, attached as we are to international institutions, the respect of the human person and human dignity, whatever the race and religion of the person concerned, and at no time can we go back on this commitment. All we want to do is to live in peace with our neighbors. In the case of Libya, I hope that this brother country will put a stop to its expansionist designs, which include appropriating parts of my country, which are a national heritage since this runs counter to the very philosophy of Colonel Kadhafi; the head of the Libyan State.\n66.\tThe only way in which it would be possible to put an end to this conspiracy is for the Government of Tripoli, by respecting the Charter of the OAU and the institutions of the United Nations, unequivocally to abandon its designs upon my country, and refrain from bringing irregular troops into oui land, which constantly plunder our wealth, murder our people and devastate our countryside.\n67.\tI should like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Government and the people of Chad, to address my sincere thanks to those friendly and brotherly countries which have agreed to receive our goodwill and fact-finding missions and which gave their moral support at a time when our Republic was living through a particularly difficult situation.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able now to pay tribute to the great statesman and man of law, Edvard Hambro, who so successfully and brilliantly presided over the last session, the commemorative session of our Assembly, and to you yourself, who are called upon to preside over us during the first year of what we all hope will be a new stage in the life of the United Nations. You bring to that task, aside from the nobility that your own great country represents, your own personal qualifications and the support of a very old and long-standing link with this Organization.\n3.\tI could not fail to voice my appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, who in his 10 years of occupancy of his high post has given proof of his indefatigable ability to sacrifice himself and zealously watched over the constant endeavors of the Assembly to achieve its noble principles.\n4.\tI am very happy to say that Peru welcomes with satisfaction the admission to the United Nations of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar, convinced as we are that they will effectively contribute to the collaboration and solidarity which must exist among Member States. \n5., We return to this noble Assembly after the solemn celebrations which last year marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. So, today is a new and propitious occasion to renew our study of the international situation, whose major features we have to confront and whose problems we have to try to solve from this political and legal standpoint which we all share and in which the words and views of great and small must carry the true weight which our responsibility requires and must enjoy the respect which we all owe to the voices of sovereign States.\n6.\tIt is obvious that our point of departure must be the realization that we must make every effort fully to understand the profound meaning of this period of upheaval and transition in which we are called upon to live. We must be fully aware that we live during a new period in the history of man, a period in which yesterday's truths are challenged, a period in which it is imperative that we define new problems and ask new questions of a changing reality which by its very nature forces us to find new approaches.\n7.\tThe old social and economic systems are obviously showing signs of crisis and obsolescence. With them the political and social definitions which shaped the fundamental concepts of earlier generations show identical symptoms. Basically speaking, the qualitative continuity of contemporary history has been shattered. That is the price which inevitably must be paid going from one period of history to another. At a moment like this the traditional truths that ruled the thinking world and that guided man's understanding of matters have to be reviewed.\n8.\tIn this a new historic period whose emergence we are witnessing, only a new awareness, only a new approach, only a new way of thought, only a new political and social way of acting, can possibly promise that we shall be able victoriously to face the challenge of a whole gamut of undefined problems, before which the thinking methods of the past could not, in themselves, point to any appropriate course or to any possible solution.\n9.\tThe sense of profound unity of the human societies of today is nothing but a beautiful pipe-dream or, in the best of cases, an as yet unachievable aspiration. In the meantime the world is hastily restructuring itself so as to identify, as clearly as possible, which interests and which common problems can converge beyond the fields of polarization which until a short while ago characterized the political and social reality of today. Perhaps we are experiencing a type of redistribution of interests within that bipolarity which was the feature of the last few decades. Day by day we are seeing a planet, shared at one and the same time by societies, that concentrate an immense military and economic power based on the staggering development of technology and science which knows no frontiers, emerging from the context of different political and social systems which, therefore, are ruled by disparate and sometimes antagonistic or conflicting ideological formulations and, on the other hand, a vast universe of peoples that are today endeavoring to shatter the multiform domination under which they have always lived. These peoples that were dominated until a few years ago, these peoples that now\nA/PV.1947\nstrive for true independence, these peoples that today, with militant determination, fight against any sign of imperialism, are the under-developed peoples of the third world. Their struggle for politic and economic freedom is basically a struggle to regain their capacity and their right to choose their own role and decide their own fate. This means that their political undertakings also include a claim to self-determination to be exercised in many ways and which, therefore, is to strengthen the profound national autonomy, at the same time, to encompass all fields of political, ideological and cultural growth. In other words, the freedom of the peoples of the third world can only be achieved when they are able to free themselves not only from the economic and political control of others, but also from the cultural and ideological control of the great centers of power which have emerged in a different historical and social framework.\n10.\tAt this critical hour in human experience the considerable contribution of the people of the third world lies in a process of full autonomy that leads us to understand that true political autonomy can exist only on the strength of effective conceptual autonomy. This is the basic task of the third world today, the identification of the acceptable direction that we must follow, starting from our own indigenous forms of political understanding. And this is I believe the course chosen. If 50, then we shall better serve the cause of ensuring our own identity and independence and, at the same time, the vocation for peace and progress which inspired the laying of the foundation of the United Nations.\n11.\tThis vast process, which in itself constitutes one of the great revolutionary conditions of our day, is beginning to take shape, both in the domestic activities of the countries of the third world and at the international level, by creating a common image.\n12.\tPeru, like most of the Latin American continent, is living through a period of intense transformation and, therefore, understands its participation in the third world in these terms and is thereby promoting its own growth towards unity. For this reason, with hope and happiness, we shall play host in our own capital to the forthcoming Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 which, for the second time since its meeting in Algeria, will attempt, through the terms of its own dialog with the great Powers, to define the different problems of trade and development and will also try to define the dimensions of its own autonomy and at the same time, to try to find the single united voice of a multiform effort to be expressed with joint responsibility and conviction.\n13.\tIt is therefore a memorable occasion for Latin America that one of the countries of our region should be host to such an important meeting, and I have the great honor to repeat here our invitation which I had the pleasure of extending to you, Mr. President, on behalf of the Government of Peru. This meeting will be a mUestone in the converging road which began many years ago in different parts of the world and which Afro-Asians and Latin Americans have traveled. This search for a national integration of a plurality of human, social and political experiences\u2014I would even describe them as historic constitutes one of the most extraordinary efforts which the young and needy peoples have carried out, and it must stand as a fruitful example of how the common nature of our interests and values constitutes a viable point of departure towards unifying our international action by taking a single stand and a single expression.\n14.\tPeru, consistent with lengthy international conduct in the service of unity and conciliation, is ready to play that role again dynamically at the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77. Deeply convinced as we are that that role is the most constructive, we shall as the host country endeavor to withstand any temptation to fall into hasty confrontations. But by this we do not by any means intend to weaken our firm determination to maintain our points of view and the interests we share with the third world.\n15.\tIn so thinking, my country believes that we are being consistent with a general movement which we believe is appearing in the international community. For decades the international community has known neither true peace nor security, and in many cases progress seems to have turned its back on justice. And yet, recent international events appear to presage a progressive dissipation of some of the vestiges of the Second World War as well as some remnants of the cold war, such as the military alliances that weigh so heavily on the world. Among the most outstanding events, I have in mind the new policy which the United States Government seems to have adopted regarding the People's Republic of China and the consequent detente which this might well bring about in the Asian region. We note the same promise in the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, signed at Berlin on 3 September 1971, in the advisory opinion handed down by the International Court of Justice on Namibia,  and finally, in the first direct contacts between the two Koreas.\n16.\tWe all hope that these signs will create an atmosphere conducive, within the framework of the United Nations -which is the only universal frame work-to a true and united security which will free our Organization as such for full action and will make the peaceful settlement of disputes, general and complete disarmament, effective respect for and defense of human rights, the elimination of colonialism and racial discrimination and rapid economic and social development through international co-operation a true reality and the goal of our Organization.\n17.\tMy Government considers that one way of achieving such ends is for those States that, because of national or bloc antagonisms, have been isolated from one another to maintain normal political and economic ties in compliance with the principles of the Charter and within the framework of the coexistence of different economic and social systems, as recommended by the Declaration of Principles of International Law Governing Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, which was adopted unanimously at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2625 (XXV)].\n18.\tThe efforts of States to establish those ties over and above their ideological differences would, nevertheless, be of little value if we were not able to ensure that all states became Members of this Organization, the latter thus achieving the universality that is indispensable if the United Nations is to be an effective instrument for international peace and security and a framework for economic, social, cultural and humanitarian co-operation among all States.\n19.\tIn fulfillment of what I consider a duty, Peru, which in 1969 extended its political and economic ties to the socialist countries of Europe, has decided, in accordance with what I stated in this same hall last year [1842nd meeting] concerning the need for the active presence of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, to formalize its relations with that country and, accordingly, firmly to advocate its representation in the world Organization.\n20.\tFollowing the same line of reasoning, my Government views with ever-increasing concern the prolonged isolation of Cuba from the countries of America. We believe that in the present circumstances the States of this region must agree to promote, within the Organization of American States, a change in this situation, or at any rate, that the regional organization grant States which wish to do so, complete freedom to resume relationships with the Republic of Cuba at whatever level they deem appropriate. If that course is not chosen, it becomes obvious that those States which consider the establishment of relations as a road to coexistence which will contribute to eliminating tensions, will separately adopt sovereign decisions that they regard as more in keeping with the interests of the international community.\n21.\tThe question of measures for the strengthening of international security, as we see it, should not only be a subject for analysis and debate, but should concentrate mainly on the search for solutions to international conflicts. In this connexion, we consider that we should more precisely state and bring into play some of the functions and powers that the General Assembly possesses, so that that body, aside from strengthening its co-operation with the Security Council, will be able to keep under constant review the question of international security and measures to strengthen it,\n22.\tFor this reason, it becomes more imperative every day for the war in IndoChina to end, and we therefore feel that an appeal from the United Nations for an intensification of the negotiations in Paris, which are to lead to an end to military activities in Viet-Nam, would be widely valued.\n23.\tElsewhere, the military and political situation in the Middle East has, unfortunately, not progressed toward effective negotiation for the restoration of peace and security in that region. Resolution 242(1967) of the Security Council which constitutes the framework for such negotiation, has not been implemented. Nor have the indefatigable efforts of Special Representative of the Secretary-General been successful; nor have any steps forward been made beyond the cease-fire in the negotiations undertaken by the United States with the full knowledge of this Organization. We trust that none of the super-Powers wishes a new conflict in the Middle East, and that the parties themselves have no desire' to maintain a permanent state of domestic and international tension that will delay the attainment of peace and general well-being for their peoples. For these reasons, we cherish the hope that urgent formulas can be arrived at that will open the way to a permanent solution under the auspices of the United Nations,\n24.\tIf international security is closely bound to development and world disarmament, it is likewise inseparably linked with nuclear disarmament. To achieve nuclear disarmament would be one of the key steps for the present United Nations Disarmament Decade.\n25.\tThe idea of abolishing nuclear weapons has two fundamental aspects: one is qualitative, that is to stop advances in l dear weapons by a total and comprehensive test ban; and the other is quantitative, that is to put an end to their production and destroy the stockpiles and means of delivery of nuclear weapons.\n26.\tThus far, only partial qualitative measures have been agreed upon, in as much as the partial test-ban Treaty, aside from permitting underground tests, has not been adhered to by all the nuclear Powers; and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] crystallizes the nuclear status quo, with the atomic Powers having given no guarantees that they will refrain from the use of these weapons against third States and having given no commitment to move toward nuclear disarmament. The recent Treaty which seeks to avoid an atomic arms race on the sea-bed  is not a disarmament measure, nor is it a measure to limit armaments, for what it prohibits is the emplacement of nuclear weapons and installations in an area where they do not exist at present.\n27.\tAlthough the United Nations has recognized the urgent necessity to end nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapon tests and urged States to suspend them; although the threat that such tests pose to the human environment exists, and finally, although an appeal has been made to world public opinion there has been no announcement of a final end to the atomic explosions in the atmosphere that are being carried out in the Pacific region by France.\n28.\tAs far as Peru is concerned, the very fact that an atoll in the Pacific Ocean was chosen-so distant from the metropolitan territory of France gives rise to doubts concerning the alleged security surrounding such tests. It has been amply proved that such explosions do cause an increase in radio-activity that not only affects the areas adjacent to Mururoa, but that also contaminates the atmosphere and the waters of the Pacific. What is more, a State need only carry out contaminating explosions -at a distance, even if within its own territorial jurisdiction, to wreak destruction on the living and active environment which is subject to the juridical protection of international law, namely, the population, either regarded as a whole, or as individuals, whom our commitments oblige us to respect. These facts make it imperative for the General Assembly to reconsider the grave consequences deriving from nuclear* weapon tests and to adopt a decision, with all the urgency required by the case, to put in end to their recurrence and place the responsibilities where they should lie,\n29,\tThe State carrying out these explosions acknowledges the increase in radio-activity, but merely tries to. reduce its effects, stating euphemistically that the radio-activity does not reach the maximum permissible level. Obviously, if the slightest risk exists the tests should cease and, since no one can prove to us that there is no risk whatsoever, the explosions must be discontinued once and for all.\n30,\tAt its fourteenth regular session, the General Assembly appealed to France to refrain from carrying out tests in the Sahara [resolution 1319 {XIV}]. Later, from the seventeenth to the twenty-fifth sessions, the General Assembly has repeatedly urged an end to nuclear tests, despite which these tests continue. This Assembly is obviously aware that these explosions constitute a serious violation of the elementary norms of human coexistence and must, therefore, call for the complete cessation of these and other nuclear experiments, as a logical consequence of the scientific information in its possession and of the legal ramifications of this situation. In so acting the United Nations would not only be living up to its own principles, but would also be furthering the efforts being made by it to preserve the environment, tangible proof of which lies in the Conference on the Human Environment, to be held at Stockholm in 1972.\n31,\tPeru is ready to make all necessary efforts to convince world and French public opinion that there is an urgent need, once and for all to put an end lo these experiments, which are not only a direct threat to humanity, but also an indirect one by contaminating vegetation and waters. This matter, which Peru feels very closely because of what the sea means to my country as a source of wealth and progress, has led us to co-sponsor, with other States an initiative that the United Nations Committee on the SeaBed appeal to France to discontinue these nuclear-weapons tests [A/8421, annex V, sect 1],\n32,\tIn these days when the problems of the sea are evolving so rapidly it is even more incongruous that this type of severely criticized test should endanger resources which are a necessary source of progress for many countries. This is so obvious that the very ideas of the law of the sea are evolving remarkably, so that the immense resources from the sea will b^ used primarily and significantly to assist those countries on whose coasts they be. So much so that, in the course of the year since the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, important statements have been made supporting the view advocated by the countries of Latin America that their maritime sovereignty should extend to the 200-mile limit.\n33,\tRecently, at official meetings between authorities of the Governments of the People's Republic of China, Yugoslavia and Spain, we received support for the Latin American position through communiques proclaiming the unalienable rights of the coastal State over the sea adjacent to its coasts and the resources therein contained, as we had advocated. These statements have given universal scope and also offer encouraging support to the less developed countries, which must be borne in mind in the preparations for the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea to be held in 1973 .\n34.\tApart from these manifestations we have also had the satisfaction of noting that in the Committee preparing for the Conference* an increasing number of countries of Latin America, Asia and Africa have spoken out in favor of 200 miles as the most reasonable and adequate limit for national jurisdiction and the international zone to be established. Thus, in an irreversible process the views originally advocated by the countries of the South Pacific are gaining ground as a bulwark against the predatory practices of the fleets of certain nations and have gradually become an organic doctrine based on legal, political, economic, biological and geographical factors and on principles that purport to embody the application of social justice to the international law of the sea.\n35.\tAt other meetings we have stated that, consistent with that new conception, the use and exploitation of the seas must conform to an order of priorities, highest among which will be service to man as such, Consequently, if there is any conflict between the rules designed to further the military purposes of certain Powers and those intended to guarantee the development rights of other countries, the latter rules must prevail, Thus too, if it is necessary to choose between the first and the rules intended to promote the survival and the welfare of peoples, the latter must again prevail over others. The idea is that the new law of the sea must not serve to ensure the hegemony of a small number of nations, but that it must become an instrument for peace, harmony and, over all, equity, that will allow the developing countries to come closer to the progress achieved by the more advanced nations and to improve the living conditions of those that are farthest away or farthest behind in their claims and rights to a better life.\n36.\tThe delegation of Peru has participated in the preparation of two documents submitted for consideration to that Committee. One is a draft list of subjects [see A/8421, annex I, sect. 14] to be studied by the conference, to ensure that its terms of reference are wide and not limited to two or three isolated subjects of concern to a few maritime Powers. The other is a working paper on a draft regime for the sea-bed [ibid., sect. 8] which would ensure to the international community, through an authority endowed with full powers, direct and active participation in the utilization of the sea-bed beyond their national jurisdiction. Thus Peru looks forward to the conference on the law of the sea with optimism, convinced that it will be hospitable to and aware of the rights of States to defend their elementary interests.\n37.\tFurthermore, this will better serve the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade approved on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization [resolution 2626 (XXV)] which is the first international instrument that considers economic and social development as a world phenomenon, dependent equally on the domestic efforts of the developing countries, the international situation resulting from it and the co-operation received from the developed countries\n38.\tCoinciding with this first year of the Second Development Decade, Peru has achieved and surpassed many of the targets and goals set by the International Development Strategy, such as that for the national economic growth rate; and yet we consider that our greatest contribution to this joint undertaking of the international community lies in the social transformation that we achieved in Peru through the domestic effort required as a developing country.\n39.\tIn the specific case of Peru we have always been an underdeveloped society of dependent capitalism . Our basic problems were generated within that system and, therefore, could not be solved by maintaining it. From this basic standpoint, we decided upon a participating society in which the power of decision should be with the men and women who constitute the bases of our institutions. A society no longer governed by the individualism of the capitalist system nor by the hypertrophy of an all- controlling State, one whose acts are a reissue of the powers that alienated our traditional society which was already dehumanized and unjust.\n40.\t\\\"Social democracy of full participation\\\" is what President Velasco Alvarado called the target of the new united and self-generating society towards which the Peruvian revolution is directing its steps. We see our revolution as a process whose development will spread over an entire and historic period in the life of our country. But the achievements we have thus far chalked up already foretell the nature of our new society: an agrarian reform that returns the land to those that till it, a reform of enterprise that gives the workers access to profits, to management and even to ownership of the means of production; a new policy in the utilization of our resources, which restores to Peruvian society its primary right to be the first to benefit from their exploitation; an educational reform that redefines the entire approach to education within a society that seeks new forms of social behavior; and a new policy of popular participation, whose aim is to make it possible for every man and woman of my people to be prepared to exercise his and her right truly to choose his own destiny in all fields of social life and at all levels of the exercise of power.\n41.\tPeru has just celebrated 150 years of independent existence. Although our independence was a historic triumph against colonial domination, it did not bring with it the total liberation of our people, which still remained subject to the economic power of a ruling class that inherited many of the economic and social privilege? of the colony. At the same time, my country was becoming economically dependent on foreign Powers which followed the one-time mother country in Latin America.\n42.\tThat is why the present revolution, which carries within it the seeds of a second and total independence, is endeavoring to achieve a new society qualitatively different from that which emerged from the first independence, without yielding to any external political and economic doctrine which might make us ideologically dependent and isolate us from the national reality and interest. Recently the President of Peru, confirming the well-proved conceptual autonomy of the Peruvian revolution, stated that his stand can be defined as being in keeping with the socialist, humanist, Christian libertarian tradition.\n43.\tAny ideological, political, social and economic effort, inherent in a revolutionary process such as Peru is carrying out to transform its structures, is also in many cases common although to a different extent and perhaps with different approaches to many countries of Latin America and the third world in general, for they, as well as we, are seeking to create the conditions necessary to achieve the status of a modern and developed State, However, these endeavors are frequently threatened from the outside, especially by the present world economic situation and because as yet the co-operation required for development is far from taking the favorable form that the immense efforts made by the developing countries calls for.\n44.\tThe trade and financial deficit of the developing countries, according to a recent study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development would, if the situation does not improve, amount in 1975 to a figure of between $17,000 million and $26,000 million, half or more of which corresponds to profits on foreign investments and services flowing out of these countries and the other part to the trade deficit. If we add to +his the fact that the flow of capital as assistance to developing countries still does not even enjoy a rate of growth of 1 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries, which in the last few years amounted to $13,000 million, we can well understand that the countries of the third world are gradually becoming areas which export capital towards the industrialized centers.\n45.\tForeign conditions for development are not only unfavorable due to these structural causes, in turn due to an archaic international division of labor which was created at the time of colonialism or of economic penetration, but because there are trends today to apply coercive measures to the developing countries. In the fulfillment of the purposes of the Strategy and the exercise of their sovereign rights these developing countries have legally expropriated foreign property in order to transform their structures and mobilize their domestic resources. Peru, in the exercise of its own sovereignty, has decided to expropriate the large land parcels existing in Peru, and to do so in obedience to certain legal criteria, and our right to do so cannot be challenged by any State. We consider that any measure, pressure or sanction of such a nature would be a manifest intervention and at the same time economic aggression which would pose a threat to international peace and security.\n46.\tTo these factors which so gravely. threaten the countries of the third world, has now been added the factor derived from the international monetary crisis created by the decision of the United States to suspend the gold convertibility of the dollar and to impose a 10 per cent surcharge on imports.\n47.\tThese measures have led some industrialized nations to float their own currencies and will have a bearing on international trade, particularly on the competitiveness of exports from the developing countries to the American market. On the other hand, the payment of the foreign debt of the developing countries will also be affected by the revaluation of other currencies.\n48.\tIf this crisis were to lead again to a new monetary readjustment privately discussed and decided upon by the exclusive circle of the great economic and monetary Powers to the exclusion of all others, an international decision of a most unjust nature will have been taken, since it will have been adopted without the participation of two thirds of mankind and thus a qualitative interpretation will presumably have been given to the communities of the northern hemisphere without reasonably and sufficiently considering the quantitative factor of the third world. Surely the latter possesses singular conditions due to its very human existence and therefore it not only deserves respect but also has the right to seek and claim active participation in decisions that will have a significant effect on its own future.\n49.\tThis, while being both political and economic is also a moral fact, and it led the delegation of Peru which I recently headed in Geneva, to speak at the Preparatory Committee, for the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in Lima of the need for the third world to seek immediate guarantees that it will be heard on an equal footing during the drafting of decisions which in the near future are to solve the question of a new monetary policy. This has led us to redefine our views, namely, that, with the technical advice of a committee of experts, the third world should formulate at the Lima Meeting a draft resolution which, with the unanimous support of all States members of this movement, will be presented to this General Assembly and will propose the holding of a world monetary conference. We are of the opinion that this is the only reasonable and equitable procedure whereby jointly to elaborate a new monetary policy that will be valid for all and that will also guarantee not only standard and constant prosperity for some, but will guarantee for all of us fundamental conditions of progress which we cannot waive.\n50.\tUnilateral measures imposed by the United States to rectify its own imbalance in the balance of payments will be designed first of all to solve that chronic problem of its own balance of payments but, when all is said and done, they are designed to stabilize the economic relations of the developed world. It is obvious that neither these unilateral measures nor the present crisis purportedly to be solved by them were created by the developing countries and yet it will be the developing countries that will suffer most in the lengthy process that has just been set under way,\n51.\tTherefore, the developing countries cannot continue to be the victims of policies in whose formulation they have not participated; nor can they accept the role of mute spectators of agreements among an oligarchy of economic powers. Our countries, that attach such importance to the foreign sector, cannot be absent from the creation of a new international monetary system. Whatever measures may be adopted in the future by the industrialized nations must be only provisional and, even as such, we insist that before they are adopted, the representative voice of the third world must be heard. But we are all aware that this crisis is neither provisional nor limited in the sense that its outer limits touch only a group of countries. The crisis will be permanent and its effect will be worldwide and therefore solutions to it must also be found on a world-wide basis and with the participation of all States on an equal footing.\n52.\tTwenty-five years after the Charter of San Francisco was signed we might perhaps note that the dynamic process of international relations seems now to be entering a phase which is characterized by efforts to achieve a more stable and realistic basis for international coexistence through greater discipline in the exercise of power and the rapprochement of the great Powers.\n53.\tThere are tangible signs that encourage us to hGpe that a careful process of readjustment of international relations might well be leading us into a stage when peace will ultimately be the true sign of co-operation among nations. But it is by the same token evident that these important readjustments that emerge from agreements, mainly among powerful countries, must be supplemented, both in scope and in intensity, by the comprehensive consideration of the problems of development because it is almost trite to say that it is in the vast frustrated and disquiet region of the third world that the great Powers will ultimately define the new dimensions of peace among nations.\n54.\tPeru is firmly convinced that the third world is doing everything in its power to solve, from the inside, the problems of its own development and to show itself unified and not incoherently broken up at the mercy of any pressure. By co-ordinating the will of all its component States, by unifying interests and by drafting common lines of action, the third world is endeavoring, once and for all, to be an effective and valid spokesman, able to meet with the great Powers and having at its disposal a reasonable capacity for conciliation, as well as the necessary power so that its presence in the field of world decisions and the defense of its own interests will be one possessing a potential for negotiation, that is, with the necessary strength and power to hear and to be heard.\n55.\tSo this confrontation between an emerging world seeking progress and a world which is endeavoring to solve the great contradictions that have been created by history, ideology and wars must ultimately, in the next few years, produce constructive dialog, free from exploitation, free from deceit, which will effectively lead to the creation and establishment of permanent terms on which the true peace of the future can rest, a peace whose protagonists will, on the one hand, be the great industrial Powers, and on the other, the third world, the present world of poverty, but the present world of hope.\n"

        "file_text": "169.\t: Mr, President, I should like to congratulate you on your election by the General Assembly. It is a tribute not only to your personal merits and to those of your country, but also to the principle of universality which all of us in Latin America and in Colombia have defended.\n170.\tThis year the General Assembly is meeting under the best of auspices. The peoples of the world have for many years awaited the end of the cold war that now seems not too distant. Strictly speaking, since the end of the Second World War, mankind has not enjoyed complete peace because of the grave effects of that catastrophic war-not only where the actual fighting took place, but also on other continents as well. In addition to the political turmoil, there was social and economic upheaval, the poverty of many regions and the displacement of countless persons. As if all that did not suffice, the victorious Powers found themselves at odds, which created more problems for the establishment of peace.\n171.\tThe birth of the United Nations was surrounded by grave doubts regarding its ability to survive and continue for a number of years. This Organization was conceived as a means of creating united action among the great Powers, and the Security Council was to be a forum for the important decisions of war and peace. Once that unity was shattered, the rules that had been meticulously drafted in the cool atmosphere of Dumbarton Oaks and even in San Francisco to create a comprehensive and perfect system of world-wide collective security were left in mid-air. International life became far more complex and difficult than the drafters of the Charter of the United Nations had anticipated. However, we all realize that the great inadequacies in the political functioning of the Organization were due to the hard times of the cold war that has marked the last 25 years.\n172.\tWe are therefore encouraged by the signs of a thaw in that cold war which we see today. There are evident signs of a European reconciliation: there is tangible proof that the differences separating the Federal Republic of Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Western States from other countries of Eastern Europe can at last be settled. There is also a new Berlin Agreement that gives rise to this hope that the wall dissecting the former capital of the German Empire may disappear. In a word, there is a trend in the international community to do away everywhere with cold-war methods.\n173.\tTo that trend must now be added the announcement of a forthcoming visit by the President of the United States, Mr. Richard Nixon, to the capital of the People's Republic of China. The meeting of those two gigantic nations will have a salutary effect if, with that meeting, mankind is brought closer to a period of real coexistence among peoples. However great may be the ideological differences that separate Colombia from the Asian giant, we could neither ignore nor conceal the importance of a nation of almost 800 million inhabitants co-operating with the United Nations. Nor can we forget what that meeting might signify in terms of fending off a new world war which would this time be a ghastly atomic holocaust on the Asian continent.\n174.\tThe announcement of the Sino-United States rapprochement caused a sudden about-face in world politics and we are now witnessing the not-too-distant prospect of the entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations. In the event of such an occurrence, Colombia wishes to take a realistic approach in analyzing the facts. So we say that there is no perfect solution to a difficult problem. To admit Peking China by expelling Taiwan China is neither a praiseworthy nor an advisable solution, for it would be tantamount to applying a punitive measure to a\nGovernment that has lawfully occupied a seat in this Organization. Yet the \\\"two Chinas\\\" thesis cannot fail to raise questions of the legal interpretation of the United Nations Charter regarding the presence of two representative Governments of one nation,\n175, Of the two choices confronting us, Colombia tends to favor the second, without admitting that such a \\\"two Chinas\\\" stand could in the future be invoked as a binding and valid precedent in similar cases. This would be an exceptional solution for an exceptional problem and small States possessing little military power must not be at the mercy of the decisions of the great Powers when they decide that another small State is to be punished by expulsion. Therefore we do not oppose the admission to the United Nations of a great Asian State of recognized power, but we do oppose the jurisprudence of expulsion on the orders of the Great Powers. That would be a return to the harsh practices of the Holy Alliance 1815.\n116. The presence of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must not mean the expulsion of the Republic of China, of whose capacity to govern itself freely and to accept the obligations imposed by the Charter we have no doubt whatsoever. Allowing a new and great State to join the Organization would be in accord with the universality that Colombia has always advocated and would be in keeping with an undeniable reality of the contemporary world. But when the People's Republic of China joins us as a new Government represented here, it does not mean that the principles and systems of the United Nations should be changed, but instead that the new Government should join our system with all the rights and, at the same time, all the duties imposed by the Organization.\n177.\tColombia categorically affirms that the right to representation of States implies a status similar to the right of citizenship and cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn by the international community. Still less can it be withdrawn in the United Nations, which is based on the principles of universality and the juridical equality of States. The precedent now being established would create a chink in the jurisprudence of the United Nations Charter.\n178.\tWe are living in a period of negotiation and of contacts among nations with different ideologies in order to do away with the cold war and replace the use of force to settle situations that might lead peoples to wide conflicts. \\\"If you desire peace, prepare for war\\\", said the Romans, si vis pacem, para bellum, but today, with the sombre picture in mind of what the last world war was, and the thought of what a new armed clash among nations possessing the greatest atomic power in the world would mean, we have to coin the old aphorism differently and say rather \\\"Si vis pacem, para pacem\\\", \\\"If you desire peace, prepare for peace\\\".\n179.\tWe are heading towards a pluralist world towards truce among the continents. Warring over ideologies has shown that none could alone unify the universe. We are therefore forced to recognize an ideological plurality and the diversity of political and social doctrines of nations if we wish wisely to acknowledge a palpable feature of our day. Never before- has it been more necessary to recognize the principles of self-determination of peoples and of non-intervention, which are the two cornerstones of our international world order. Without them, we would be back to the dismal and tragic period of interference by the great countries of the world in the domestic affairs of the small which for so many decades blotted the history of our American continent. We now aspire to full coexistence among the American .nations without any of them seeking to interfere in the free life of the others.\n180.\tEach country must have the right to channel its own institutions along the lines chosen by its citizens through the free play of popular vote and thus we shall be able to turn our attention to international co-operation on the basis ,of the principles that this General Assembly approved in 1970 in resolution 2625 (XXV), which might warrant repetition since they embody a supreme hope for legitimate peaceful coexistence among all States-regardless of their political and social doctrines or their national institutions.\n181.\tBy that resolution the General Assembly approved the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and presented them as follows: the principle that States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the principles of the United Nations; the principle that States shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered; the duty not to intervene in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any State in accordance with the Charter; the duty of States to co-operate with one another; the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples; the principle of the sovereign equality of States; and the principle that States shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the Charter.\n182.\tIf we are to act consistently with those principles, therefore, we must condemn the exporting of revolutions and we must accept the plurality of ideologies. Intervention is an aspect of the cold war that is being replaced as an obsolete policy. Nothing could be more absurd than the imposition of an ideology by the force of arms. A movement is gaining ground against such methods, and other techniques in the mutual relations of States are gaining ground-such as, for example, the visits of Heads of State of different beliefs and talks between Ministers of Foreign Affairs. Despite difficulties in the international field, the world is now guided by dialog and a sense of human understanding and solidarity.\n183.\tWithout a doubt this was the trail blazed by Pope John XXIII, the Supreme Pontiff of the Catholic Church, who must be called the precursor of the' policies\\\" of understanding that become manifest in events in the Far East and in Europe. In his encyclical Pacem in Terris, that outstanding leader outlined what should be true peaceful coexistence in the world, based on true balance between rights and duties, respect for minorities, a legal order in harmony with moral order and the common good based on the principles of economic justice. I shall quote his words;\n\\\"There is reason to hope, however, that by meeting and negotiating, men may come to discover better the bonds that unite them together, deriving from the human nature which they have in common; and that they may also come to discover that one of the most profound requirements of their common nature is this: that between them and their respective peoples it is not fear which should reign but love .. .\\\".\n184., It would be premature to try and foretell the outcome of this new period of understanding among all States, over and above their national idiosyncracies. Perhaps this pluralistic world of which we speak may come closer to that ideal that was sought at the beginning of the nineteenth century : the democratic State with the coexistence of its citizenry. We are transferring to a world-wide scale what was fulfilled within the narrow confines of the \\\"independent State\\\". The freedom of the State as a social group is today as necessary as freedom of thought to the citizen at the beginning of the democratic era. States therefore have the right to dissent. Among the great monoliths that are the atomic Powers small nations have a place. Ideological terror imposed by vast armies is today nonsensical.\n185.\tColombia reiterates its adherence to the principles of international law and to the doctrine that the fundamental rights of the State is an essential need of the present day. This is an inevitable requirement of our era of relaxation of tensions and closer bonds and the general .assumption now is that different ideologies can coexist in the world without resorting to the occupation of free peoples or the desperate measures of war, bombing and the annihilation of defenseless populations.\n186.\tBut that view has one more implication. European reconciliation, the shrinking of the conflict areas, the trend towards an ending of the war in Viet-Nam are all factors that should contribute to the conclusion of the unfinished business of disarmament as much as the entry of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.\n187.\tA conference of all the atomic Powers seems today both possible and necessary, with the contribution of that great State, to avoid the arms race which weighs so heavily ori the developing nations and even on the countries which stockpile the weapons. In April of this year the Secretary- General of the United Nations, with his enlightened view of world needs, proclaimed the necessity for disarmament at the fourteenth session of the Economic Commission for Latin America and he quoted the alarming figure of $200,000 million as the disproportionate sum invested yearly by the nations of the world in the purchase of arms.\n188.\tColombia has championed the elimination of all unnecessary military expenditures in Latin America. We believe that it is still not too late to extend to other highly sophisticated weapons the prohibition covering atomic arms\nin our continent contained in the Treaty of Tlatelolco. There is no reason for the peoples that bear the burden of poverty and suffer the rigors of constant work in order to overcome the limitations of under-development to invest exorbitant amounts of money in armaments that are disproportionate with the true needs of their national defense. In Latin America we are running the risk of getting into an arms race, because we lack agreements prohibiting sophisticated and costly weapons.\n189.\tWe are neither Utopian nor are we visionaries, but we are anxious to meet the needs of national defense. We wish to contribute to the economic and social development of our countries with all our resources and to the fullest extent of our ability. The arms race in the under-developed continents cannot but be the denial of the basic needs of men.\n190.\tAnd with disarmament, we face the harsh visage of poverty.\n191.\tEvery year, from this very rostrum, the developing nations rise to repeat complaints about the deficiencies in world trade which hamper the expansion of their economies and hinder an increase in their resources. Colombia does so this year also, and with more than usual concern, because of the unexpected turn in the world monetary market. The developing countries had seemed to be the only ones to suffer from monetary readjustment due to imbalances in their balance of payments; but, paradoxically, this phenomenon now seems to be affecting the richer countries. We feel we are in good company although we face greater limitations because the crisis in the world monetary market affects us so vitally.\n192.\tThis crisis is characterized by the unequal distribution of gold reserves and the impossibility of maintaining rigid exchange rates. We cannot nurture the illusion that it has been business as usual since the Second World War in the monetary and international trade institutions, inasmuch as the Bretton Woods pillars of monetary regulations are crumbling before us. But analyzing the consequences of these events we are led to state that it would be unjust completely inimical to the urgency of narrowing the gap between the wealthy and the poor countries if the financial imbalances of the former were allowed adversely to affect the scarce monetary reserves of the latter which have been accumulated through savings and constant work. This new Development Decade cannot be permitted to become a period of greater frustration.\n193.\tConsultative machinery in the international economic field that seems to be deteriorating to the great prejudice of the multilateral approach on which the 1944 Articles of Agreement on the International Monetary Fund rested must be re-established. We are in effect witnessing the existence of a double standard in monetary regulations: one that permits the great nations to ac' as they will and another that forces the poor countries to submit to the strict discipline of deprivation and poverty. We must return to the principle that no single country can by a unilateral decision alter the international exchange situation. Latin\nAmerica has just made a most vigorous protest against the recent United States decision to impose a 10 per cent surcharge on imports and it has taken a unified position on immediate and long-term solutions to the problem of revising the world monetary system which have been put forward by the Minister of Finance of Colombia, Dr. Rodrigo Llorente, on behalf of Latin America.\n194.\tAlthough this problem is under lengthy discussion in other forums, it is appropriate to mention that it would have been fairer towards the developing countries had the United States not applied the surcharge to them, since basically the rivalry that exists is between the great exporting nations. By exempting them it would have virtually granted the trade preferences that are still an imperative measure if the trade balance is to be restored. We must realize that the situation in the developing countries which in all continents represent the area with the largest population has not improved sufficiently in the past few years and could deteriorate if these circumstances are not remedied.\n195.\tColombia believes that everything should tend towards the opening of new markets for our products. In the strategy for development of the countries with fewer resources, it would seem that what Mr. Raul Prebisch called \\\"the persistent and systematic effort to overcome foreign strangulation\\\" has to be resorted to. Apart from the need for structural reforms and the accumulation of their own resources, and the development of greater technological capacity, that distinguished economist, in a study on Latin America published under the auspices of the Inter- American Bank,  warned us that in the future our countries would depend on new exports.\n196.\tThe problem of world trade is daily becoming more acute and distressing for the developing countries, which depend on their exports to pursue their plans for progress. The dilemma facing these countries is either export or suffer from poverty, and that of the developed countries is to share their profits or to increase world disorder.\n197.\tAt past regular sessions of the General Assembly, Colombia advocated consideration of certain aspects of a concrete revision of the United Nations Charter. We are fully aware of the very serious tactical problems which would be involved in a genial revision of the San Francisco Charter. We have taken a very specific approach to this and we have referred to the problem of universality and the acceptance of new Members in the United Nations.\n198.\t-\tWe think that the institutions governed by the Charter can be perfected. First of all, we would like to have regional covenants of collective security used mere broadly in the Lengthening of peace. Experience has shown that the Security Council, in most eases, is paralyzed because of political obstacles which have been created by the antagonistic stands of the major Powers, and that is why greater flexibility must be given to it in application of Article 53 of the Charter.\n199.\tIt was felt in San Francisco that regional arrangements were a dangerous exception to the general rules of collective security and an intense campaign was waged to render the Charter compatible with the rules of the Inter-American system. Today we note the contrary phenomenon taking place. No one would challenge the advantage of appealing to the countries directly concerned in a given conflict.\n200.\tRegional collective security agreements are the best instruments for co-ordination among the countries directly interested in solving international problems before appealing to the Security Council.\n201.\tSecondly, the International Court of Justice needs to play a more active role in the maintenance of peace. The Statute of the Court grants limited jurisdiction in whatever controversial matters the parties submit to it, and this has led to important decisions that have enriched international jurisprudence. But exclusively legal matters, and questions of the interpretation of treaties have constituted the main subjects for discussion by the Court, and these should not be the sole concern of that judicial body. If it were not possible to extend the competence of the International Court of Justice to matters of peace, as Colombia has already advocated and defended from this rostrum last year [1846th meeting], it might be advisable to consider granting it special competence to safeguard human rights throughout the world.\n202.\tThe International Court of Justice would then act as an organ to protect human rights and would play a decisive role in one of the areas of international law where valuable experience has already been gathered by the European Court of Human Rights, which a number of Western nations established. This competence could be open to acceptance by States, and, little by little, a new jurisprudence would build up on the principles of the international covenants on human rights of the United Nations which otherwise run the risk of becoming just a manual of pious good intentions without practical application.\n203.\tThe United Nations is studying a grave matter, the law of the sea. The 1973 Conference, convened by the General Assembly pursuant to resolution 2750 (XXV), is being actively prepared for, but a thorough study of the subjects allocated to that Conference is still required. In practical terms, that Conference will have to deal with all the problems of the law of the sea, going from the breadth of the territorial sea to the international regime for the sea-bed, without overlooking such related issues as the continental shelf, the contiguous zone, fishing and the exploration of marine resources.\n204.\tAt the last session, Colombia sponsored the convening of this Conference and we feel in duty bound to draw attention to the undeniable need to prepare a strict program of work that will lead to mature and carefully pondered decisions at the future session. Perhaps the best way of ensuring positive results would be not to contend that all subjects should be discussed at the same time, but problems should instead perhaps be staggered in different stages or sessions of a Conference that might well stretch over for a number of months, or might even be held in two consecutive years. It would be far better to advance thoughtfully step by step than to try to rush through the whole gamut in one single session.\n205.\tThe problems confronting us under the heading of \\\"The Law of the Sea\\\" are vast in their implications. On the one hand there is the question of the international regime for the sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The Declaration of Principles adopted by the General Assembly in 1970 in resolution 2749 (XXV) spells undoubted progress in shaping the new doctrine of the \\\"common heritage of mankind\\\" as applied to the sea-bed. As the Declaration states, that area \\\"shall not be subject to appropriation... by any States\\\" and \\\"shall be open to use exclusively for peaceful purposes\\\". All activities in the area shall be governed by the international regime to be established. Much progress has been made thanks to the preliminary study carried out in the enlarged Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction of the United Nations which has considered a number of draft resolutions, one of which, co-sponsored by Colombia and 11 other Latin American countries, provides for an international sea-bed authority possessing sufficient autonomy to undertake scientific research of the abyssal depths and their exploitation.\n206.\tOn the other hand, there are still the matters left pending after the first two United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea, which were held in 1958 and 1960. In reality, the four Conventions approved in 1958 constituted the most ambitious codification of the regulations of the sea that might have been imagined in the days of John Selden and Hugh Grotius, and they are the very basis of maritime international law today. However, there can be no doubt that the enormous strides of science and technology have brought out new problems not contemplated in 1958. The very matter of the joint exploitation of the sea-bed calls for far greater precision in the definition of concepts related to each of the four Conventions adopted that year on the territorial sea, the continental shelf, the high seas, the fishing zone and the conservation of the living resources of the sea.\n207.\tColombia believes that significant agreements must be arrived at if the Conference is to be a success, and to that end, we suggest:\n(a)\tThe principle that all States shall be free to utilize the marine and submarine zones contiguous to their shores and that they shall be considered an extension of their territory;\n(b)\tThe principle that there exist reasonable limits to the setting of the sovereign and primary interest of the State over the marine and sub-marine zones contiguous to their shores, and that there can be no hindering of the Jus commune nationis nor the common progress of mankind;\n(c)\tThe principle that the international community should offer the State guarantees and safeguard it against undue usurpation of its marine and submarine resources by devising, for international maritime law, a concept of Uti possidetis maris similar to that which exists in Latin America for national territory.\n208.\tWe also would point out the need to differentiate between the territorial and the patrimonial sea. In many cases the differences that occurred in international maritime law have been due to the mistaken use of the territorial sea to meet the economic needs of our day, when these could better be served with the new notion of the \\\"patrimonial sea\\\". The former is the zone of exclusive sovereignty recognized for the coastal State, over the sea, the air space and the subsoil under the waters. It is an old part of international law whose origins go back to the Middle Ages and which was always understood as defined by Pradier Foddrd as \\\"the defensive line of the territory\\\".\n209.\tThis concept is deeply embedded in the legal customs of man, but with all due respect to the countries of Latin America which have adopted ample breadths for their territorial sea. Yet one still wonders whether it is appropriate for the State to enjoy the unlimited right of setting the breadth of the territorial sea to the point that it might close off the lines of communication of other States. The jus commune nationis of which Francisco de Vitoria wrote is still a vital need today, and if we leave in the hands of States the right to set any breadth whatsoever for the territorial sea, or to extend it to the coasts of another State across a gulf or a strait, the freedom of communications across the sea would be endangered.\n210.\tAt the last two United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea, a quasi-unanimous consensus was arrived at on the 12-mile maximum breadth for the territorial sea, which seems in itself sufficient under normal circumstances to permit vigilance to be maintained over the coasts. Of course, however, with modern weaponry and intercontinental missiles, medieval concepts have been made obsolete, and if the countries with lesser military potential insist on contending that the territorial sea can be extended arbitrarily, the great Powers could quite easily close off the seas altogether by the mere application of the principle stated by Bynkershoek, when he proclaimed that territorial sovereignty ends with the range of weapons (Potestas terrae finiri ubi finitur armorum vis).\n211.\tA confusion has arisen in the present discussions between the territorial sea which should reach the 12-mile limit and the patrimonial sea which had begun to appear in international law as a zone where the coastal State enjoys special privileges for the exploration and exploitation of marine and submarine resources. Today, the patrimonial sea is what the territorial sea was to the Middle Ages: a consequence of biological and economic needs and also of the need to defend a nation's own resources as well as a way of compensating for the poverty of many areas, or, in other cases, for the lack of a continental shelf, and it includes the exclusive authority to explore and exploit the sea and all its resources.\n212.\tThe patrimonial sea could well be 200 miles wide while the territorial sea merely reaches the 12-mile limit. The special privileges recognized for it should be the subject of a separate convention unifying rights over the contiguous zone and the continental shelf. Thus we might come to a reasonable compromise between the old and the new- between the 12-mile limit and the 200-mile limit that some countries claim; between the States which contend that the territorial sea cannot be widened unrestrictedly by unilateral measures and those which advocate the present-day concept of the economic interests of State applied to the \nlegal regime of the sea. The common denominator would be to avoid closing off the high seas.\n213.\tTo the universality of the principles of the Law of the Sea is added the need to accept the regional nature of solutions for each of the seas themselves, considered separately. Surely the Pacific Ocean, where distances are immense, is not the same as the Caribbean or the Baltic Seas. Colombia considers that a regional agreement will have to be arrived at for the Caribbean which includes all States having islands or mainland coasts on it, whatever their national situation. It is only thus that we will be able to settle the specific questions that arise with regard to the narrow area of the Caribbean, where no country can claim its 200 miles without encroaching upon the waters of another State.\n214.\tRegional marine agreements will facilitate the already complex work of the future universal conference of the law of the sea. A regional conference of the countries of the Caribbean region would, I believe, be very advisable, to establish special formulas for this island-studded sea, as a preparatory stage for the world conference.\n215.\tIf a special formula of 200 miles has been arrived at for the Pacific or the Atlantic, surely it would be possible to devise a more appropriate one for the Caribbean, or the Baltic or the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea.\n216.\tUniversality and regionalism have never been incompatible concepts as far as political and security aspects are concerned, and we believe that the solution to the problems of the sea lies in these two concepts.\n217.\tMay I conclude my statement paying a tribute to our Secretary-General, UThant. For many years he has been the man who has been directly responsible for the fate of the United Nations. Information on the grave situations confronting mankind has been placed in his hands-and thanks in large measure to his serenity, ability and wisdom as a great statesman of Asia, none of these has led to a confrontation. His calm demeanor has been a model of international wisdom, yet it has never been devoid of energy. On the war in Viet-Nam and on conflicts that have afflicted other regions, UThant has made categorical declarations and issued warnings to the major Powers.\n218.\tIn the forthcoming election of a new Secretary- General of the United Nations, Latin America claims the right and the honor to elect one of its own citizens of this continent. Europe and Asia have already exercised this right, and it is only natural that Latin America should obtain this honor and responsibility in the person of a son of its own continent.\n219.\tColombia expresses a most fervent wish that the United Nations shall truly be an Organization of peace, law and justice, for mankind, which still places its hopes and trust in the principles of the San Francisco Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "138.\tMr. President, on behalf of the delegation of Chile, I have the honor to offer you our warmest congratulations on your election to preside over the twenty-sixth regular session of the General Assembly. Your nomination is a tribute to your capacity and your experience. We cannot lose sight of the fact that in Bandung, in 1955,  basic principles were established for common action on the part of the countries of the third world.\n139.\tMy delegation is also particularly happy to welcome the representatives of the three new States that have just been admitted to our Organization: Bahrain, Qatar and Bhutan. We are sure that we shall establish solid ties of friendship and co-operation with them.\n140.\tTo U Thant I bring a very special greeting from the people and the Government of Chile. We should have preferred him to stay at the head of our Organization. His performance has been deeply imbued with heartfelt idealism but, at the same time, with very acute and wise understanding. He has advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes, international co-operation and the strengthening of the moral authority of the United Nations. His work has been exemplary, and we are most appreciative. We know that he will continue to co-operate in all the great undertakings that may spell a benefit for mankind as a whole.\n141.\tA political and electoral decision by the Chilean peoples, ratified by the National Congress in accordance with our Constitution, last year led to the establishment in our country of a new Government that has decided to begin the creation of a socialist society in Chile in keeping with our own national characteristics.\n142.\tThe triumph obtained was the result not only of an electoral exercise but also of a crystallization of a long period of struggle and experience which tempered and organized the Chilean people, awakening its political awareness and teaching it to start through new roads an ambitious and important revolutionary undertaking. The strength and flexibility of the Chilean political institutions, reinforced by the loyalty of our armed forces to democracy, is enabling us, with the least possible social cost, to cross the bridge between the past and the future, although not without having to confront the stubborn and insistent resistance of the interests affected by the changes taking place within and outside the country.\n143.\tTherefore, I do not speak on behalf of a stagnant people, or one that is wanting in the great ideals of peace, justice and liberty which underlie the United Nations. I speak for a people that calls for respect and encouragement from the international community for its laborious efforts to obtain that justice within the framework of the law, in strengthening and widening fundamental freedoms and human rights.\n144.\tThe domestic and foreign forces that oppose the social transformations we are carrying out constantly endeavor to distort our image to the world in order to alienate us from our friends and to make it difficult for us to obtain international and bilateral assistance, with the final aim of blocking our revolutionary task and trying to maintain a past that no longer has the support of our people nor any historical justification.\n145.\tThat is why this appearance before the Assembly is not mere routine. We have a determined purpose, and that is to fit our policy within the framework of the United Nations, and thus contribute to the efforts of the Members of the international community represented here to achieve a stronger and effective peace, which is the imperative condition for the progress of the world's peoples. We are here also to encourage and assist the United Nations in the work being carried out by peoples, to convert foreign dependence, which immobilizes and deforms them, into a vast and authentic framework of international co-operation.\n146.\tChile is now undertaking a policy aimed at nationalizing its natural resources which are in foreign hands, widening and extending our agrarian reform, and taking over control by the State of the essential economic activities of the country so as to allow us, in a rational and planned manner, to utilize our natural, human and financial resources for the common good. We are deeply convinced that these objectives are at one with the achievement by the United Nations of its own supreme goals.\n147.\tWe value, support, and are endeavoring to contribute to a transformation of the humanistic principles of the United Nations into tangible reality. We recognize that this entity is the most valuable instrument thus far created to encourage international peace and justice and, thereby, to help man to reach a fuller and better future. These aspirations have met with great obstacles created by vested interests desirous of maintaining in nations, and in their mutual relations, the irrational, dependent and unjust structure which, unfortunately, still prevails in the world.\n148.\tThe United Nations has now become an irreplaceable world forum; a network of agencies that are of undeniable advantage and a source of law. But it is still not the tool that we need in order to permit a solution to the problems linked to international peace: that is, the full strengthening of the sovereignty of States, respect for the principle of the self-determination of peoples, and the economic progress of the developing countries.\n149.\tThe principles of the Charter of the United Nations are still valid and are consonant with the aspirations of peoples. But they must be translated into positive action in order to alleviate the lot of man and keep up with the revolutionary transformations taking place in our world.\n150.\tChile fully shares the concerns and views expressed about these matters at Lusaka and at other conferences of non-aligned nations. We must point out that in the last 26 years economic and social development, impelled by the United Nations, has been fruitful in some cases, but sterile in others, Hundreds of millions of persons have been liberated from the colonial yoke; peoples have acquired a greater awareness of their needs and of their future. But we still live in a period of armed peace, and therefore a precarious peace. Moreover, the contrasts and distances between the wealthy countries and the dispossessed masses of mankind are increasing, while the basic principles of peaceful coexistence are violated as are those of respect for the political and economic sovereignty of States and unconditional co-operation without interference. The reactionary forces of imperialism, colonialism and neocolonialism have no compunction in putting down or pressuring peoples struggling for independence or desirous of consolidating it through economic emancipation.\n151.\tThere is an indifference or perhaps an inability to face tragedies such as the flight to India of millions of East Pakistanis. Surely this is a problem worthy of special attention by this Assembly, as the President of Chile expressed in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. There is a war of extermination in Indo-China; there is a constant threat of war in the Middle East; there are African peoples that are still the victims of colonial slavery or of brutal racial persecution; and in Latin America there is an increasing feeling of frustration and helplessness.\n152.\tYet, despite these sombre aspects of the international picture, despite these limitations to the work of the United Nations, we still believe that we must in that work stress the formulation of important principles of international law which respond to the voiced aspirations of the great majority of peoples and which help to create s new and more just world order.\n153.\tAmong such principles I think it most timely to recall those that have established the right of peoples not only to political independence, but also to economic sovereignty.\n154.\tIt is obvious that the principle of the self- determination of peoples and its corollary, the termination of colonialism, have been greatly strengthened by resolutions of the General Assembly, particularly 1514 (XV), the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, a resolution which has now made unchallengeable the right to struggle for full political emancipation.\n155.\tIn the same way, other fundamental resolutions, such as resolution 1803 (XVII), which proclaims the right of States freely to exploit their resources and natural wealth, as well as to exercise permanent sovereignty over them, and have therefore signified explicit recognition, on the part of the international community, of the right of peoples to economic independence.\n156.\tIt is within the very context of these principles, so solemnly declared by the United Nations, that the Government of Chile, as a means of overcoming its economic dependence, lias undertaken a process of recovery for the country of those natural resources and wealth which are basic for the development of the national economy. Pursuant to that policy we have nationalized the great copper-mining industry, within the framework of respect for the principles of international law and our own traditional observance of the domestic legal order. That nationalization was born of an initiative taken by the Government of Popular Unity, which was unanimously approved by the National Congress, in which the opposition is in the majority,\n157.\tThe Government of Chile is convinced that the exercise of its sovereign right to recover for the country its natural resources-a right recognized by the United Nations -will be respected by the affected interests. We therefore hope '.at no new pressures or reprisals will be taken against us for that reason.\n158.\tI am happy to point out that in the recently issued Joint Declarations signed by our own President and the Presidents of Ecuador, Colombia and Peru on August, 31 August and 3 September respectively, in accordance with those principles, express mention was made of the repudiation by all our countries of any undue pressure to limit or condition the free exercise of the right to recover control over natural resources.\n159.\tThe exercise of sovereignty over basic resources cannot be divorced from another very important question being discussed at the moment in this Organization. I speak of the law of the sea.\n160.\tFor developing countries such as my own, utilization of the national resources of the maritime areas adjacent to their coasts is intended primarily to meet economic needs in order to ensure the welfare of the population.\n161.\tIt was these measures which led an increasing number of Latin American States, including Chile, to proclaim our sovereignty and jurisdiction up to a distance of 200 marine miles in order to ensure the conservation and exploitation of those natural resources.\n162.\tChile is convinced that the aims we seek are hindered if, in all the extension over which we exercise our jurisdiction, there is any restriction of the freedom of navigation or over-flight to which all planes and ships of\nany flag have a perfect right. *\n163.\tChile will continue to participate actively in the debate on the law of the sea in order to contribute to the establishment of norms and regulations which, while recognizing the just interests of other States particularly in the field of international communications, will guarantee the right of the coastal States to exercise their sovereignty over the natural resources of the marine areas adjacent to their coasts.\n164.\tThe efficacy of the United Nations depends to a large extent on the degree of universality it is able to achieve, Universality means to throw open the doors of the\nOrganization to those countries that have so far been excluded, such as the People's Republic of China, the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the now divided States such as Viet-Nam and Korea; it also means to welcome the countries and territories that are still under colonial domination.\n165.\tChile hopes that at this session we will redress the enormous historic error of having kept the People's Republic of China out of the world Organization. When we correct an unjust and anomalous situation, we will be breathing new life into the United Nations. We will, with the co-operation of China, be given a new impulse to all the undertakings leading to peace and welfare of all peoples. The recognition of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China must be stated clearly and unambiguously, without subterfuge. It is a question of recognizing it as the legitimate representative of all China with a just right to occupy a seat in the Security Council and in all other United Nations organs and conferences and to recognize that Taiwan is part of China and to bar any other representation.\n166.\tGuided by the principles of the Charter, which set forth the sovereignty of peoples and respect for international agreements freely arrived at, my country wishes to express its solidarity with the heroic people of Viet-Nam that have never yielded to the cruel sufferings of a war imposed on them by invading forces and that prefer to die rather than bend the knee and abdicate their freedom and dignity. We express our desire for an immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from Viet-Nam and support the seven-point proposal of the Provisional Government of Viet-Nam to solve this grave conflict,\n167.\tWe also repudiate the invasion of the other peoples of Indo-China, such as Cambodia and Laos, and we support their aspirations to live in peace and to decide upon their own future without foreign intervention.\n168.\tFor the same reasons of principle, with regard to the conflict in the Middle Bast, my Government is still convinced that resolution 242(1967) of the Security Council, accepted by the parties concerned, is the key to restore peace to that tormented region. We consider that the people of Palestine deserves not only humanitarian attention, but a recognition of its legitimate rights. In accordance with that resolution, we feel that the Israeli troops should withdraw from occupied territories, that any effort to annex such territories should be condemned, that all States of the zone, excluding none, have a perfect right to a recognition of their territorial integrity, their sovereignty and political independence, as well as to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. We trust that Ambassador Jarring's mission will be resumed and that the four great Powers will continue to seek the best way of ensuring application of resolution 242 (1967) and that both the Security Council and the General Assembly will again examine all possibilities of finding a just solution to the conflict in the Middle East which threatens international peace and security.\n169.\tMy delegation is very happy at the very felicitous African initiative to co-operate in the search for a solution among the countries that are now in conflict and that may lead to a formula that will solve the question in a way the entire world desires,\n170.\tWe wish to state our understanding of and solidarity with the African and Asian peoples that struggle for independence. This Organization that has contributed to the liquidation of colonialism must increase its efforts supporting the movements of national liberation and forcing the colonial Powers to fulfill the terms of the Charter. The people and Government of Chile trust that very soon the delegations of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau) and of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia will take their seats in this hall, but in the meantime those territories and peoples are being martyrized in their just struggle for independence, and in southern Africa there is being created an extremely dangerous colonialist and racist bloc, Once again Chile condemns the practices of apartheid and of racial discrimination, which are an insult to mankind.\n171.\tReaffirming these points of views, we have very often expressed our support for the agreements arrived at during the Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Lusaka in September 1970. I am happy to state that China is now a full member of the group of non-aligned nations, where we will be able actively to co-operate in the achievement of true peaceful coexistence, avoiding a division of the world into blocs and endeavoring to ensure that all countries, great and small, will contribute to understanding and co-operation among peoples.\n172.\tThe Government of Chile considers that at this new session of the General Assembly two subjects will be thoroughly and jointly discussed: the strengthening of international security and general and complete disarmament. We believe that this Assembly must implement the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, adopted last year [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. Furthermore, a Soviet Union suggestion was put forward for the holding of a world disarmament conference [A/8491], and my Government supports it whole-heartedly.\n173.\tThe arms race is in direct proportion to international tension. One provokes the other. Despite agreements arrived at, we believe it is in the interest of the smaller and non-aligned nations that any initiative to slow down the arms race, be it nuclear or conventional, be welcomed. Chile is ready to co-operate in a task which we consider to be the most important of our day.\n174.\tAlong this line of reasoning, we cannot but condemn the proliferation of nuclear weapon tests, particularly those carried out in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, which have caused a number of justifiable complaints from the coastal States, For this reason, in the Organization of American States we supported the Colombian proposal to study an effective limitation of armaments in Latin America,\n175.\tThis concern shown by our country to diminish international tension and bring us closer to a world system of security to replace the blocs we inherited from the cold-war period leads us enthusiastically to welcome the\nQuadripartite Agreement on Berlin, signed in that city on 3 September 1971. These agreements help to solve the German problems on the strength of full recognition of the international personality both of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the German Democratic Republic. At the same time they open the way for the holding of a conference on European security to herald the dawn of a new era of peace and co-operation in that vital part of the world.\n176.\tConsistent with the political beliefs I have mentioned, in bilateral relations my Government has endeavored to strengthen, establish and maintain relations with all countries all over the world, regardless of their domestic regimes but on the basis of unconditional respect for self-determination and non-intervention. Following that line of conduct, we have re-established relations with Cuba and thus redressed a historic injustice. We have also established relations with the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic, Guyana, Nigeria, the People's Republic of Mongolia, the United Republic of Tanzania, the Arab Republic of Libya and Albania.\n177.\tThe visit that I made to the socialist countries of Europe, heading a fruitful political and economic mission, and the welcome we offered in Chile to a number of high-level delegations from all regions of the world, including those of very old countries of Western Europe that have contributed so greatly to our progress, attest to this true opening up of Chile to a new and wider understanding of international relations.\n178.\tWe have endeavored successfully to broaden our relations and ties with the sister Republics of Latin America. The recent visit of President Allende to Ecuador, Colombia and Peru, and the wide consensus reached with those countries, and set forth in constructive joint declarations, as well as the support and impetus which we have impressed on the Andean Subregional Integration Agreement within the framework of the Latin American Free Trade Association, also reflect this new orientation of our policy.\n179.\tI wish to state with great satisfaction that we have reached an agreement with the Argentine Republic to solve through arbitration, the pending border problems with that country at the Beagle Canal, This attests to the warm and friendly relations between our country and that great neighbor and is an example of a peaceful and legal solution to an international problem, which the Presidents of the two countries attempted to establish at their historic meeting in Salta.\n180.\tWe have been, and are, ready to resume diplomatic relations with Bolivia unconditionally and thus to put an end to an unjustified state of affairs and allow an always necessary dialog to take place between two sister Republics.\n181.\tThis entire policy bespeaks our vocation of fraternity and co-operation in Latin America, and that is why we are concerned about the unjust economic isolation to which the sister Republic of Cuba has been subjected. To continue that situation of discrimination against that country seems to us juridically and morally unacceptable and we shall do all in our power to do justice to that valiant people that, in different ways but still in keeping with its own desires, is, like Chile, pursuing the dream of creating a socialist society on American soil.\n182.\tMy country is happy to note that we have normal relations with the United States of America. We believe that questions pending involving private American interests should not alter our traditional friendship with that great nation.\n183.\tAt the last session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States [OAS] held in San Jose, Costa Rica, in April 1971, the Government of Chile expressed its views regarding the role which that organization has been playing in inter-American relations. We contended then that the OAS had been used to increase the relation of dependency between the United States and Latin America. We said that for an inter-American system to serve as a means of constructive dialog between the North and the South of the continent, the fictitious principles on which the OAS at present rests must be replaced by others more in keeping with reality that will recognize the objective divergence of interests of the United States and Latin America, as expressed in the concrete practice of international relations and as we have begun now to see them in the Special Committee for Latin American Coordination (CECIA) since the Consensus of Vina del Mar of May 1969.\n184.\tThat practice has shown that the gap between the advanced capitalist countries and the developing nations of Asia, Africa and Latin America tends to increase; despite words, despite declarations and despite international agreements, what people see is a failure on the part of the traditional patterns for development, the repeated lack of fulfillment by the prosperous countries of their commitment to eradicate under-development, and the systematic refusal of the industrialized nations to adopt measures to redress the imbalance of international trade.\n185.\tTo prove these statements, suffice it to recall what has been happening to the trade of the dependent nations whose participation shrinks constantly and is less equitable than ever on the world market: the result of the measures for financial assistance which have turned the nations of the third world into constant debtors, the uncontrolled exploitation of the natural resources and wealth of the countries which were purportedly being helped by investments by monopolies, the costly transfer of a minimum of technology and th?. abusive control of marine trade.\n186.\t'\tThe instruments and machinery regulating the monetary system of the world, as well as international trade, established at the end of the Second World War, despite their declared principles, have proved to be incapable of achieving a balanced development of the world economy and have hindered the economic growth of the backward regions. Today, when these systems turn out to be unfavorable to their proponents, they are abandoned unilaterally and upheavals are created that have negative effects on the developing countries.\n187.\tWe must protest vigorously against this unjust situation for Which we are not responsible. Latin American\nGovernments shared this opinion unanimously at the session of CECLA held in September of this year, in Buenos Aires, where they stressed the damage which the recently adopted measures of the United States would do to Latin American economy and the economy of the developing nations in general. That position of Latin America was also expressed at the seventh session of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council where, unfortunately, no positive understanding was shown by the United States delegation. Lately we have seen that new formulae have been studied to reorganize the world monetary system. We hope that those formulae will not overlook the legitimate interests of the under-developed countries and will not further increase the vulnerability and dependence of their economies.\n188.\tThe formulation of the bases for international trade relations must be discussed at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]. The agreements of the developing countries to be arrived at by the Group of 77 when it meets in Lima in October must improve upon previous agreements and establish the background for the debates at the third session of UNCTAD, to be held in Santiago, Chile, in April 1972. In so doing, the dialog which was begun in New Delhi among the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America with the capitalist industrialized countries and the socialist countries will be resumed: It is to be hoped that by that time the outlines, for a general system of tariff preferences will be implemented as the European Economic Community and Japan are already doing and as the United Kingdom and the Nordic countries have promised to do very soon.\n189.\tAs the host country we shall do all in our power not only to ensure the material success of the conference but also to contribute, in close co-operation with the other countries of the Group of 77, so that the aspiration to international justice will gain ground and set aside egotism and recalcitrance.\n190.\tTo succeed, all undertakings in that direction must be met by a corresponding domestic effort on the part of each of the developing States to develop, increase, mobilize and make rational use of their natural and human resources. But in order to achieve that end, the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America must develop their own scientific and technological capacities, make profound changes in their social and economic structures. They will have to adjust the foreign components of the development process to the needs and priorities of national development. They will also have to channel the role played by foreign private capital in order to achieve those priorities, and they will have to encourage the preparation of regional and subregional plans for integration as well as increase their mutual co-operation.\n191.\tThis struggle of the under-developed countries to impress an impulse on their economic development, to strengthen their political sovereignty and to achieve their social emancipation is supported by the workers of the whole world and by the progressive and advanced nations whose policy is not committed to the maintenance of the present unjust domestic and external structures.\n192.\tIn its activities the United Nations must reflect the combination of all those forces, which doubtless are the most powerful in the world and thus make accessible to man and society the new and greater form of coexistence.\n193.\tThe people and Government of Chile will stint no effort to succeed in the struggle, nor shall we be found wanting. This is proved by the fact that domestically we are trying to reconstruct our society along the lines of socialism, under the auspices of justice and freedom, and when we give our assistance to peace, detente, security and international co-operation.\n194.\tBy our assistance we contribute to the creation of a future that we wish to be more just and free. Inexorably, that is the course of history, and we Chileans, consistent with our austere and hard-working tradition, will make all sacrifices to assume our full responsibility within a more active, creative and united international community.\n"

        "file_text": "83.\t Mr. President, the first words of my delegation and of my Government, in participating in this general debate, must be those of satisfaction at seeing the Foreign Minister of Indonesia presiding over the twenty-sixth regular session. Your great experience and your well-known judgment. Sir, your impartiality and your conciliatory approach, augur well for our work during the next few months; work that is filled with very heavy problems, but nevertheless most promising and open to decisions of great significance to the future of the international community.\n84.\tThe United Nations will no doubt be the arena for new alignments of world political powers. In fact, the move towards the universality that the United Nations Charter defines will allow States heretofore outside this international forum to join us, and, due to their own unique position, they might help in a redefinition not only of the political interests at play, but what is more important, the political forces that move economic and social development and relations among the developed and the developing countries.\n85.\tWe can foresee that in the not too distant future the nations which today are divided will, with their own consent, find a place in the Organization. The admission of those States, to the exclusion of their counterparts, would be like trying to square the circle. Therefore, the only solution is to offer equal opportunities to the nations divided into States, whose division was caused by the armed conflicts that took place in the last 30 years. The duration of that division will depend upon the nations themselves, since they alone can decide upon their ultimate political reunification. In the meantime, their absence from the international arena creates a breach in significant and promising negotiations.\n86.\tThe application of the principle of universality pre-supposes the recognition of certain political facts, without thereby justifying them or endeavoring to interfere in the domestic affairs of other States. There are, however, certain facts that have lasted for a number of decades and will apparently be crystallized for many more. The United Nations is not creating those situations which the historians will have to unravel and politicians solve. The United Nations has to work with the world as it is. The least we can do is to accept to negotiate with the spokesmen of all sides and ideologies present. Otherwise, we are doing a disservice to peace and security and are, a priori, closing the road to agreement and compromise.\n87.\tTherefore, any discussions that might confuse agreements that could ultimately lead to the principle of universality's being applied should be postponed or dealt with very simply, without acrimony of any sort. Declaring a truce in the verbal war that has taken place year after year and that has presented no new argument to the point that we have heard them so often we might say that we know all the arguments by rote-would be a service to the United Nations and to the peoples which have most directly lived through those antagonisms for the last few years.\n88.\tWe must point out that the mere increase in the Members of the United Nations, although bringing in new forces, and probably new ideas for the treatment of problems, is not in itself a solution to the great pending problems themselves. However, it is a better basis on which to deal with those problems than the present one. If we do some honest stocktaking, we would have to recognize that the United Nations has been absent, or has only participated very incidentally, in the most critical problems in the last few years. Even arrangements for the achievement of universality have been carried out outside the United Nations through bilateral or multilateral negotiations. The United Nations should have participated in explorations and negotiations taking place that will in the future lead to the admission of new Members. Thus, not only would we strengthen the concept of the United Nations presence, but by positive action we would also assist the world in achieving the objectives and principles of the Charter. Probably for technical reasons-but we might be well advised to try to overcome them through political initiatives and with the agreement of the interested parties-the United Nations has been absent from the entire problem of Indo-China.\n89.\tOn the other hand, its activity in the Middle East has been significant, but in the last few months has had to yield to bilateral diplomacy. We note an atmosphere of detente, of lowering of guards, of diminution of tension, and to contribute to that atmosphere we might set some very difficult problems aside for a while. This, of course, does not mean that we will forget them nor that we have solved them; but merely to give breathing space, a precious time in which to study them and also allow the United Nations to contribute, with its prestige and its peacemaking resources, to their ultimate solution.\n90.\tObviously, it still holds true that the golden rule to be applied in the solution of all international problems is direct negotiation, and in these cases, with the assistance of the United Nations. Certain situations cannot be improvised, we cannot artificially create states of mind, but we can yearn for those periods when, carried by the favorable breezes of history, the United Nations played a pioneer role in many of the fields of international relations, and, with its faith and its spirit, spurred on the crusade for peace and economic and social development, and was felt in the farthest corners of the world.\n91.\tAmong the different causes for the weakness of the United Nations, some political and even academic circles in many developed countries, point to the imbalance between real power and the number of States; that is to say, the majority decisions on the one hand, with majorities composed generally of smaller States, and strength or power on the other primarily an economic strength but also military power. This judgment defines the measure of the problems of the international community in terms of Realpolitik and the traditional balance of power. Yet, neither Realpolitik nor that balance of power inspired the Charter, except where the first left its imprint on the structure of the Security Council. But the United Nations was conceived along certain progressive lines of international law, such as the legal equality of States, cooperation with the international community, the peaceful settlement of disputes. Other principles, such as justice, although mentioned, did not hold sufficient sway. Yet the field was left open for work to be done in the reorganization of the international community through the principles of true distributive justice. Thus, the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction [resolution 2749 (XXV)} and the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] constitute important milestones. They can perhaps be improved upon--they may perhaps be strengthened in terms of trade relations and of the new regime of the oceans.\n92.\tInternational law must necessarily establish a single yardstick for international relations, and it responds to the process of humanization of all institutions, as well as the growing process of rationalization. Within this process, to \nsurrender to Realpolitik and balance of power is tantamount to abandoning the process of humanization and rationalization, and therefore means surrendering the long- range interests and the projections for the future to the petty interests of the moment. In domestic law great efforts and significant progress have been made in the curbing of power. In the international field, although belatedly, these efforts show the progressive line of the development of mankind and can only be achieved through a legal order based on principles that rest on the concept of humanization and rationalization. Of course, peace and security are basic values in this entire picture, but as we progress along those lines, it becomes obvious that true peace can only rest on justice and that the type of justice that must govern international relations is proportionate justice which the ancients termed 'distributive justice'.\n93.\tObviously we cannot in a few years expect to change the habits and views of centuries and traditionally we have considered expediency from the unilateral and short-range view of each State. The type of society created by science and technology has changed the systems of traditional interests and we have come to an interrelation of all of them. However, we still measure and judge our relations on the basis of the old models, thus international activity, and in particular that of international organizations, is sadly unbalanced when confronted by the realities of the present-day world. With its undeniable weaknesses, the United Nations is an irreplaceable instrument allowing the international community to rationalize its relations, to enable new principles of distributive justice to gain ground, and to base peace and security on concrete foundations, not simply on the inert maintenance of the status quo ante. It would be deplorable for us to surrender to those who still survive from the period when the rights of States coincided with their strength. Traditionally, men have always sought a better city than that in which they live, and the passage of time has proved that that sought-after city is not one of dreams, but the one that becomes reality in the course of time. Therefore, we must not yield to the past or to the vices of the present, we must look to the world-city, built on the control of power, the true understanding that peace\nit\tand prosperity are one and indivisible, and that there are obligations derived from sharing this planet-earth.\n94.\tAs the United Nations increases its membership, it is merely following the lines drawn by its Charter, be these new Members great or small; it is gradually achieving universality and putting to work all the peoples of the world together. Right is not measured by might and it is to be hoped that, in the world concert, Governments will carry out the difficult and laborious apprenticeship of rationalizing their decisions, which does not mean that they need ignore their own interests, but rather that they should discern the existence of common and long-range interests that must prevail over the immediate ones. The weakness of the United Nations does not lie with the increasing number of its Members, many of them extremely small, but with the fact that it has allowed the policy of balance of power to replace the policy of collective security, and that it has been satisfied with programs of economic and social development conceived somehow within the old concepts that recent history has shown to be insufficient or inadequate. The developed countries have refused to make the change to make of development a truly common undertaking and to consider the development of other countries as an international and national objective, on the understanding that, even from the standpoint of economic interests, the development of the third world will increase the prosperity of the developed countries themselves.\n95.\tThe executive power of the United Nations lies with the Security Council, but the Council is paralyzed because the policy of balance of power has replaced the policy of collective security; in it, it is the lowest common denominator that is sought by voiding resolutions of any significant sections and using oracular language which allows of contradictory interpretations and can thus satisfy even the most opposed interests. And thus has been created a new irt in the drafting of resolutions which touch on all possible points but have carefully built-in curbs. This art might be praiseworthy if it led to a solution of the problems; but not only do the problems persist, but, what is worse, they become aggravated.\n96.\tWith regard to the increase in the membership of certain bodies of the United Nations, we must point out that, although this does respond to the desire for greater representation and is thus very valuable, we cannot see in it the panacea that will revitalize all these organs. Thus, the proposal to raise to 54 the number of the members of the Economic and Social Council is important since it would make that Council more representative and would establish the balance between its composition and the number of Members of the United Nations, which in the last years has increased considerably. But the Economic and Social Council can be invigorated only by the will of its Members; and we ought not to try to invigorate it at the expense of activities which are being carried out by other bodies of the United Nations, such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development fUNCTADJ. We can quite justifiably fear that the transfer of competence from UNCTAD to the Council may decrease ks effectiveness, since UNCTAD is an organ of the United Nations with exclusive competence, with true specialization, and it is largely due to this that it can render services to the international community. To transfer these powers to a Council that has a very wide competence, might reduce those powers and water them down. If the price of the increase of membership of the Economic and Social Council is to water down the specific and specialized activities of UNCTAD, my Government would not be ready to pay that price.\n97.\tThe twenty-fifth session of the United Nations was very significant because of the declarations adopted. At least some of them have blazed new trails in the history of international relations: the Strategy for the Second Development Decade, the Declaration on the principles on the sea-bed, the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] and the resolution on basic principles for the protection of civilian populations in armed conflicts [resolution 2675 (XXV)].\n98.\tBut the twenty-sixth regular session of the General Assembly is one in which the United Nations might well take a new tack in specific areas. It may well be that, at the present session, for the first time in the history of the United Nations, the first concrete steps towards disarmament may be taken, in this case as far as biological weapons are concerned, because what has occurred thus far with all \nthe treaties that deal with armaments is that none of them has been truly one of disarmament but only preventive agreements to stop the build-up of potential arms, therefore their scope has been very limited, and they all fall within the framework of the policy of the balance of power. This is the year of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on Namibia and this, too, is a milestone in the treatment of decolonization.\n99.\tThe achievements of the United Nations in economic, social and legal questions are undeniable. Of course, this does not free the United Nations of its political responsibilities, particularly with regard to peace and security.\n100.\tThe trend to justify the United Nations for its technical achievements is questionable, although I would not want to underestimate their importance. But the United Nations was not created as an entity to solve technical problems, but rather to take full advantage of technology to achieve its greatest objectives: peace and security based on development, human rights and distributive international justice.\n101.\tThe famous policy, the International Development Strategy, suffered a set-back in the last few days, and it is precisely the developing countries that have been squeezed between the rivalries and antagonisms of the great developed countries.\n102.\tWe understand the problems of balance of payments, for they are not the monopoly of a few countries; however, the defensive measures of the United States have been extended to the exports from the developing countries and include their first few manufactured goods. Yet the problem of the balance of payments of the United States is not primarily caused by the importing of such merchandise from those countries.\n103.\tIt has been said that one cannot discriminate and that therefore protectionist measures must apply equally to all countries. This argument should be examined in the light of the realities of the international community of today, and among these realities we should stress the following: first, the growing ties among all countries that are becoming partners in a great common undertaking; secondly, a defined policy of international development-United Nations documents, the strategies for the first and Second Development Decades; and thirdly unanimous international agreements and efforts, which take into consideration the particular situation of the developing countries.\n104.\tSpecial arrangements arrived at by these countries have never been called discriminatory. On the contrary, they respond to the very normal and reasonable agreement that rules and accords are adapted to the circumstances they are intended to deal with. If there is a world program and a defined program to encourage development, if we even speak of transferring 1 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries, it is inconsistent to raise tariff barriers to the incipient exports from those countries, when it is through those exports that they are strengthening their economy and paying salaries that will allow them to create their domestic markets and therefore allow the vertical development to which they aspire.\n105.\tBut today's case is not the only one that can be looked at. Any other day it may be another industrialized country, or a war of tariffs might be unleashed or retaliatory measures might be adopted. As developing countries, we wish and we have the right to be protected\nthe conflicts and problems confronting the developed countries. And in this we do not discriminate, we do not ask for capricious concessions; what we ask for are political coherence and adaptation to the norms of reality. This may soon pass, but it is a tocsin which announces the problem, it is an alarm and should be considered coldly before new decisions are taken by other countries.\n106.\tMy country proposes that the appropriate bodies of the United Nations, without trying to antagonize any country in particular, should examine the specific case of protectionist measures that might be decreed by industrialized countries. Together with other declarations and as a means of ensuring effectiveness for the doctrine of the Development Strategy, it should be proclaimed that the developing countries shall not be affected by such measures and countermeasures adopted by the industrialized countries.\n107.\tOf course, in order to have a firm starting-point in dealing with world problems, we have to begin with our own home and neighborhood. We cannot act. appropriately in the solution of foreign problems when we overlook those that beset us at home, and we have to begin with our own, that is, by seeking the full potential of each and every country and State. Therefore, if we express an interest in peace and security all over the world, it is because we are ready to seek and establish peace and security on a firm and just bas in our own region.\n108.\tThe preservation of peoples and States today calls for a dynamism and requirements that have been increased by technological society. Only in movement, in the exercise and expression of our wills, can we maintain the health of our political bodies. And today the way in which this domestic consolidation is possible is by understanding and by co-ordinating interests into progressively widening spheres from the sub-region to the region and so to the world, and in the case of my own country from the region of Central America to the Latin American continent and then to world organizations. Without resorting to rhetoric here, we may say that preservation requires movement, the discovery of our own personality, the understanding of other personalities, the establishment of an historic affirmation of our own existence and a recognition of how closely we must work and collaborate with other peoples.\n109.\tThe great word that has polarized wills and rationalized national and international activities is \\\"development\\\". Development is the main component of peace and security and can only be achieved through two major resources which are: negotiation and agreement and a sense of justice in harmonizing the interests of all and in making the fullest use of the products and the benefits of regional and world co-operation. The best way of preserving the international personality of peoples and of preserving their identity lies in their active and responsible contribution in the different geographic, historic and cultural spheres in which they find themselves as a result of many vicissitudes and historical events which they were unable to avoid and cannot reshape.\n110.\tAlthough development is intended for these purposes, today it hinges on at least three decisive factors: first, a thorough understanding of all the developing countries without any restrictions based on spheres of culture or geography; second, the creation of great integrated zones, and third, the capacity of the developed countries to understand the problems of the third world as also being their own, in a true perspective of time, history, solidarity and particularly of justice.\n111.\tFor the first factor to express its constructive presence the solidarity of all countries in the developing sphere is required, that is, all those that constitute the so-called Group of 77. The forthcoming meeting in Lima might well be a milestone, not only in restoring understanding among the \\\"77\\\" themselves, but in making it even deeper as a consequence of finding the common character of their interests and the strengthening of negotiations, which is the cement that binds them together. We believe that international agreements must not continue to consider all developing countries as in the same position; they must recognize the relative differences among them and therefore norms have to be established that will give more to those who have less, and therefore carry out that distributive international justice among the third world nations that we call for from the developed countries.\n112.\tWith regard to the programs of integration, it is the firm and definitive opinion of my Government that this is the only way of ensuring decorous survival in this period of accelerated technology. Every day we delay integration means a postponement in meeting the elementary needs of our people and diverts us from enjoying economic and social welfare and the possibility of ensuring our peoples their education and development.\n113.\tEl Salvador knows that it is its mission to integrate with its neighbors. In Central America we have come to the point where new, irrevocable and profound decisions of integration which will have to be made-not only to cover the trade aspects as in the past, but also political, social, and international matters. Experience has taught us that purely economic agreements have been shattered for lack of the political and legal organs of machinery to deal with them. It was nevertheless a useful experience, and for 10 years it allowed the Central Americans to take full advantage of the benefits of horizontal development. But only with vertical development, which increases the productive and consumer capacity of the people, their level of education and their handling of technology, can they keep up with the progress of other countries and regions. Therefore, El Salvador is ready to form part of the Central American community, with all the social, political and economic obligations involved, as a preliminary step to our integration within the Latin American community, and of course with the firm purpose and prospect of organizing responsible spokesmen and participants in efforts with other regions and peoples of the world to strengthen the international community in accordance with the up-to-date terms of the Charter.\n114.\tThe problems of the last few years in the Central American region which, by dint of slow and patient effort, are being smoothed out through direct contacts will show a completely different picture of the Central American community.\n115, The sorrows, the anxiety and all the sequels of harm that were left behind by discord and in general the loss of perspective in international relations, lead to reflection and to the understanding of the situation, and therefore ineluctably we are taught by history that we have mutual respect, justice and a reasonable understanding of the interests of the parties concerned.\n116 Within that completely new dimension of the Central American community, which for political, geographical and sentimental reasons must include the sister republic of Panama, El Salvador feels constrained in this forum to speak up in solidarity with the legitimate aspirations of the people of Panama that the Canal Treaty signed in 1903, be renegotiated on a more just basis which will recognize the full sovereignty of Panama over all its territory, and we trust that such claims will be heard by the great Power which, in accordance with the wise declaration of its historic leaders, finds its raison d'itre not only in liberty but also in law and justice.\n117.\tWith regard to the dependence of development on the understanding of the great countries, we have made some progress but we are far from having met with the true awareness that, in promoting the development of all the regions of the world, the super-industrialized nations are also promoting their own development. In this field the work of the United Nations has been significant since it allows this and other problems to be defined, permits their continued study and the establishment of organs and machinery for global negotiations. The dismantling of UNCTAD would be an obviously backward step in the programs of the United Nations and would be the greatest setback that the developing countries might suffer.\n118.\tThe United Nations is about to adopt decisions which will have a great impact on the immediate future of the international community. It could be hoped that the effectiveness of the considerably delayed principle of universality might be carried out without exclusions or reprisals or, in other words, what it gains on the one hand, it should not lose on the other, or to speak more specifically, my Government believes that we should preserve the representation of the Republic of China in the United Nations for it is one of the realities of the contemporary world.\n119.\tThe admission of Bahrain, Qatar, Bhutan and Oman was fully supported by us. To these new Members and to their representatives we offer the best expressions of friendship of the people and Government of El Salvador. Their presence confirms the universal vocation of the United Nations. We trust that we will be able to work with these new Members of our Organization on the basis of the greatest cordiality and in full co-operation.\n120.\tIn brief, El Salvador reaffirms its unshakable purpose to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Charter and the establishment of an increasingly interdependent international community, motivated by a feeling of impregnable solidarity and with a vocation for justice as the basis for peace and security.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t  It is a pleasure for me to extend to you the warmest congratulations of the Finnish Government on your election to your high office. We know you as an Asian statesman of great experience and devotion to the cause of peace and cooperation among nations. We are confident that under your leadership the General Assembly will function effectively and harmoniously.\n2.\tI also wish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the outgoing President, Edvard Hambro of Norway, whose performance during his term of office was a source of pride for all of us in the Nordic community of nations.\n3.\tAt the same time, let me pay a tribute on behalf of the Finnish Government to our distinguished Secretary General, UThant. For ten years he has served this Organization with selfless devotion. His untiring work in the cause of peace and justice and his moral courage have earned him the respect and gratitude of all Member States.\n4.\tWe are meeting today in the midst of exceptionally profound and rapid change in international relations. The very structure of the world scene is being transformed before our eyes, In such a period of transition doubts and uncertainties often prevail. But this time the dominant feeling is one of encouragement and hope.\n5.\tIn Europe, in particular, there is hope today that the process of reconciliation set in motion by the treaties signed last year between the Soviet Union and Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany will bring about stable and peaceful conditions in which the use of force between States can be ruled out, and in which friendly cooperation could continuously increase. This European development, while not formally before this General Assembly, cannot fail to have a worldwide impact. Twice in our lifetime Europe has been the source of a war that has engulfed the entire world, and still today, 25 years after the end of the Second World War, Europe remains the scene of the deadliest concentration of modern weapons in history. The unsettled state of affairs in Europe has been one of the central causes of international tension. Stability in Europe therefore will remove a major threat to world peace.\n6.\tFinland has worked actively for the cause of European reconciliation. It will be recalled that the Finnish Government has offered to act as host for a conference on European security and cooperation in which all European Governments as well as the Governments of the United States and Canada would participate. We have also suggested that multilateral consultations in preparation for such a conference could take place in Helsinki. The favorable trend in European developments exemplified by the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin  encourages us to believe that our suggestion can soon be accepted by all concerned.\n7.\tThis trend has also encouraged us to take a new initiative on the German question, the central issue that has divided Europe for the past quarter century. It has been Finnish policy to refrain from recognizing either the German Democratic Republic or the Federal Republic of Germany, while in practice maintaining equal relations with both. This policy has been dictated by our desire to avoid taking sides in the dispute between the great Powers on the German question. As the confrontation between the great Powers on Germany is losing its sharp edges, and in anticipation of an understanding between them, the Finnish Government has approached both German Governments with a proposal for a comprehensive arrangement of relations between Finland and the two German States, with a view to establishing diplomatic relations with both, based on a mutual renunciation of the use of force and recognition on the part of the two German States of Finland's neutrality. We believe that this initiative will contribute to the emerging new peaceful order in Europe.\nA/PV.1941\n8.\tOur activity on behalf of European security and cooperation is firmly rooted in Finland's policy of neutrality. We have sought and I believe we have succeeded  to safeguard our security and the prosperity of our people by keeping aloof from the conflicts and controversies between the great Powers. But in today's world, national security cannot be divorced from the maintenance of international security. Accordingly, neutrality can no longer remain a(negative concept. It must also mean active participation in efforts to keep the peace and to promote \ncooperation between nations. It enables us to maintain friendly relations with all nations across the dividing lines of military alliances or ideological blocs, and thus to render useful services to the cause of international conciliation.\n9.\tThe recognition and confidence which our policy of neutrality has received from all sides has encouraged the Finnish Government to put forward, with the support of the other Nordic States, the candidature of our representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Max Jakobson, for the post of SecretaryGeneral of this Organization, The Finnish Government has full confidence in his personal integrity and professional competence, and we have been gratified by the wide support his candidature has received in all parts of the world.\n10.\tAs a small, neutral Country, Finland looks upon the United Nations primarily as an instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security, and we welcomed the unanimous adoption by the General Assembly last year of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] as an expression of the collective wj'l of Member States to make this Organization more effective for this purpose, Finland for its part is prepared to continue to do its full share in efforts to improve the capabilities of the United Nations to make peace and to keep the peace.\n11.\tA first essential step in that direction, in our view, is to make this a truly universal organization. We hope and believe that it will be possible during this session of the General Assembly to achieve important progress in that direction.\n12.\tWe are confident that the Assembly will now at last decide to restore the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, which Finland has consistently supported, and we shall oppose any move that might obstruct or delay the entry of the People's Republic.\n13.\tWe are also confident that the process of European reconciliation now in progress will soon snable the two German States to enter into the United Nations as new Members. Such an outcome would significantly strengthen the Organization.\n14.\tFurther, the time has come, in our view, to put an end, after more than 20 years, to the fruitless debate about the rights and wrongs of the Korean conflict and to make every effort to enable both North Korea and South Korea to take part in international cooperation as Members of the United Nations.\n15.\tAs for the question of VietNam, I wish to state once again the firm conviction of the Finnish Government that lasting peace in that area can only be achieved through a political solution ensuring the right of the VietNamese people freely to determine their own future and to be represented in the United Nations. We in Finland welcome the continued withdrawal of American troops from the area and fervently hope that the war in 3ndoChina will be brought to a speedy end. With the entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations, it may become possible for this Organisation to play a constructive role in the restoration of peaceful conditions and the reconstruction of the region after the devastations of the prolonged war,\n16.\tI realize, of course, that universality by itself solves nothing. On the contrary, the entry into this Organization of several important nations will require a period of adjustment; but this will be adjustment to reality, and the sooner it is done the better for the United Nations. At least it will then be possible to use the Organization effectively for the purpose for which it was created: as a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of the purposes of the Charter and, above all, for dealing with all the urgent problems affecting international security.\n17.\tIn the case of the Middle East, the framework for the establishment of a just and lasting peace has already been created through the use of the United Nations. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) provides for a comprehensive political solution of the conflict between Israel and the Arab States, a solution adopted by virtually the entire international community as its guide to the problem. The Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral to the Middle East, Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, is ready to assist in carrying out that solution. Other United Nations services, such as peacekeeping forces, can surely be made available whenever needed.\n18.\tNevertheless, the peacemaking process has come to a standstill. While we welcome the fact that no major fighting has occurred between Israel and the Arab States for more than a year, we cannot fail to express grave concern about the lack of progress towards a peaceful settlement. This session of the General Assembly provides an opportunity for the reactivation of the Jarring mission, and we hope that it will be used constructively before it is too late.\n19.\tThe vast human tragedy caused by the events in East Pakistan has deeply moved the people in my country, as everywhere else in the world. Finland has already contributed and will continue to contribute to the efforts of the United Nations and other international organizations to bring humanitarian aid to those in need, to the refugees in India as well as to the distressed population in East Pakistan. We hope that conditions in East Pakistan could soon be improved so as to put an end to the flow of refugees and enable those who have fled to return home.\n20.\tThe urgent demands of acute conflicts and crises in different parts of the world should not lead us to overlook the grave potential dangers arising from the continued repression of the black people in South Africa, Namibia and Southern Rhodesia, as well as the denial of the right to self-determination of the peoples living in the Portuguese Territories in Africa. United Nations efforts to bring about, a change in southern Africa have so far had little effect. It must be admitted that we have reached a dead end in dealing with these issues. This must not deter us from making a new, determined effort to find constructive and effective means by which the international community could influence the course of events in southern Africa, It is essential, in our view, that the interest and energies of the great Powers be more fully engaged in this effort.\n21.\tIn this connexion I wish to emphasize the importance of the advisory opinion recently given by the International\nCourt of Justice on the legal consequences of South , Africa's continued presence in Namibia.  The illegality of that presence has now been clearly established by the highest judicial authority of the international community. The advisory opinion, which was requested on the initiative of the Finnish Government, should .provide the Security Council and the General Assembly with a fresh incentive to consider a new approach to the question of Namibia.\n22.\tThe strengthening of international security cannot be limited to efforts to contain and extinguish existing conflicts. It is essential to take preventive action by strengthening the machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes and peacekeeping. The United Nations is the principal instrument available to nations for this purpose. It is, therefore, an urgent necessity that the financial difficulties of the Organization be speedily overcome. It is equally important to reach agreement without delay on guidelines for future peacekeeping operations.\n23.\tDisarmament and arms control measures are also essential parts of international efforts to keep the peace. It is often said that real disarmament is not possible before greater mutual trust has been established between the leading Powers. In practice, however, we have seen that disarmament and arms control measures tend to contribute to the creation of  mutual trust. In this regard, the talks between the Soviet Union and the United States on strategic arms limitations, held alternately in Helsinki and Vienna, are of crucial importance. It is one of the encouraging features of the present international situation that there now seems to be real hope of agreement between the two Powers on a first treaty on strategic arms limitation. Even an initial treaty of limited scope would have great significance, both in itself and in promoting confidence between the two most powerful nations in the world. It would also give a fresh impetus for continued negotiations with a view to agreeing on more comprehensive limitations with regard to strategic weapons.\n24.\tAt the same time it must be recognized that the continued arms race poses grave danger to all nations, large and small, whatever their military capabilities. The consequences of nuclear war, once unleashed, would respect no national boundaries. Disarmament requires a truly universal effort. We believe therefore that the proposal of the Soviet Government for a world disarmament conference [Af8491J deserves the serious attention of the General Assembly.\n25.\tThe Finnish Government also welcomes the progress made in the disarmament negotiations at Geneva concerning biological and chemical weapons. The ban on production and possession of biological and toxic weapons, which is now the subject of a draft convention [A/8457 DC/234, annex AJ should in our view be followed up as soon as possible by a ban on chemical weapons.\n26.\tThe Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has performed a valuable service to the United Nations by preparing a number of important arms control agreements.\nIt is in our view of ever greater importance, however, that a way be found by which all the nuclear Powers could be brought into a continuous negotiating process on disarmament, They do after all bear a special responsibility for the maintenance of world peacc.\n27.\tLast year, as the General Assembly approved the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], an important step was taken towards a higher degree of integration in the international efforts towards progress and prosperity. The implementation of that program is a challenging task and my Government, for its part, has already taken several steps in order to fulfill its obligations, in the field of both trade and development cooperation.\n28.\tIn this context we feel that, in order to be able to discharge successfully its responsibility, the United Nations must be prepared to make certain adjustments in its organizational structure, A larger number of countries must be engaged in this effort that encompasses so many different facets of development with important differences in accent in various parts of the globe. Science and technology cannot be fully harnessed to speed up the development process unless a suitable institutional framework for intergovernmental cooperation is created.\n29.\tThe international community cannot do more than assist the developing nations in their own efforts. The solution to their problems is in their own hands. They themselves have to establish their priorities and choose their own patterns of progress and development. But there are issues of importance vital to the entire world community. Two among the most important ones are the population question and the acceleration of food production. Although these issues are highly interdependent, they should not be treated in isolation from others. They are in many ways intertwined with such economic and social issues as health, urbanization, industrialization and international trade, just to mention a few.\n30.\tUnplanned development, a single-minded sectoral approach to economic growth without full sense of responsibility for the indirect consequences, has led in many countries to a situation where the qualitative aspects of life are jeopardized. The awakening that has taken place during the very last few years in this matter has not yet manifested itself in full-scale international cooperation. But the urgency of the matter has already been fully realized by this Organization and, we consequently, expect much of the forthcoming United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held at Stockholm in 1972.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.    In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.\n2.\tSir, the delegation of Saudi Arabia would like to take this opportunity to express its gratification at your election to the presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We have always looked upon the Indonesian people as our own brothers. It is no wonder, therefore, that my Government takes pride in your having been elected to preside over the deliberations of th- 'international community. You had been a leader in your country even before Indonesia became independent, about two decades ago. Thereafter, you have indeed been identified with wise policies in your country. Furthermore, it was my personal privilege not only to have known you personally but to have been associated with you in policies of great import to the world Muslim community. It was not surprising that you have been so admired and respected as to win the unanimous support of the Members of this Organization.\n3.\tThis session of the General Assembly augurs especially well for Saudi Arabia. Several sister Arab States have been admitted to membership in the United Nations, and while Bhutan is not an immediate neighbor of my country, we were equally happy to see that State, situated in the heart of Asia, the mother of continents, take its rightful seat as a Member of this Organization.\n4.\tMy delegation would like to express its appreciation for the efficient manner with which your predecessor, Edvard Hambro, presided over the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, which was a milestone in the history of the United Nations.\n5.\tNo statement of ours from this rostrum should fail to refer to the exemplary role which our illustrious Secretary- General, U Thant, has played for a decade during which he fully dedicated himself in his endeavor to safeguard the high principles and lofty ideals of our Organization. We can never forget how vigilant we found him to be when, on several occasions, political crisis threatened world peace, and we still remember how diligently he used his good offices to avert many an international conflict.\n6.\tIn discharging his duties, his health was bound to suffer once in a while, and inasmuch as we are solicitous about his personal welfare, we do hope that he may still be able to continue in his office until the international community could unanimously agree on a successor.\n7.\tYear in year out, as time marches on, we have found ourselves still seized of the same major problems to which we have not been able to find satisfactory solutions, notwithstanding the unflagging efforts exerted towards that end. Why is it that we have not made significant progress on many issues that have engrossed the United Nations since its early years? Is it due to the lack of goodwill amongst men who shape the policies of their respective States? There is no dearth of good intentions amongst many leaders in the world.\n8.\tWhat, then, is at the root of the failure which is apt to dampen the ardent spirit of the people at large who expect our Organization to be the guarantor of world peace? The answer is not very difficult to find. The lack of progress in paving the way to peace whenever then is war and conflict or strife and turmoil might be attributed to the fact that, unfortunately, many politicians wielding power pay lip- service to the United Nations Charter whilst they doggedly pursue their narrow national interests.\n9.\tIt is such self-seeking policies that caused the League of Nations to founder. Is it not high time that we should learn by avoiding the mistakes of the not-too-distant past? The covenant of the League of Nations spoke of liberty and freedom. The United Nations Charter enshrined the principle of self-determination. What actually happened was that the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 had granted Mandates over many peoples to erstwhile colonial Powers, aside from gerrymandering the map of Europe with new boundaries\nregardless of the consent and aspirations of various ethnic groups. It was these arbitrary arrangements, concocted by the victors of the First World War, that largely contributed to the factors that undermined the Versailles Peace Treaty and led to the Second World War.\n10.\tDid the victors of the Second World War profit by the lessons of history? Not at all. For we find them committing more serious blunders before and after the Charter was proclaimed at San Francisco. To illustrate concretely what has happened, we have only to cite the partition of Korea, the partition of Germany, the partition and zoning of Berlin all this on ideological grounds without due regard to the ethnological homogeneity of these peoples and countries.\n11.\tBut the blunders committed after the Charter had been proclaimed were even worse. Palestine was partitioned in 1947 as if the right of peoples to self-determination was merely ink on paper. Viet-Nam was partitioned in 1954 to suit the strategic interests of great Powers in the region, with the result that a people with the same language and culture became divided, and brothers were incited to slit one another's throat.\n12.\tNo one should be astonished why such major problems as I have mentioned are still besetting us in this Organization without our having made headway towards their solution. At the root of our difficulties lies the fact that the States which wield world power, unfortunately, still predicate their respective national policies on the balance of power and on incessant endeavors on their part to maintain supremacy in what they consider their spheres of influence.\n13.\tThe pursuit of such policies that have caused many wars since the dawn of civilization compels contesting Powers to emulate one another in armaments and thereby resort to devising new lethal weapons, hoping thus to maintain an advantage over their adversaries. Hence, the interminable race in escalating armaments at the expense of the masses who are compelled to contribute hard-earned funds for what may end up in the profession of killing or getting killed in the name of liberty, justice and self- defense.\n14.\tMy delegation is far from so presumptuous as to address itself to the nearly 100 items inscribed on the agenda of the current session, inasmuch as, no doubt, each item is of special importance to a group of Member States, if not to the whole United Nations. It therefore becomes understandable that I may be permitted to dwell in this statement on those items of the agenda that deeply concern the Government and people of Saudi Arabia.\n15.\tThe situation in the Middle East is still paramount so far as we are concerned. We can never keep silent about the injustice that has been perpetrated on the indigenous people of Palestine since 1947 and thereafter till the present day.\n16.\tThe usurpation of the Palestinian homeland by European Jews on the grounds that God Almighty had given them the land is untenable as long as, by the grace of God, the deep feeling that this injustice should be undone still surges in the breasts of 110 million Arabs and 600 million Moslems, who feel that it is their sacred duty to save the Palestinians as a people from national annihilation.\n17.\tThe arrogance of the Zionist usurpers knows no bounds. It is an insult to human intelligence for them to act as if they were the chosen people of God to the exclusion of everybody else. While the United Nations incessantly decries racial discrimination or the superiority of one religion or sect over the other, these Zionists unabashedly endeavor to seek privileges on religious grounds.\n18.\tBut this is not all. These European Zionists have even pieced themselves above the Sephardic Jews, who, unfortunately, have become victims of Zionism by being looked upon as second-class citizens in usurped Palestine. Truly, such flagrant racial discrimination stops at no limits. It is not strange, therefore, that Zionists consider that the Arabs, together with all the gentiles in the world, should belong to a lower stratum of the human creation. It is the most despicable effrontery for the Zionists to engage in such sordid racial discrimination.\n19.\tIf the Zionists persist in claiming that the question of Jerusalem is non-negotiable, let me make it unmistakably clear that we, Arabs and Moslems, will in time, with God's help, sacrifice ourselves to redeem Jerusalem and all the Palestinian homeland from colonial invaders who have constituted a foreign element in our midst. This fact explains the state of perpetual war, the high tensions and anarchic upheavals in the whole region of the Middle East. That is why the clash of interests between Powers, big and small, will definitely lead to a global holocaust, if injustice is allowed to prevail while the United Nations merely stands by as a helpless witness to this unprecedented tragedy.\n20.\tWhat authorities other than the usurping Zionists would dare consistently to defy the decisions of the United Nations and ignore the innumerable condemnatory resolutions adopted against them since the United Nations unjustly admitted them to its membership?\n21.\tIf the major Powers that in 1947 were responsible for the creation of this artificial Zionist State refuse to act in the face of these defiant usurpers, I am afraid we may all end up by losing faith in the effectiveness of this Organization.\n22.\tWe are not boasting of what the Arabs and Moslems may one day be able to do, nor is it our intention to arouse the fears of the world community by what we say on this question from the rostrum of the United Nations.\n23.\tPalestine lies astride the routes of three continents and, as such, was and still is being coveted by foreign invaders who throughout history had thought they could keep it permanently as the prize of conquest. Where are those invaders now? With the exception of the present non-Semitic usurpers, the Khazars, who were converted to Judaism, they are no more.\n24.\tWe would like to ask, will the General Assembly and in particular the Security Council remain helpless in the face of Zionist aggression? Will the United Nations act or allow the situation in the Middle East to deteriorate to such an extent that no remedy may be found except in eventual armed conflicts until the aggressor is curbed and ultimately expelled? We can hardly add more to this grave warning, which we hope will be heeded before it becomes too late.\n25.\tOur stand on the remnants of colonial rule and on questions of racial discrimination will again be made clear in the appropriate Committees of the General Assembly, where these items will be fully debated. We may venture to make certain suggestions and recommendations that we hope will contribute constructively towards finding some satisfactory solutions.\n26.\tMy having dwelt on the situation in the Middle East, as I have done, should not at all be construed to mean that the Government of Saudi Arabia is not concerned with other momentous questions that will be dealt with during the present session.\n27.\tAs we said we would do in regard to colonial and racial problems, my delegation will define its position on the multifarious items that have been allocated to the agendas of the various Committees of the General Assembly.\n28.\tThe Government of Saudi Arabia strongly deplores any interference in the domestic affairs of Pakistan. We believe what is happening in Pakistan is strictly and without any doubt the affair of the Pakistanis themselves, and therefore any outside interference in the internal affairs of Pakistan will surely constitute a violation of our Charter. We may be allowed to remind all the indigenous peoples of the Indian subcontinent that they are brothers regardless of the diversity of cultures, languages and religions in that region. We particularly appeal to them to respect each other's political integrity and to exert all efforts to avoid what may cause a rift in their political structures. We have been assured by Pakistan that it would welcome the repatriation of refugees that are now on Indian soil; and from the various declarations that have been made we have no doubt that Pakistan is eager to see the refugees return home to live with their brothers under the same flag. The Pakistani Government has repeatedly assured us that it will spare no effort to ensure their progress and security.\n29.\tBefore bringing these words to a close, and without having to reiterate in detail what I mentioned at past sessions, I feel that it would be appropriate to refer to the continued progress achieved in Saudi Arabia under the leadership of His Majesty King Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz in the economic, social and cultural spheres. In this respect, I can do no better than to repeat a quotation from a speech made by His Majesty in clarifying our policy. Addressing the Saudi people, His Majesty said:\n\u201cBrothers, this State was built on strong foundations. Firstly, it was built on the foundation of Islam; secondly, on the foundation of administering and spreading justice among citizens whereby King and citizens stand equal before the law; thirdly, on the foundation of making education available to all and raising the country to a proper standard of living.\u201d\n30.\tFinally, I pray God Almighty to guide us along the right path so that we may succeed in our efforts during this session to reach those goals which may lead the world to greater prosperity, lasting peace and security.\n\n\n\n"

Your election to this high office is all the more gratifying to us not only because we both come from the same region but also because Indonesia is our next-door neighbor. My country therefore derives some vicarious pleasure from being able to bask in reflected glory. As for your qualities of leadership and statesmanship, these have been amply demonstrated in the many years you have devoted towards the creation of an independent and progressive Indonesia. Equally notable has been the single-mindedness with which you have espoused the cause of regional co-operation by helping to establish the Association of South-East Asian Nations or ASEAN. It is therefore fitting that you should have been chosen to preside over one of the most important sessions in the history of our Organization.\n38.\tPermit me also, Sir. to pay a tribute to our distinguished Secretary-General, who has for 10 years been performing what has been described as the most impossible job in the world. His integrity, his dedication to the Charter and his techniques of quiet and patient diplomacy have added new dimensions to the office of Secretary-General. We are grateful to him for a decade of impeccable service to the United Nations, which we would have liked to see continue if it were possible.\n39.\tA depressing feature of our Organization has been the steady accumulation over the years of problems designated as unsolvable. We have consequently developed rigid conventions as to their treatment. Year in and year out these questions are solemnly unwrapped before this Assembly, given an airing and returned to the catacombs more or less undamaged.\n40.\tThe China question was one such unsolvable problem. For over two decades it was a \\\"must\\\" on our agenda.\nThough no solution was expected, it was nevertheless debated, if only to justify our expensive trips to New York. The speeches on the China question have over the years acquired the irrelevant abstruseness of debates by medieval European theologians wrangling over the number of angels who could dance on the point of a needle.\n41.\tNow, after 21 years, the log-jam has been broken. We are now very close to demonstrating that the unsolvable is solvable. This is a momentous discovery, and one of great significance to an Organization only too ready to be convinced that difficult problems are unsolvable. This happy outcome to the China problem would, I hope, at least shake our faith in the existence of unsolvable problems. Problems may be difficult, complex and delicate, but they are not unsolvable. This is because all the problems that come before this Assembly are wholly man-made and therefore well within the capacity of men to resolve.\n42.\tIf the China question, long accepted as unsolvable, can be solved, then so can the many other allegedly unsolvable problems which are now permanent fixtures of our agenda.\n43.\tThere is, for example, the war in Viet-Nam. It is a war that has continued more or less uninterrupted for some 30 years involving first the Japanese, then the French, and now the United States. But even here there is, at last, sound reason for optimism. The desultory talks in Paris and the United States decision to disengage as soon as possible from the war in Viet Nam are indications that the Viet-Nam problem is not unsolvable. It is senseless to persist in a war where clearly one side cannot defeat the other. It is an outrageous fact that more than half of the population now living in Viet-Nam was born in war and has never experienced peace.\n44.\tThe other apparently unsolvable problem is the tragic war in the Middle East. Here, too, there are grounds for at least qualified optimism. The area of agreement between the parties concerned has now been hopefully widened. My Government is well aware that there still exists a gap of suspicion and fear. But we believe that renewed war will not narrow the gap, and will most certainly erode the area of agreement so painfully and patiently broadened through peaceful negotiations.\n45.\tMy Government would like to reiterate that the Middle East conflict should be resolved through negotiations and on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n46.\tA more intractable problem which comes regularly before this Assembly is that of white racialism in South Africa and Rhodesia. The ritualistic condemnation of white racialism, though necessary, will not., it is now clear, by itself bring that evil to an end. Black Africa must first manifest a unity and strength sufficiently credible to compel white Africa to come to honorable terms with the Colored majority.\n47.\tHowever, the problem of white racialism must be understood and attacked within the wider context of racialism in general. It is a depressing fact that manifestations of racialism are no longer a simple conflict between\nthe white and black races. Racialism is increasingly becoming a world-wide plague. It afflicts not only the underdeveloped world but the developed world as well. We all know that there is oppression of blacks by whites. But there is also oppression of blacks by browns, of browns by blacks, of yellows by browns, of whites by whites, of browns by browns, and any other chromatic combination we care to think of.\n48.\tSo we of the third world cannot successfully fight white racialism if we ourselves indulge in that indefensible vice. Racial oppression cannot be fought on the basis of discrimination, as regards Color struggles.\n49.\tI do not wish to go through the list of many other allegedly unsolvable problems before us which we have accumulated over the years. The point I want to make is that the China problem demonstrates that, given the will, the irresistible can give way and the immovable can move. There are really no unsolvable human problems.\n50.\tThe participation of the People's Republic of China in the work of our Organization will at last make it truly representative of nearly all of humanity. The exclusion of some 700-800 million people-a quarter of mankind-from the community of world nations has not only made the United Nations that less representative of mankind but has also threatened international stability by compelling a quarter of mankind to work outside the framework of the United Nations. The danger becomes more compelling now that Communist China has emerged as a nuclear Power as well.\n51.\tI am well aware that the debate on the China issue at this session will not be all plain sailing. It was cold war considerations which had for so long kept Communist China out of this Organization. One should therefore not be unduly dismayed if, at its final stages, this question should still betray old fears and ancient animosities.\n52.\tBut we should not allow what is undoubtedly a triumph of common sense and wise diplomacy to be marred by efforts to present the final outcome as a triumph for one side or a capitulation by the other. Therefore I should like at this juncture to state my country's position in regard to the issue of China.\n53.\tWe have always maintained the view that the seat allocated to China should properly be occupied by the People's Republic of China. We also subscribe to the view that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of it. We can hold no other view, since the Governments of Peking and Taiwan themselves have consistently maintained this view. That being so, the status of Taiwan is a domestic matter to be settled by the people of China, including those of Taiwan.\n54.\tHaving said that, I should like to add that my delegation has no intention of joining in any denigration of a Government that has for 26 years represented China in this Organization. We may disagree as to whether it should have continued to represent mainland China after it lost control over it. But we cannot deny that during those 26 years it has discharged its responsibilities towards this Organization constructively, responsibly and judiciously.\n \n55.\tIt is for that reason that we regret very much that the Albanian draft resolution [AIL.630 and Add.l], with whose essential points we whole-heartedly agree, should contain elaborations that are unduly harsh and unnecessary.\n56.\tThe entry of the People's Republic of China into this Organization will make for a different kind of United Nations from the one we have known for the past 26 years. For the first time in 26 years the United Nations will feel the impact of new approaches and new attitudes to world problems. That will impose new strains on the Organization. New problems will emerge. But, most important of all, the politics of the United Nations will be dominated, not by two, but by three major nuclear Powers. That has great implications for the small nations, in particular those of the third world. Hitherto we have had to contend only with the ambitions and rivalries of two nuclear Powers. It was a difficult enough task for small nations not to be caught in the cross-fire. There were moments of great danger for us, and even a few casualties, as we learned through trial and error how to cope with the cold war of an essentially bipolar world. But over the years the small nations have learned how to deal with two Powers, just as the two great Powers have developed their own expertise in the art of coping with small nations.\n57.\tBut with the entry of China into the United Nations arena the familiar bipolar world comes to an end and with it the equilibrium-of-sorts that world has established. In other words, the cold war involving only two great Powers has come to an end. We now see looming ahead prospects of a new tri-polar cold war. Looking a little further ahead, it is more than possible that two other dormant Powers  Japan and a united Western Europe will enter the arena of great-Power struggle. They too will, as is natural to great Powers, seek to shape the world in the light of their own particular ambitions and national interests. In other words, in the 1970s the small nations must learn to live and survive in a multi-polar world of power politics. The shift from a bipolar to a multi-polar world has, it is true, ended the danger of the carving-up of the world by only two great Powers. To a great extent, that offers the small nations greater room for maneuver, a greater range of choice. But it also carries with it new dangers. Where before we, the small nations, were subjected to pressures by two Powers, we are in future going to be exposed to the blandishments of three or more great Powers.\n58.\tI do not foresee the great Powers abandoning power politics in the near future. That is because the great Powers believe they have evolved techniques for conducting power politics safely, without danger. I do not believe that in the long run that technique is really safe. But it is enough for our purposes that the great Powers believe it to be so. That is because the development of nuclear weapons has forced a tacit agreement among the nuclear Powers that there should be no direct confrontation between them because in nuclear terms that would mean the mutual annihilation of the great Powers. But they know that conflicts between big Powers are inevitable so long as the drive for power and dominance remains the overriding consideration in international relations. But they will be waged by means other than direct confrontation.\n59.\tAnd the means are the small nations. Big wars can be and have been fought through small nations. The idea is not\nreally new. In the past, small nations have been pitted against one another to further the interests of great Powers. But today the technique of wars with small nations as proxies has been more systematically developed. Small wars have in the nuclear age become the only safe method of conducting big-Power conflicts. That is why today and for the past decade small wars are and have been gradually increasing; that is why the third world is the scene of growing violence and conflict and civil wars. Textbooks on military strategy refer to this as the strategy of fighting limited wars. They have developed a strategy; textbooks refer to it as the strategy of fighting limited wars. It also includes the promotion of wars of national liberation, support for guerrilla uprisings, subversion and the engineering of coups in small countries.\n60.\tSo long as power politics persist, small nations will, I am afraid, increasingly be made the battlegrounds for resolving big-Power conflicts. A multi-polar world will possibly increase the risk of small wars breaking out. The small nations are more than ever before necessary instruments for big-Power conflicts-the only available instruments for big-Power conflicts.\n61.\tI personally do not believe that small wars or limited wars are all that safe. They may be so in the short run, and in a bipolar world. But in the long run, in a multi-polar world, limited wars must escalate into unlimited wars. Small Powers can acquire a significance and involve considerations of big-Power prestige which may make it impossible for a major Power to accept defeat even in limited wars. But there is little evidence at the present time to show that the big Powers are convinced of that. For the immediate future, small countries would increasingly be made the battlegrounds for big-Power conflicts because great Powers believe small wars to be safe wars.\n62.\tThis will be all the more so because we, the small nations, are either unable to resist being made pawns in the power game or because we unwittingly provide ample opportunities for big-Power intervention and manipulation. We, the small nations, are rent by internal dissension, civil wars, crushing economic problems and often inter-State conflicts, degenerating into endemic wars. These are all irresistible opportunities for successful big-Power intervention, often disguised as sympathy and aid for our respective causes.\n63.\tBut once local conflicts are meshed in with big-Power conflicts, then these wars cease to be small wars to further the ends of small nations. These small wars pass into the hands of competing big Powers. Once that happens, these wars can be ended only by the leave and license of the big Powers and only when they have attained their somewhat different objectives.\n64.\tSo if the small nations are to prevent their becoming expendable pawns in the big-Power game, they must first put their own houses in order. As long as we are internally weak, we are easy prey for big Powers. A major source of internal weakness is our failure to promote rapid economic development. The only successful revolution that the third world has so far waged is the anti-colonial revolution. It was by any standard a great revolution. But we have been far less successful in bringing about the economic revolution so\n \nnecessary to build strong modem States. We cannot build immunity against manipulation by great and wealthy States so long as we remain economically weak and are beset by all the ills of under-development. We will remain weak and easy prey for big-Power manipulation so long as we persist in promoting what has been described as ineffective under-developed revolutions.\n65.\tAccording to the Secretary-General's report on children, there are more sick and more undernourished children in the under-developed world today than was the case 10 years ago.  Human misery is progressively increasing in the third world; more people starve and more die of preventable diseases because the reproductive capacity of the peoples of the third world is increasing faster than their economic productivity.\n66.\tThere can be no unity, stability or modernization in the third world unless there is an economic breakthrough. Clearly, all the remedies and policies attempted during the past 25 years to promote rapid economic development have fundamentally been in error. That is why we still remain under-developed, in fact more under-developed with every passing year, because while we grow poorer, the wealthy nations are growing richer and more powerful every day, every year. The gap between the rich and the poor nations is widening at such a rate that if it is kept up for another two ox three decades, the under-developed countries may be doomed to live in permanent bondage to the advanced nations.\n67.\tTime, therefore, is not on the side of the third world. That is why it is vital for the small nations of the third world to approach the problems of economic development with a new sense of realism and with the utmost urgency. Past policies in regard to economic development must be abandoned simply because they have clearly failed to provide results after a period of 25 years.\n68.\tSo, for a start, we should develop an obsession about economic development. True, there is more to life than economic development. But the time to think of these higher and nobler aspects of existence is when elementary decencies of life have been assured to a majority of the peoples of the third world. Only then can we think of the more spiritual aspects of our lives. True, man does not live by bread alone, but without it he does not live at all. So an obsession with economic development is necessary for our survival as small nations.\n69.\tWhen this happy condition has been reached, then small nations stand a better chance of resisting attempts to convert them into pawns in the game of great Powers. Most important of all, without the co-operation of small nations, the great Powers, confronted with the awful alternative of direct confrontation in pursuit of power politics, may finally be forced to abandon power politics as a method of conducting international relations.\n70.\tSo in a way, we, the small nations, can bring power politics to an end by first concentrating on internal development and by steadfastly refusing, like the Trojan women in the Greek play, to enter into any cold-war liaison \nwith the major Powers. This is the only practical strategy for the survival of small nations in the multi-polar world that is now emerging.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "82.\t  Mr. President, I am happy to address you on behalf of my country, the Republic of the Ivory Coast, extending to you my warmest congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are bound to recognize that our work will be carried out in a sombre atmosphere because of the imminent departure of our Secretary-General, U Thant. Nevertheless, the delegation of the Ivory Coast believes that, more than ever before, our Organization needs a man of his stature and his philosophy who, more than once, has saved the United Nations during acute crises. We therefore express the hope of seeing the Secretary-General although we understand the reasons which inspired his decision- consent to continue his task in the interest of mankind.\n83.\tTo address this Assembly is not only to manifest faith in the United Nations; it is also to contribute to the attainment of its humanitarian projections towards the objectives the Organization has assigned itself, that is to say, to preserve future generations from the scourge of war. My country does so because we feel co-responsible for this noble mission. Thus we shall endeavor to express ourselves in accordance with the laws of maturity for a positive co-operation, all the more so since, while war or violence may be a domestic necessity for certain regimes, a national industry for others, the Ivory Coast can tind no cause or explanation for this phenomenon which would enable us to rationalize it or to integrate it in an intelligible system.\n84* Almost six years ago Mr. Ian Smith proclaimed the illegal independence of Rhodesia. World public opinion was roused to indignation and took a collective decision: economic sanctions decreed by the Security Council. Six years have gone by; the sanctions have failed. The reason for them, which was a casus belli yesterday, no longer seems to be so important in the minds of people. During that time, with an almost total disregard for public opinion, Great Britain and the Rhodesian regime resumed their negotiations like members of a family. Rhodesia would make concessions, promises rather, and taking these promises on faith, independence, is to be granted it in the most legal way in the world and the game will be played out. Some decolonizations were not properly carried out and already create problems for the world or will create them in the future. We hope that Rhodesia will not be added to the ranks-we hope that Great Britain, with its experience, will manage to spare Africa the situation which exists in Palestine and in Cyprus and the fate reserved for the Indian Union. The Ivory Coast is a country of dialog, and dialog requires faith. The Rhodesian question is the responsibility of Great Britain, the British Government has stated. We shall continue to place our confidence in it to safeguard the interests of 4 million Africans which it colonized. But our regional organization-as well as the Security Council should maintain its relations with Great Britain so as to establish contact with it in order to be informed of the course of the negotiations.\n85.\tAs for Portugal, it lives a legal fiction and we hope that it will participate fully in destroying the myth. Decolonization is an inevitable event. its rate can only be more or less accelerated. Portugal must turn to the future with serenity and lucidity. Portugal wanted assimilation, and that ideal, far from being condemnable, could well be the link that will in due course bind the new African States to the former metropolis. Because, in fact, there is no acceptable course today other than self-determination and independence. We have stated this in the past from this rostrum and we affirm it again: it is not too late. Portugal can still play the role which history expects; it can free itself from the system which holds it in bondage; it can lead die Territories which it maintains under its domination to independence and enjoy the friendship and the recognition of people who will then be greatly indebted to it. Today, as never before, Portugal faces its future. We must assist Portugal and, like the Arab States in regard to France when the Algerians were courageously fighting against France, we must not be content with Platonic resolutions but must establish contacts with Portugal with the purpose of starting and accelerating the inevitable process of negotiation between the latter and the fighters so as to shorten the suffering of our brothers and preserve, between Portugal and its former colonies, the relations imbued with friendship which exist between the countries that have acceded to independence and their former metropolises.\n86.\tIn regard to Namibia, the International Court of Justice pronounced a clear-cut Judgment. But, alas, our institutions, like every human endeavor, are imperfect. The advisory opinion of the Court  cannot be binding unless we declare that we accept it; South Africa will certainly not make such a declaration. And we run the risk that for a long time to come we shall continue to administer Namibia from New York. The United Nations is not prepared to raise troops for the purpose of protecting and escorting the United Nations Council for Namibia to that Territory to govern it.\n87.\tIn the final analysis, in the Ivory Coast we come back to our only weapon, dialog. The South African Government proposed a referendum which the Court quite rightly rejected because the problem is a political one and rests with political authorities. But why should our Organization not discuss with South Africa, which is a State Member of our Organization, the purpose of that referendum within the framework of self-determination as defined in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV}] and how the referendum would be carried out? The referendum would be preceded by amnesty for political prisoners and with freedom of action for political parties so as to enable the entire population of Namibia to decide, in the presence of neutral observers and by means of universal suffrage, its future status?\n88.\tIndeed, the Namibians must enjoy the right to self-determination. That was the purpose of the Mandate; current international law confirms it. All the other countries which were under the Mandate of the League of Nations have acceded to independence. Consequently, it is the duty of South Africa, a Member of the United Nations, to comply with that interpretation. This referendum must be not on a choice between administration by South Africa or by the United Nations, but on accession to independence. And Namibia must accede to independence in its territorial integrity as entrusted by the League of Nations to Great Britain and by the latter to South Africa.\n89.\tI now come to the problem of apartheid. This is so painful a question as to appear as a veritable mental epidemic; it blocks our judgments and out critical faculties and makes us impervious to reasonable solutions. It prevents us from perceiving the essence: the tragic march of Africa towards an ideological division, with the misfortune of seeing superimposed upon it a political-religious division.\n90.\tThe Ivory Coast is against every kind of violence. Violence means armed struggle, war-mongering verbalism, but also structural violence, which causes the oppression of man, which prevents him from being free and acceding to human progress.\n91.\tDespite the malicious insinuations of some of its friends and despite the accusations of being a traitor to Africa hurled against it by some of its brother countries whose regimes give the outside world a distorted picture of African humanism, the Ivory Coast not only denies these oppressive regimes, which are a shame to Africa, the right to inveigh against its positions but also asserts with firm conviction that only through dialog can an armed clash between our States and the disastrous consequences of structural violence within each of them be averted.\n92.\tTo those who recommend a dialog between whites and blacks in South Africa, the Ivory Coast expresses its complete agreement because we reaffirm that it if? only a dialog which can prevent the disastrous consequences of structural violence within each of our African countries, including South Africa.\n93.\tIn response to those who claim that we want to negotiate on the backs of our unhappy brothers in South Africa, the Ivory Coast rejects, not with scorn but with indignation, these fallacious accusations. Indeed, we repeat that it is only a dialog which can prevent an armed\nstruggle between our States, including South Africa, and which is able to contribute to the establishment of an atmosphere which will promote or facilitate the indispensable dialog among the citizens of South Africa,\n94.\tMy country and its Government have no intention of either becoming resigned to the perpetuation of the system of apartheid, or of seeing extinguished in the ashes of resignation the flame of legitimate indignation of black Africans in South Africa. True, they insistently extol the dynamic ideal of non-violence, but fully understand that, through the accumulation of deceptions, the threshold of tolerance is broken and brings violence in its wakes driving some to fight or to accept death in order to satisfy their fundamental aspirations to freedom and dignity. But that is only a distress solution for a distress situation.\n95.\tIt is therefore incumbent on those who are not immediately involved in this tragedy to endeavor to analyze these events, to dissect the components, to interpret them, to seek solutions so that those mainly responsible, namely, colonialism and racist government, will discover the morality of freedom, of equality, rather than to encourage by deeds and words the terrible logic of violence which leads opponents to greater reciprocal violence.\n96.\tThere are so many divergences in assessing the methods of approach because the categorical judgments that we arrive at do not take into account the essential elements of reality, that is to say, do not place the problem in its true context: the situation of Africa with regard to peace or war. Obviously the use of force will be abhorrent. The great Western Powers will not accept an invasion of South Africa by African armies. The armed power of South Africa is such that one cannot foresee how long a war would last. Our armies would be fighting on several fronts. Our continent would be reduced to a vast field of ruins where hunger and epidemics would cause millions upon millions of dead. Our youth, our hope for tomorrow, would be sacrificed and, without winning the war, we would lose a precious peace.\n97.\tA similar^ conceived masked war was implanted in the Middle East and has enabled the great Powers to project their problems there and the profound impetus of their quarrels and to issue proxy invitations to our brothers in that region of the world to fight against one another.\n98.\tAfrica, because of its sociological and ethnic pluralism and the need to devote itself to a harmonious development on the economic, cultural, scientific and social levels, must safeguard itself against bloc rivalry. It can only do so if vigilance brings about an internal and external conduct which excludes hated, even vengeance in the most tragic cases, and establishes a will for dialog and a permanent policy of negotiation.\n99.\tIndeed, to think of our struggle against apartheid since 10 years ago is to take the measure of the evolution of that phenomenon and of the conduct of the world, of which Africa is an integral part. The ethics and philosophy of our decisions have tended toward an economic and diplomatic boycott of South Africa, in order to halt its economic expansion, isolate it and compel it to surrender.\n100.\tEvery year South Africa is condemned because of the system it practices, appeals are made and then sanctions are imposed upon it for non-compliance with those appeals. The United Nations will not fail in its task; this year again it will adopt resolutions of condemnation and sanctions. As long as those sanctions remain at the level of the General Assembly, votes will be cast in favor with no opposition -excepting Portugal and South Africa. The sympathies for the victims are many, convictions are unanimously reiterated. Any attempt to have the Security Council endorse resolutions under Articles 39, 41 and 42 of the Charter so that they will become binding decisions has suffered from the veto of the great Powers-the fourth veto of the United Kingdom and the first veto of the United States since the creation of the United Nations.\n101.\tAs a general rule, the 10 great Powers which provide South Africa with three quarters of its imports and purchase two thirds of its exports will, like almost all the other Powers, not only not make the necessary effort to impose sanctions but will never make such an effort. The reduction of gold and other mineral deposits, whose expansion is so useful to the world economic structure and the structure of their economies, would cause a crisis in international liquidity, so that each one, given the complexities of economic laws, plays a subtle game of self- satisfaction which consists in voting in favor of a resolution first and then being deceptive about its implementation. Who would dare to propose abandonment of the gold standard for any currency, let alone the dollar? The International Monetary Fund has just purchased, gold from South Africa in the amount of $137.55 million so as to enable States to use the special drawing rights to acquire currencies. All these realities mean that, far from suffering from the decisions taken, economic expansion continues and South Africa increases its income by 6 per cent, which reveals how uncertain are the methods advocated. Thus the possibility for an internal revolution is based on nothing; what is more, within the context of the present world, it seems impossible, if not inconceivable for us, to set up a joint force to fight South Africa, Beside the' victims, machine-guns in hand.\n102.\tOur support can only be verbal, laden with affection, in a romantic way, bewitching for our peoples, but not in accord with the realities of the situation. Our effort, apparently active, is in fact passive; and we are among those who become exasperated and find it more and more difficult to support it. The Ivory Coast has no great merit in making this affirmation, because we are simply stating a truth known to all. What we denounce is that no one wishes to draw the consequences of this blocking in the United Nations.\n103.\tThree elements command that, while maintaining moral pressure on South Africa, we study new methods of approach. The big businessmen, grouped around large financial institutions which invest even in certain African countries, are liberal; while the racism of the old, who grew up after the Boer war, is pathological, the young are inspired only by the fear of revenge from the blacks. There are therefore differences in motivation which enable us to believe that it will be possible, through technology, frequent contacts and the influence of communications, to disseminate among the vast majority of white and black citizens of that country the ideals of an egalitarian and brotherly society, to strengthen standards and the social and human values of our time, and thus bring about a peaceful evolution towards a multiracial society.\n104.\tIt is true that the thinking and training of some do not predispose them to such a conception. But it is arbitrary to group all attitudes in the struggle under the single world \\\"violence\\\". The Ivory Coast reaffirms its conviction that contacts, the creation of conditions necessary for a dialog, can, without hampering or discouraging the struggle of the victims, bring about changes through evolution.\n105.\tDiplomatic isolation has also failed. None of the Powers in question has broken relations with South Africa. While South African Airways does not transit our countries, the other airlines and the shipping companies which go to South Africa come to our ports and airports; at the same time the South Africans of Dutch, German, British and other descent maintain contacts with their cousins in Europe and other continents, despite our resolutions. Those contacts between whites certainly do not speed up the solution of the problem; whereas, in the opinion of the Ivory Coast, contact between blacks and whites would in itself constitute a crack in the wall of apartheid. Our black brothers, South Africans, also need to circulate, to know the black citizens of the independent countries of Africa -their habits, their customs, their way of life-and their relations with the whites who have remained in those countries in friendship, or who have been liberally welcomed after independence. Finally, it is no mere chance that harmonious relations between whites and blacks in America have been developed increasingly since 1960, the period of independence of African States and their mass arrival in the United States.\n106.\tThat is why, in acting against the current of a collective delirium, we affirm that it would be an illusory satisfaction to try to liberate our brothers through war. Our warlike attitude runs the risk of setting off a deadly chain of events, triggered by blind external forces and by our just fury, and would lead our beloved Africa which has already suffered so much to the hecatomb desired by some. Thus the well-understood interests of our continent compel us to risk peace rather than war.\n107.\tIn this connexion President Felix Houphet-Boigny said the following in March 1968 before the Tunisian Parliament:\n\\\"We must once and for all renounce the idea of harnessing our plough to the clouds. We must give proof of being serious and realistic in every field, whether it is a matter of our own affairs, of our struggle against those who persist in wanting to scorn Africa, or whether it is a matter of our relations with our African brothers and the methods used to try to reach unity. What does this consist of? It is to refuse uselessly sentimental and chivalrous attitudes in this century of realism; to reject demagoguery and vain improvisations; it means admitting that words and skills count but little when facts are faced; it is to propose reasonable solutions, that is to say, solutions that one can and wants to apply; it means remaining faithful to principles, but at the same time being able to exercise the necessary flexibility to ensure their triumph.\\\"\n108.\tThe single-mindedness of Africans in regard to the objective elimination of apartheid stands intact. Only the methods may very after 10 years of no success.\n109.\tThe situation in the Middle East is a permanent danger for world security. At the fifth emergency special session of this Assembly, I said that the political instability within certain States of the area, the bloody events and the grave disturbances which periodically have broken out in that part of the world, have as their cause, directly or indirectly, the problem of Palestine. We must recognize that the picture is sombre. Yet, I would wish to believe that, today, a ray of hope has lifted some of the shadows from that picture. On both sides, it seems that, finally, they wish to free themselves from the politics of doom and embark on the very difficult course of negotiations yes, difficult because intransigence confronts intransigence.\n110.\tThe Jarring mission, whose noble efforts have been appreciated by both sides, with which his prestige remains intact, may be called upon to pursue his task. Those countries which are friendly with both the Arab States and Israel must assist both parties to adopt an attitude favorable to a dialog, on the basis of mutual understanding, which in turn is born of mutual good faith. The basis for the discussions exists: Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The terms were carefully weighted both in the preamble and in the operative part. It advocates evacuation from the' occupied territories and the recognition of Israel's right to exist.\n111.\tIn truth peace will not be made up of either rights or claims, but more simply of mutual concessions. Without them, there is neither negotiation nor dialog, and therefore no peace. There is no conflict which does not lend itself to a peaceful solution unless minds are closed to every suggestion. Be that as it may, in the end solutions which were initially rejected indignantly are found to be plausible and acceptable. The cease-fire must become permanent and every recourse must be set in motion so as to find arrangements for the reopening of the Suez Canal.\n112.\tThe Chinese question is governed by two facts: the national fact, which is reflected in the feeling of each Chinese Government that it is the legitimate representative of China; and the international fact, which, without daring to be definite, leads the other countries of the world, at the whim of world political events, to recognize either de jure the Republic of China, or de facto, the People's Republic of China, and vice-versa.\n113.\tBut the Sino-American ping-pong games have launched the United States \\\"bomb\\\", and it was logical to discover in its fall-out the specific form of the international fact of two Chinas. Nobody doubts that this solution would win many votes if both were likely to accept a compromise formula. But in fact positions are irreducible and a compromise non-existent. The problem stands in its entirety. There are no nuances in positions taken, and that would lead us to believe that there is a greater interest in the question than in the solution. If the Organization were to take the decision to expel the Republic of China, it would not emerge morally greater. The Ivory Coast will always be objective whenever this question is debated. Quite obviously, any proposal to expel the Republic of China from the United Nations should continue to be considered an important question.\n114.\tAs for the Viet-Nam war, its extension to the entire peninsula is to be deplored and its continuation is not warranted. It would be desirable to encourage the participants in the tragedy to pursue their negotiations in a spirit of sincerity.\n115.\tThe peoples of the third world hunger and thirst for economic justice. The problem of peace is also tied to the redistribution of wealth. Redistribution does not mean that the \\\"haves\\\" would have to distribute their goods, but to seek a balance between income we derive from our raw materials and the price we pay for manufactured goods. It has long been thought that the solution to the underdevelopment of the countries of the third world lay in aid given by the rich countries to the poor ones.\n116.\tThe disappointing United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 1964  did nevertheless make it possible for us to see that this conception was cramped, that trade was the primary instrument for the poor countries to accede to general prosperity, and that therefore the development possibilities for the third world were governed by the evolution of the general framework of world trade. Hence the importance of expanded trade, economic co-operation and regional integration as elements of an international development strategy. But the deficiencies and barriers to maximizing international trade are still many and very difficult to surmount.\n117.\tThe share of the developing countries in world exports, which was 27 per cent in 1953, fell to 18 per cent in 1969; it even fell from 52 per cent to 42 per cent for primary products, which represents the main part of their exports. These figures reveal the weakness of the structure of exports in the developing countries, which are too dependent on commodity goods.\n118.\tBut the organization of markets for commodities and international agreements will not enable producing countries to derive enough income from their products to ensure the accelerated rate of development they need.\n119.\tMoreover, serious import barriers subsist in the advanced countries for these processed or semi-processed commodities. Unfortunately, we observe that the developed countries often still follow a rather pronounced protectionist policy: import duties, surcharges, quotas or subsidies for national producers whereas in fact the only real solution that will enable the developing countries to improve their situation and to ensure their economic growth would be to export more of their manufactured or semi-finished goods to the wealthy countries.\n120.\tExpansion of international trade should not be sought solely between the rich and low-income countries; trade between the developing countries should also increase. Unfortunately, the barriers to this increase in trade are many and often cannot be overcome by developing countries alone without international aid or contributions. Transport and communications between these countries are often inferior to those which link them to the wealthy countries; the quasi-monopoly or the preponderance of foreign shipping companies which service those poor countries places them at the mercy of any freight rates policy which is unilaterally decided in the wealthy countries. The financial institutions, the payments systems and the sales organization have been devised, often for historical reasons, more in terms of trade with the developed countries; products manufactured in the developing countries are often competitive with one another instead of being c complementary. Finally, trade in agricultural goods between low-income countries is often hindered because wealthy countries give their farmers assistance in kind or export subsidies. It follows that a serious effort has to be made by the developing countries to institute multilateral payment agreements and regional arrangements among themselves in order to intensify trade.\n121.\tIn reviewing these difficulties and these obstacles to the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, which was adopted at the last session of the General Assembly [resolution 2626 (XXV)], we can but feel overwhelmed at the volume of effort, work and goodwill which must still be amassed to achieve our goal, even though we retain our full confidence in the solidarity, the good sense and wisdom of the world community. Yet we must recognize that the recent crisis in the international monetary system gives cause for the developing countries to despair. They bear no responsibility for the present crisis and yet they suffer the rebound effects of an incoherent management of the international payments system by the developed countries. The present trends toward protectionism and withdrawal which is the pattern in the trade policy of the wealthy countries cannot f\\\"\\\" to be detrimental to the hopes of the developing countries for an expansion of international trade.\n122.\tThe fluctuation of currencies and, as a consequence, the ensuing uncertainty in the value of the exchange reserves which have been painfully accumulated by the developing countries can but jeopardize and disturb all the Programs and plans for the economic development of the disinherited countries. It is therefore a matter of urgency to set up a new international monetary system which will final}/ take into account the interests of the developing countries.\n123.\tThe rules of the game have so far been defined by the developed countries among themselves. We, the developing countries, because we are realistic, do not claim to challenge their preponderant role, but we do hope that, since we ourselves observe those rules, they will not change them, or, if they do, we should not have to suffer the consequences.\n124.\tThe Ivory Coast believes that henceforth we should move towards a polycentric world economy, with several strategic poles, so that the economies of our young countries will not depend on a single pole of attraction, the decisions of which might dash all our hopes. The present financial crisis which threatens the world gives us this redoubtable example.\n125.\t\\\"The new name of peace\\\", said His Holiness Pope Paul VI, \\\"is development\\\". Thus the problem of peace cannot be solved by philanthropy; it must be solved by a mental transformation leading to an equitable structural organization for international trade. This transformation can be achieved only by means of education: the education of the third world in mastering technology and science, the education of the \\\"haves\\\" to give them a realistic view of underdevelopment so that their main concern will not be \\\"get rich and have no other worries\\\".\n126.\tThe work for peace is for each of us an effort at understanding one another. It is a labor of every day, of every instant in all circumstances. Peace is in the hands of men where it is as little secure as a crystal vase in the hands of a child.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "121.\t At the outset of the Second United Nations Development Decade, the undertakings to overcome the conditions of backwardness and subordination which prevail in the greater portion of mankind are still uppermost in the minds of most delegations. The results achieved thus far and the perspectives for the immediate future clearly indicate that we are still far from having achieved true international co-operation or of breathing real-life into the purposes and principles proclaimed in the Charter of San Francisco,\n122.\tThe aggressive policy of imperialism, particularly of North American imperialism, constitutes the main obstacle to the establishment of adequate rules governing relations among States. The present situation in the world eloquently bespeaks the fact that ,the imperialists are not resigning themselves to the loss of their privileges, they are not complying with the precepts of the international organs and they are mobilizing all their resources to hinder the efforts of the countries of the third world to strengthen their own independence and sovereignty. Asia, Africa and Latin America are still the arenas where the decisive struggle is being waged between the subjected people and an imperialism which refuses to bow to the dictates of history.\n123.\tIndo-China is still the region that polarizes that fundamental contradiction of our day. The war of aggression unleashed by Yankee imperialism against Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia not only shows the people of the third world the best example of the true designs of imperialism, but also points to the only way to wipe out the policies of aggression and exploitation. For many years North American imperialism has used against the Viet-Namese people all the warlike resources of its arsenals. Against that people it has mobilized contingents of its allies and Asian lackeys. It has widened aggression against the territories of Cambodia and Laos. In the territories of those three countries it has unleashed all the criminal potentials of its many means of chemical and biological destruction. On Viet-Namese territory it has dropped more bombs than all those that were dropped on Europe in the course of the Second World War. It has committed the most atrocious acts of genocide against the civilian population. It resorts to all means to pressure the Viet-Namese people and to shake its firm decision to achieve independence.\n124.\tAnd yet the heroic and determined struggle of the people of Viet-Nam, led by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam, has dealt North American imperialism its greatest, most absolute and most irreparable defeat. The incomparable Viet-Namese resistance has proved that imperialism is not invincible. It has opened new channels for the struggle for emancipation of the oppressed peoples. It has also gathered around itself world opposition to American imperialism, and even inside the United States itself, it has let loose resistance to the policy of war and death dictated by the great monopolies.\n125.\tThe result of that confrontation is the complete failure of the United States Government's aims to subjugate the peoples of Indo-China. Today no one, not even the hierarchy of the Pentagon, believes in the possibility of a Yankee military victory. Politically, diplomatically and militarily speaking, the aggression against Viet-Nam has met the worst defeat suffered thus far by North American imperialism and yet the authorities in Washington try at all costs to continue their interference in the Indo-Chinese peninsula, they refuse a total, immediate and unconditional withdrawal of their troops and they cling to their dreams of domination in Asia. It is for that reason that it is indispensable that efforts be redoubled to put an immediate end to the aggression against the people of Indo-China. Solidarity with the peoples of that region is still an unshakable duty for all until the full liquidation of imperialist aggression is achieved.\n126.\tThe seven-point proposal of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam is the sole formula that can restore peace and correctly solve the problem of Viet-Nam, guaranteeing fundamental national rights to the Viet-Namese people, That proposal is also consistent with the interests of the North American people and with the aspirations to peace and justice of other peoples all over the world. The Government in Washington has thus far refused to reply to the peaceful initiative of the Viet-Namese people. In the meantime the United States stubbornly continues and widens the war by the clumsy maneuver of so-called \\\"Viet-Namization\\\"; it tries to obtain military victories in order to negotiate from a position of strength; it continues its aggression and its interference in South Viet-Nam and it makes use of the warmongering group of Nguyen Van Thieu as an instrument of its neo-colonialist policies. The American refusal to reply to the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam and its stubbornness in imposing the Thieu group through a scandalous electoral farce clearly indicate that the Government of the United States means to continue violating the right to self-determination of the South Viet-Namese people and intends to perpetuate its aggression.\n127.\tIt is for that reason that world public opinion must resolutely condemn the policy of the war of imperialism; it must insist that the Government in Washington give a favorable response to the peace initiatives of the Provisional Revolutionary Government and that it commit itself to the immediate, total and unconditional withdrawal of all its troops. The Government of the United States must be required to abide by and respect the agreements of September 1962 on Laos, to put an immediate end to the aggression and intervention against that country and, furthermore, to respect the independence, peace, neutrality and territorial integrity of Cambodia and fully, totally and unconditionally to cease its intervention in that country.\n128.\tThe numberless crimes committed by North American imperialism against the people of Indo-China constitute a debt in blood that the imperialists have assumed towards all peoples of the world that no propagandistic or diplomatic maneuvers can ever disguise Towards Viet-Nam, furthermore, the peoples of the world have assumed an immense debt of gratitude for the contribution that that small Asian country by its indomitable resistance has made to the cause of preserving the independence and peace by the rest of mankind.\n129.\tIn Latin America the revolutionary anti-imperialist movement is still gaining ground and shaking the foundations of North American hegemony over a region of the world where the United States monopolies exercised almost exclusive domination for almost a century. The establishment of the Government of Popular Unity in Chile, the establishment in Peru of a nationalist Government and the development all over the continent of a popular movement which offers the most concrete example, in the case of Uruguay, of throwing out of government the oligarchic group serving imperialism; these are all obvious signs that Latin America has now entered a new phase, one that will not be concluded until the entire continent has achieved its , second and true independence.\n130.\tFor years the North American imperialists considered Latin America as their own private domain, where their monopolies could impose their will and where the peoples were denied the possibilities of recovering their natural resources or fully exercising their sovereign rights. Every .serious effort made by our people to take a step towards independence and progress was brutally cut off by the imperialist Government of the United States. With the guilty connivance or the servile applause of the Organization of American States, Yankee imperialism and its continental servants cut off at the root, the efforts of our peoples to set up more just systems of government and eliminate the causes of backwardness, misery and exploitation imposed on them by centuries of vassalage. The peoples of Latin America remember far too well the heroic efforts of Augusto Cesar Sandino in the mountains of Nicaragua; the open intervention against Guatemala in 1954; the landing of Yankee troops in Santo Domingo in 1965; the massacres of the Panamanian people; the colonial occupation of Puerto Rico; the establishment of Fascist regimes; the slaughter of Indians, workers, peasants and students when they claimed their rights; the invasion of Cuba in 1961; and the pressures on and interference in the affairs of our peoples.\n131.\tBut today the situation begins to change radically. The time when American imperialism could dominate our continent without let or hindrance has ended. The Latin American peoples now, with firm step., have headed toward their full national emancipation. The imperialists and the parasitic oligarchies know that today they confront a fight to the finish, cne in which they are condemned by history to fail: thus they unscrupulously organize a continental repression against all revolutionary movements, and devise conspiracies and provocations against popular governments. The recent fascist coup d'etat in Bolivia under the Yankee Central Intelligence Agency with the open support of the Governments of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, was an assault on the revolutionary movement and against all the peoples of Latin America. Fascism has gained an ephemeral victory in Bolivia. It imposed itself over the corpses of hundreds of workers and students, but its regime of hatred, treason and crime will not last. The Bolivian people know how to regain the positions they have momentarily lost, and then to advance and conquer revolutionary power.\n132.\tAs the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba, Commander Fidel Castro, stated on 27 August last:\n\\\"We are fully convinced that that Government cannot last, that the Fascists will not be able to keep themselves in power, that the Bolivians will indefatigably struggle until they, shall we say, regain the right road. But it will be more than the right road; it will be to gain power through revolution.\n\\\"It is obvious that imperialism and reaction have hurled a great challenge to the revolutionary movement with the events in Bolivia, And it is the duty of the international revolutionary movement, to give help and moral and material support to the Bolivian revolutionary in their struggle for liberation.\\\"\n133.\tImperialism and its oligarchic underlings cannot set back the revolutionary movement in Latin America. The struggle of the people of this continent has gone once and for all beyond the channels in which the exploiters those lackey regimes and those reformist and shaky groups tried to keep them. The a glorious example of thousands of revolutionary fighters who lost their lives for the cause of continental emancipation constitutes the impetus of the present process and the sure guarantee that that process will not stop until the last Latin American country has fully shaken off Yankee vassalage. The thoughts and the im-mortal example of Commander Ernesto Che Guevara are today more living and powerful than ever, and offer encouragement to millions of Latin Americans in their march towards the battle without fear and without surrender, ready now and forever to conquer their independence once and for all.\n134.\tThe Revolutionary Government of Cuba is deeply convinced of the total victory which will crown the revolutionary movements and the peoples of Latin America. We pledge our full solidarity to the revolutionary fighters in all corners of America and to the popular Governments that endeavor to strengthen their national independence.\n135.\tThe revolutionary position of Cuba and its unshakable commitment to those who are heroically confronting Yankee imperialism will never change. Cuba will not bring down its revolutionary flag in any circumstances. We shall stubbornly and with determination stand up against Yankee imperialism and its Latin American lackeys. to the gambles, maneuvers and lying campaigns of imperialism, Cuba can once again emphatically and categorically reply that it has no desire to rejoin the so-called Organization of American States, nor to re-establish relations with the puppet regimes of imperialism which oppress their peoples and are composed of corrupt and servile exploiting minorities. The Organization of American States is a putrid Organization, in bad repute, useless and already breathing its last. The Organization of American States will inevitably disappear, swept away by the un-containable waves of revolution of the Latin American peoples.\n136.\tWith regard to bilateral relations, Cuba wishes to state that it would only be ready to re-establish such relations with those Latin American countries that have shaken off Yankee domination and that act with true sovereignty and really defend the interests of their peoples against foreign monopolies. With oligarchs, with demagogues, with pretenders and with traitors to Latin America, we shall never have anything to do. They, too, will be irredeemably smashed by the revolutionary action of their own peoples.\n137.\tWith regard to the foreman of the Organization of American States, United States imperialism, the Revolutionary Government of Cuba has unshakably and unequivocally defined its position. Under no circumstances and regardless of the difficulties our people may have to confront, will Cuba ever abandon its position of principle: we are revolutionary and anti-imperialist and fully support the anti-imperialist movements of liberation on our continent. We shall not compromise with American imperialism. We shall never seek conciliation or understanding with the imperialists that for so many years exploited us, as today they exploit millions of our brothers on this continent  with those who sow war and destruction among the peoples of south-east Asia, with those who uphold the reactionary and non-popular groups, with those who tried to break the backs of our people and organized against us blockades, mercenary aggressions and threats of total extermination. The foreign policy of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba is based on immutable principles. We are bound to the movement of liberation against imperialism, and that struggle will not end until the peoples in their resolute battle and fighting united will have beaten to their knees those who are to blame for exploitation, misery and backwardness.\n138.\tThe struggle for the total emancipation of Latin America is a factor of crucial importance in the process of the liberation of the peoples of the third world and basic to true universal peace.\n139.\tIndependent and progressive States are in duty bound to support the liberating undertakings of peoples of this part of the world.\n140.\tCuba is at one with the peoples subjected to colonial domination, particularly in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). Once again we state our repudiation of the political and criminal policies of racial segregation imposed by the South African regime, and we repeat our support Arr the struggle of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe,\n141.\tAt the same time, we wish to express the imperative duty of Member States to assist the people of Puerto Rico in their struggle against United States colonialism. The discussion that took place this year on our request [A/8441 and Add J] for examination in the Assembly of the colonial case of that territory has merely shown up the United States fallacies regarding the status of Puerto Rico. The United States delegation was unable to refute any of our arguments, which eloquently proved that that sister island has been subjected to classical colonialism and that its people have never been allowed freely to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination. Cuba will continue to fight for this Organization to fulfill its duties-those duties imposed on it by resolution 1514 (XV)--with regard to Puerto Rico. We shall continue to urge the United Nations to assume its full responsibilities so that we shall know once and for all whether the anti-colonialism of this Organization is a universal principle or whether it becomes useless when we call for its use against American pressure.\n142.\tCuba wishes to confirm the position we adopted on the question of the conflict in the Middle East. We repeat that this question cannot be solved until the State of Israel withdraws its armed forces from the territories it occupied in a number of Arab States and until the people of Palestine are guaranteed full exercise of their national rights,\n143.\tCuba insists upon the withdrawal of United States troops occupying South Korea and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, Implementation of both these measures is the imperative duty of this Organization if it is to comply with the principles of its Charter. The United Nations interference in the domestic affairs of Korea must cease forthwith, and the Korean people must be permitted, alone and without alien interference, to solve the problem of the country's reunification.\n144.\tOnce again the General Assembly is to consider the question of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China. On this, our position is the same as that stated and defined year after year from this same rostrum. Consistent with that position, the Cuban delegation is co-sponsoring the draft resolution which advocates the restoration of the rights of that State and the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek group [A/L.630 and Add J].\n145.\tThe United Nations must truly become universal. To do so, we have to secure the participation in this Organization of the German Democratic Republic, a sovereign and independent State.\n146.\tThe world of today is living through a determining moment for its future. The conflict between the forces of progress and the interests of the minorities that hold wealth has reached a critical moment. While the retrograde forcer* preserve their hegemony in some regions of the world and reflect their influence in our Organization, we can hardly expect satisfactory results from the efforts being made to promote international co-operation.\n147.\tThe present international moment, at the same time, however, is filled with potential progress and happiness for peoples. Imperialism stands surrounded by many contradictions and it has found turned against it the results of its aggressive policies. The crisis of United States imperialism ruminated in the recent economic measures announced by\nNixon. They reflect the growing obstacles that United States monopolies are finding in their role as the gendarmes of mankind. But, by the same token, they are an indication of the fact that imperialism intends to solve its difficulties at the expense of the legitimate interests of the developing countries, which would be the ones to suffer from the arbitrary restrictions imposed on international trade which those United States decisions have created. This being the case, the countries of what we call the third world must redouble the defense of their common interests and stand together against the American designs.\n148.\tAt the beginning of the last decade the imperialist Government of the United States arbitrarily canceled the Cuban sugar quota and imposed a savage economic and trade blockade on our country. When these illegal and criminal measures were adopted against Cuba, my country did not enjoy the solidarity which the international community called for under the San Francisco Charter. On the contrary, other countries accepted the crumbs of what was left of our sugar quota, handed out by the Yankees as bribery to purchase the necessary votes to push through the Organization of American States the decisions against Cuba.\n149.\tThe United Nations turned a deaf ear to our denunciations, and Cuba had to confront and resist alone, counting only on the assistance of the socialist countries to outlive the criminal measures intended to strangle us economically,\n150.\tToday, Yankee imperialism is imposing restrictions which seriously affect the developing nations and particularly those of Latin America. Those who yesterday tore up the agreements born of our common history are now reaping the fruits of their docility in the face of the imperialist dictates. It is not Cuba, but they, who today must confront the arbitrary restrictions, the barriers to trade and the obstacles to their development.\n151.\tCuba, which yesterday suffered much more drastic measures intended to destroy it and confronted them with courage while other Latin American countries not only abandoned it but quickly hastened to participate in despoiling a sister people of its rights; Cuba, which had to stand practically alone against the criminal policy of Yankee imperialism; Cuba today offers its support to the just claim of the third world against the restrictive measures imposed on international trade by the Government of Washington.\n152.\tFor the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America the future holds periods of strife and sacrifice. The future to which those peoples have a right is not one that can be easily won, but victory is not far off, and how close it is will depend on the degree of cohesion and determination with which the progressive forces battle. The united struggle of the socialist countries, the peoples of the third world and the revolutionary forces of the rest of the world could very well surround the imperialists and turn the balance of history once and for all in favor of those who struggle for justice, peace and the progress of mankind.\n153.\tCuba, whose international policy draws inspiration from revolutionary principles, whose line of conduct is inspired by the heroic traditions of our people, whose acts obey the rule of full solidarity with oppressed peoples, faces the future with optimism. The peoples subjected by imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism will not falter in their struggle for full liberation, and in that struggle lies the key to the future. And in that struggle they can always rely upon the solidarity of Cuba.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "60.\t Mr. President, you come to the leadership of the General Assembly at a time when eastern Asia stands in the center of international concern. It is in that region alone that war still rages day by day. It is there that a burden of suffering, unparalleled elsewhere, weighs heavily on the conscience of mankind. And it is to Asia that our eyes will turn when we come to take decisions on the future of this Organization and the principles underlying its structure.\n61.\tIt is right at such a time that an Asian statesman of high capacity and repute should preside over our deliberations. Israel wishes you success and pledges itself to your support. You will be fortified by the high example of your eminent predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, and by the experience and patient skill of the Secretary-General, who is completing a full decade of service to the international cause.\n62.\tLast year the United Nations marked its twenty-fifth anniversary by an act of celebration. I suggested then that the occasion could have been more wisely used for scrutiny and self-criticism (1851st meeting]. There is a manifest decline in the influence of the General Assembly on the main issues affecting human welfare and destiny. Its resonance has diminished. The central currents of international life and policy flow outside its walls. The frustration arises, not so much from defects in the Organization's work, as from discord and contention amongst the Powers. Yet there are some causes which lie within our capacity of correction. I shall mention one.\n63.\tIn the work of the United Nations there is a strong accent on public controversy and a relative neglect of private conciliation. A report by the Secretary-General 11 years ago contained a plea to give greater emphasis to the United Nations as an instrument for negotiation of settlements as distinct from this world debate of issues. The advice was not heeded. Debate, not negotiation, still dominates the United Nations practice. Resolutions are adopted in great numbers, but their texts bear witness to the parliamentary advantages of fragmentation rather than to a balanced view of rights or realities.\n64.\tFor example: in a dispute in the Middle East between two parties one of which has a single vote and the other 16 or, in practice 40, the preordained triumph of automatic majorities has no moral value, little practical effect and a very short life in the world's memory. The same is true of the Security Council, a third of whose members have their diplomatic relations and their ethnic or sentimental predilections exclusively on one side.\n65.\tThis difficulty would not exist if the organs of the United Nations would regard it as their main function to seek consensus which would include the interested parties. They would be better employed in encouraging agreement between the parties at issue, than in sharpening controversy between them by attempts at adjudication. In short, the United Nations should aspire to a diplomatic rather than to a parliamentary role. The test of achievement should be not how many resolutions we have voted but how many solutions we have advanced.\n66.\tAnd, indeed, wherever free, direct negotiation has taken place across the world in the past year there has been fruitful issue. There have been the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union and Poland with the Federal Republic of Germany, based, as Mr. Gromyko significantly told us, \\\"on recognition of European realities, especially on the inviolability of frontiers\\\" [1942nd meeting, para. 101]. He was referring to the frontiers established after the war by negotiation and agreement. There has been the four-Power agreement on Berlin where, as Mr. Gromyko again correctly said, it is now up to the two parties directly concerned \\\"to complete the negotiations between them\\\" [ibid., para. 98]. There has been the normalization of relations between Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany. There has been direct contact between the United States and the People's Republic of China, to be followed at an early date by a meeting at the highest level of responsibility. The Paris talks on Viet-Nam, with the direct participation of all the parties at issue, have been accompanied by a constant de-escalation of the fighting. There is grave tension between India and Pakistan, as is evident from the general debate here earlier this week; but the two Governments have direct relations which they ca\u00ab apply to the solution of their differences. Many hearts are heavy at the reports coming from the boundary between Ireland and\nNorthern Ireland; but there is also news that the heads of Government concerned have met each other and agreed on a process of political reconciliation. In Washington, agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union are being signed today for modernizing the \\\"hot line\\\" and strengthening safeguards against accidental war.\n67.\tIs there no lesson to be drawn from the settlements reached and attempted this year? Surely they show that the air is alive with a spirit of innovation. Attitudes of hostility which once seemed to be an organic part of our generation's life are now yielding to a strong impulse for peaceful settlement. Above all we are learning lessons about the immense importance of communication. Time and again the decision of Governments to abandon their cold separation and make contact with each other develops from a procedural advance into a change of substantive positions and thence into binding agreements. The central themes of international life in 1971 are direct contact, the abandonment of traditional conflicts, and flexible, pragmatic negotiation.\n68.\tThere is also a move away from dogmatic attachment to documents. If old formulas and texts have reached deadlock, new ones are sought. There is a particular recognition that after wars the need is to build new systems of relations and not to reproduce the conditions and situations out of which war erupted. This new empiricism affects the juridical domain as well. Governments which seriously seek peace do not hesitate to confer directly with Governments which they do not yet recognize and with which they have no legal relations,\n69.\tIf there is frustration in the Middle East it is because our region is still the exception to all the positive rules which have been applied elsewhere. Whatever is tried successfully in other regions is avoided in the Middle East. Here alone there is still no contact between the parties at issue. Here alone the Governments which will have to live side by side with each other have still not come face to face at a table of negotiation. Here alone we are often told that the only way to get peace is to restore the situations which erupted in war. Here alone it is said in many places that the resumption of an important peace mission is wholly dependent on a single memorandum on which there is deadlock, and that there is no room for any innovation or any versatility of formulas and techniques.\n70.\tIt is true, despite these failures, that the situation in the Middle East today is less explosive than a year ago. The flow of events has not been backward. The cease-fire along the Suez Canal has been effective, with rare and isolated exceptions, for 14 months. Israel does not propose to bring it to an end and Egypt would achieve nothing by violating it. Indeed, the only certainty in the Middle East is that resumed hostilities would serve no interest and advance no settlement. The absence of fighting along the Suez Canal line has released the Middle East and the world from the daily prospect of escalation involving the Soviet forces which were irresponsibly introduced into the' region with the effect of aggravating and enlarging a local tension. There has been a sharp decline in the strength and prestige of the terrorist groups and the pirate organizations that loomed so large a year ago. There has been peaceful movement across open bridges into Israel and the administered territories of scores of thousands of Arabs from neighboring Arab countries which are officially \\\"at war\\\" with Israel. Thus new patterns of coexistence have grown up between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs in daily life and work. Side by side with a violent and incendiary Arab rhetoric there seem to be here and there some beginnings of a greater realism in Arab thinking on the problem of Israel's sovereignty and Israel's deep roots in the life and history of the Middle East. Finally, there are three separate availabilities of good offices which, although not all in active course today, are mutually accepted by the parties: the Jarring mission; the good offices of the United States in pursuit of an agreement concerning the Suez Canal; and the intention of ten African Presidents to authorize four eminent heads of State to go to Jerusalem and Cairo on a mission of information and goodwill.\n71.\tYet, with all these consolations the peace efforts are not sufficiently intense. The talks under Ambassador Jarring's auspices, which began in high promise in January, have been at a standstill since the end of February. An exchange of views and positions on a special Suez Canal agreement was inaugurated through the good offices of the United States in April. This effort is still underway, but its pace is slow. In discussing the obstacles to peace it would be easy, but sterile, to fall into recrimination. Nothing would be easier. One of the few things that all Members of the United Nations have in common is the ability to discuss each other's imperfections. Yet what mankind longs to hear is not how deadlocks arose, but how it is proposed to overcome them. The general debate will be well used if Middle Eastern States will give precise definition to what they are prepared to do in order to bring a peaceful settlement into view. All who seek an understanding of Israel's policies must come face to face with two elements in the national mood. There is a sharp preoccupation with security; and there is a vivid memory of the horror and dark peril from which we emerged four years ago.\n72.\tIn reflecting on the theme of security, Israel cannot easily forget the immense loss and burden it has borne through the hostility directed against it for over two decades. Our danger, in 1967 was the climax, but not the whole story, of our predicament. No other people has had to live all its days with a mark of interrogation hanging over its collective and individual survival. Israel's insistence on genuine and stable security takes particular depth from the hideous legacy of Jewish massacre in the European slaughter-house. No people in history has undergone an experience of such tragic depth and scope. And no other State has grown for 23 years amidst such a comprehensive effort to deny it every breath of life.\n73.\tIn particular, Israel's mind preserves a permanent and,, unfading image of the danger and solitude from which it emerged in the summer of 1967. To forget or ignore these memories is to renounce all true understanding of the Middle Eastern reality today. It was only by exceptional vigilance and cruel sacrifice that we repelled a monstrous design that would have ended our people's historic journey and cast all Israel's life and achievement into the flames. Maritime blockade, terrorist incursions, military encirclement, declarations of overt war, a frenzied torrent of threats and a formal announcement from Cairo that the battle was joined for Israel's destruction all these came\ntogether in cumulative assault,\\\"We recall the outrageous silence and apathy with which the Security Council, between one adjournment and the next, calmly observed the only attempt in modern history to wipe a sovereign State off the map of the world. Mr. Gromyko indulges his sense of humour when he tells us that guarantees by the Security Council are among \\\"the firmest guarantees that can be imagined in the modern world\\\" [ibid.., para. 135], The truth has Iden and is that, largely as a result of Soviet policy, the Security Council for 20 years has refused to defend any Israeli right including the right not to have its citizens killed, its ports blockaded, its existence threatened. The policy of the Security Council has been to refuse to adopt any decision of which a single word is unpalatable to the Arab Governments. It has thus surrounded every assault on Israeli lives, Israeli rights and Israeli security with indulgence. At the highest point of tension and of Israel's danger in May 1967, with Israel blockaded and encircled on every side, with all mankind gripped by the apprehension of approaching war, the suggestion of the Soviet Union was that the Security Council should go home and refuse to discuss such an \\\"artificial\\\" matter as the declaration of active war and the formal imposition of a blockade against a Member State. It is largely because of Soviet policy that the Security Council cannot be a guarantor of any Israeli rights. And the future development in the composition of the Security Council, however essential for other reasons, is bound to emphasize its inability to guarantee or even to express an Israeli interest, whatever the majority of its members may think or say.\n74.\tThere are few effective guarantees of peace beyond those inherent in the nature of the peace itself. The greatest danger is lest through lassitude of spirit or impatience or imprecision of diplomatic craftsmanship we again revert to fragile, false and ambiguous solutions, which carry in them the seed of future wars.\n75.\tBut the work of peace, however complex, must be attempted. Israel's deepest aspiration is to take part in a new deployment of energies in the service of a peaceful order of relations in the Middle East. Accordingly I ask the crucial questions: Is the slow rhythm of the peace efforts inevitable? Can nothing be done or at least attempted to set some dialog in swifter motion? Do Israel's policies offer openings through which roads to peace can be discerned and actively explored? My answer is that if the Arab States, and especially Egypt, sincerely desire an honorable and lasting peace, there are many roads leading to that goal.\n76.\tThe first road lies in a Suez Canal agreement. There are many reasons for giving priority to this at attempt. A sudden transition from a conflict of more than two decades to a total settlement has proved difficult. It may be more rational to expect progress by stages. Each stage would bring about a solution of a specific problem while opening the way to further agreements and thus to final peace.\n77.\tThe Suez Canal sector calls urgently for disengagement. It is there that the regional tension is compounded by the military presence of a great Power. Disengagement of forces here is an urgent international interest.\n78.\tThe President of Egypt proposed on 4 February an attempt to open the Suez Canal ahead of a total settlement.\nIsrael's Prime Minister responded on 9 February. Both Governments subsequently agreed that the United States should use its good offices to explore the prospect. We therefore have an agreed objective and an agreed modality. , We believe that the effort to bridge the gulf between the positions of the parties should be pursued in the general interest of peace. If agreement cannot be reached on such a clearly defined issue in which Egyptian advantage is so strong it would appear to be even more difficult to advance in one step towards an over-all settlement in which all the complex issues would Ml into place. But the contrary is also true. A concrete result in this matter will accelerate and inspire negotiation and agreements on other issues. The peace effort will acquire momentum. It will be surrounded for the first time by an air of confidence and promise.\n79.\tHaving been invited to give its views on this matter, Israel developed a proposal that an arrangement be agreed upon with a view to the opening of the Suez Canal to be cleared and operated by Egypt. Israel would make a withdrawal of its forces from the water-line to an agreed distance. The fighting would not be resumed. Egypt would clear and open the Canal. It would be agreed that there be free passage for all ships and cargoes, including those of Israel. Effective and agreed supervision procedures would be established. Means of deterrence against the danger of violation of the agreement would be assured. The agreement would stand on its own feet, but it would not affect or annul the undertakings which the parties gave in August 1970 to hold discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices in conformity with his mandate under Security Council resolution 242(1967). The line to be held by Israeli forces in accordance with that Canal agreement would not be considered final. When agreement on a final boundary is reached in the framework of the peace settlement Israeli forces will withdraw to it.\n80.\tWe hope that Egypt will give this proposal the detailed and careful consideration which seemed to be its intention in April. It represents far-reaching concessions on Israel's part. It involves a movement from the cease-fire line ahead of peace. It mitigates the accepted legitimate principle that no withdrawal need take place ahead of a contractual and mutually agreed peace. The prestige, benefits and revenues from the Canal, the possible return of three quarters of a million people who live near the Canal in peaceful times, as well as the crossing of the Canal by Egyptian civilian personnel, would all be Egyptian, not Israeli, gains. A new impetus would be given to the Jarring mission, which is now in abeyance. The undertakings which I have given refute the idoa that the Canal agreement would be the last word. On the contrary, its conclusion and observance would create a favorable channel for further agreements.\n81.\tIt is true that neither Egypt nor Israel would attain its final objective in this interim framework, but Egypt's right to present its claims in the over-all peace negotiations would remain intact, as would Israel's freedom to present its own proposals and reservations.\n82.\tA second road to peace lies through the resumption of negotiations under Ambassado. Jarring's auspices. Israel agreed to resume these talks in January 1971 despite Egypt's refusal to rectify its violation of the missile- standstill agreement. At a meeting with the Prime Minister and myself in January, Ambassador Jarring was requested to communicate to the Governments of Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon a list of principles which, in our view, should be embodied in the peace agreements to be concluded and signed between Israel and each of the Arab Governments concerned. These principles were, at first, vehemently \\\"ejected by the Egyptian Government. Subsequently, on i 5 February, the Government of Egypt commented f A/8541, annex II] on an aide-memoir submitted a week before by Ambassador Jarring [A/8541, annex I], It did not accept Mr. Jarring's precise formulations on navigation in the Suez Canal, on the Straits of Tiran, nor indeed on the definition of the scope of withdrawal. But the Egyptian reply did contain an expression of readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel provided that all the Egyptian terms for the agreement were met. One of these terms was the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza strip and all territories beyond the armistice line existing on 4 June 1967.\n83.\tIn its reply on 26 February 1971 [A/8541, annex III] the Israel Government viewed favorably the expression by Egypt of its readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and reiterated that it was prepared for meaningful negotiation on all subjects relevant to a peace agreement between the two countries.\n84.\tWhy then are the Jarring talks in abeyance? The reason is plain. The Security Council resolution, 242(1967), requires that the withdrawal and boundary clauses of the peace agreement, like all its other provisions, must be determined through agreement, which of course implies negotiation. Egypt declines to hold any dialog or negotiation whatever on this point. It lays down its own position as an ultimate condition to which Israel must submit before negotiation begins. Indeed it is not clear why negotiation would be needed at all if the Egyptian view has to be accepted in advance. In a recent declaration of which President Sadat was a signatory, three Arab Governments, including that of Egypt, reiterated that there can be no negotiation with Israel, no conciliation and no bargaining over the Palestinian issue. This is a more recent and presumably more authoritative statement of Egypt's policy than the one that Mr. Riad, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicated to Mr. Jarring six months ago. Together with other declarations in the same mood and spirit, it raises the question whether the February memorandum has the significance that we chose to attach to it at that time.\n85.\tBut on one point alone the February communication from Cairo and the Damascus tripartite statement are one: they both rule out the free, precise and detailed negotiation of the \\\"boundary and withdrawal questions. Our policy is that, instead of cease-fire lines or armistice lines, we should establish secure, recognized and agreed boundaries as part of the peace-making process, and withdraw our armed forces to those boundaries once they are determined. It is important to break away from the temporary and unresolved territorial concepts which have prevailed since 1948 in order to develop for the first time a permanent structure of boundaries and security agreements.\n86.\tThere is no need to be apologetic about the doctrine that peace boundaries may be different from armistice lines. The Arab Governments wrote into the 1949 Armistice Agreements a provision stating that the armistice lines are not the final boundaries and these must be worked out by agreement in the transition to peace. We are now embarked on that transition. Israel's size and strength are smaller than those of the European Powers which insisted on secure and agreed boundaries after the Second World War; but the right to negotiate boundaries that would release Israel from a chronic and desperate vulnerability belongs to it as to every other sovereign State. In this matter we are not in a position of juridical defense.\n87.\tI shall summarize under three headings the reasons and justifications which give Israel the right to have negotiation on boundaries and security arrangements. The first, as I have already pointed out, is the provisional character of the lines now held as well as those which existed before. Several years before the 1967 war the Deputy Foreign Minister of Egypt correctly said: \\\"There is no legal boundary between Israel and Egypt but only a line that was fixed in the pursuance of the Armistice Agreement.\\\"\n88.\tOn 31 May 1967 the representative of Jordan said in the Security Council:\n\\\"There is an Armistice Agreement. The Agreement did not fix boundaries; it fixed a demarcation line. The Agreement did not pass judgment on rights political, military or otherwise. Thus I know of no territory; I know of no boundary.\\\" \n89.\tA second and more contemporary reason in support of Israel's claim to a negotiation on withdrawal and boundaries lies in the Security Council's resolution 242 (1967), which has been accepted by some Arab States and by Israel and which is the constitutive document of the Jarring mission. That resolution was adopted after all attempts to require a withdrawal to the 4 June armistice lines had been defeated by vote or discarded for lack of support. The term \\\"secure and recognized boundaries\\\" was an innovation in the United Nations vocabulary. It first appeared in a United States draft resolution submitted on 7 November 1967 and later embodied in a United Kingdom draft  which was presented for unanimous vote. I must state with full solemnity and knowledge that Israel's adherence to the Security Council resolution and acceptance of the Jarring mission were secured on the most explicit understanding that the resolution offered an opportunity to negotiate agreements on boundaries and withdrawal. Secretary of State Rogers stated for the United States in October 1969:\n\\\"Those boundaries were armistice lines not final political borders. The rights, claims and positions of the parties in an ultimate peaceful settlement were reserved by the Armistice Agreements. The Security Council resolution neither endorses nor precludes those armistice lines as the definitive political boundaries.\\\"\n90.\tIn a public statement on 12 July 1970, Mr. Sisco, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, declared that he had taken an active part in the formulation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). He added:\n\\\"That resolution did not say withdrawal to the pre- June 5 lines. The resolution said the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiation between the parties.\\\"\n91.\tThe United Kingdom Government, which sponsored Security Council resolution 242 (1967), put itself on record on 17 November 1969, when its Foreign Secretary, Mr. Michael Stewart, was asked:\n\\\"What is the British interpretation of the wording of the 1967 resolution? Does... it... mean that the Israelis should withdraw from all territories taken in the late war? \\\"\nHe replied:\n\\\"No, Sir. That is not the phrase used in the resolution. The resolution speaks of secure and recognized boundaries. Those words must be read concurrently with the statement on withdrawal.\\\" \nA month later, on 9 December 1969, in the House of Commons he said:\n\\\"... There is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As I have told the House previously, we believe that these two things should be read concurrently and that the omission of the word all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.\\\"?\nI repeat: \\\"... the omission of the word 'all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.\\\"\n92.\tIt was in the light of these clear undertakings that the Israel Government informed Mr. Jarring in August 1970 that it accepted the Security Council resolution 242 (1967) for implementation in all its parts and that on the establishment of a just and final peace in accordance with the resolution it would withdraw its forces from the cease-fire lines to secure and recognized boundaries to be determined in the negotiations.\n93.\tThe political and juridical aspects of the questions to which I have referred are the expression^ a deeper, more concrete reality. Israel does not have a policy of expansion or annexation. In the negotiations on boundaries and withdrawals it will seek those modifications which are essential to ensure security and to prevent another war.\n94.\tihe war of 1967 did not arise exclusively from the vulnerability of the armistice lines. But there is no doubt that some topographical and strategic situations were a permanent temptation to assault. If they are not corrected and adjusted Israel, on withdrawing from the cease-fire lines, would find itself again in a position of intolerable vulnerability. There could be no more horrifying error than to revert, through lack of precise and detailed negotiation, to a territorial structure and security balance capable of reproducing the peril which exploded four years ago.\n95.\tIn the framework of a peace settlement with Egypt, Israel would withdraw from the cease-fire lines. We have never asserted that in a condition of peace it would be necessary for our troops to remain in all of the Sinai peninsula or even in most of it. But there are vital interests affecting security, peace and navigation which impel us to reserve the right to attempt in the peace negotiations to secure a contractual basis for such continued presence as is necessary to protect security and navigation. There are several juridical expressions and precedents for such an arrangement. Our emphasis is on practical security conditions, not on any particular juridical formula. The post-war map of the world is replete with instructive parallels. The peace treaties in Europe and Asia did not bring about a return to the exact military and territorial dispositions that existed before.\n96.\tNow Israel does not ask Egypt to accept any of its positions as a condition of negotiation. The proposal for the withdrawal of all Israeli troops to the previous positions is legitimate as an Egyptian proposal. It is equally legitimate for Israel to insist on an opportunity of free negotiation in which its own reservations and counter-proposals could be made. And our request from the world community is modest. We do not present specific Israeli proposals for endorsement by other Governments; we ask only that our right to negotiate the issues vital to our future, to our peace and to our security, should not be cut off in advance.\n97.\tOur position, then, is this: We have taken note of the Egyptian proposal on withdrawal. Israel would withdraw its armed forces from the Israel-United Arab Republic ceasefire line to the secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be established in the peace agreement. Now that both parties have presented their basic positions, they should pursue their negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior condition to cover all the points I listed in their respective documents with a view to concluding a peace agreement. I continue to adhere to the view which I expressed at the twenty-third session of the General Assembly in October 1968 that\n\\\"It is possible to work out a boundary settlement compatible with the security of Israel and the honor of\nArab States\tThe majority of the United Nations have\nrecognized that the only durable and reasonable solutions are agreed solutions serving the common interests of our peoples. The new peace structure in the Middle East, including the secure and recognized boundaries, must be built by Arab and Israeli hands\\\" [1686th meeting, para. 111].\nThus if Egypt will present its position for negotiation without the unprecedented request for Israel's acceptance of it in advance, we shall be ready for detailed and concrete negotiation on all the matters mentioned in the Egyptian memorandum of 15 February and the Israeli document of 26 February,\n98.\tEffective and versatile conciliation must include a capacity to move from one direction to another in a tireless pursuit of peace. In March 1968, Ambassador Jarring suggested a formula for the convening of meetings between the parties in Nicosia on the basis of an agreed term of reference. Egypt rejected that proposal. Those concerned with the conciliation effort did not say that the mission had to be held in suspense until Egypt gave a positive reply to something which its policy did not then allow it to endorse. It would be wrong now to affirm that such a vital objective as the establishment of a negotiated peace between Israel and Egypt will never be possible except on the basis of a working paper which did not happen to secure the agreement of the parties. Egyptian-Israeli peace is too great a cause to be tied and tethered for all time to a single optional memorandum. If Egypt will agree to pursue negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior conditions on all the points listed in the Israeli and Egyptian memoranda of February 1971, this road to meaningful negotiation will lie open,\n99.\tThere are other roads to peace. The Suez Canal agreement and the discussion of an over-all settlement are not the only options available for negotiation. The problem of refugees requires a broad acceptance of regional and international responsibility. We have therefore proposed the convening of a conference of Middle Eastern States, together with Governments which have contributed to refugee relief and the specialized agencies of the United Nations, in order to chart a five-year plan for the solution of the refugee problem and the integration of refugees into productive life.\n100.\tThis problem would now be considered against the background of some alleviating developments in recent months. There is a growing disillusion with the irredentist pretensions of the terrorist groups and the air pirates. The dividing wall which once prevented all human contact between Israelis and Palestine Arabs is falling. It is true that this is due so far to Israeli initiative. Last year not a single Israeli set foot in any Arab land, but 110,000 Arabs from countries \\\"at war\\\" with Israel came into contact with Israel across the open Jordan bridges. An open frontier between Israel and its eastern neighbor similar to the community frontiers in Europe would do much to give human reality to a peace settlement, and indeed might help the settlement to be achieved.\n101.\tThere is a fourth possibility. The problems of boundaries and security are usually considered to be the crux of the negotiation. But there are other unresolved matters in the memoranda presented by Egypt and Israel in February. At first sight there seems to be some proximity between the peace, non-aggression, recognition and navigation clauses suggested by the two Governments. On closer inspection the disparities are substantial, and could become crucial. We suggested in January and later in March that, it might be profitable to attempt to draft some of the clauses of the Egyptian-Israel treaty relating to the principles of peace. It is an accepted negotiating technique to begin with problems in which divergences are less broad and thus to create a favorable atmosphere in which to confront the more acute problems.\n102.\tThere is a fifth road towards negotiating procedure and activity; it concerns the negotiating procedure, but its weight is intensively substantive and not at all procedural I have said that in the early months of 1968 Ambassador Jarring suggested meetings between the parties, under his auspices, in Nicosia, in accordance with a text setting out the terms of reference for the conferences. On 10 March 1968, Ambassador Jarring informed me that Egypt had rejected that proposal. As the Secretary-General's report of 4 January 1971 reveals, Dr. Jarring \\\"was informed of Israel's official acceptance, without conditions, of the text\\\". \n103.\tNow that was the negative turning-point in the history of the Jarring mission. Since then it has been limited, through Egyptian insistence, to a bizarre procedure under which Israeli documents are presented to Ambassador Jarring, and by him to the Egyptian representative. If the Israel document contains the words \\\"for communication to the Government of Egypt\\\", the Egyptian representative refuses to take it into his h?nds; or if he has inadvertently accepted its delivery, he comes back to relinquish it with panic-stricken haste as if it were a hot coal. The Israel document is then divulged by the Egyptian representative to the press, accompanied by a burst of invective. Egyptian replies are published without any hint of an intention to communicate them to Israel. The Egyptian position is that Israel may not talk to Egypt directly, may not talk to Egypt indirectly and may not communicate anything to Egypt in writing.\n104.\tIf no other method is available my Government will communicate its views to Egypt by whatever channel or technique is possible. But we cannot conceal our conviction that there is an element of farce in the idea that the word \\\"negotiation\\\" can honestly be applied to the extraordinary procedure followed so far. How can a Government which alleges that it wants a peace agreement with Israel refuse to negotiate the terms of that agreement by a rational method of contact? To say that one is prepared to enter into a peace agreement but not to meet or negotiate even under international chairmanship is to make a mockery of the international community. One thing is clear: No international agreement has been reached on any subject between any States at any time by the methods to which the Jarring mission has so far been confined through Egypt's insistence.\n105.\tI am convinced that the strongest chance of breaking out of the deadlock lies in a transition to a rational negotiating procedure. The hour is ripe. The gap between the parties is wide, but may not be impossible to bridge. Negotiation is the agent which would transform the potentiality into action.\n106.\tOne of the most important things said about the Middle East in recent days is Sir Alec Douglas-Home's statement yesterday that \\\"distrust... of this depth ... cannot [easily] be removed by long-distance correspondence\\\" [1944th meeting, para. 98] and that \\\"those who are in confrontation must actively help to promote a dialog'' [ibid., para, 97], If all those who hold that view would express it with equal candor, an international movement in favor of abandoning the illusion of long- range correspondence would come to effective expression.\n107.\tThere is no weight or value in. the argument that the Arab Governments would be negotiating from weakness if they accepted direct contact under international chairmanship. Their point of reference would be, not the military situation, but the political forum in which the Arab side would speak from a position of numerical and geographical predominance,\n108.\tI therefore propose to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mr. Riad, that we take our guidance from the spirit which inspires the international life of our ags. Let us meet here this month under the auspices of the United States to discuss the details and! principles of a Suez Canal settlement; or under the chairmanship of Ambassador Jarring to discuss the establishment of peace in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) on the basis of our respective memoranda of February 1971. Let us break out of devious procedures and sterile polemics into a new vision and a new hope.\n109.\tIn a recent statement the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat, declared that he would sacrifice a million men to achieve a military victory. What he and we should be considering is how to ensure that the 33 million Egyptians, tin 3 million Israelis and the other millions in the Middle East are saved i.om sacrifice and preserved for the construction of a peaceful regional order. The task will not be served by war or by threats of renewed hostilities which command our vigilance but which are, in effect, an echo of ill-fated bombast in the recent past. Nor will our task be fulfilled by living out the rest of 1971 in ineffective debate or inflammatory resolutions. The Arab States may have enough voting strength to secure the adoption of virulent, unbalanced texts or to give a biased interpretation to the Security Council resolution, which would then cease to be an agreed documentary consensus available as a basis for the ultimate and inevitable negotiation. But what will it profit to gain an Assembly majority, but to lose Israel's adherence to a set of principles common to it and to neighboring States? The roads to peace do not have their starting point in war or in polemical debate. They branch out from one of the many avenues and by-ways of negotiation on which we shall meet Egypt when its choice is made and declared.\n110.\tThis session could mark a recuperation in the career of \\\"the United Nations if the Organization made this the year of negotiation, the year of negotiation in all outstanding disputes. It has other tasks. The Second United Nations Development Decade can be saved from the frustrations of the First if the advanced countries turn aside from the perils of monetary war towards an expanding vocation in the development of emergent societies.\n111.\tAnd in the last resort this Organization will be judged according to the role it has played in defense of human welfare and dignity, The call of kinship and of dark memory will bring us to refer at appropriate stages in Committees and in the plenary meetings to two dramas of great intensity and pathos: the Jews of the Soviet Union, of whom some have reached us but of whom the great majority are still restrained from the expression of their cultural identity and their national hope; and the captive remnants of helpless Jews in Arab lands, especially in Syria, whose anguished voice cries out for liberation from terror and despair. This Organization, for all its imperfections, is still the only organized expression of the planetary spirit. It may be bearing within itself the seed of a universal order in which men will come together to save their environment from pollution, their society from disruption, their economy from decline, their life from the stress and grip of violence. There is no room for fatalistic despair. There is still time for men and nations to be, inspired by a new and spacious vision and to invest their thought and labour in defence of the \\\"common heritage of mankind\\\".\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "168.\t Mr. President, allow me on behalf of the Khmer Republic as well as my own behalf to convey to you my very warmest congratulations on your impressive election to the office of President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n169.\tThis honor which your eminent qualities justly merit will redound to the honor of your great and beautiful country and on your brother nations of South-East Asia. We are convinced that, thanks to your ability, your impartiality and your spirit of equity, your lengthy experience in international affairs and the breadth of your political vision which my country has had an opportunity to appreciate, the work of the present session of the Assembly will go on in the spirit of Bandung, in an atmosphere of cordiality, understanding and tolerance. The Khmer delegation assures you of its full and friendly co-operation.\n170.\tMoreover we would be derelict in our duty if we did not avail ourselves of this occasion to convey to you again, Sir, our deep gratitude for the continuing support that the Indonesian Government and you yourself have given to our struggle to safeguard the independence, territorial integrity and neutrality of our country. The Khmer people and its Government will never forget the perseverant and courageous efforts that you exerted to this end at Djakarta, Dar-es-Salaam  and Lusaka.\n171.\tI should also like to associate myself with the words of tribute to Mr. Hambro, the outgoing President, who guided with competence and efficiency the debates of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\nMr. Ismail (People's Democratic Republic of Yemen), Vice-President, took the Chair.\n172.\tI wish in particular to pay a gloving tribute to the Secretary-General', U Thant, who has won the gratitude and admiration of the Khmer people for his tireless efforts to maintain and promote peace, security and justice throughout the world. His memorable accomplishments over more than a decade in the service of the United Nations and of mankind are almost beyond number. That is why we have received with deep regret the announcement of his decision not to accept a third term of office. We retain, however, the firm hope that, with the blessing of Buddha, he will agree to remain in his post, at least until the international community succeeds in reaching agreement on the choice of his successor.\n173.\tIt was with great pleasure that my delegation voted in favor of the admission to the United Nations of the States of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar on 21 September last [1934th meeting]. In so doing the Khmer Republic, which respects the principles of universality of the United Nations and of self-determination of peoples and faithful to its policy of neutrality and peaceful coexistence, hopes to establish ties of friendship with all countries, without distinction as to ideology or governmental regime. Accordingly, in addressing to the representatives of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar who are present here our sincere congratulations and best wishes for their we i-being, the Khmer Republic wishes to assure them of its friendly co-operation in all fields on the basis of the principles proclaimed in the Charter.\n174.\tFirst of all, I should like briefly to pass in review the tragic events that have taken place in my country. The Khmer Republic, a sovereign, independent and neutral State, a Member of the United Nations, which has always respected the principles of the Charter, has been the victim of an overt act of aggression by the North Viet-Namese and the Viet-Cong. This unjustifiable aggression has been going on for more than a year now. Its authors were convinced that they were going to be able in a very short period of time to crush the resistance of the feeble Khmer army of that time and of a people that was then in no way prepared to face the invaders. But these assumptions about our resistance, which Hanoi and the Viet-Cong considered would be ludicrous, have proved false, because they took no account of one decisive factor, namely, the patriotism of the Khmer people.\n175.\tMay I now set forth to the Assembly in broad general terms the present situation in my country.\n176: As part of our self-defense, we now have the initiative in operations on almost all the fronts, thanks to the determination of the entire Khmer people and thanks to the improvement in the organization and equipment of our national forces. Our fighters recently inflicted a series of defeats on the North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong invaders, in particular in the eastern Mekong region, where a North Viet-Namese division was almost completely wiped out. Our forces have succeeded in turning back all the enemy assaults and the operation that they conducted early in June 1971 enabled them to clear the zone of the enemy.\n177.\tThe victorious battles waged almost everywhere have clearly shown the progress made by the Khmer Army, which now has the weapons and material necessary to carry out its task of defense, whereas it completely lacked these means a year ago.\n178.\tThe true successes recorded in military terms, however, were overshadowed by the situation of our economy, which, already difficult enough before the events of March 1970, could not help but grow worse with the war of systematic destruction and extermination waged on our territory by the foreign aggressor troops. From the outset the Aggressors were able to occupy a part of our territory, in particular the rubber plantations region one of our principal resources and also the region of the Angkor temples, the center of our tourist activities. At the same time, contrary to what happened in South Viet-Nam, they engaged in the indiscriminate destruction of our economic infrastructure, in particular our means of communication and transport, our plantations, factories, workshops and industrial enterprises of all kinds, even those created from foreign aid, whether French, American or Chinese in source. They have even begun to attack enterprises placed directly under the control of the United Nations. Thus during the night of 24 to 25 September 1971, their assault troops attacked the storage depot for supplies and fuel of the construction plant for the Prek Thnotdam, an international project which we were able to set in train thanks to the personal efforts of U Thant and to the participation of a group of friendly countries.\n179.\tThese premeditated acts of systematic destruction have dealt a severe blow to our economy. Our exports have been considerably reduced. Many products have Income scarce on our markets and we are now witnessing a considerable rise in prices. Our Government has done everything in its power to remedy this situation. But its means are still of necessity limited because of the fact that we are at war and because of the criminal acts of our aggressors.\n180.\tThus, the Khmer Republic continues to be the victim of deliberate aggression on the part of the North Viet-Namese; the Viet-Cong, who, because they belong to a race completely different from the Khmer people, do not even spare our religion and do not hesitate every day to impose the most savage demands on the sacred persons of our monks and to engage in the deliberate destruction of our religious buildings.\n181.\tThe exactions from and the ms^ : of our civilian and religious population are increasing from day to day and are turning into true genocide. Our military authorities have discovered in regions recently liberated by our army many common graves which contain the bodies of villagers who were assassinated by the aggressors in cold blood because of their refusal to collaborate. This is a common practice adopted by the North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong to terrorize the population in order to force the people to rally to their cause.\n182.\tAmong the many acts of vandalism committed on Khmer territory there is one which affects the heritage which belongs not only to the Khmer nation, but also to all of mankind. The historic temples of Angkor, the preservation of which is still entrusted to the French School of the Far East, are in serious danger of destruction, because they have been occupied by North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong regular troops, who have made them their real sanctuaries and fortified military bases from which they attack our forces with impunity.\n183.\tIn this connexion, the Khmer Government, as of 11 June 1970, launched an appeal to all countries, and in particular to those that are signatories to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, signed at The Hague on 14' May 1954, to take the necessary steps and set in motion the necessary and appropriate activities in order to help us to enforce respect for and safeguard this artistic and cultural heritage. For its part, the Khmer Government could have freed Angkor by force, but it prefers to seek all possible peaceful means rather than to run the slightest risk of damage to these monuments. We want to spare Angkor from the fate of the historic city of Hud in Viet-Nam.\n184.\tThat is why, in accordance with the principles enunciated in the Hague Convention of 1954, the Khmer Government has again addressed a solemn appeal to all Member States and to all men of goodwill to help it to convert the Park of Angkor into a demilitarized, neutralized zone placed under international control.\n185.\tI hereby renew that appeal. The Khmer Government undertakes, for its part, to avoid any action or any military occupation of Angkor, and awaits a similar commitment from the adversary. International action for the preservation of these temples is exceedingly urgent, particularly as quite reluctantly, on 13 September 1971, the aircraft in which members of the Khmer Government were riding on their way to Siemreap, at the time of its landing at the Siemreap airport, came under the fire of mortars shot from one of the bases installed at the summit of the Bakheng monument in the Park of Angkor, wounding a number of the civilian population. In the search for a solution to preserve the temples of Angkor from destruction, we express our deep gratitude to the Secretary-General, U Thant, and to UNESCO for the efforts that they have made in this direction.\n186.\tWith respect to foreign affairs the policy of the Khmej Government continues to be based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, peaceful coexistence, reciprocity and neutrality. We do not seek to become members of a military bloc or alliance, no matter what type it may be.\n187.\tYet while fighting a war that we did not seek, we continue to proclaim our desire for peace and our devotion to neutrality. Accordingly, we warmly endorse the recent and dynamic initiatives taken by President Nixon to set up a constructive dialog with Peking. We are convinced that these initiatives increase the likelihood of peace and can contribute in large measure to diminish tension in the part of the world in which we live, which would be to tH utmost good of the smaller nations whose people wish to remain free.\n188.\tTaking into account our geographical position in a region where various ideological currents come into confrontation, neutrality proves to be a necessity for us, and, at the same time, a factor for peace and stability in South-East Asia. The Khmer drama has its origins in the violation of the Geneva Agreements of 1954 by others, and not by the Khmer people themselves, who have always respected those Agreements. We think, therefore, that a reversion to the strict application of those Agreements with the withdrawal of all foreign forces from our Territory would be the best way to restore peace to our country. There is no doubt that peace will be quickly restored in our country if the North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong forces withdraw finally and completely from our territory. That is why we support any initiative to revive those Agreements.\n189.\tI solemnly proclaim that the Khmer Republic abides by the various resolutions adopted by the General Assembly condemning direct or indirect interference by one State in the domestic affairs of another, rejecting aggression as the most serious of crimes against peace and calling for the establishment of relations of good neighborliness between States regardless of their social and political doctrine.\n190.\tWe reaffirm our respect for the right of all peoples to self-determination; we are opposed to the policy of racial discrimination; and we support the true liberation movements by peoples under colonial domination. However, we condemn the false liberation movements which sow subversion and exploit the credulity of peoples in order to practice annexationism, as in the case of the Viet-Cong and the North Viet-Namese.\n191.\tWithin the context of respect for human rights, my Government draws the attention ^f the Members of the United Nations to the fate of journalists assassinated in cold blood or carried off and kept prisoner by the aggressors. We should vigorously condemn these barbarous acts committed against innocent people who are only discharging their duty to inform. It is to prevent the truth from coming to light that these journalists have been either killed in cowardly fashion or kept as hostess. For its part the Khmer Republic, since the very first cases of disappearance of foreign journalists were noted on its territory, has spared no effort to discover their whereabouts or at least to obtain information about them.\n192.\tAccording to statements gathered from our rural population, there is no doubt that these journalists were captured by Viet-Cong and North Viet-Namese forces.\n193.\tAccordingly, we firmly support any action undertaken by international organs to achieve the same purpose. We have even taken the initiative along these lines by proposing, through an official statement of 17 March 1971, that the Viet-Cong and the North Viet-Namese prisoners that we had captured should be released in exchange for the journalists held prisoner by the aggressors. The Khmer Government has approached the International Red Cross in order to enter into negotiations with North Viet-Nam, but the latter has categorically rejected our proposal. We continue to offer broad support to various initiatives undertaken abroad to help the captured journalists and we support fully the initiative of the United Nations to help foreign journalists working in dangerous areas or those who are prisoners of the North Viet-Namese.\n194- In the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations the Khmer Government fervently hopes that our Organization will become truly universal in character. Accordingly, the Khmer Republic supports any country wishing to become a Member of the United Nations which agrees to abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter and the rules of international law. And it will not oppose the entry into the United Nations of the People's Republic of China, for it hopes that that Government will consider itself duty-bound to conform to the aforesaid principles.\n195.\tHowever, by virtue of these same principles, the Khmer Republic will oppose the expulsion of the Republic of China, which is recognized by many Member States as having always scrupulously fulfilled its obligations under the Charter and will vote against any resolution to bring about its expulsion.\n196.\tWith respect to the divided countries, in accordance with this principle of universality and because of its policy of non-alignment, the Khmer Republic is in favor of equal treatment for both parties in question and their admission to the world Organization, pending their reunification to be effected in accordance with the freely-expressed will of the peoples concerned.\n197.\tFurthermore we are still in favor of international and regional co-operation. We participate actively in the project of the Mekong Committee. We are already a member of the Asian Parliamentarians Union and of the Pacific Area Travel Association, and we hope soon to become a member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, the purpose of which is to promote economic, social and cultural co-operation among its members.\n198.\tThe situation obtaining in my country is sometimes judged with a patent lack of good faith. For example, in his statement of Tuesday, 5 October [1952nd meeting], the representative of Albania took it upon himself gratuitously to insult half a dozen countries. The Khmer Republic did not escape his violent diatribe. Since we have become accustomed to this since last year, the Khmer Republic was not at all surprised.\n199.\tIndeed, at the twenty-fifth session of the United Nations, Albania undertook to distribute to the representatives of States Members of this Organization a communique from GRUNK,  a puppet of\\\" Sihanouk, supporting the alleged legality of this overthrown prince and making unpleasant references to our Secretary-General, U Thant, who could not recognize him. Apart from a few representatives, no one took that communique seriously and some even went so far as to protest against the crude language used by Sihanouk about the Secretary-General.\n200.\tAlbania would not have aroused our interest if it had not intervened in our domestic affairs. In the statement to which I have already referred, the representative of that country allowed himself the luxury of describing the\nKhmer Government as a puppet regime and of calling its Head, Marshal Lon Nol, \\\"a docile instrument of the United States of America\\\"-a completely gratuitous allegation. To those who insist on coming to this rostrum to distort the facts concerning my country, I should like, on behalf of my Government, to reissue to them here the invitation I extended to them last year from this rostrum [1855th meeting] to come to our country and to see for themselves on the spot the realities of the aggression of which the Khmer people is a victim. We think that in so doing we are making a gesture of goodwill, and we are entitled to expect that in return they should grant us the just and equitable treatment which is due us, instead of continuing to adopt an attitude of discrimination towards us.\n201.\tIn this connexion I should like to inform the General Assembly that recently Khmer jurists invited by the President of the World Peace through Law Center to the Fifth World Conference on World Peace through Law, held at Belgrade from 21 to 25 July 1971, were unable to participate in that Conference as the result of the refusal of the Yugoslav authorities to grant them entry visas although our jurists were already en route to the Yugoslav capital. Tine, that Conference for world peace was organized outside the framework of our Organization, but the fact nevertheless remains that it was an international conference. Yugoslavia, by agreeing to receive it on its territory, was in duty bound to conform to the obligations of a host country and to respect the commitments undertaken by the organization issuing the invitations by setting aside any personal or political considerations. In submitting this case for the consideration of the General Assembly the Khmer delegation hopes that our Organization will examine the measures within its power to prevent countries legally represented in the United Nations from being treated in such an unfair and discriminatory manner on the occasion of international meetings or conferences organized under its aegis or with its approval. In our opinion, the selection of a country truly free of any complex of fear or discrimination is the most desirable choice. My delegation would even suggest that the country chosen should be one that undertakes to abide strictly by the obligations devolving upon a host country.\n202.\tFrom the picture I have just sketched, it can be seen that the war which has been imposed upon us by the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the so-called National Liberation Front of South Viet-Nam, known as the Viet-Cong, is I continue to repeat an act of true genocide. This slaughter of the unarmed civilian and religious population, the systematic destruction of any infrastructure which is essential to the existence of a country and which has no military character: these acts are designed to achieve one specific purpose, the extermination of the Khmer people and preparation for its ultimate annexation. For centuries we have witnessed the thrust of the North towards the South, and the North Viet-Namese continue today to pursue the annexationist aims of their ancestors. The disappearance of the Kingdom of Champa, struck from the map of the world, is tangible proof of this. Here you have the true face of North Viet-Nam and the Viet-Cong. What we have here is a new type of imperialism, pompously camouflaged under the label of a liberation struggle. They even camouflage their presence in the Khmer Republic and describe the war in our country as a liberation struggle between Khmers and Khmers, which is really the height of duplicity.\n\n203 Fortunately, the truth always comes to light in the end, Journalists and correspondents of the entire world press have a recorded their presence in the Khmer Republic, and even the former leader of Cambodia had to admit to a reporter from the French newspaper Le Monde the presence of his \\\"dear friends, the North Viet-Namese and the Viet-Cong, who had come to massacre his Khmer compatriots and ravage his own country.\n\n204. In the face of this mortal danger the Khmer people has risen up as one in this ultimate struggle to preserve its independence and freedom. But it is only desire is to live in peace and security within its own frontiers as they now stand. It therefore launches a pressing appeal to the international community to ask it to help in putting an end to this attempt at extermination and foreign domination, and to persuade the North Viet-Namese and Viet-Cong aggressors to withdraw from Khmer territory.\n"

        "file_text": "In the name of my President, H.E. Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and my delegation from Kenya,   am very happy to bid welcome to Foreign Minister Adam Malik of Indonesia as the President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am confident that, with his characteristic grasp of detail and dedication to the aims and objectives of the United Nations, he will steer the current session to a successful conclusion. I wish him every success in his difficult and challenging task ahead.\n2.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Edvard Hambro of Norway. He conducted the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly with speed, precision and decisiveness. His balanced judgment, constant endeavors to bring about accommodation and agreement in deadlocked situations, and his vast reservoir of knowledge left a deep imprint on the work of the twenty-fifth, session.\n3. I should like once again to reaffirm Kenya's dedication to the aims and objectives of the United Nations Charter. Amidst the clash of arms, financial crisis and the intricate maneuvers of power politics in this day and age, the United Nations has withstood the test of time. Its substantial contribution to the process of decolonization and development is an undisputed fact. Any success that has been achieved in the field of disarmament stands to the credit of the United Nations. Wherever peace and security have been threatened, the United Nations has not failed to exert maximum pressure on the side of order, tranquility and understanding. It has provided an invaluable forum for the exchange of views and dialog on issues of concern to the international community, irrespective of the status, social or economic system, level of development or military capacity of any State. It is Kenya's sincere hope that the ballots cast in this august Assembly will control the bullets fired far afield in the areas of conflict in the world.\n4.\tI should like to welcome into our fold the States of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar. Their membership in the United Nations marks yet another milestone in the universality of our Organization. We wish the new Members success and prosperity.\n5.\tI wish to survey the African scene in the context of the aims and objectives of the United Nations. Being an integral part of it, and considering the monumental challenges that confront us in this vast and varied continent, I hope my priority will be readily understood.\n6.\tIn southern Africa, the odious practice of apartheid continues to reign supreme. Portuguese colonialism has strengthened its stranglehold over the defenseless and innocent millions of Africans in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). Rhodesian rebellion, sustained by external forces, continues to flourish. The South African expansionists harbor designs of preserving physical control over Namibia in perpetuity under a discriminatory system. All these afflictions cast a dark shadow over the destiny of Africa. The security, survival and honor of Africa are at stake. In Africa of 1971, no less than 30 million Africans are still under white minority domination. Therefore, our grave concern for Africa is real; it is not merely an exercise in rhetoric.\n7.\tIn South Africa, the African is subjected to the vilest forms of oppression and degradation. He is denied basic human rights. His cultural heritage is being systematically destroyed by discriminatory laws and police terror. Any right of association and expression of grievances has long been stamped out. The tyranny of apartheid has decreed ruin and servitude for him. There is no glimmer of hope in the long night of darkness and desperation that has descended upon him. In such circumstances, a plea for mercy or reason is merely a cry in the wilderness.\n8.\tEvery peaceful method to win the rights of the overwhelming majority of black Africans has been frustrated by the white minority racist regime. This situation is bound to explode one day, unleashing a racial conflagration without parallel in history. Such an undesirable development will be the making of the supremacist regime , in Pretoria. This will be the choice dictated to the Africans by the unreasonableness and brutality of the whites in South Africa. It is clear from history that no force of arms or support from external forces ever cowed the will of people to be free. Kenya's own successful struggle against the might of the British is a sufficient reason for us in Kenya to believe in the eventual freedom of the Africans in South Africa.\n\n9.\tThe free States of Africa firmly believe in, and are in search of, a peaceful settlement of the situation in South \nAfrica, This has motivated them to offer the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa  to the supremacist nSgime of South Africa, The Manifesto stresses peaceful methods for the settlement of the problem there, It clearly demonstrates that free Africa holds no credentials for violence, The Manifesto is based on the recognition of the right of Africans to freedom and independence on the basis of equality and human dignity. It has been endorsed by the General Assembly /resolution 2505 (XX1V)J> by the Heads of ^te of member States of the Organization of African Una/ and by the non-aligned nations. It was totally rejected by South Africa. I wish to reaffirm here that Kenya believes in a peaceful settlement of this tragic situation. But one cannot blame the Africans in South Africa if their patience runs out and if they decide to take the path of armed struggle, The onus for a peaceful settlement now rests squarely on South Africa,\n10.\tIf Vorster, the Prime Minister of South Africa, signifies his acceptance of the Lusaka Manifesto, we, on our part, would be ready to exchange views with him. In such an eventuality, we would insist on democratization of South Africa being on the agenda.\n11.\tThe South African proposal for dialog is based on the concept of apartheid. It conveniently ignores the position of the African countries as outlined in the Lusaka Manifesto-a reasoned plea for equality, brotherhood, peace and independence, If Pretoria insists on advancing the proposal for a dialog in its present form, it would be well advised to initiate a dialog with its overwhelmingly black majority population first. After all, charity begins at home.\n12.\tThe acceptance of a dialog as at present proposed has many pitfalls. It will bestow the seal of recognition and respectability on the racist regime and the apartheid policy of South Africa. That will be a triumphant success for Vorster because the isolationism of his regime, which was beginning to erode apartheid and its discriminatory practices, would be broken.\n13.\tIf African countries accepted Pretoria's proposal for a dialog on the present terms, it would mean that apartheid which oppresses the black population of South Africa would be further entrenched with the blessing and the endorsement of sovereign African States to the north. The proposal does not guarantee the repeal of discriminatory laws nor the restoration of the fundamental political and economic rights of the Africans. That is why we cannot look at it in a favorable light.\n14.\tFurthermore, a new design is being unfolded in South Africa: the creation of what is Called \\\"Bantu Homelands\\\" (Bantustans). It is a maneuver to carry apartheid to new extremes. It is said that this exercise will represent a new system of separate development. Yet no development has got off the ground in the Bantu areas because development efforts are concentrated in the white areas. In short, it is a device to hoodwink the world into a recognition o\u00a3 institutionalized apartheid under the guise of home rule and self-determination. Kenya rejects these attempts to falsify the true situation in South Africa.\n1 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-fourth Session, Annexes, agenda item 106, document A/7754.\n15.\tThe call for a dialog, in short, is a summons to capitulate to tfes Fascist will of the white regime in South Africa, Kenya cannot be a party to such a maneuver and cannot collaborate with the existing racist order,\n16.\tThe South African regime has also offered a non- aggression pact to free Africa as a complementary move to the call for dialog, That offer was also intended to allay African fears of South African military capacity being turned towards aggression against sovereign independent States of Africa,\n17.\tMy Government categorically rejects that offer, The lesson of Munich still rings fresh in our ears. We have learned history, which has a way of repeating itself. We know that Nazi Germany's record of brutality, aggression and defiance of world opinion is today being imitated by South Africa. Munich, too, could be imitated.\n18.\tPortugal continues to pursue ruthlessly its objective of the perpetual colonization of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). Its oppressive policies and military adventurism have spelled disaster and untold suffering for millions of Africans in Its colonies. Portugal has embarked on a systematic policy of violating the territorial integrity of sovereign African States.\n19.\tWe appeal to the enlightened element of Portuguese opinion to convince the Portuguese administration of the Mies of a colonial war in Africa in an era of decolonization and tolerance. Portugal's shaky hold over the colonies cannot long be maintained against the determined drive of the liberation movements for freedom and sovereign equality. Let Portugal practice the wisdom of the United Nations on decolonization and benefit from it in the long run through accommodation with free Africa.\n20.\tWith regard to Namibia, the United Nations should ensure by practical action that it does not fall victim to the expansionist ambitions of Pretoria. In that context we welcome the recent decision of the International Court of Justice declaring the South African presence in Namibia illegal and invalid on the ground that Namibia is a Trust Territory of the United Nations over which the Mandate has been terminated by the United Nations itself. \n21.\tWe understand that the United Kingdom is resuming negotiations for a settlement with Smith and his racist henchmen. We cannot be satisfied with any arrangements that do not include the following principles: no independence without African majority rule; repeal of all discriminatory legislation in recognition of the right of the Africans to sovereign independent status; full participation of the Africans in any moves to settle the destiny of Zimbabwe in order to ensure a durable and just solution. That implies the right of African leaders currently languishing in Smith's prisons to participate in the negotiations on the future of that Territory.\n22.\tWe also recommend that the United Nations should be involved in ensuring the effective and demonstrable transfer of power to the African majority in Zimbabwe. \n23.\tWith regard to the question of the sale of arms to South Africa, I should like first of all to express Africa's appreciation to those countries which have complied with the Security Council's call for an embargo on the sale of arms to South Africa, However, we watch with shock and disbelief the rapidly growing Anglo-French trade in arms with South Africa in contravention of the United Nations position. Such trade amounts to an endorsement of the evil system of apartheid by the leading Western democracies. We hold that any move to bolster South Africa militarily is a move to strangulate African nationalism and self-determination and constitutes a threat to the security of Africa. These arms are bound to be used for internal suppression and for mounting aggression against the free independent States to the north. This will assist South Africa to solidify its bonds with the Portuguese colonialists and help the Rhodesian rebels to perpetuate white rule within South Africa. South Africa would likewise feel encouraged to pursue its expansionist ambitions in Namibia and other Territories to the north. We are satisfied that arms supplies to South Africa are not for security reasons but rather for purely economic reasons.\n24.\tBoth France and the United Kingdom fought the dark forces of oppression and enslavement of the Nazis. They should not now reverse their values and align themselves with the Nazi-style racism and brutality of the apartheid order. Both France and the United Kingdom occupy positions of honor as permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations. They should not be the first to undermine the resolutions of the United Nations. The United Kingdom, with its love for justice and the rule of law; France, with its long tradition of liberty and equality-both being leading democracies-should be the first to support liberty, democracy and justice in southern Africa, for what is good for their citizens in Europe is good for the black man in South Africa.\n25.\tWe appeal to all nations to refrain from giving aid and comfort to the oppressive white minority regimes in southern Africa because that will sustain in power the apartheid regime of Pretoria, the rebel clique of Salisbury and the impoverished dictatorship of Lisbon.\n26.\tHaving briefly surveyed the situation in southern Africa, I should now like to turn my attention to the other African issues of interest to the international community.\n27.\tKenya firmly believes in meaningful and concrete regional cooperation to foster economic and social development. In our own region, we have the East African Community, which is a very successful and unique experiment in common marketing arrangements and integrated development. Basic utility services, like railways, airways, harbors, taxation, customs and excise and research, are carried out jointly under appropriate bodies set up by the authorities of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. We are eager and ready to welcome the participation of other neighboring States to make these common market and common services arrangements wider and more fruitful in the spirit of African unity, co-operation and good neighborliness. Kenya is determined, despite temporary difficulties, to make a complete success of this joint venture, and commends this experience to the other regions of Africa,\n28.\tKenya is deeply interested in the Trans-Africa Highway from Mombasa to Lagos, which would link the east coast of Africa to the west, In our estimation, it is a project of monumental importance that will open up vast areas of Africa to development and the exploitation of its vast resources, and will foster closer economic and social co-operation. Intra-African trade would be stimulated and a much-needed network of communications established. To us it will have the same significance as the Trans-Siberian Railway, or the Trans-Canadian Railway. We are very glad that the Economic Commission for Africa is showing enormous interest in it. We urge the greatest possible involvement of the United Nations in this scheme through >ts Development Program.\n29.\tI should like now to address the Assembly on the other important issues that are crucial to the world community.\n30.\tWe welcome the more realistic and positive change in policy of several Western countries towards the People's Republic of China. We had pointed out right from the time of our independence that the policy of keeping the People's Republic of China out of the confines of the United Nations and its activities was not conducive to international peace and tranquility. Kenya has consistently championed the presence in the United Nations of that great country, which has a population of 800 million people, occupies a vast territory and is in full and effective control of its destiny. As a great Power with .impressive nuclear capability, its importance in international affairs cannot be minimized. We hope that, in taking its position in all the organs of the United Nations, Peking will play a constructive and decisive role on the side of peace, justice, international understanding and development.\n31.\tWe equally welcome the East-West detente in Europe. The recent Berlin Accord  has done much to defuse tension in Europe. Berlin was the festering sore in European politics that focused the East-West confrontation in a very dangerous context. We hope that this positive development augurs well for the over-all normalization of the European situation, which had been caught in the throes of constant turbulence as a result of the Second World War. Given the necessary will and the spirit of accommodation, the most dangerous situations in the political arena can be defused. We hope this spirit will be manifested in other areas of conflict as well.\n32.\tThe situation in the Middle East continues to be grim: a shooting war may erupt at any time. The disastrous consequences of such an explosion are too well known to need elaboration. The continuation of hostilities in the Middle East is of no benefit to any side; that war of attrition is a heavy drain on the material and manpower resources of the countries concerned. I fee closure of the Suez Canal has caused heavy economic losses, not only to the countries immediately involved in that conflict, but also to others whose shipping and trade-routes traverse the Suez Canal.\n33.\tKenya is committed to a speedy and equitable settlement of the crisis in terms of the Security Council resolution 242 (1967), But we are disturbed by the rising crescendo of the arms race which is being encouraged through the supply of sophisticated weapons of mass destruction in that area,\n34.\tWe have welcomed all peace initiatives in that conflict, including the Jarring mission, the Sisco mission and the recent British endeavor, We fully support the latest initiative of the Organization of African Unity fOAUJ to bring peace and order to that region. It is recalled that the last QAU summit  appointed a committee of 10 African heads of State to resolve that crisis in the African context within the framework of the Security Council resolution. We are gratified that both Israel and Egypt have welcomed this mission to visit Cairo and Tel Aviv. We hops that the present session of the General Assembly will endorse the 0 AU initiative*\n35.\tTurning to the International Development Strategy, I wish to point out that, although goals and objectives, and policy measures based on joint and concentrated action by developing countries and developed countries in all spheres of economic and social activity, were clearly spelled out, effective action is still lacking. The share of the developing countries in world trade has shown no appreciable rise, In fact, the protectionist policies of the developed countries are specifically directed against the primary products of the developing countries. Development has stagnated owing to acute foreign-exchange problems and a lack of finance, capital equipment and technical expertise.\n36.\tHigh interest loans continue to increase the indebtedness of poor countries. The benefits of aid are canceled out by various barriers put up against the export products of such countries. Rapid price inflation in the industrialized States has the effect of devaluing any aid given. Unilateral action should not be taken by industrialized nations in international monetary crises, because developing nations have a stake in this matter as well.\n37.\tHaving dealt with certain specific political issues, I should like to say a few words about the following items of economic interest to the world community.\n38.\tThe implementation of the International Development Strategy that was adopted [resolution 2626 (XXV)J by the twenty-fifth commemorative session of the United Nations remains of crucial importance to the entire world community. The Second United Nations Development Decade implies that we African countries should launch a coordinated effort at co-operation in development activities amongst ourselves. Intra-African trade must be stimulated. Infrastructural development on a continental basis should be initiated. Our economic growth should be promoted, not in mutual isolation, but on a regional and continental basis of co-operation.\n39.\tWhile discussing regional co-operation in terms of the International Development Strategy, I should mention that the Organization of African Unity has decided to hold the First All-Africa Trade Fair in Nairobi in February 1972. We are very proud to have been chosen to host this historic event in our capital. The Fair will demonstrate the range of products that emanates from all sectors of the African economy. It will also reveal the vast economic potential of all the African countries. The Fair will emphasize that the Organization of African Unity is not only a political forum of immense importance but also a powerful instrument for concrete African development in the economic and social fields.\n40.\tIn these economic matters, we appeal to the industrialized countries to take effective, prompt and comprehensive measures to help achieve the goals of the International Development Strategy adopted at the twenty-fifth session.\n41.\tThe Kenya Government believes that the exploitation and utilization of natural resources is cardinal to accelerated economic and social development and is largely dependent on possession of scientific technology. Therefore the transfer of technology and science to the developing countries for the development and exploitation of their natural resources is of paramount importance to those countries. The Kenya Government's interest in this field is manifested in its agreement to host the next session of the Committee on Natural Resources in Nairobi early next year. It is hoped that the Nairobi session will result in positive planning and action.\n42.\tAs in the other environments, the scientific revolution in marine technology has opened up new horizons and posed unprecedented challenges for humanity. The new advances are so spectacular and the benefits to be reaped by humanity so unlimited that it is no longer realistic to talk of certain aspects of the sea; one must deal conceptually with the marine environment in its totality, That explains why my Government enthusiastically welcomed the decision of the General Assembly to convene a conference on the law of the sea in 1973 to comprehensively with all matters pertaining to the sea [resolution 2750 (XXV)],\n43.\tOne issue of vital importance . is the question of effectively controlling and finally eliminating marine, river and industrial pollution. This problem transcends national boundaries and requires a global effort to combat it. All forms of pollutants, whether industrial, organic or military, pose a grave threat to humanity at large. They have deleterious effects on the living resources in the sea. They are a proven hazard to human life. They affect the economy of countries, particularly in the field of tourism, where hitherto lovely beaches have been rendered unusable 1>y oil slicks and other pollutants, Marine activities, including shipping and fishing, have been seriously hampered. The dumping of toxic, radio-active and other noxious materials can permanently damage the marine environment. It has also been pointed out by experts that the decay of certain pollutants harbors disease-causing micro-organisms. Therefore all these dangers, which can change the ecological balance of nature, should be eliminated by concerted international effort. Stringent national laws on pollution should be applied. Under international arrangements and with appropriate detection and enforcement machinery, this hazard should be contained before it gets out of hand. Developing countries should also ensure that pollution- causing industries are not established in their lands without adequate pollution control measures.\n44.\tRecent advances in outer-space technology have high-lighted the possibilities of the application of space technology to development in such fields as communications, television, meteorology, pollution detection and the surveying of earth resources. As with developments in other environments, the United Nations should ensure the transfer of outer-space technology to developing countries for their accelerated economic and social development.\n45.\tIn the field of disarmament, the world is trapped in a cycle of incongruities. Words are not matched by actions. We seek disarmament, but the result so far has been limited preventive measures of \\\"non-armament\\\". We aspire to the termination of nuclear tests in all environments; yet underground nuclear blasts occur with calculated regularity. Hie General Assembly has deplored the enormous expenditure on military build-up; yet these valuable resources have not been diverted to social and economic development. We seek to strengthen international peace and security; yet the arms race is deliberately encouraged in areas of acknowledged conflict. There is, in short, a lack of political will to take effective disarmament measures.\n46.\tTo ensure the success of any future disarmament measures, it is essential that all nuclear Powers should participate actively in such arrangements.\n47.\tThe United Nations is once again in the grip of serious financial insolvency which threatens its very survival. By a concerted action, in a spirit of dedication to this Organization, the solvency of the United Nations must be restored. Every Member State must pay all its assessed contributions, for it is only through regular and prompt contributions that the United Nations can carry out its most desirable functions of disarmament, development and decolonization and be able to safeguard peace and international security.\n48.\tI wish to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a tribute to Secretary-General U Thant* who has worked for the United Nations with dedication, decisiveness and distinction. His constant endeavors to strengthen the United Nations, world peace and international understanding will be recorded in the scrolls of history. His deep concern for the welfare of colonized peoples and the interests of the newly-emergent nations is well known. His absence from the councils of the United Nations will be deeply felt. However, w.. \\\"an take comfort in the fact that the spirit that guided work of the United Nations during his tenure of off;, g will not be lost in the difficult years ahead. On behalf of the President of Kenya, H.E. Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, and the Government and people of my country, I wish him a long, happy and successful life.\n49.\tNow, more than ever before, the United Nations is needed to complete its work in decolonization, disarmament and development and to keep international peace and security Let us all give it our unqualified support to accomplish those objectives.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "208. Mr. President, it is with genuine pleasure that, on behalf of the Republic of Guinea, I welcome your election to the Presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are all the more gratified by your election since, through you and your country, we are welcoming here a true representative of our great Afro Asian family. This means that, as a representative of the third world to which we belong and whose firm will it is to put an end to all foreign domination, you, Sir, for many reasons are in a favorable position to understand the urgent appeal made by representatives of almost three quarters of the world's population. We also take this opportunity to congratulate the VicePresidents who will be at your side and will work to ensure the complete success of this session of the General Assembly.\n209.\tThe Republic of Guinea is very happy to extend its warm congratulations to the delegations of the fraternal States of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar, and to wish all progress and prosperity to their courageous peoples.\n210.\tDespite all the efforts of our Organization to promote peace, progress and justice, my delegation is compelled to state that the international situation presents a very grave picture, and this is all the more disturbing because of the persistence of colonial oppression and the many imperialist colonial aggressions that have gained ground everywhere.\n211.\tOnly one year ago, through me, my delegation from this very rostrum [1859th meeting] warned international public opinion of Portuguese preparations for aggression, aggression that was to be launched against our country from the territory of Guinea (Bissau), with the complicity of NATO forces. Despite the many warnings of my country to the Lisbon Fascists and despite our urgent appeals to the United Nations, precisely during the celebration of its twenty-fifth anniversary, 50 days later, on 22 November 1970, my country became the victim of a barbarous aggression.\n212.\tAllow me today, 28 September the thirteenth anniversary of the historic vote by which my people rejected all forms of subjection and domination and achieved full sovereignty to extend to the representatives present here and to the valiant peoples which they represent the fraternal greetings of the people of Guinea and of their enlightened leader, President Ahmed Sdkou Toure, Supreme Authority of the Revolution, CommanderinChief of the People's Revolutionary Armys whose firm faith, indomitable courage, clairvoyance, lucidity, political wisdom and high moral virtues have made it possible for our people to frustrate all the Machiavellian plans hatched by the imperialists and to make our Republic a bastion of the anti-imperialist front in Africa.\n213.\tSince 22 November 1970 the people of Guinea has been confronted by a very serious situation. The imperialist colonialist aggression perpetrated on 22 November 1970 against Guinea by the Portuguese colonialist forces, supported by the NATO Powers, bears witness to the implementation by the imperialist camp of a plan for neo-colonialist reconquest of those zones of liberty which had freed themselves from the fetters placed on Africa by capitalist Europe. That brutal and brazen aggression, which was in violation of all rules of international law including the right of our people to live under its political and social regime, is evidence that imperialism recognizes only one law the law of force, the law of arbitrary violence, which it uses to oppose the legitimate cause of peoples struggling for independence, sovereignty and peace, namely, the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n214.\tI have already stated that today is the thirteenth anniversary of the historic decision of the people of Guinea to free themselves from colonialism and to recover their own personality and sovereignty. In so doing, my Government undertook the solemn commitment to adhere to Article 1, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations, to develop with all countries of the world friendly relations based on the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.\n215.\tThe international community will agree with me that it took only a few years for my country to achieve full political independence, to embark upon a full non-capitalist economic development and to achieve a genuinely African anti-imperialist regime. In Africa and in the world, it has been shown today that Guinea, thanks to its judicious political choice and to the efficiency of its organic structures, has ever-greater prestige among the forces of progress and peace.\n216.\tThus, the creation of' a national currency, the nationalization of banks and insurance companies, foreign trade, transportation and power; refusal to grant permission for foreign military bases on our territory; the absence of all foreign technical assistance in our administration; the control by the State over our natural resources, as well as the integration of the entire Army within our civil service with all political rights and career guarantees that are granted to all citizens; the promulgation of a single social security code, which makes no distinction whatever on grounds of sex or profession; the reform of the school system; the reduction of the salary spectrum; the effective exercise by our people of all the attributes of sovereignty by means of the 8,000 committees which have been set up as local revolutionary authorities in our country; and the permanent mobilization of our people for the purpose of ensuring our defense all this has made our country a strong ant-imperialist force in: Africa and has placed our country irrevocably on the side of those peoples who have always refused to bow down before imperialism.\n217.\tBy the reconversion of its structures and thinking, therefore, our country has refused to accept any foreign influence or ideology, be it military, economic, political or cultural.\n218.\tThe great progress achieved by my country in the field of social democracy has impelled international imperialism and its henchmen to undertake a policy of political and military aggression against our people and its freely chosen regime.\n219.\tThus, operating from certain neighboring African States, some expatriates after having served the French colonial army in operations aimed at the colonial reconquest of IndoChina and Algeria are now serving the cause of the Portuguese enemy.\t \n220.\tThe perfidious aggression of 22 November 1970 was carried out by Fascist Portugal; however, it is quite clear today that this aggression was planned, prepared and directed by a French network, namely, the Foccard group, acting in cooperation with the Federal Republic of Germany and other NATO countries.\n221.\tThe attacks of the Portuguese hordes against the Republic of Guinea are not of recent date, and our\nOrganization bears witness to this, because, mindful of its international commitments with respect to the Charter, my Government has informed the United Nations, through the Security Council, of political and military aggressions that have been .directed against our sovereignty and our existence.\n222.\tThe Security Council of the United Nations will recall that in July 1961, in February 1962, in April and October 1965, as well as in October 1966 and in June 1967, through letters sent to the President of the Security Council and to the SecretaryGeneral, my Government notified that body of the United Nations, which is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security of the following: first, constant violations of Guinean air space by Portuguese military aircraft; and secondly, bombardments of our villages by Portuguese aircraft and by Portuguese artillery, causing much loss of life and considerable property damage.\n223.\tThe Security Council members will recall the communication sent by the Republic of Guinea dated 27 August 1968, on which date a Guinean civil aircraft, after having made a navigation error, was compelled to make a forced landing in Guinea (Bissau) because it ran out of fuel and was confiscated, while its two man crew was detained by the Portuguese authorities.\n224.\tOur Assembly will also recall the appeal sent out by all the Heads of African States at a summit meeting held in Addis Ababa after the aggression of 27 August 1969 which was perpetrated in the Boke area of Guinea by five Portuguese patrol boats against the Guinean trawler Patrice Lumumba, which was loaded with cargo and passengers. In this open aggression a school teacher was killed and three civilians were wounded.\n225.\tOn 15 December 1969 the Security Council, acting on the request of my Government, met after a new, cowardly aggression had been perpetrated by the Portuguese colonial army against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country.\n226.\tThe violations of our air space continued and are still continuing. On 21 September 1971 two Portuguese aircraft of West German manufacture flew over the zone of Foulamory, which is located in the region of Gaoual, in the northwestern part of our country.\n227.\tOne year ago the delegation of which I am the head informed the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly on 2 October 1970 of preparations for an aggression against my country by Portugal, supported by its NATO allies, an aggression which was to be launched from occupied Guinea (Bissau).\n228.\tDespite the various appeals of my Government to the United Nations to force the Portuguese Government to put an end to this long series of misdeeds and infamous crimes, an astonished world was to learn that on 22 November 1970, operating from Guinea (Bissau), a Portuguese fleet\n6 Sixth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 10 September 1,969.\ndisembarked on the shores of the Guinean capital, and several hundred Portuguese commandos and mercenaries attempted to repeat, in the twentieth century, the gunboat policy by which Europe conquered Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n229.\tThe Security Council, which met in emergency session on the very day of the aggression at the request of my Government, decided in its resolution 289 (1970), to send a fact-finding mission to Conakry to study the situation on the spot.\n230.\tAllow me to recall the concisions of the report of the Security Council Special Mission to the Republic of Guinea:\n\\\"From the information received and the observations made by the Special Mission during its visit to Guinea an outline of the events of 22. and 23 November 1970 clearly emerges.\n\\\"During the night between 21 and 22 November a naval force appeared off the coast of Conakry. It consisted of two troop-carrying ships described as being of the type known as LST during the Second World War, as well as three or four smaller patrol boats.\n\\\"In the early hours of 22 November troops were taken ashore in a number of motorboats. The strength of the invading force seems to have been between 350 to 400 men. They wore uniforms resembling those used by the army of the Republic of Guinea, without any insignia, except green armbands. They were armed with infantry weapons, including bazookas and mortars.\n\\\"The force split into several groups. Some of the groups were assigned to strategic points in Conakry, such as army camps, the airport and the electric power station. One group demolished the summer residence of the President of the Republic of Guinea, while another made an abortive attempt to assault the presidential palace. The headquarters of the PAIGC  was also attacked. The invaders occupied an army camp in which Guineans imprisoned for activities directed against the Government, as well as the Portuguese captured in the fighting with the PAIGC, were being held; the [Portuguese] prisoners were released and some of them... were apparently taken back to the ships. The motorboats were seen to make frequent trips between the ships and the shore.\n\\\"Fighting continued at various points in the city until the morning of 23 November, after which the raiders withdrew to their ships and departed. The number of casualties is not known to the Special Mission with any degree of certainty. According to the Guinean authorities, over 100 attackers are being held as prisoners.\n\\\"The operation seems to have been well planned and\ncarried out with professional skill and precision\tThe\nattack against the residence of the President of the Republic of Guinea, coupled with the freeing of the Guinean prisoners, supports the belief expressed by the representatives of the Government of the Republic of \nGuinea that one purpose of the attack was to overthrow the Government and replace it with dissident elements....\n\\\"Regarding the origin of the invasion, the use of naval ships indicated that an external power was involved. The representatives of the Government of the Republic of Guinea had no doubt that this power was Portugal. This view was supported by information from other sources, including the prisoners interviewed by the Special Mission, as well as eyewitness accounts of independent observers and material evidence,\n\\\"After a thorough analysis of all the material it has gathered concerning the external, armed attack launched from the sea against the Republic of Guinea, the Special Mission has reached the considered opinion that:\n\\\"(a) The ships used to transfer the invading force to Guinean waters were manned by predominantly white Portuguese troops and commanded by white Portuguese officers,\n\\\"(b) The force consisted of units of Portuguese armed forces... under the command of the regular white Portuguese officers, as well as of a contingent composed of dissident Guineans trained and armed on the territory of Guinea (Bissau).\n\\\"In the beet judgment of the Special Mission, the invading force was assembled in Guinea (Bissau). The invasion of the territory of the Republic of Guinea on 22 and 23 November was carried out by naval and military units of the Portuguese armed forces, acting in conjunction with Guinean dissident elements from outside the Republic of Guinea.\\\" \n231.\tThose are facts which prove that that aggression was by no means an accident and that it was as we have repeatedly stressed the result of an operation that was organized at great cost to wrest from free Africa one of its regions most committed to the anti-imperialist and anti capitalist struggle.\n232.\tHowever, the enemy who thought that the firing of cannons and machine guns would suffice to cause the downfall of an African regime underestimated the ability of our people to defend itself. Thus it was convinced that the Guinean people supported its cause and that it would suffice to land in order to elicit sympathetic demonstrations of support. Events showed that he had grossly miscalculated, because not a single man, woman or youth among the valiant people of Guinea came out in its favor. The fifth column, which was camouflaged in our ranks, was immediately neutralized by the people bearing arms.\n233.\tThe report of the Security Council's Special Mission stresses, in paragraph 38, that \\\"The operation seems to have been well planned and carried out with professional skill and precision\\\". Indeed, according to documents taken from the prisoners, the plan of aggression of 22 November 1970 was called \\\"operation 5535547071\\\", the text, of which follows:\n\\\"First phase: logistic and tactical support. First by sea: Units 105223, throughout the entire first phase, will follow the routes for landing, furnishing protection and assistance if necessary. Once the objectives are attained by each group, two BA 12 landing craft will take to the port area of Conakry 500 men to obtain and strengthen control of strategic points.\n\\\"By land: points of departure two neighboring territories \\\"Ranger units 5670 stationed in the areas will give all necessary support to the transport and infiltration\ngroup\t 300 men aboard camouflaged helicopters will\nbe ready to assist the northern group\\\" starting from the same accomplice territories.\n\\\"Second phase:.. elements of the 1st and 3rd 'Mediterranean' parachute regiments will proceed at the request of the new government established immediately after the occupation of the various targets indicated in . the preceding plans. Fifteen minutes later a plane will arrive at the Conakry airport with the members of the new government, who will ask certain Powers... for military assistance to disguise the external military intervention, The new government will immediately be recognized... thus conferring a legal character on the operation.\n<c\n...\n\\\"Composition: 2 naval groups, 3 land groups from outside, and staff group will take part in the operation. First phase:... 2 land transport convoys from outside, 5 automobile transport convoys from within.... the general mission: internal opposition to the regime established by Sekou Toure, bound up with the interests of the free world, has given hope to the NSA... regarding the possibility of setting up in place of the present Government a nationalist government favorable to the interests of the Western world.\n\\\"This plan was drawn up through the special services of Portugal and with the full cooperation of friendly countries.\n\\\"... Bases of support as well as economic resources called for by the forces of political opposition in Guinea were planned to facilitate the work of certain officers and the acquisition on the spot of additional means of action requested in note 63870, which was received through Senegal.\n\\\"The general missions are as follows:\n\\\"(a) Transport groups: stationed in landing and frontier areas;\n\\\"(b) Reception groups: setting up a radio and protective unit to assure maximum safeguards for frontier crossings and landings;\n\\\"(c) Action groups: group A: occupation and control of Boke and Labe, together with the airports and public\nservices; after the arrival of the naval group; defense of the points indicated on the detailed maps must be guaranteed not only during the occupation of the targets at Conakry, but until such time as complete and total mastery of the situation in the country is achieved. Group B: occupation, control and defense of the civilian and military targets indicated on the pertinent maps. The principal objective is control of the airports and public services at Kankan, N'Zerekor and Kissidougou in Lower Guinea and in Upper Guinea'Group C: landing points; Dubreka, Boffa and Forecariah. Immediately thereafter, organization of various commandos in a pincer movement towards the capital. For achieving the objectives assigned to each group, priority is given to the occupation of public establishments and local airports with immediate neutralization of local police and military forces and the arrest of prominent persons> in accordance with document No, 11. Point of departure for the naval uni( Guinea (Bissau) Orange Naval Base,\n\\\"For Group A, point X2,... Mobile command post 5375 on the general operations map prepared by Eduardo da Silva> approved by Watson.\\\" \n234. The new plan against the life of our people is as follows:\n\\\"First: infantry to operate in coastal Guinea, starting from Buba that is an island in Guinea (Bissau)by motorized transport through Kandiafara, Kaluka, to reach Boke and occupy it> taking any action necessary. (Boke is the bauxite area, with large companies operating there.) They were to occupy Boke, for further action, first against Kindia, operating from Diaka, Dirota, Linguinal, Fria and Tondon cutting off Kindia and preventing the troops from the interior from reinforcing Conakry.\n\\\"Second, an attack on Conakry, along the Boke line, by air and sea Boki, Boffa, Dubrdka, kilometer 36 to cut off the special area of Conakry up to kilometer 36 and to occupy the city in collaboration with parachute elements in the Gbessia sector and with naval forces.\n\\\"...when Conakry is occupied, these troops are to occupy the north and act as reinforcements. These troops from Senegal leave a part of Beli (Guinea (Bissau)) by motorized vehicle, and by way of Lagui, Koumbia, Gaoual, Seriba, TianguelBory, reach Labe and occupy it With a view to further actions, principally against Conakry and then against Kankan. These troops are to link up with, elements from Kadara, on the frontier with Guinea (Bissau).\n\\\"Thirdly, infantry operating in Upper Guinea, coming from Somotou in Guinea, and by motorized vehicle to Kankan through Saladou, Tiriru, Mandiana, occupying it and linking up with the occupation troops in Middle Guinea (at Labe) through Kankan, Kouroussa, Banko, etc.\n\\\"Naval forces: three groups of ships to sail from Bissau, in close formation. Arriving at Rio Nufiez (near Boke), two groups to continue out at sea southward in the area of latitude 920 North and longitude 1510 West. The third group skirts the coast at a distance of about 40 or 50 kilometers and heads towards Conakry. This third group will consist of light warships and landing craft carrying troops and material. The first two groups, with the above mentioned coordinates, set their course for Conakry. Arriving at a point about 60 kilometers from Conakry, they separate, the first continues on to Conakry, and the second heads for the southern frontier to break up any counterattack coming from Sierra Leone or from the southern frontier. This group could, if there were no intervention troops, give support to the groups attacking Conakry. The group going directly to Conakry could provide support or reinforcement.\n\\\"Air forces: two groups, one for reprisals, to go about attacking various points and towns and creating havoc -a group for reprisals and intimidation; the other group, for airborne troops, transported by air from Kthio Guinea (Bissau), to head for Conakry on the line of Boffa, coordinates 940 latitude North, 1420 longitude West. The reprisal group continues on to Conakry to carry out its mission. The second group, airborne and airlifted, occupies the airport at Gbessia and cuts off the Conakry airport and the Alpha Yaya camp, and isolates the Conakry peninsula by surrounding it.\\\"\nFrom a curtain border'Ytfy with airborne and airlifted troops, take the Faranah airport and occupy it for logistic purposes; (b) counter any operations from Sierra Leone and Liberia and provide any support that might be needed for the troops at Kindia and Conakry.\\\" \n235.\tOn 3 August 1971, the authorities of my country intercepted a number of messages which were exchanged between two staff headquarters of the Portuguese colonial army relating to the implementation of the new plan. The Guinean delegation to the United Nations reported this matter immediately to the Security Council, which decided to send a mission to Conakry In order to consult the Guinean Government on its complaint.\n236.\tIn the view of my delegation, this conflict between Portugal, a Member of the United Nations, and Guinea, another Member of the United Nations, involves a very broad field of considerations which include the fundamental question of decolonization and the overt policy of aggression of Portugal against the neighboring African States committed to the implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).\n237.\tThe role of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security and, under Article 1 of the Charter, \\\"to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or Other breaches of the peace\\\".\n238.\tMy Government has stated its faith in the United Nations, and it expects the United Nations to use the powers available to it under the Charter in order to thwart the threat of aggression which is at present facing our country. The provisions of Articles 39 and 41 of the Charter call for the adoption of measures against States which have undertaken acts of aggression. These provisions are clearly relevant to this subject. Furthermore, in accordance with the wish expressed by the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session, the United Nations must take appropriate measures within the framework of the application of sanctions, in particular measures designed to prevent delivery to Portugal of all types of weapons.\n239.\tOur country states solemnly that it is ready as it was on 22 November 1970 to crush any aggression no matter whence it comes and to defend on its own soil the dignity and personality of Africa to the last Guinean.\n240.\tBy inflicting on the mercenaries a well-deserved lesson, the Guinean people implemented, Oil 22 November 1970, this important statement of President Ahmed S&kou Tourg:\n\\\"Let the enemies of Guinea make their plans; let them sharpen their weapons of destruction;!\\\"* them place their rockets, their bombs, their ships and their ill-gotten gains at the disposal of those who are against Guinea, not one inch of the sovereignty of our country will be yielded to them.\n\\\"From now on, the independence of Guinea is a fact and will remain so. Having now become a nation, a people, a conscience, a personality and hence a force, the democratic people's Republic of Guinea, which has irreversibly committed itself to the revolution, has totally and definitively reconquered the right to life and to freedom and the capacity to take part, with an ever increasing power of action, in the building of a new world.\\\"\n241.\tThe decolonization of vast territories in the world, and especially in Africa; the strengthening of the policies of white supremacy in southern Africa, linked to the growing development of the inhuman practices of apartheid in the South African Republic; and the tension which prevails in the Middle East, and the war imposed on the peoples of Asia by imperialism, the questions relating to the universality of our Organization, the preparations for complete and general disarmament, the question of the human environment, the codification of the law of the sea, the implementation of the International Development Strategy all these matters are part of mankind's concerns today.\n242.\tAfrica is the only continent where the worst type of colonialism still exists. Indeed, for more than 10 years the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) have suffered from barbarous colonialism, the colonialism of Fascist Portugal, which henceforth owes its survival only to the massive assistance provided by its NATO allies.\n,243. However, the freedom fighters, thanks to their determination to free themselves from the Portuguese colonial yoke, are winning victories every day, victories leading to the goal of national liberation. At this time, therefore, the world's conscience is asking how Portugal, which is so underdeveloped, can carry out such a policy of military aggression against so many African States in\nsystematic violation of resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. And it is here, in the view of my delegation, that the full responsibility of NATO is involved since the maintenance of Portuguese colonialist domination in Africa is due to the aid given by NATO to the Lisbon  Government.\n244.\tThis is why Guinea is convinced that the efforts of our Organization in the matter of decolonization will be futile as long as the NATO Powers are not made to face their responsibility by the United Nations.\n245.\tThe dispute which pits our continent against South Africa and the Rhodesia of Ian Smith is a conflict the dimensions of which are as well known as its objectives.\n246.\tIt suffices merely to recall the true context of this conflict, for it represents a new form of imperialism which some are seeking to impose on the southern part of Africa.\n247.\tWhile the era of colonialist expansion was marked by confrontations between coJ,o*iial empires as a result of which certain possessions simply changed hands and names, today, on the other hand, in the southern part of Africa, the former colonial Powers, having lost their empires, are resolved to keep their hold on South Africa so that they can integrate it into the Western defense system for the purpose of maintaining white supremacy in the southern part of Africa.\n248.\tFor this purpose, the imperialists have found, even in Africa itself, agents who advocate some kind of a dialog with the South African enemy.\n249.\tMy Government has taken a clear, precise and unambiguous position in this regard. We reject any policy that involves a rapprochement with South Africa, that would tolerate its policy of racial discrimination, even if such policy is that of a country of the African continent. The democratic and popular Government of Guinea considers that to be a policy of high treason against Africa and against the South African freedom fighters. We regard as Reason any dialog with the illegitimate Pretoria Government for the obvious reason that the heroic struggle being carried on by the African peoples in that country falls within the framework of Africa's battle to recover its dignity, justice and its own personality.\n250.\tWith respect to Rhodesia, we have always asserted, and we assert now, that only armed force can put an end to Ian Smith's revolt, all the more so since the British Government, through its complicity, is no longer able to bring about the adoption of constitutional measures for transferring the power in Southern Rhodesia into the hands of the maj ority population of that country.\n251.\tWe deplore the farce that has been called an \\\"economic blockade of Rhodesia\\\". In this connexion, my delegation decries, denounces and condemns all forms of economic, military and other aid afforded to the colonialist and racist regime of Ian Smith. We likewise regard any sale of arms to South Africa as an antiAfrican act and we urgently appeal to France to refrain from building factories that would make possible the manufacture of Mirage aircraft in that country. \n252.\tThe International Court, requested by the Security Council in its resolution 284(1970) to give an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of South Africa'?,, presence in Namibia, by 13 votes to 2 rendered its judgment by declaring South Africa's presence in Namibia illegal, As a result of the decision, the United Nations must assume its responsibilities all its responsibilities as regards tin's problem. It goes without saying; what is more, that all diplomatic and other missions to Namibia should deal with the authorities of that country and not with the Pretoria Government.\n253.\tThe Middle East is another source of deep concern for my delegation, On 5 June 1967, in violation of Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter, a State, Israel, committed one more treacherous aggression in its long list of aggressions against three Arab States. The consequences of that aggression have not yet been eliminated, despite the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) formulated, decided and imposed by those who are commonly called the \\\"guardians of the world's conscience\\\" in matters of international peace and security by virtue of the Charter. Those consequences are the cause of the grave and dangerous tension that prevails in that region,\n254.\tThe fact is that today the State of Israel in seeking to bring into being plans that have been contemplated ever since 1919 by the world Zionist organization. As events have since shown, the invasion and the refusal to evacuate the occupied territories fit perfectly into those plans.\n255.\tThe area of the territories at present occupied is four times as great as that envisaged in 1947 by the United Nations plan [resolution 281 (II)j and the plan of expansion, The territorial area occupied today Is several times larger than the territory envisaged in the Zionist plan of 1919.\n256.\tMy delegation is convinced that the plot hatched by international imperialism acting in concert with Zionism is to impose on the Arab nation the reality of Israel, with all that entails of usurpation, arbitrary action and violation of human rights,\n257.\tIsrael's stubborn refuse to evacuate the illegally occupied Arab territories that it seized in its aggression of 5 June 1967 shows how unstable is the peace in the Middle East area.\n258.\tThus, in the view of my delegation, any effective solution of this crisis must take into account the Palestinian element.\n259.\tThe Republic of Guinea, true to its anti-imperialist policy, reaffirmed before this Assembly its full support for the Arab peoples in their just and legitimate claims for a Palestine with all its legitimate and inalienable rights to freedom and independence restored.\n260.\tWith regard to VietNam, how can we refrain from expressing our deep concern over the dirty war imposed by imperialism on the valiant VietNamese people? We hail with respect and admiration the heroic peoples of VietNam, Cambodia and Laos, who every day are inflicting cradling defeats on the American forces and their allies.\n261,\tOur delegation supports and approves without reservation the seven-point proposal of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam.\n262,\tWe do hope that the United States will finally come to understand the necessity of unconditionally and totally withdrawing its forces of aggression so that the VietNamese people may settle their own problems among themselves,\nThe same applies to the question of Korea, It is high time indeed that the United Nations troops were withdrawn from that territory and the courageous people of that divided country be allowed to settle their own internal problems with no outside interference,\n264.\tThis year too, even more than in preceding years, my delegation is deeply concerned over the absence from the United Nations of the powerful and peaceful People's Republic of China.\n265.\tThat great Power, the most populous in the world with its 750 million inhabitants about a quarter of all mankind a founding Member of the United Nations, owing to systematic maneuvers has, since 1949, been denied the seat to which it is fully entitled. To try to entrust to the Chiang Kaishek clique the representation of the Chinese people is nothing less than stubbornly and deliberately to disregard, in absurd and dangerous fashion, historic realities.\n266.\tFor years my Government has constantly denounced the hostile, discriminatory policy adopted towards the legitimate Government of China, the only true representative of the great Chinese people, which has on so many occasions given concrete proof of its love for peace and its desire to contribute to the political, economic, social and cultural development of the world of today.\n267.\tThe United Nations has a duty to put an end to this inadmissible and dangerous situation, which some wish to foist on the world in unprincipled fashion in order to implement a policy that has been disavowed by the peoples concerned.\n268.\tMy Government hopes that this year the General Assembly will decide to restore to the People's Republic of China its legitimate rights as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kaishek from the seat they have been illegally occupying in the United Nations for over 20 years.\n269.\tMy country is deeply committed to the effective achievement of general universal disarmament, and we feel that only that form of disarmament will make it possible to achieve true peace-not peace that can best be described as a state of non-war. Thus my delegation will support any proposals aimed at ensuring the participation of all countries in the solution to this problem.\n270.\tThe question of the human environment, that is, of the quality of life on the planet, is also a matter of deep concern to my delegation. We believe the gravity of the problem of the environment results from the difficulties encountered by the developing countries in proceeding towards their rapid industrialization. Consequently, any useful dialog among the developed and developing countries aimed at averting this danger should take full account of the responsibility devolving upon the more favored countries.\n27 L International cooperation is a historic necessity today. Therefore it should lead nations to assist each other in improving their material situation. However, this cooperation if it is to benefit all concerned must be based on the principles of equality and respect for the dignity and worth of all parties.\n272 Today, no nation and no people, however developed it may be, can do without such cooperation without harming its own future, for the will to cooperate broadens the possibilities for economic, intellectual, moral and political development. And the natural consequence of this trend is to strengthen the ties of brotherhood amongst men. My delegation feels that, after the adoption of an International Development Strategy and the approval of a general preferential system, the activities of United Nations development machinery should be aimed at the adoption of practical measures to implement decisions taken on the subject.\n273.\tIn this respect, at its twenty-sixth session the General Assembly should set forth guidelines for the use of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n274.\tIn my delegation's view, resolution 2749 (XXV) of the General Assembly, concerning the Declaration of Principles Governing the Seabed and Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, represents a step forward within the framework of efforts being undertaken by the international community to achieve harmonious development of the law of the sea and the seabed.\n275.\tA number of delegations rightly considered the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly to be a session for the evaluation of problems still facing our international Organization. For that reason the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly should be one of bold decisions taken with the purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of the role of the United Nations.\n276.\tFor, indeed, if the purpose of this Organization is to reflect trends in the world of today it also has the responsibility of promoting continued progress. Therefore, in my; Government's view, the Assembly at its twenty-sixth session should aim at the following:\n(a)\tStrengthening the role of the United Nations with regard to the solution of international problems;\n(b)\tAchieving universality for the Organization, having regard for the urgent need to restore to the People's Republic of China its lawful rights in the United Nations;\n(c)\tStrengthening the roles of the General Assembly and the Security Council, at the same time fostering close cooperation between these bodies in order to safeguard peace and security;\n(d) Ensuring the greatest possible participation of Member States on a basis of equality and equitable geographical representation with respect to the adoption of decisions dealing with the achievement of the purposes and principles of the international Organization.\n277.\tThose are the general considerations that guide our delegation in its study of the important items on the agenda of this twenty-sixth session.\n278.\tI should like now to perform a very pleasant duty. I have been authorized by the President of the Republic of Guinea, Ahmed Sekou Toure, to extend, on behalf of the people and Government of Guinea, deepest thanks and warmest congratulations to SecretaryGeneral UThant, whose high moral and human qualities and whose lofty sense of human dignity and justice have won for him the admiration and respect of the entire international community.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "42.\t Mr. President, I am proud and happy to congratulate you, on behalf of the Indonesian delegation, on your election to the presidency of this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your assumption of this high office is a fitting tribute to your years of service and dedication in the field of international relations, and it is an honor for Indonesia to share with this august Assembly one of its most outstanding citizens.\n43.\tMay I also pay a tribute to your distinguished predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, whose wise leadership, experience and understanding helped to steer us successfully through last year's milestone session: the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations.\n44.\tI would like to extend also on behalf of my delegation a warm welcome to the four new States Members of our Organization admitted this year. We feel certain that the participation of Bahrain, Bhutan, Qatar and Oman will greatly contribute to our deliberations and decisions and will strengthen the United Nations by bringing us one step closer to universality of membership.\n45.\tMr. President, in your opening address to the Assembly [1934th meeting] you emphasized the theme of universality, urging us to work for a universality of peace as well as of hope in this era of interdependence.\n46.\tUniversality implies, first of all, conquering our worst enemy: man's basic self-centeredness, which affects all relations whether interpersonal, national or international. It means the submersion of narrow national ambitions in the broader stream of common interest. It requires the forging of a new global vision and a global capacity to deal with the problems of our time.\n47.\tThe timeliness of your appeal is confirmed by the situation we see around us. The world seems to be going through a period of far-reaching transition and change. Yet, deep-seated contradictions and inequities continue to dominate international life.\n48.\tOn the one hand, the sharp divisions of the early cold war years are dissolving into a new multi-polarity in the international power constellation. The tremendous advance of modern technology is opening up unprecedented possibilities for progress, while transforming the dimensions of international relations. Ideological intolerance is slowly giving way to a general search for new forms of global accommodation and coexistence.\n49.\tOn the other hand, the trend towards detente among the major Powers still fails to improve the security of the smaller and weaker nations. It has not removed the scourge of war in various regions of the world. The benefits of modern technology have yet to reach the majority of mankind, while its unrestrained use now threatens to degrade the human environment. And, as the Lusaka Declaration so eloquently states, \\\"In spite of the great achievements and aspirations of our generation, neither peace, nor prosperity, nor the right to independence and equality, have yet become the integral and indivisible attributes of all mankind.\\\" \n50.\tThus, the era of transition in which we find ourselves today raises our greatest hopes, but also presents us with grave challenges.\n51.\tThe essential task we face is the structuring of a new international order that will make possible the establishment of genuine peace in the world and the equitable sharing of economic prosperity in freedom and social justice for all. Whether such an international order can emerge in the future will depend on how we decide to resolve a number of fundamental problems confronting us today.\n52.\tHow to obtain effective nuclear arms control so as to enable us to move towards general and complete disarmament; how to build an international economic and monetary system that will ensure stability as well as continued growth for the developing countries; how to exploit the new resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor under arrangements equitable to all; how to e* 1 '\\;e war in Indo-China and the Middle East, relieve tk: v uTerings of refugees on the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent ^ in Palestine, and eradicate racism and colonialism in Africa these are some of the problems to which we have to find the collective answers, and of which will depend the shape and conditions of the new international order that will emerge.\n53.\tIn facing these problems, there is indeed legitimate reason for hope. The most cynical pessimist cannot but acknowledge the growing tendency towards rapprochement among the major Powers, evident at various levels and within several regions.\n54.\tThe degree of accommodation and integration taking place in Europe at present increases the prospects for peace and stability in that area, and thus internationally. In this context, my delegation particularly welcomes the recent Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971 as a first step towards a conference on European security.\n55.\tProgress so far achieved in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, although still limited, brings us a step closer to our shared aim of general and complete disarmament.\n56.\tIndonesia is also heartened by the steps which the United States and the People's Republic of China have taken with a view to normalizing relations. My Government has always welcomed any development which could support and strengthen the conditions for world peace and international security. Our response to the United States- China rapprochement, therefore, is based on our hope that this new development will indeed bring greater peace and security to the world and especially to Asia and will effectively contribute to the resolution of such fundamental problems as disarmament, the Indo-China war, the question of divided countries and related issues.\n57.\tAside from these hopeful aspects, however, the most critical and explosive sources of international tension still remain, and we are today, more than ever, faced with the problems of human conflict and suffering, injustice and discrimination in various forms.\n58.\tUndoubtedly, the most urgent of these problems is actual and potential war, casting its shadow over various regions of the world, in south and South-East Asia, in the Middle East and in southern Africa.\n59.\tThe war in Indo-China continues to prevent the early stabilization of peaceful conditions in South-East Asia. As such, it remains a potent threat to world peace, a fact which, due to the prominence of certain other questions of international concern, seems unfortunately to have been relegated somewhat to the background.\n60.\tThe heavy toll of human tragedy continues unabated. For almost 30 years now the people of Viet-Nam have suffered the agony of war, and an entire generation exists which does not even understand the meaning of peace.\n61.\tAs a close neighbor, Indonesia cannot but have a direct interest in what is happening in Indo-China. With the other countries of South-East Asia it shares the need for peace in the area as a prerequisite for development. That is why my Government took the initiative last year of organizing a conference of Asian Foreign Ministers on the question of Cambodia. The decisions we made then are still relevant to the situation today. The Djakarta Conference on Cambodia demanded, among other things: the withdrawal of all foreign troops to facilitate the cessation of hostilities; respect for the sovereignty, independence, neutrality and territorial integrity of the countries concerned; the reactivation of the International Commission for Supervision and Control, and the convening of an international conference similar to the Conference on the Problem of Restoring Peace to Indo-China, which met at Geneva in 1954. \n62.\tAnd when, earlier this year, events in Laos took a turn for the worse, Indonesia, together with Japan and Malaysia, again initiated a series of direct appeals to all parties involved and actively sought concrete ways to overcome the impasse.\n63.\tMy Government remains convinced that peace in Indo-China cannot be achieved by military means, and that a political solution, to be lasting, should take into account the legitimate wishes of the Indo-Chinese peoples themselves. We maintain the hope that the present stalemate in the Paris peace talks will be broken soon and that an acceptable formula for a settlement can be reached on the basis of various proposals already submitted to this forum.\n64.\tIn the Middle East, Israel's adamant refusal to comply with the essential conditions for peace as provided for in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) remains the principal cause of continuing and explosive tensions in the area.\n65.\tFor four years now, Ambassador Jarring, the Secretary-General's Special Representative to the Middle East, has untiringly devoted himself to helping to find a solution based on the above-mentioned resolution. His efforts and proposals have met with the support and sympathy of all parties except Israel. On the other hand, the President of Egypt, Mr. Anwar El-Sadat, has shown commendable reason and courage in declaring Egypt's willingness to sign a peace accord with Israel provided Israel withdraws from all Arab territories occupied since the June 1967 war, and even to reopen the Suez Canal as a first step towards an over-all settlement.\n66.\tIt is clear that Israel's intransigence directly undermines the prestige and authority of the United Nations. Its continued illegal occupation of Arab territory and its persistent denial of basic human rights to the Palestinian people constitute serious violations of the Charter. And even as recently as a fortnight ago, Israel once again showed its total disregard for Security Council resolutions on the status of the City of Jerusalem.\n67.\tIndonesia remains firm in its conviction that the acquisition of territory by military force cannot be tolerated. The complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Arab lands should, therefore, be the starting-point from which to develop all further efforts to attain a just and durable peace. We will continue to stand on the consistent implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), as well as of last year's General Assembly resolution which guarantees the Palestinians their inalienable right to self- determination [resolution 2672 C (XXV)]. We reaffirm our support to Ambassador Jarring's mission and welcome any other initiative, including interim agreements, to secure these objectives.\n68.\tThe tragedy of civil strife in Pakistan is another matter of deep concern to Indonesia. While my Government regards the political turmoil in the eastern part ^ that country as an internal affair of Pakistan, we realize that the resultant problem of refugees should be the humanitarian concern of the international community also. Indonesia, therefore, fully supports all efforts to extend relief to the distressed people of East Pakistan, as well as to the refugees in India. It has appealed to both India and Pakistan to resolve the tensions that have arisen between them, through peaceful negotiations and without recourse to force or mutual recrimination. And we entertain the hope that with the return of a civilian administration in Dacca, the confidence of the people will be restored and the general situation in Pakistan returned to normalcy.\n69.\tThe threat of war is not limited to Asia. Colonialism, neo-colonialism and racism continue to hold sway in southern Africa and create tensions constantly endangering world peace.\n70.\tDespite all the efforts of the United Nations, over so many years, large parts of Africa continue to suffer under colonial oppression and racial discrimination. I refer to the Portuguese Territories of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), to Namibia and Southern Rhodesia, and to the abhorrent manifestation of racism which is apartheid in South Africa. Even worse, Secretary-General U Thant has alerted us to the fact that there has been a slowing-down in the pace of decolonization during the last few years [A/8401jAdd.1, para. 55], due mainly to resistance or lack of co-operation in implementing United Nations decisions on the part of certain Member States.\n71.\tMy delegation wishes to stress the importance of the program of action for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted by the General Assembly last year [resolution 2621 (XXV)]. Within the framework of that Declaration, we reiterate our full support for all relevant decisions and resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. We also welcome the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on Namibia, in the earnest hope that it may bolster the determination of the Security Council to take resolute action and to put a stop to the continued defiance of the authority of the United Nations by South Africa and Portugal.\n72.\tWe appeal to all nations to co-operate in implementing the above-mentioned decisions. But we would like to address ourselves specifically in this regard to the big Powers and the major trading nations of the world. It is they who possess the influence and capability to impose the necessary economic and political sanctions on these colonial regimes.\n73.\tColonialism and racial discrimination, under whatever guise or label, are anachronisms we should no longer tolerate at this stage of world development. Instead, all of us should actively work for the liberation of the Territories remaining under colonial bondage, so as to enable them to join the United Nations and thus contribute to the strength and universality of our Organization.\n/4. The principle of universality also determines the manner in which we view the question of the representation of China. Ever since this issue arose in the General Assembly, the Government of Indonesia has taken the position that there is only one China the People's Republic of China and that, therefore, China's seat in the United Nations, including the Chinese seat in the Security Council, rightfully belongs to it. This position remains unchanged, in spite of the suspension of diplomatic relations between our two countries. In this respect Indonesia maintains that normalization of bilateral relations must be settled on the basis of the principles of the Bandung Declaration^ of which both are signatories, notably the principles of non-interference and respect for each other's sovereignty. Indonesia hopes that, by assuming its rightful place in the United Nations, the People's Republic of China will be placed in a position where it will carry out its foreign policy with full responsibility for peace and security in the world, and especially in Asia.\n75. Moreover, the participation of the People's Republic of China in our work and deliberation? will considerably strengthen the authority of the United Nations and add to its effectiveness. For it has become obvious that the solution of many outstanding world problems requires China's participation. At the same time, however, we are fully aware that the restoration of the lawful right, of the People's Republic of China may leave important residual problems arising out of the political realities existing in the region and as also reflected in the United Nations itself. We hope that the parties concerned will be able to reach a satisfactory solution to these remaining problems.\n76.\tI turn now to the question of the so-called divided nations. We only wish to restate our position that the divided nations should be admitted to membership in the United Nations, and that the peaceful resolution of their differences, which has our support in principle, should be considered an internal affair of those countries.\n77.\tAs to the question of disarmament, we recognize that there have been some limited achievements in this field. But our main concern that of general and complete disarma-ment, including a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty is far from being achieved. In this connexion a world disarmament conference, as proposed by the Soviet Union [A/L.631], certainly deserves our serious and sympathetic consideration. But that conference should be carefully planned. It should be held under the auspices of the United Nations and with all States participating.\n78.\tBut let me stress that the aim of general and complete disarmament must also be seen in the light of development. The figures for armament expenditures are appalling. Our Secretary-General quoted a figure of over $200,000 million for 1970 alone [A/8401/AddJ, para. 42]; that is to say, the equivalent of a total year's income of all the developing countries.\n79.\tLast year the General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the establishment of a link between the Disarmament Decade and the Second Development Decade [resolution 2685 (XXV)]. The International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)], which was adopted in the context of the Second United Nations Development Decade, is aimed primarily at reducing the gap between the rich and the poor countries, redressing the unequal distribution of wealth, power and resources and the unbalanced access to scientific and technological knowledge. As my delegation sees it, the deeper significance of this Strategy lies not in the gods per se but in the collective commitment and responsibility we have jointly undertaken.\n80.\tBut, unfortunately, recent developments, especially in the trade and monetary fields, have run counter to this commitment, and have added to the already aggravated burdens of the developing countries. The present monetary crisis has not only led to a loss in the real value of our monetary reserves, but also to a reduction in development assistance at a time when the need for such assistance has substantially increased. Moreover, the danger of a revival of economic nationalism that is, a tendency towards protectionism discernible in certain quarters if not checked threatens to halt or even to reverse the growth of international trade.\n81.\tThose developments only serve to underline the interdependence between nations. It is clear, then, that the present situation can be remedied only through collective measures, which must be carried out in a spirit of co-operation between developed and developing countries, with mutual goodwill and understanding.\n82.\tAny solution to the current crisis must not impose additional burdens on the developing countries and must adhere to the principles set forth in the International Development Strategy. The developing countries must be compensated for any loss in the real value of their monetary reserves. Also, a new international monetary system must be evolved which would provide additional development financing to developing countries and which would be geared to a more dynamic concept of world trade, based on a new international division of labor between developed and developing countries. New conditions must be created which are favorable to the expansion and liberalization of trade.\n83.\tWe should like to stress the significant role of the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development [UNCTAD] in solving these problems. We earnestly hope that the third session of UNCTAD, to be held in Santiago, Chile, and the preparatory conference of the Group of 77 in Lima, Peru, will provide both the impetus and the instrument for further liberalization and expansion of trade in the developing countries. In particular, we should like to emphasize the urgent needs for the speedy removal of all tariff and non-tariff barriers.\n84.\tOf vital importance to the success of the Second Development Decade is the monitoring mechanism on the national, regional, functional and world-wide levels. Concerning the global, over-all level, we feel that the Economic and Social Council should play a primary role in the review and appraisal of the Decade's progress and achievements. As the President of the Council, Mr. Driss of Tunisia, has pointed out, all efforts to strengthen the Council in this vital function are welcomed as timely and appropriate. Measures to expand the membership should go hand in hand with measures to expand its functions.\n85.\tBut, ultimately, the success of the entire Strategy is only possible once we have established a concrete link between the Second Development Decade and international peace and social justice. The Second Development Decade should only be seen as a part of a global commitment to solve our major problems: those of the environment, the population explosion, technological excess, the future exploitation of new resources, of the continental shelf, the sea-bed and the ocean floor, as well as a more equitable distribution of the resources and wealth already available to us. Problems of development cannot be regarded without this reference point to international social justice. We must work within the framework of our mutual interdependence, developed and developing countries alike, always keeping this crucial link in mind.\n86.\tI have dwelt at some length on the problems of development. This is only natural, since to Indonesia economic development remains a matter of the highest priority in our Government's program. As in the past three years, Indonesia this year once again made significant progress towards monetary and economic stability.\n87.\tHand in hand with economic stability, of course, goes political stability. We have just passed another important phase in our national development. The general elections of 3 July 1971 resulted in a more representative parliament closely reflecting the aspirations of the people. That is a clear endorsement by the people of all of those in our society favoring planned development, rationality and realism in government.\n88. Finally, I should like to convey my delegation's most sincere appreciation to our Secretary-General for the devotion to the ideals of the United Nations he has shown over the past decade. In this period, U Thant has gained the t! y,cx and friendship of all who have come to know him and work with him. We shall remember the contributions he has made to the Organization during these most difficult and challenging years. We join with other delegations in expressing regret at his decision to retire from the position of Secretary-General, and to wish him and his family the best of health and happiness. It is our hope, however, that the United Nations may continue to benefit from his vast experience, wise counsel and guidance in the future as; t has in the past.\n\n"

        "file_text": "50.\t Mr. President, I take pleasure in congratulating you upon your well-deserved election to the presidency of this Assembly, and I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Edvard Hambro upon his successful tenure of office at the previous session.\n51.\tTo U Thant, on behalf of the Government of Bolivia, I should like to express our sincere appreciation; he has earned the confidence of many nations during his long tenure of office, in which the destiny of humanity has wavered between uncertainty and hope, and he has measured up to his task.\n52.\tMy welcome goes to the young countries of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar on their democratic entry into the United Nations. They will surely contribute to our cause with their force of spirit and their creative energies.\n53.\tI bring to this Assembly a message from a country situated in the centre of South America, from a people great in terms of its virtues and sacrifices, a people which has been able to overcome, worthily, many misfortunes and from a nation which emerged at the dawn of time with the appearance of our original races and which married the Spanish conqueror and then gave birth to the Republic. That was a social compact to which we in Bolivia pay homage and because of which we cannot strike out about 500 years of history; we can deny neither the motherland of Spain nor the motherland of our own native soil, which brought us their faith, their beliefs, their traditions, their culture and their languages in harmonious combination, making of the New World, together with its prodigious natural wealth, the hope of the human race.\n54.\tMy country has undertaken structural changes, from 1952 on, in order to liberate the common people from feudalism and to attenuate the rigors of plutocratic exploitation. The dispossessed of the countryside have ceased to be slaves and the tin which brings income into our Treasury no longer benefits its former possessors. Such are the virtues of the agrarian reform and the nationalization r T mines.\n55.\tPetroleum, gas, zinc, gold, timber, sources of water- all our natural resources form part of the heritage of the nation. In my country it is no longer possible for an economic super-State to arise which would challenge the State itself.\n56.\tRevolution is proceeding now in Bolivia on the basis of a unanimous consensus and long the glorious path of full nationalism. It will always be welcome in America, as elsewhere, so long as it preserves its autonomy and the hallmark of genuine authenticity. When the revolution tries to transfer its own sovereignty it becomes anti-national and hence anti-American.\nMr. Molina (Costa Rica), Vice-President, took the Chair.\n57.\tThis is precisely what happened in Bolivia under the former administration, which relinquished control of events to outside influences and permitted itself to pervert freedom and to prostitute justice and to cover up political crimes, to make the law its tool, to disregard institutions and deny democracy. All this was done to replace the national sovereignty with another sovereignty and to raise up petulant popular assemblies which were made up of false  representatives appointed arbitrarily, and was done by setting up irregular courts designed to imprison free citizens and to consign the opposition to the firing squad, all of which was openly avowed with unwonted arrogance.\n58.\tWe are all aware of the principles of America which proclaim justice, which we all admit and we are all accustomed to defend with a certain readiness and boldness. But no one can ignore that these also compel the countries of America to preserve human and civil rights, to preserve their independence in the face of all forms of\noutside interference in their internal decisions, and to repel jointly any kind of aggression.\n59.\tYes, we have been able to carry out this sacred task imposed upon us by the revolution and the free and civilized conscience of America.\n60.\tIn order to save the freedom of our country, which was on the point of being alienated by outside forces, in our policy we have applied the maxim of \\\"help yourself.\n61.\tIn order to obtain this, Bolivians have been inspired by lofty sentiments, as, for example, in Colombia where liberals and conservatives joined hands and forgot their old quarrels in order to serve their country better. Our two great rival parties, the Bolivian Socialist Falange and the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, both with popular and nationalist roots, both equally pugnacious, have decided to join forces in the face of the danger threatening Bolivia. And this political instrument, forged with such detachment and grandeur, has served the armed forces of the nation to rise victoriously, hand in hand with the people and under the leadership of Hugo Banzer Suarez, leader of the Nationalist Popular Front, which governs my country.\n62.\tContrary to false and self-interested versions alleging non-existent fascism and a reaction which no longer is active in Bolivia, the new Government is inspired by profound democratic faith and by the conviction that it is preferable to run the risks of liberty. As soon as the circumstances of the political crisis which now confront us have been overcome, the powers of the nation will be established through the free exercise of universal suffrage. Parallel to this psychological preparation of the Bolivian people for the ennobling exercise of the ballot box, we are seeking a beneficial counterweight to control of the public sector by the State through incentives to private initiative and proper guarantees for foreign investments. Bolivia is a country which requires capital for its development and needs currents of immigration which will help it to grow. Social achievements such as the trade-union movement and workers' movements are being maintained unchanged. National universities have been suspended until next March while we undertake their restructuring on a modern basis, as has been done in other American universities. The reforms of 1930 are outmoded, anachronistic and inadequate. These reforms did not include in higher learning the new disciplines which are indispensable in our day. Economic and social development, the investigation of local realities and the training of medium-level scientists and technicians were not part of its objectives. In order to bring up to date our institutions of higher learning what we will need are sustained efforts, apart from the necessary resources and technical assistance from international organizations.\n63.\tIt is all very well to say that there exists a third world made up of developing nations or by nations considered to be backward and dependent, including Bolivia. My party, the Bolivian Socialist Falange, 30 years ago, at the end of the Second World War, spoke of a third point of the triangle, a third position distinct from the exploiting right and the anarchistic left. Today we are pleased to observe that our idea has been implanted democratically in the conscience of the countries which do not have the power of decision in world politics and need the understanding and solidarity of the strong and powerful States.\n64.\tIn the process of development, of industrialization through international co-operation, the concept of a third world distinct from the major Powers in conflict is naturally proper. At a time of definitions, at the supreme moment when the destiny of man and the fate of nations will be at stake, among the opposed and hostile forces which \\\"third worldism\\\" presupposes, each country is faced with a critical choice. There is no room for neutrality in the great historical contests. ii sexual indeterminacy of certain species does not permit biological transformation neither can there be in social terms a fruitful conciliation of the neuter with well-defined and categorical characteristics.\n65.\tQuite a few members of the third world are considered to be non-aligned countries. This non-alignment is more apparent than real. listening with due attention to the magnificent speeches which have been made in this hall at this present twenty-sixth session, it has been possible to observe that the Governments of our respective countries are in fact clearly aligned in taking a stand on each of the great subjects which perturb mankind today, and, even in dealing with specific problems of each nation, we observe a well-defined position which indicates a certain philosophy and a camp in which action is taken. The results of the final votes will show us better than anything else that we are all aligned in one way or another.\n66.\tSome people involved in the atmosphere of \\\"third worldism\\\" have unfortunately been given to violence, to terrorism and to urban and rural guerrilla warfare. These people confuse the moral and the economic posture of the countries of the third world, a posture which should be understood in a constructive way with a facile and convenient appeal to subversion and disorder for criminal ends.\n67.\tViolence, and there is no way of denying it, is the great midwife of history. But violence is legitimate and proper when it is exercised by the weak against the strong, by the exploited against the exploiter, by slaves against their masters. Blind violence through motives of revenge or resentment or as reprisals for a defeat which ha. been sustained, or the expression of impotence with regard to fighting openly is reprehensible and cowardly and deserves the most energetic condemnation.\n68.\tA political doctrine which practices organized criminality and for this purpose resorts to anti-social elements is not of course something which reveals the virtue of its principles, but a diabolical spirit which is intrinsically anti-natural and perverse, that of the Cains who swarm over the face of the globe and who will never be able to raise the standard of human hope.\n69.\tAlong with the terrorism which is practiced as a political system, we find this tendency to intervene in the internal policies of other countries. Bolivia has been a victim of this kind of foreign aggression with the guerrilla fighters in Nancahuazu. The death of their leader in La Higuera attests to the fact, and attests to the violence done to the American principles of self-determination and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.\n70.\tDuring the last attempt to \\\"Viet-Namize\\\" Bolivia, there was public incitement to revolt from foreign rostrums. Well-known guerrilla fighters from another country have made their headquarters in the Gabriel Rene Moreno University in the east of Bolivia.\n71.\tOur case is not an isolated one. Among other countries, Guatemala, as we have been told here by its Foreign Minister, has also \\\"suffered from an intensive divisive campaign, inspired and supported from outside the country, which afflicted the country with ways of violence and subversion by extremists and clandestine factions\\\". [1947th meeting, para. 92.] He concluded with the justified complaint that \\\"the measures adopted [to prevent and punish acts of terrorism, kidnapping and violence] have not been as efficacious as we have hoped\\\", a situation which, in his judgment, \\\"threatens international peace and security\\\" [ibid.].\n72.\tIn the noble and democratic American community there is no place for ignoring anyone except States which exclude themselves by their own actions in promoting, in defiant ways, the undermining of public order in other countries. The right to the recognition of one's own personality begins with respect for the free determination of other peoples and the right to govern themselves in conformity with their own will.\n73.\tThat the leaders of independence of America intervened in our countries is not historically true, nor does it. fit the present situation. Bolivar and Sucre, San Martin and Artigas, just to mention four of our distinguished liberators, belonged to one and the same country, which was able to preserve its unity but which, for the good or ill of our continent, split up into various countries. These republics today constitute different countries which have agreed in embracing certain principles and whose violation is a grave condemnation of the country which commits them.\n74.\tHappily, the United. Nations cultivates the same extremely noble and basic ideals as America and is determined to preserve human freedom, the security of nations and universal peace. Within its competence also we find the promotion not only of economic development but also of social development of countries struggling with an overwhelming scarcity of resources due to their situation of producing only one product, countries which are lashed by the scourge of evils ., r k .i sow fear and give us this lack of confidence in the fut /a.\n75.\tNo less important and significant is the task which the United Nations has assumed of stimulating the processes of integration. This phenomenon, which is characteristic of the time in which we live, is due to the growing interrelationship between States and a growing interdependence which requires dialog and a positive policy of international co-operation. There are attempts to integrate in Europe as well as in Asia, Africa, Oceania and America.\n76.\tIn South America there is a problem which affects Bolivia and Chile and which has effects also on the policy for development and integration of the Andean Group. The land-locked situation of my country is well-known, as well as its historical background, so that it would be redundant for me to dwell upon this. It would be better to approach this question in the light of the integrationist thought which concerns us all in more or less degree in accordance with the standing of our countries and the nature of the problem.\n77.\tChile is facing a difficulty that has its origins in the capricious insular nature of its territory, which is isolated from the continent by the Andes. With a coastline of more than 4,000 kilometers it has a reduced territorial mass and its extensive northern area is desert. That is why it is interested in geographical factors which Bolivia might offer to it in guaranteeing not only the security but also the flourishing of regions which lack natural resources. The fresh water of the cordillera, the petroleum of the eastern part of Bolivia, the flow of trade in the departments of Oruro, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz, are \\\"non-territorial compensations\\\" which their statesmen and strategists have been thinking about since 1930.\n78.\tBolivia, on the other hand, is an enormous continental mass of more than a million square kilometers, an area which is greater than Chile, without a single centimeter of coast on the Pacific. It is obvious that a country with such an unusual geography must seek out its own supplementary maritime facilities.\n79.\tIt would seem that Chile had found the means for solving this difficult situation in its provinces in the north by means of integration with Bolivia through the Andean Group. Possibly it thinks that this is a way to help it to achieve its objectives. Bolivia, on the other hand, by integration merely through the ways of development which it has been using, will not be able to satisfy its urgent need for rounding out its development through a sovereign access to the sea. The principal leaders of the Andean Group have a very heavy historical responsibility which is related to the future of our sub-region and the peace of the southern part of the continent.\n80.\tFurthermore, as fax as Bolivians are concerned, our incorporation in the western ocean is more pressing since the sea is considered now to be an inexhaustible emporium of food reserves and of staggering natural resources. This wealth is even more abundant since the territorial sea has been expanding to a width of 200 miles and the world is also beginning to legislate concerning the sea-bed as a common and universal dominion.\n81.\tMaking this approach more specific, we can say that the sea for Bolivia and the non-territorial geographical factors for Chile, will make it possible for the Andean Group to bring its far-seeing policy of integration to its fullest and happiest conclusion.\n82.\tNext, I should like to express my concern about the stability of the United Nations; in other words, the life itself of the Organization. This stability rests fundamentally on the prestige which the Organization can achieve, based on its fidelity to principles which it has proclaimed and the unswerving correctness of its conduct and the efficacy of its decisions.\n83.\tOnce the prestige of the League of Nations was compromised, the League came to an end without sorrow or glory. As a healthful exercise, let us refer to some of the efforts which contributed to that dissolution. In that way we will see to it that the United Nations, which raises greater hopes, in spite of the skepticism of some of its Members, is able to meet its grave historical responsibilities.\n84.\tOne of the faults of the League of Nations was the withdrawal of the United States from it, after it had sponsored its creation in the Treaty of Versailles. This event came on top of the previous isolation of Germany and Russia, which were the big Powers of the time. Today the United Nations counts on the active participation of the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as new Powers, although others of undisputed importance are being ignored.\n85.\tOne thing which weakened the League of Nations morally was the institution of an International Court of Justice which could apply an optional arbitration without mandatory force. This implied an abandonment to the stronger countries of the solution of conflicts between the weaker countries, since the former did not have to use the arbitration of the Court. In our Organization some of this is occurring on some levels and it is endangering its effectiveness.\n86.\tUniversal disarmament, in order to achieve peace, stumbled over insuperable obstacles in the League of Nations and its results, of course, could not prevent countries from arming themselves and from preparing a new war. Uien we spoke simply of the \\\"manufacture of arms and munitions\\\" and the \\\"reduction of arms\\\". Our generation is alarmed to see the production of nuclear weapons and the massive destructive power which they have. To limit and to dismantle this apocalyptic race towards a catastrophic extermination of men and nations is an unavoidable duty which cannot be escaped by the prominent Members of the United Nations.\n87.\tThe Foreign Minister of Peru referred [1947th meeting] in detail to the risks of pollution of the atmosphere and the waters of the seas as well as the insecurity which is involved in atomic tests. In so doing, he was wise to emphasize the great urgency in adopting means to avoid proliferation of these deadly tests and in having an improved convention banning thermo-nuclear weapons. We might note, in this connexion, the reassuring words of the representative of France, a country which however is not the only one carrying out this research.\n88.\tHie image of the League of Nations was affected also by the process which was followed in the admission and rejection of new States. Some were rejected, others were accepted, and this was based on discrimination which was often not well founded. The rejection of Armenia had special characteristics which we ought to recall.\n89.\tThe case of Armenia was debated, and it was said that the League of Nations ought to support a new State whose existence was being threatened. All the members of the Assembly agreed that this step ought to be taken, but they fonH that the League did not have the weapons, armies or funds to do so. Later on, when the recognition of Armenia came up again, *he League of Nations, in a contradictory manner, decided to reject it, and in that way it wounded its own authority and prestige.\n90.\tIn looking at this background we can see the negative influence which might be exercised in the United Nations if we are to accept and expel Members, to say that there is protection and not to bring about that protection because of insufficient means or operative inefficiency. That is why the Foreign Minister of Spain hit the mark when he said that the United Nations ought to find out whether constitutionally it is able to meet the challenges of the present time [1949th meeting para. 13].\n91.\tThese references, as illustrative examples, strengthen our conviction in saying that the admission of the People's Republic of China ought to take place both in the Assembly and in the Security Council, and that the Republic of China ought to be kept in the Organization. There must be discretion in the acts of the United Nations if we are not to commit the mistake of harming its moral vigor and detracting from its political authority.\n92.\tLet us not regret the delay in the necessary incorporation of the People's Republic of China into this world Organization. The fact is that we are proposing it today as a matter of justice in the face of the principle of the universality of nations, which has been invoked by so many outstanding speakers and because of what might be called the doctrine of realities. Continental China is a country which cannot and should not be ignored because of the size of its territory, its enormous population, the strength and expansion of its economy and because it is an organized State. Bolivia is especially interested in speaking to China, about the production of antimony, wolfram and tin, and about the whole policy of prices.\n93.\tAt the same time and using the same principles and reasons, we can in no way reconcile this with the expulsion of Nationalist China from this great amphitheater of peace, progress and solidarity of nations. A State which has 14 million people, a flourishing industry with exports of about $4,000 million a year, which is the same as the exports of the People's Republic of China, with a high cultural and technical level and which is in a position to give valuable assistance to other developing countries, cannot be refused, as Armenia was in the past, without the Organization compromising its serious purpose, and even less so now when the country involved has been one of its principal Members from the very outset.\n94.\tIf, at the beginning, in the opinion of some, Formosa was a \\\"fictitious State\\\", at present the Republic of China shows the attributes of a modern State and is an example to others with its virtues of organization and its historic will to exist and to nourish lofty and constructive ideals.\n95.\tThere might also be an impression that, if we were to abandon the island of Taiwan, there would be a hidden intent to allow that State to become the victim of the use of force. The reconquering of territories is a dangerous precedent which might be transformed into a terrible boomerang for the United Nations, some of whose Members might find themselves in similar situations. This risk flows from the words of one head of a delegation, when he said that Taiwan should be recognized as part of China and that representatives other than those of continental China should be expelled.\n96.\tWith respect to the conflict in the Middle East, the framework of which is the Arab-Israeli conflict, this is a matter which should be duly sorted out and properly settled. Two principles should be pointed out here, the importance of which cannot be doubted by anyone and the rational application of which might lead to the result which we all desire. These are the principle of dialog, which is a worthy means of human understanding, and the principle of non-recognition of territorial acquisitions resulting from armed conflict.\n97.\tBoth doctrines form a single whole for Bolivians. Direct conversation, enlightening dialog these are unchanging policies which Bolivia wishes to cultivate with Chile in solving its own problems and which it would like to see applied now in controversies such as the one which exists between the Arab States and Israel. The non- recognition of territorial annexations through the use of force has always been the key position of the Government of my country, and now we are pleased to hear this from the Minister for Foreign Affairs for Chile, when he says that Israeli troops should be withdrawn from the occupied territories and that any attempt to annex territories should be condemned, under Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which embodies this principle and which is to be found in international public law in Latin America as one of its guiding doctrinal concepts [1948th meeting, para. 168].\n98.\tNo less censurable would be an attempt to bring about the destruction of Israel as a State. Even though Israel is a young State, it belongs to an old nation, whose origin goes back to biblical times and the beginning of man on earth. Israel in its short life as a modern State has astonished the whole world by its extraordinary capacity to organize itself, to preserve its independence and to advance resolutely forward along a broad road towards progress and the structuring of a just society, one which favors science, the arts and letters.\n99.\tTo guarantee the security of Israel would seem to be just as important as to guarantee the territorial status of the Arab countries. Let reason and prudence, the mother of wisdom, and equity, upon which rests the theory of balances, of the \\\"golden mean\\\" spoken of by the ancients, let these, rather than tho clouded intellects and frustrated wills of sectarianism, say the last word in this controversy between nations worthy of admiration and respect.\n100.\tThe armed struggle in Indo-China has not only become unpopular, as all wars do which become prolonged, but it has become a blind and irrational fact which is incomprehensible for most men. This conflict has incorporated a new term in the human lexicon the idea of \\\"Viet-Namization\\\" as the division of countries through ideological motivations. The threat of \\\"Viet-Namizing\\\" Bolivia or dividing it if necessary was made by a labor union leader from the grounds of our legislative palace which was converted into a sort of Paris commune, but not to bring about a revolution in favor of the Bolivians, as was carried out in France in favor of the French, a revolution which was made on the march, a nationalist, realistic and profound revolution, but one which -was intended to yoke the Bolivian State to foreign Powers, forgetting that America must become leader of its own destiny. The inclusion of the People's Republic of China in this Organization might constitute a decisive factor in favor of re-establishing peace in Viet-Nam. The present Government of the United States of America, in turn, with its comprehensive and constructive attitude, might win the palm of victory in this manner. It would be a victory for the cause of peace, which is so deeply yearned for by the long-suffering people of Indo-China, by United States citizens and by the citizens of the entire world.\n101.\tAmong the main problems before the world is the question of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, into which the Third Reich was divided after the last war. In the territory of the old Germany, which was unified by the Iron Chancellor new European borders were laid out separating the leading Powers of the world. Some favor the admission of both Germanys as Member States of the United Nations. Actually, I would say that each Germany West Germany and East Germany deserves a seat in this great Assembly. We are pleased in this way to pay a tribute to a hard-working nation whose industry and human intelligence have contributed to progress and the ideological orientation of mankind.\n102.\tIt would possibly be better to leave it up to the Germanys to settle their big problem now or in the future. No one could agree more than the Germans that they are a single nation which has been temporarily divided into two States because of transitory differences and that foreign interests have raised between them a wall of hateful connotations. This is a wall which, because of human comprehension and the transcendent unity of a people, will no doubt be demolished to give rise to an active and fruitful understanding which will prepare for the future the reunification of the German nation in a single State, with the democratic understanding of the great Powers.\n103.\tIt would be premature to arrive at conclusions on the various items concerning the problems of the seas to be considered by the plenipotentiaries who will take part in the conference on the law of the sea to be held in 1973.\n104.\tIn the broad field of the law of the sea, the problems of land-locked countries have relatively little meaning for the international community. Nevertheless, they take on vital characteristics when the interests of States lacking i sea coast are at stake, as in the case of Bolivia.\n105.\tOf course the right of free access to the sea is given to land-locked countries. In this connexion, I should like to point out that the improvement of this law, which is a matter of concern to my country, does not mean now, nor will it ever mean, giving up the rights that are helping it to hold its own sovereign rights in the seas of the world.\n106.\tThere is another aspect which should be pointed out. The universality of the law for the use and the exploitation of the sea, which the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly proclaimed in a solemn declaration of principles,  would be partial and incomplete if it were applied only to coastal States and if the legitimate rights and aspirations of land-locked countries were to be forgotten.\n107.\tThe international community began to confirm and to codify in 1958 various principles relating to the right of access to the sea, in the Convention on the High Seas  as well as the Convention on the Transit Trade of LandLocked States.  In addition, there are hundreds of bilateral agreements in this field. This matter has been the subject of special studies carried out by the Secretary and by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ.\n108.\tAs UNCTAD has quite correctly pointed out, landlocked status is one of the factors which ought to be taken into account in identifying the characteristics of countries having a relatively lower degree of development. It is obvious that, as is the case in the Andean Group, account should be taken of the fact that there are not only countries having a relatively lower degree of economic development but also land-locked countries that are less developed, and those countries ought to be accorded a doubly preferential treatment.\n109.\tIn the organization of international machinery to administer the exploration and the exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed, consideration should be given to the fact that the recognition of preferential rights for coastal States over extensive areas adjacent to their coasts, would automatically transfer to land-locked States access rights to the deepest and most inaccessible ocean trenches, thus making such rights purely hypothetical ones. Such a situation would become even more absurd if it were established that land-locked countries have no right to the living resources even of the adjacent sea.\n110.\tAt the end of this month and at the beginning of next month there will be a ministerial meeting, in Lima of representatives of the Group of 77 to prepare a joint plan of action to guide their deliberations during the third session of UNCTAD to be held next year in Santiago, Chile.\n111.\tBolivia will be present at both meetings and will deal, with a special interest, with the important problems that concern the developing countries in their permanent relationship with the highly developed countries. I should add to this that Bolivia has complete solidarity with the views expressed by the Group of 77 in favor of co-operation for development, balanced and just international trade, the transfer of technology, special measures in favor of the relatively less developed countries and the special problems of land-locked countries, in order to comply with the objectives of the International Development Strategy of the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)].\n112.\tWithout going into further analysis I wish to add at this point that Bolivia will give its support to improving regional organizations, the expansion of the number of members of the Economic and Social Council and, if necessary also to modifying some of the present characteristics of that body which do not correspond to the demands of our time and, finally, to examining closely the conditions for implementing the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n113.\tThe Bolivian delegation has maintained and will continue to maintain its systematic and consistent attitude against all forms of colonialism and against racial and religious discrimination which are still afflicting various peoples of the world.\n114.\tFurthermore, my country reiterates its concern at the situation in Belize, the MaMnas and Gibraltar, which is of interest to Guatemala, Argentina and Spain and which endangers relations between those countries and the United Kingdom. The same thing can be said for the Canal Zone, whose recovery is being sought by Panama.\n115.\tAmong the interesting matters before this body is the Convention of the Central American Community, which this Organization ought to welcome with great pleasure. This event shows us that Bolivar did not plant seeds in the desert. Bolivar's ideal for an American union, proclaimed in the amphictyonic Congress of Panama and in the Treaty of Confederation of 1848 in Lima, is being brought back to life and is gaining a new expression with the new Central American Community.\n116.\tFive nations of the same origin and the same destiny in the continent, tied by the same tradition and similar ideals, have manifested their desire to band together to create a Central American Community of Nations. Let us hope that such a generous effort will reach a definite crystallization for the good of America and the general fate of the world.\n117.\tIn 1907, at the beginning of this century, an outstanding Brazilian jurist, Ruy Barbosa, the father of the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, defended in The Hague the principles of the juridical equality of States, which has become the corner-stone upon which this modern edifice of great international organizations has been raised. With the welcome passage of time, we now see the forming of a corollary doctrine, the idea of the economic equality of nations in international co-operation for development.\n118.\tThe first thesis has led us to the concepts of regional and world security, as well as of the recognition of the rulers of self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\n119.\tThis second thesis must lead us to the establishment of sure markets and stable prices for the raw materials of the developing countries. At the same time, it should make it necessary for us to safeguard freedom of trade and the stability of currencies.\n120.\tAll that can be possible if we faithfully follow the international rules which we accepted and if, at the same time, we reject movements for hegemony in the eager search for a great universal concert of nations.\n121.\tScience, technology and the great processes of industrialization today should not be used for destruction and death. We are facing a great challenge to man: a new and great adventure for his intelligence. That will be what will make it possible for us to become aware of and to dominate the forces of nature in the service of mankind and not of war in order to bring about the miracle of the realization of our ardent desire for justice, progress, universal peace and a better knowledge of the mysteries which the universe holds.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you, on behalf of the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic and in my own name, our congratulations and best wishes on the occasion of your election to the high office of President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election reflects the distinguished position of your country, Indonesia, to which my country is linked with the strongest ties of friendship. It also reflects the great appreciation for your person and for the principles which you uphold. We are confident that, guided by you, the present session will deal with international problems in a spirit of adherence to the basic rules of right and justice enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\n62.\tProfound appreciation is also due for the efforts of Mr. Hambro, the President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, whose unfailing efforts, tact and knowledge contributed to the success of that jubilee- marking session.\n63.\tI must also express my great respect and deep sense of appreciation to Secretary-General U Thant, who has guided the world Organization through wind and storm, courageously, and with dedication to the service of all mankind as well as with a firm belief in the need to uphold the ideals on which the world Organization was founded and to establish firmly principles of justice and peace. We should wish to see the Secretary-General accede to the overwhelming desire of United Nations Members to renew his tenure of office in order to continue to serve the international community and the cause of world security and peace.\n64.\tIt is a source of pleasure for me to congratulate the new States of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar on their recent admission, and Oman on its forthcoming admission, to membership in the United Nations. This stresses the inevitability of the victory of the struggle of peoples, big and small, to achieve liberation from colonial rule. My country, which is linked to Bahrain, Qatar and Oman by belonging to the Arab people, who are fighting to achieve peace and liberation, wishes the three new States full progress and prosperity.\n65.\tThe United Nations, which was born more than 25 years ago in the aftermath of the catastrophe of the Second World War, has been able to face grave crises, to withstand challenges and to confirm, year after year, the inevitability of the victory of the struggle of peoples.\n66.\tThe United Nations has acted to restrain aggression; has exerted efforts to put an end to colonialism, to promote economic development, to ease international tension and to foster peace; it has achieved an agreement to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons;  and it has started useful talks on the subject of general and complete disarmament.\n67.\tBut do these achievements meet the pressing needs of humanity? Do they rise to the level of the aspirations of peoples? Peoples of the world who are fighting to exist and to survive find their existence and their survival seriously threatened; peoples who are seeking peace and justice are plagued with aggression and occupation; and peoples who are struggling to ensure mere subsistence find their usurped and their resources exploited through old and new forms of imperialist domination.\n68.\tFear of the woes of war, fear of the loss of liberty through subjection to domination and occupation, and the fear of people who have to suffer the cruelties of homelessness and hunger-these are the dangers that threaten humanity and its future. These are the dangers that stress the need for the struggle to ensure due respect for provisions of the United Nations Charter and the basic rights of man.\n69.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic, which is struggling along-side other peoples to achieve liberation and to ensure a better future for its citizens, participated in the establishment of the United Nations and in the drawing up of its Charter. Like other participants, it entertained the hope that, through this Charter, a better world-a world free of colonialism, domination, exploitation and under-development-would be created. Syria, moreover, has sacrificed much to contribute to the attainment of this goal, as witnessed by its record inside the United Nations and outside it.\n70.\tSyria's firm adherence to United Nations principles has made it the object of various forms of pressure and threats, ranging from economic blockade to direct aggression and occupation.\n71.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic believes that the battle for liberation is one and indivisible and can be won only through a united struggle by the peoples of the world. We also believe that the struggle for peace can attain its goal only through a relentless fight to put a final end to all forms of colonialism and that the struggle against underdevelopment will be effective and fruitful only through co-operation and the co-ordinated efforts of peoples.\n72.\tSyria, therefore, reaffirms its support for the heroic struggle of the peoples of Viet-Nam, who are fighting to achieve unity, liberation, self-determination and the evacuation of all foreign troops from their homeland, We believe that the seven-point plan of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam constitutes the only way to resolve the Viet-Namese question. We condemn the United States interference in Cambodia against the lawful Government of President Sihanouk. We support the struggle of the people of Indo-China against United States imperialist aggression, which constitutes a threat to the peace and security of South-East Asia. The people of Korea should be allowed to achieve unity and exercise their indisputable right to self-determination. We call for the evacuation of all foreign troops from South Korea and for the dissolution of the I L Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, the very existence of which constitutes serious interference in the internal affairs of Korea.\n73.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic is very eager to see that the unity of Pakistan is preserved and that peace in East Pakistan is maintained so as to secure the return of the refugees to their homeland and to ensure peace and security in that region, particularly as the President of Pakistan, Mr, Yahya Khan, has called upon all the refugees to return to their homes.\n74.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic has always supported the struggle of the peoples of Africa against racial discrimination in all parts of the African continent. We condemn the apartheid policy of the Government of South Africa, as well as its illegal occupation of Namibia. We support the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe against the racist rule of the usurper minority. We support the liberation movements of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau) and all the other parts of Africa subject to colonial rule and their struggle against foreign colonialist forces which threaten the security of Africa. We declare that support for this struggle is a sacred duty squired by the common destiny of peoples and the dignity of humanity.\n75.\tThe Arab people of Syria, who have fought against imperialist occupation, the crimes of colonialism and the brutality of the Nazi-type Zionist aggression in the Middle East, reaffirm their stand alongside the peoples of Africa in their destiny-deciding struggle against racial discrimination and imperialist intervention in Africa. The solidarity of the struggle of the Arab people with the struggle of the peoples of Africa will, we believe, ensure the defeat of the common enemy and its racial-Zionist ideology, which is based on hatred, malice and genocide.\n76.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic supports the principle of universality of representation at the United Nations and believes that respect for this principle strengthens the world Organization. Indeed, world peace cannot be safeguarded if political prejudice is permitted to replace the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n77.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic was one of the nations that first advocated the restoration to the People's Republic of China, in its capacity as the only true representative of the Chinese people, of its legal right to occupy China's seat at the United Nations. It is indeed gratifying to note that in the world at large the year 1971 has witnessed a growing recognition of the justice of this stand.\n78.\tBelieving in the principle of universality of representation, and desirous of strengthening the world Organization, we support the admission to membership in the United Nations of States which have shown due respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter, such as the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic Republic of Viet-Mam and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The admission of those States would strengthen the forces that stand for liberty and peace. We believe that the United Nations will continue to lack due effectiveness and the requisite international character if the peoples of those States, representing, as they do, a tremendous human, cultural and economic potential, continue to be denied admission to membership in the United Nations.\n79.\tThe victory of the struggle of peoples to achieve liberty, equality and the enforcement of the principles of the United Nations Charter will remain a far-off target unless the heavy legacy of long centuries of colonial rule is overcome and liquidated. Economic and social underdevelopment, which developing countries have inherited from the period of colonization, constitutes a permanent threat to the peoples of those countries. Real independence for them should include freedom from poverty and ignorance, and a bridging of the tremendous gap that separates developed from developing countries. That terrible gap constitutes a grave and continuing threat to world peace. Those are some of the basic considerations which have led us to support) as we still do, the adoption of all necessary measures for the strengthening of international peace and security.\n80.\tWorking to achieve those targets has not proved easy and has always met with opposition from world imperialism, the bitterest enemy of the freedom and development of peoples. Notwithstanding the various forms of pressure to which it has been subjected, including that of direct aggression, the Syrian Arab Republic has succeeded in freeing its economy and effectively utilizing its resources through co-operation with friendly countries which believe that international relations should be based on mutual respect for a country's dignity and its national sovereignty. We believe that the battle for economic liberation, which is no less important than that for political freedom, requires the full co-operation and complete solidarity of all forces of liberation throughout the world.\n81.\tTo serve a common cause and common interests, relations of friendly co-operation have been established by Syria with the forces of liberation in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Strong ties have also been maintained with socialist countries that have supported the just causes of peoples and have given us assistance on the basis of sincere co-operation. The Syrian Arab Republic is prepared to enter into relations of mutual co-operation with all countries that believe in the right of peoples to liberation and sovereignty.\n82.\tIn pursuance of the struggle to achieve the unity of the Arab people, the Syrian Arab Republic, in co-operation with the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Libyan Arab Republic, has established a federation that fulfils the aspirations of the Arab masses to unity and liberation and enhances the economy of the States of the Federation.\n83.\tThe new Federation of Arab Republics represents an emerging political force capable of developing defensive power against aggression. The Federation is a new force that supports the struggle of peoples and all liberation movements throughout the world. The Federation represents a force that seeks peace and friendship with all peoples that believe in the dignity of men and in a peace based on justice and equity.\n84.\tThe General Assembly debates yearly the explosive Middle East crisis which threatens not only the security of the area but also world peace. At the heart of this crisis is the cause of the Arab people of Palestine, who have been deprived of all rights confirmed by international legislation, conventions and United Nations resolutions. It is the case of the Zionist imperialist aggression against the people of Palestine as well as against the whole Arab people, an aggression that has continued unabated for over half a century now.\n85.\tThis hall and this forum have witnessed repeated condemnations of Israel for acts of collective killing and genocide. The majority of Members of the United Nations has endorsed these condemnations, as can be ascertained through reference to numerous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, the Security Council and other organs and committees of the United Nations. No Member State has a darker United Nations record or one that is more tainted with crimes and violations than Israel.\n86.\tIsrael's existence as an entity in Palestine since 1948 represents a continuation and an expansion of the illegal colonial presence which had ruled the country through the device of the Mandate. From the early days of its existence, Israel has perpetrated the worst atrocities, which, before its rise, were committed by Zionist terrorist gangs. Since its inception as the successor to British colonial rule in Palestine, Israel has violated all international rules, human principles and moral codes. Its program and logic included murder and assassination, which has extended even to United Nations personnel; collective killing of disarmed civilians in a Nazi-like manner and the uprooting of a whole people. Every crime committed by the Nazis of modern times and by barbaric invaders in past times has been committed by Israel, which has violated all the rules and conventions of international law.\n87.\tIn this very hall, on several occasions, the voice of the representatives of the Zionist authorities has been heard defying the authority of the United Nations and warning the world Organization that Israel would not heed any United Nations resolutions even though they ' /ere adopted almost unanimously if they did not serve Israeli designs and the Zionist logic of aggression.\n88.\tThe Arab people of Palestine have been uprooted from their homeland to make room for the establishment of a settler colonial State based on a racist ideology that upholds discrimination on grounds of race, color, and religion, an ideology that embodies the madness of the Nazis and the criminal practices of the minority regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa.\n89.\tThe Zionist regime has been set up in Palestine, and it has adopted, in co-operation with world imperialism, a policy of aggression and of territorial expansion involving the displacement of 1.5 million Arab refugees from their homeland and of over three quarters of a million newly displaced persons from the occupied areas of three Member States: Syria, Egypt and Jordan. It is a policy aimed at keeping the peoples of the region under-developed and disunited. United Nations records and official reports confirm this dark image of Israel.\n90.\tThe' world was brought to the verge of a global war when Israel played the role of the spearhead of the tripartite aggression which was launched against Egypt in 1956. Israel pushed the world again to the verge of another world war through the launching of an expansionist Zionist-imperialist surprise attack against three Arab States in 1967. Following the 1967 aggression, Israel was ordered to withdraw from all the occupied territories. Since then, Israel has been condemned for savage, inhuman attacks, aerial and otherwise, deep inside Arab territories, killing innocent school children, working men and women in their factories. Israel has also been condemned for crimes committed in every part of the occupied territories: crimes\n7\nagainst civilians; against children, women and old men; against sacred historical places; and against the sentiments and feelings of Christians and Moslems throughout the world.\n91.\tTo set the record clear, the number of resolutions and decisions on the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestine question adopted by the General Assembly, the principal organs of the United Nations, and specialized agencies -UNESCO and WHO from the first cesse-fire decision of\n6 June 1967 until now, totals 54. Those resolutions and decisions have, on the one hand, affirmed every Arab right and confirmed, on the other, Israel's utter disregard of these rights and its deliberate ignoring of every principle of the Charter, a record which makes Israel a candidate for expulsion from the world Organization in accordance with Article 6 of the Charter. Specifically, of the 54 resolutions referred to, 14 \\\"condemn\\\" or \\\"strongly condemn\\\" or \\\"specifically condemn Israel\\\" for \\\"flagrant violations\\\" of the Charter, including attacks on the Arab countries, its refusal to apply the fourth Geneva Convention  and its violations of human rights. Nineteen of those 54 resolutions either \\\"deplore\\\" or \\\"deeply deplore\\\" or \\\"strongly deplore\\\" or \\\"note with dismay the refusal of Israel\\\" to co-operate in implementing specific resolutions or \\\"urgently call upon the Government of Israel\\\" to implement the Charter.\n92.\tThere is no limit to Israeli arrogance and cynicism. Israel attempts continuously to derogate from the authority of the United Nations and its responsibility to maintain world peace and order. Such arrogance was displayed last week in the Security Council following the adoption on 25 September last of a resolution on Jerusalem which, inter alia, \\\"urgently calls upon Israel to rescind all previous measures and actions\\\" in annexing Arab Jerusalem. The Israeli representative arrogantly declared the refusal of his Government to accept that resolution. The following day the Israeli Cabinet issued a statement to that effect. Only Thursday of last week, the General Assembly hall witnessed a similar irresponsibility expressed by the Foreign Minister of the Tel Aviv authorities when, in his statement at the 1946th meeting, he requested the world Organization to give up its authority for the maintenance of international peace and security and to abandon, directly or indirectly, its responsibilities vis-a-vis Zionist aggression and expansion in the Middle East.\n93.\tEurope witnessed such a disregard for international covenants and agreements on the eve of the Second World War through the declarations of the Nazi leaders who dragged their country and the whole world to the Second World War that brought untold sorrow to mankind. That is why the United Nations and the Members represented in it are asked to put an end to such cynicism and irresponsibility which now threaten the peace* and security of the world.\n94.\tThe Foreign Minister of Israel, faithful to his sophistry and to the well-known Zionist pattern of distorting facts, referred to what he called the situation of the Jews in Syria. I need hardly refute his allegations because the members of the Jewish community in Syria are. Syrian citizens. They\nlive not only better than the Arabs in Israel, who are treated as third-class citizens, or the Arabs in the occupied territories, but certainly better than the oriental Jews in Israel, Indeed, who did not read recently about the revolt of these wretched oriental Jews who have been lured by Zionist propaganda to migrate to Israel? Those oriental Jews saw for themselves what it means to live under a racist-Zionist European society based on discrimination as to color, race and creed, We do not believe that the Zionist authorities can hide from the eyes of the world the tragedy of the oriental Jews in Israel. The Black Panther movements there, their continuous strikes and demonstrations, are but the beginning of the erosion of that racial society.\n95.\tFurthermore, Zionist-Israeli propaganda, in utter dis-regard of the Will of the world concerning the maintenance of international peace and security, has been attempting continuously to picture Israeli aggression against the Arab States as a conflict between the United States and the USSR in the Middle East, Such an attempt aims at tying the United States and its interests totally to Israeli aggression and to the desire of the expansionist Israeli State to expand further in to Arab lands. It is an explosive situation, because it aims ultimately at pushing the whole world to the brink of a third world war in order to protect Israeli expansionism and aggression.\n96.\tWe therefore confirm once more that any settlement based on getting a reward to the aggressor is but a call for a further renewal of aggression. It is a dangerous game which threatens the security of the world community. Artificial creations based on racialism and aggression cannot subsist, regardless of the arsenal of offensive destructive arms which they have at their disposal,\n97.\tHistory teaches us beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the early victories of aggressors always become the road leading to their defeat. The Zionist-Israeli aggression against the Arab peoples of the Middle East will not fare better than the Nazi aggression against Europe and the whole world.\n98.\tThis Zionist-imperialist aggression, which has been so extensively condemned on the international level, could not have continued had it not been for the support which the United States of America gave to Israel, first to commit the aggression and later to perpetuate it. The alliance between the United States and Israel, between imperialism and Zionism, which is directed against the uprooted and dispossessed people of Palestine, as well as against the whole of the Arab people who aspirs to peace, constitutes a threat to all freedom-loving and peace-loving peoples of the world and is harmful to American interests, which are sacrificed to serve the aggressive aims of Zionism.\n99.\tThe so-called United States policy of \\\"quiet diplomacy for a Middle East settlement\\\" is in effect nothing but a manifestation of that country's desire to give the aggressor party the opportunity and the needed \\\"quiet\\\" to enjoy the fruits of aggression and to consolidate its control of the occupied territories by establishing new colonies and expelling the inhabitants of these territories.\n100.\tIt is indeed regrettable that the United States of America, the country which produced, in the past two centuries, great heroes of freedom-Washington, Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln-should become today the chief supplier of the arms and weapons used to commit aggression against the peoples of the world who are seeking liberty and freedom. It is indeed regrettable that the United States of America, which produced the Declaration of Independence, the first declaration of human rights in modern history, should become today the oppressive force used to threaten the freedom of peoples and to support violations of the rights of man.\n101.\tThe large-scale expulsion from their homes and lands of the Arab inhabitants of the Golan heights, the west bank of the Jordan, Gaza, the Sinai peninsula and Jerusalem is a terrible crime that should move the conscience of humanity to intervene to save the threatened peace and security of the world.\n102.\tThe Israeli authorities have gone so far in their defiance of the international community as to declare openly their colonialist intentions regarding the occupied Arab territories. The Israeli Minister of Defense has recently demanded that these territories should be annexed to Israel and that Israel should therefore regard itself as the \\\"permanent government\\\" of these territories.\n103.\tZionist acts of aggression and expulsion have reduced the Arab people of Palestine to the status of refugees. The failure of the world community to render justice to these refugees and the indifference with which it has regarded their tragic plight has kindled the spirit of resistance in their torn tents and has converted the homeless and dispossessed people of Palestine into freedom fighters struggling to defend the rights which the United Nations Charter has recognized as belonging to all peoples.\n104.\tThe struggle of Palestinian resistance is a struggle for the right of self-determination. International law recognizes this right and consecrates the struggle to achieve it. For it is, indeeds the right for the achievement of which all the peoples of the world represented in this Organization, not excluding the United States of America, have fought to achieve. It is the right recognized by international law and charters, including the United States Declaration of Independence, and is, therefore, the inalienable right of the Palestinian people, which the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly recognized and affirmed in resolutions adopted by various sessions of the Assembly, most notably by the twenty-fifth anniversary session.\n105.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic wishes to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the grave dangers to the peace in the Middle East and to the world attendant upon the present state of continued Israeli aggression. The international community should discharge its historic responsibilities relating to the preservation of world peace by promptly putting an end to that aggression.\n106.\tThe attitude of the Syrian Arab Republic to the Palestine question and to Israel's continued aggression is constant and firm and is based on the principles and provisions of the United Nations Charter and the inalienable rights of man.\n107.\tThere are two prerequisites for the establishment of peace in the Middle East: first, recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to their lands and homeland and of their right to the free exercise of self-determination; secondly, the complete, immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied Arab territories.\n108.\tThe continued occupation of these territories constitutes a grave danger to peace, a danger for which the Zionist aggressors and the forces of imperialism that support the aggression must be held responsible.\n109.\tThe freedom-loving forces of the world and all peoples fighting for liberation bear the responsibility to check the aggressor. These forces, acting collectively, can deter aggression, can protect the cause of freedom and the sovereignty of peoples, and can ensure a world peace based on justice and equity.\n\n"

        "file_text": "82.\t First of all, Mr. President, I should like to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly of the United Nations and to wish you success in carrying out the responsible tasks which lie before you.\n83.\tThe international situation in which the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly has been convened is complex and variegated. There is undeniably much in it; which is new and which meets the aspirations of the peoples; but the opposite trends are strong and the world is not free from danger. The situation is shaped by the policies of States and is by no means simple.\n84.\tIn analyzing the foreign policy of any State, what we have to determine above all else is whether that State regards the task of strengthening world peace as the focal point of its policy, or whether it gives preference to other objectives which may not correspond to the interests of peace and may even run counter to those interests,\n85.\tThe position of principle of our socialist State on questions of foreign policy was already determined at the time of its inception. Since then, for over half a century, it has never deviated from that policy. It has always done everything in its power to consolidate the security of the peoples and to ensure respect for their rights. It has condemned wars of aggression and annexation and holds the banner of peace firmly in its hands. The Soviet Union will continue to use all its authority, all its resources, its policy and its ideology to influence the course of international events in the direction of peace among the nations.\n86.\tA policy aimed at worsening the situation and leading to tension, conflicts and international crises is organically alien to us and is rejected by the very nature of the socialist order. At the same time, we shall continue to resist all attempts to pursue such a policy against our country and against our allies and friends.\n87.\tThe general line of the foreign policy of the USSR, which was evolved and bequeathed to us by Lenin, was confirmed and adapted to the circumstances of today by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Congress carefully weighed and appraised the most important directions and trends of world developments and advanced a broad program of peace and peaceful co-operation.\n88.\tThis program covers all the main aspects of the task of maintaining peace, from the elimination of existing hotbeds of war and the prevention of new conflicts between States to the implementation of the principle of collective security, from measures to ensure a military detente in the areas of the most dangerous confrontations to the prohibition of ail types of weapons of mass destruction, and from the final elimination of colonialism and racism to the development of mutually advantageous co-operation between States in solving major economic, scientific and technological problems.\n89.\tWe make no secret of our feelings of satisfaction at the world-wide acclaim given to the program of peace and co-operation advanced by the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. All those who show concern for peace, irrespective of their class and ideological outlook, consider this program to be constructive and realistic and to meet the interests of all, peoples. The Soviet Union's efforts in the sphere of foreign affairs are being concentrated on the preparation and execution of measures to give effect to the proposals contained in the program.\n90.\tOur country is acting in concert with the other socialist States in solving the problem of building a more stable world. Our alliance with them is firm, and the policy of its members is directed towards securing the most advantageous conditions for building up socialism and communism in their countries, a task for which the main prerequisite is peace.\n91.\tThe foreign policy objectives of the socialist alliance coincide with the interests of all peoples and with the purposes solemnly proclaimed in the United Nations Charter. No one is more concerned than we are to ensure that the lofty principles of the United Nations are brought into effect through peaceful relations between States and peoples, .irrespective of their social systems and political structures.\n92.\tBut the socialist countries neither claim nor want to monopolize the policy of peace. On the contrary, the wider the circle of States defending the cause of peace and actively helping to find solutions for acute international problems, the mora opportunities there will be to forge ahead and the greater will be the confidence in success, however difficult the road to stable security may be and whatever obstacles may have to be overcome.\n93.\tThis circle of States has now widened, because the facts of our times are forcing all States into the realization that in spite of the social, political, economic or cultural differences between them, it is in their common interest to ensure that people can live in peace.\n94.\tThe ways in which States express this realization may vary, but its meaning is always the same. It underlies the foreign policies of the socialist States. It is the main guideline of the policy of countries which call themselves non-aligned. It is manifested in the trends towards realism which have recently become more evident in the policy of a considerable number of other States which only a short time ago automatically adjusted their attitudes to the positions of the military blocs into which they had been drawn in the past. That is why in recent years the alienation and even antagonism between States belonging to different social systems has in a number of cases given way to relations based on mutual understanding.\n95.\tNone of this can in any way eliminate the historic confrontation between socialism and imperialism or make less acute the struggle between the two opposing directions in world politics to which we have often referred from this important world platform. But the strengthening of the principle of peaceful coexistence as a real force of international development and the further redeployment of political forces on the international scene in favor of peace can shape to a large extent the relations between States.\n96.\tIf the development of the situation in different parts of the world is compared from this point of view, then it is Europe that attracts most attention. On that continent, where both world wars began, where in the post-war years a dangerous and prolonged confrontation took place between two opposing political systems and two armed camps emerged, 'there are now signs of developments and trends towards a relaxation of tension.\n97.\tThe recently signed Quadripartite Agreement on problems concerning West Berlin will serve to eliminate one of the most dangerous sources of tension and friction and to improve the atmosphere in an unhealthy area of European politics. The Soviet Union has long and consistently pursued this objective.\n98.\tAs we know, neither of the German States participated directly in the negotiations between the four Powers,\nbut they were constantly consulted and much depended on them. It is now for the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to complete the negotiations between them which are provided for in the four- Power agreement. We should like to express the hope that this stage of the settlement of the question of West Berlin will also be successful.\n99.\tMutual understanding and agreement between two continental European Powers, the Soviet Union and France, has become one of the main pillars of peace in Europe. These relations were given considerable impetus by the Soviet-French Protocol on Consultations, which was signed a year ago  and which during this short time has proved to be an effective instrument of political co-operation. We are in favor of raising the relations between the two Powers to an even higher level, in the interests of European peace and international security.\n100.\tIn the Federal Republic of Germany, the forces which evaluate the situation more soberly and have declared themselves in favor of a policy of peace and a peaceful future are showing more confidence than in the past and gaining the, upper hand. The objectives consistently pursued by the socialist States of Europe in their relations with the Federal Republic of Germany have thus become attainable.\n101.\tThe treaties concluded with the Federal Republic of Germany by the USSR 3 and the Polish People's Republic,  which are based on recognition of European realities, especially on the inviolability of frontiers, meet the interests of all European States. We expect them to be ratified and to enter into force in the near future.\n102.\tNext on the list is the settlement of relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, based on the recognition of the invalidity ab initio of the Munich agreement, and on the normalization of relations between the two countries on the basis of respect for the principles of sovereignty and equal rights in their relations among themselves and with other States.\n103.\tIf the Federal Republic of Germany makes a final break with the disastrous legacy of its past in favor of a peaceful future, no one can cast doubt on the place it should occupy in Europe and in European policy. Another reason why this should be mentioned is the unceasing activity in the Federal Republic of Germany of those forces which look to the past instead of to the future and desire above all to turn West German foreign policy back to its former course of hostility against other countries and peoples, a course which endangers peace and holds oiit'fRT\\\" prospects for the Federal Republic of Germany itself.\n104.\tWe must dwell on yet another aspect of the question, one that has a direct bearing on the United Nations. The, fact that the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany are still not Members of the United Nations is a political anomaly. The reason for this does not\nlie in any objective difficulty in solving this problem, but in the unrealistic, discriminatory attitude of certain Powers towards the German Democratic Republic. But the time is definitely past when some people pretended that this State did not exist and that they did not know what its correct name was.\n105.\tThe German Democratic Republic has firmly established itself as a real and active component of the European system of States. To be more precise, it is no longer possible to imagine modern Europe without it. But since that is the case, it is time to remove the artificial obstacles which lie in the way of the admission of the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations. We are also in favor of the simultaneous admission of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations.\n106.\tAs we know, in the communique on the recent meeting between Leonid Dyich Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Mr. W. Brandt, Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic declared their intention to promote that very solution of the problem.\n107.\tWhat has been and is being done in Europe is significant, but by no means exhausts all the outstanding problems. There are questions which all the European States must settle together, and that is the underlying idea of the well-known proposal of the socialist countries on the convening of an all-European conference on problems of security and co-operation, in which the United States of America and Canada could also take part.\n108.\tOn meeting together, the participants in such a conference could achieve a great deal in the interests of consolidating peace in Europe. Renunciation of the use of force in relations between European States and the expansion of economic, trade, scientific and technical and cultural ties between all these States are requirements dictated by our times, and the solution of these problems should be within the capacity of the conference. This is now recognized by everyone, or nearly everyone, in Europe.\n109.\tThe problem of convening an all-European conference is ripe for solution; this is now obvious, no one questions it, and the problem now is to move from the preparatory to the practical stage of the work.\n110.\tThe problem of relaxing military tension in Europe also insistently demands solution. This is one of the most important problems. The military potential of the opposing sides in Europe has been growing for many years, and though neither the Soviet Union nor the socialist countries were responsible for this, 'they have been obliged to participate in the race. The existing political tension has been adduced as the reason, but we have always regarded this argument as dubious. Now that a certain relaxation may be observed in Europe, there is no longer any room for such assertions, if we wish to face the truth rather than try to base our policy on deception of the peoples.\n111.\tReactions to the Soviet Union's proposal to begin negotiations on the reduction of armaments and armed forces in Europe show that many are in favor of this proposal. Accordingly, what we must do is set to work.\n112.\tThe convening of an all-European conference and the progress made towards a military detente in Europe should bring us closer to the solution of the problem of eliminating military blocs in Europe. This would lead to a thorough and comprehensive improvement of the situation. Let the fervent advocates of the policy of military blocs not faint at the thought of such a proposal. While such blocs continue to exist, the danger of a military confrontation between States will also continue to exist.\n113.\tIt may be difficult to achieve this goal at once, although the socialist countries have stated on more than one occasion that they would be prepared to agree forthwith to the elimination of military blocs, or, to begin with, of their military organizations. But even if we have to proceed step by step in this direction, the elimination of military blocs in Europe now seems to be attainable in principle, and this too is something new on the horizon of European politics.\n114.\tOf course, the task of improving the international situation is not limited to Europe. For all the importance of the relations between States in Europe and for all the influence of European events on the general world situation, the prevention of a new world war depends not only on them, but also on relations in general between States in all regions. When the United Nations Charter speaks of the obligation \\\"to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples\\\", it does not distinguish between European and Asian nations or between American and African nations. Universal peace can be based only on peaceful relations between all nations.\n115.\tThe settlement and development of friendly relations between any countries calls for good will, mutual interest and common peaceful intentions on their part. When these conditions are present and when countries entering into closer relations with each other do so in the context of a common concern for the strengthening of international peace, it is possible to achieve results which benefit not only the countries in question, but the world as a whole.\n116.\tThe treaties of friendship and co-operation which the Soviet Union recently concluded with the Arab Republic of Egypt  and with the Republic of India  may serve as examples. Both instruments are widely regarded as important stages in the development of friendly Soviet-Egyptian and Soviet-Indian relations, as well as significant factors in the general construction of a more stable peace. We are convinced that this is a correct appraisal.\n117.\tWe attach great importance to the development of our relations with Italy, Canada, with which we have concluded a Protocol on Consultations, Algeria, Iran, Afghanistan and Finland, with such an important Asian Power as Japan and with other countries of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America and Oceania. We make no exceptions for anyone and our attitude towards the development of contacts and ties between other countries is the same: the closer these are, the more purposefully they are integrated in the general system of efforts to strengthen peace, the more the forces of aggression will be held in check and the greater will be the benefit to the peoples.\n118.\tMuch has been said recently about the intended normalization of relations between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. In principle we regard this as a natural development. Normal relations should exist between all States. So far as the position of the Soviet Union is concerned, we have always consistently opposed any unlawful action in respect of the Chinese island of Taiwan, any deprivation of the People's Republic of China of its legitimate rights in the United Nations, the concept of \\\"two Chinas\\\" and any notion of a \\\"dual representation of China\\\". This is our position of principle, and we shall uphold it at this session of the General Assembly.\n119.\tBut the Soviet Union opposes now as before any policy which is directed against the legitimate interests and security ,of other States, including the Soviet Union, however such a policy may be camouflaged. In the past, States combined into many antagonistic groups, which led to international complications and sometimes even to wars. Yet in the end such actions always backfired against those States which had initiated and participated in them, whether they were large States or small. The generation of people who saw such combinations has not yet died out.\n120.\tThe Soviet Union's approach to its relations with the United States of America is also based on the strengthening of peace. We attach due importance to these relations, being aware that they affect international affairs as a whole. The Soviet Union is willing to develop its political contacts and economic, trade, scientific and technical and cultural ties with the United States of America, just as it is with any other State. We are prepared to seek mutually acceptable solutions. But in doing so we are not prepared to adapt our principles in international matters, our firm policy of peace, to any considerations of the moment. The steps we take in our relations with the United States of America are always in keeping with our general line of action in the interests of peace. Speaking at the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev laid special emphasis on the following:\n\\\"We proceed from the premise that it is possible to improve relations between the USSR and the United States. Our position of principle with regard to the capitalist countries, including the United States of America, lies in the consistent and comprehensive practical implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence, the development of mutually advantageous relations and, in the case of States which are prepared for this, co-operation towards the strengthening of peace, by making our relations with them as stable as possible. But we have to consider whether we are confronted by a sincere wish to solve problems at the negotiating table or by attempts to pursue a policy from a 'position of strength'.\\\"\n121.\tHowever great the power of the Soviet Union may be, we have never used it and never will use it to place our country above others. Nor do we generally accept the division of States into categories according to their sign or military might. The Charter of the United Nations is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of its Members and we fully subscribe to this principle.\n122.\tViolation of the principles of equal rights, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs and attempts by more powerful States to impose their will on those which they consider to be weaker inevitably lead to critical situations and conflicts. This is the course which is always followed by aggressors.\n123.\tIs this not essentially what is going on in Indo-China and the Middle East, which have been hotbeds of war for many years?\n124.\tStatements have been made recently in Washington concerning the intention to withdraw American troops from Indo-China. Information is published practically every week about the number of thousands by which the American forces have been reduced. But the war in Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia is continuing, and the scope of military operations even expands from time to time. The United States of America and its hirelings are continuing the war.\n125.\tThe point is not the percentage of American soldiers in the area, but the number of local troops, and whether they are being trained, armed and sent into battle under orders from Washington. The point is that the United States of America should cease its military and political interference in the affairs of Indo-China and its efforts to impose an order of its own choosing in that area Ly force of arms.\n126.\tThe world now understands full well that from the very outset, right was on the side of the patriots of Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia. Now that information which was formerly carefully concealed has become known, there is simply no more room for discussion about who unleashed the war in Indo-China and with what ends in view. It is also obvious whose fault it is that the Paris negotiations were brought to a deadlock.\n127.\tIn these circumstances, the new proposals for the establishment of peace which have been advanced by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and have been supported by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam acquire even greater importance. These proposals are imbued with a constructive spirit and are directed towards finding a rational solution for the practical problems which arise.\n128.\tNot only the friends of the Viet-Namese people, but all those who can assess the situation objectively see these proposals as a realistic way out of the prevailing situation. But what is it about them that the United States of America does not like? Why does the United States of America continue the war when all the conditions for peace are there? Why is the bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam continuing and being intensified of late, although as we know the cessation of this bombing in 1968 was a prerequisite for the beginning\nof the Paris negotiations for. a political settlement? These are questions which arise from the logic of events, and they require an answer.\n129.\tWhere the Soviet Union is concerned, our country, resolutely supporting the proposals for a peaceful settlement and pursuing its international duty, will continue to provide all the necessary support to the fraternal VietNamese people and to the peoples of and Cambodia in their legitimate struggle for their rights.\n130.\tEvents in the Middle East centre round the same problem: will the legitimate rights of the Arab States which have suffered aggression be respected, will the territories annexed by force be returned, or will the policy of aggression be allowed to triumph?\n131.\tIsrael and its protectors are obviously counting on the latter alternative. That is why they have paralyzed the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary- General of the United Nations, who was entrusted with the task of promoting a political settlement in accordance with the well-known decision of the Security Council. That is why the consultations between the four Powers which are permanent members of the Security Council are just marking time, since to be effective they require the co-operation of all the participants.\n132.\tBut Israel has miscalculated. The policy-makers of that country have made their expansionist schemes too evident to receive any support on the international scene. Now no one can believe the claim that Israel is defending its \\\"existence\\\". One by one, the false arguments with which Israel's rulers have tried to cover up the real objective of their policy have fallen to the ground.\n133.\tIsrael has refused to relinquish the occupied territories until the Arab countries agree to put an end to the state of war, yet the Arabs are prepared to agree to this.\n134.\tIsrael has insisted that a treaty of peace should be concluded and the Arab States do not object to this either, provided, of course, that all the occupied territories are returned to them.\n135.\tIsrael has expressed anxiety about its security. It is now clear that, as part of a political settlement in the Middle East, the appropriate guarantees, including those of the Security Council, can be given. These are the firmest guarantees that can be imagined in the modern world.\n136.\tNo one can now have any doubts: Israel does not want peace, or if it does, then it must be an annexationist peace. But this is contrary to the United Nations Charter and to the most elementary principles of international law, and must therefore be rejected.\n137.\tIsrael's rulers apparently believe that since they have been able to hold on to the occupied territories for four years, that situation can be maintained indefinitely. But they must be aware of the alternative to a political settlement in the Middle East!\n138.\tIs the United Nations capable of contributing to the solution of the problem of a Middle Eastern settlement?\nYes, it will be capable of this if it does not limit itself to adopting yet another resolution expressing pious hopes unsupported by practical measures and if it makes use of all the possibilities afforded it by the United Nations Charter.\n139.\tThe Soviet Union wants to see peace in the Middle East. It will continue to support the Arab States which have suffered aggression and their efforts to liberate their territories. The just cause of the Arab peoples, including the people of Palestine, must prevail.\n140.\tIndo-China and the Middle East are not the only sources of military danger. In some other parts of Asia tension is not only not declining, but is even increasing. The situation in the area of the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent is becoming increasingly complex. It must be admitted that India has cause for concern at the turn which events have taken in East Pakistan. The flow of refugees into India has given rise to serious difficulties and problems which are not only economic. We are convinced that a political settlement of the problems which have arisen in East Pakistan is the only means of achieving a general relaxation of tension in that region. Moreover, all the States of the region must be associated with such a settlement. The refugees must be returned to East Pakistan, and this will become possible only when their safety there is ensured. The present situation in the area is acute, and this is not merely a domestic problem. The Soviet Government would like to express the hope that this situation will not lead to a military conflict between the States of the region an.: that restraint and reason will prevail.\n141.\tThe peoples of Asia need lasting peace and a situation in which their resources and efforts are not dissipated in conflict, but are directed towards the solution of social and economic problems on which the raising of their standard of living, of their economy and culture, primarily depends.\n142.\tIt will be recalled that the Soviet Union put forward the idea of establishing a system of collective security in Asia which would ensure a state of stability on that continent. Time and effort may be needed to put that idea into practice, but the situation which has arisen in Asia requires that such efforts should be made and should be pursued consistently.\n143.\tAnother essential condition for normalizing the situation in Asia is to put an end to interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people. The United Nations, for its part, should stop serving as a screen concealing the foreign occupation of South Korea. That is the purpose of the proposals submitted to the General Assembly by a number of socialist and non-aligned States concerning the withdrawal of United States and all other foreign troops from South Korea and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. We can only regret that the consideration of these questions, which require immediate solution, has been deferred until the next session of the General Assembly. Such an approach in no way helps to reduce tension in the Korean area. On the other hand, we note with satisfaction that during the discussion of the question whether the items concerning Korea should be included in the agenda of the current session of the General\nAssembly, some 30 countries spoke against the clumsy maneuvers of those who are afraid of a broad consideration at this session of the topical questions of the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and of the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission.\n144.\tIf we are to choose an area of international relations in which the interests of all States coincide and in which an impulse by the United Nations is particularly necessary to speed up progress, such an area is that of questions relating to the cessation of the arms race and to disarmament.\n145.\tThe arms race is fraught with new and unknown dangers and its adverse effects on the life of our society are now more profound and more dangerous than ever before. During the post-war years, the money spent on armaments has been several times greater than the total annual national income of all the developing countries in the world. This waste of material and intellectual resources is taking place at a time when many millions of people have no bread to satisfy their hunger and no roofs over their heads to shelter them from rain and cold and when over one third of the population of our planet are illiterate.\n146.\tIt would be wrong to say that nothing has been done to check the arms race. Nuclear weapons tests in the air, in outer space and under water have been prohibited, the proliferation of these weapons among States has been stopped, and the siting of weapons of mass destruction in outer space, on celestial bodies and on the sea-bed and the ocean floor has been prevented. The conviction is growing that the solution of the problem of banning underground nuclear tests can no longer be postponed. The ideas of the creation of nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world and of the elimination of foreign military bases in the territories of others are gaining increasing support.\n147.\tEfforts for the prohibition and destruction of bacteriological weapons are proceeding in the right direction. Negotiations for an appropriate convention are nearing conclusion. This should be an important practical step not only in limiting the arms race, but also in actual disarmament. We are dealing here with the elimination of one specific type of weapon and, moreover, a weapon of mass\\\" destruction. The task of also prohibiting and eliminating chemical weapons lies ahead.\n148.\tThere has been growing awareness recently of the need to take measures to prevent the accidental occurrence or deliberate provocation of incidents involving the use of nuclear weapons. This purpose is served by the agreement reached recently between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America.\n149.\tThe talks between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the limitation of strategic arms are continuing and are now concentrated on the preparation of an agreement on anti-missile systems. Unless the expansion of anti-missile defense is halted now, a chain reaction Of competition between offensive and defensive weapons will inevitably take place, as it did in the past between naval armor and the artillery shell, the difference being that this competition would be immeasurably more dangerous and more costly.\n150.\tThe successful outcome of these talks would serve the interests of the peoples of both the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, as well as the cause of strengthening universal peace. In view of the increasing importance of the talks, the Soviet side is intensifying its efforts to reach agreement, which must of course be based on the principle of equal security. But the success of the talks also depends to the same extent on the other side.\n151.\tAchievements in limiting the arms race are only the first steps towards disarmament. However important they may be, to stop there would be to shirk the solution of the basic problem. And we are convinced that, from the point of view of what is possible, it can be solved. The whole question is whether there Is a desire for such a solution.\n152.\tThe Soviet Union recently advanced a proposal to convene a conference of the five Powers possessing nuclear weapons-the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, the People's Republic of China, France and the United Kingdom-with a view to examining questions of nuclear disarmament. One of the nuclear Powers we approached, France, supported this Soviet initiative. But then another announced its opposition, whereupon the remaining two hastened to declare that in the existing circumstances the convening of a conference of the five nuclear Powers had become an \\\"academic'' question.\n153.\tThe Soviet Union does not consider that the other nuclear Powers have said the last word. All those who view matters realistically understand that nuclear disarmament can be achkved only with the participation and agreement of all five iiuclear Powers and that they cannot absolve themselves of this responsibility.\n154.\tA radical solution of disarmament problems will, of course, call for the united efforts of all States, irrespective of the size of their territories and populations, the level of their military might and their economic potential. The Soviet Government believes that further intensification of efforts to achieve disarmament would be promoted by the convening of a world disarmament conference in which all the States in the world would participate, and that this question should be examined at the current session of the General Assembly. The relevant item has been included in the Assembly's agenda at our proposal fA18491J.\n155.\tIn the not-too-distant past, States have already approached the question of convening a world disarmament conference, but for various reasons it has so far proved impossible to hold such a conference. The general political situation is now more conducive to this.\n156.\tIt is essential to make the most of these developments, bearing in mind the fact that, although during the post-war years disarmament talks have been conducted in the widest variety of places, all States have never yet gathered together to discuss disarmament questions. Yet +his problem affects them all without exception.\n157.\tThe universality of the world conference and the participation of all States might contribute to its success.\n158.\tThe tasks before the world disarmament conference would of course be enormous. That Is why it should perhaps become a permanent forum, or rather one operating over a long period. Its sessions might be convened periodically, say, once every two or three years. In view of the fact that the nuclear arms race arouses the greatest concern among the peoples, first priority should be given, if the majority of the participants in the conference express this wiJh, to questions of the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons, the use of which cannot be tolerated by the conscience of mankind.\n159.\tThe world conference should be convened outside the United Nations, so that it can be attended by all States, irrespective of whether or not they are Members of the United Nations. It is self-evident that Its convening should in no way detract from the significance of those forms of, and channels for, disarmament talks which are now being used, Including the Committee on Disarmament. On the contrary, the Committee on Disarmament should intensify its work.\n160.\tBoth the existing channels for negotiations and any which may be created in the future would contribute to preparations for the convening of the world disarmament conference, and later to the actual drafting of specific agreements on disarmament in pursuance of the decisions of the world confoiencc.\n161.\tStates must obviously be given some time to conduct the necessary consultations on questions relating to the convening of the world disarmament conference. In this connexion, we consider that the General Assembly might address an appeal to States to agree not later than 1972 on the date of the conference and on its agenda.\n162.\tIn view of the above considerations, the Soviet delegation hereby submits the following draft resolution for the consideration of the General Assembly:\n(The speaker then rear? out the text of a draft resolution which was subsequently circulated as document A/L.631. For the text, see Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-sixth session, Annexes, agenda item 97.]\n163.\tWe believe that this draft speaks for itself. We call upon all delegations to give it due attention.\n164.\tIn considering all these questions, within the United Nations or outside it, no one should forget that disarmament negotiations are being conducted in circumstances where the arms race is not only continuing, but is being accelerated. This may appear to be a vicious circle, but it can and must be broken. This is demanded by the most vital interests of mankind.\n165.\tDisarmament is the most reliable means of strengthening international security and ensuring peace, this is clearly expressed in the United Nations Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security which was adopted at the twenty-fifth, anniversary session of the General Assembly [resolution 2734 (XXV)], at the initiative of the Soviet Union.\n166.\tThe Declaration has been correctly assessed as a program of specific measures which, taken together, can\nradically change the international situation for the better. Some of its particularly significant features are that it reaffirms the principle of the inadmissibility of acquiring territories through the use of force and strongly emphasizes the obligation of all States Members of the United Nations to carry out the decisions of the Security Council and to do everything in their power to enhance the authority and effectiveness of this organ, on which the Charter confers the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n167.\tIn this connexion, we should like to state frankly that the Security Council is by no means carrying out its functions as it should under the Charter of our Organization. The founders of the United Nations envisaged the situation rather differently. They envisaged it in such a way that no one should paralyse the Council's activities and that all the States which have been trusted to become members of that organ, especially its permanent members, should carry out their obligations with a sense of responsibility, so that no violator of peace should go unpunished and so that the activities of the Security Council should be based on the agreement reached during the Second World War, when the foundations of the United Nations were laid and its structure was elaborated. We believe, however, that this situation can be remedied, if the policies of States particularly of the great Powers, are directed to the pursuit of genuinely peaceful goals.\n168.\tThe twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly will have to consider the question of how the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security is being implemented [item 34]. It is not enough to adopt even the best possible declaration: every effort should be made to ensure that it does not become a dead letter.\n169.\tYet such a danger exists, because not all States Members of the United Nations are in practice acting in accordance with the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security for which they voted. Many of the considerations I expressed earlier can serve as examples of this.\n170.\tThere are yet other facts of the same kind. For example, let us take the clause of the Declaration which calls upon all States to desist from any forcible or other actions against peoples still under colonial rule and to render them assistance in their just struggle. This requirement is not being fulfilled by those very States to which it is primarily addressed.\n171.\tThere are different forms of colonialism and racism, but none of them is better than any other, be it the Portuguese kind, supported and sustained by the NATO military bloc, the South African kind, with its policy of hatred-apartheid, or any other kind.\n172.\tAnd now, when the great torrent of national liberation movements has destroyed nearly all the strongholds of colonial empires, there are still people and even governments which vaunt the pseudo-civilizing action of the colonialists and are trying-in one form or another and on some pretext or other-to maintain their rule over the last colonial territories. If they think that the peoples have forgotten how much blood and sweat the policy of certain\nStates has cost the peoples of Africa, Asia and other parts of the world and if they think that they will be allowed further to oppress and exploit those who still remain under their domination, they are mistaken, and history does not forgive such mistakes. The United Nations has done a good deal to help peoples in their struggle for freedom and independence. It must do even more. Colonialism must be finally eradicated.\n173.\tThe Soviet Union is in favor of the full and unconditional implementation of United Nations decisions on the elimination of remaining colonial and racist regimes. We shall continue to provide material and political assistance and support to all the peoples striving towards that goal.\n174.\tThe United Nations must of course take vigorous action in all the areas provided for in its Charter. We can only welcome the fact that a number of questions arising from developments in the scientific and technical revolution will be considered during this session of the General Assembly. The Soviet Union introduced one such item into the agenda of the session, the question of the preparation of a treaty concerning the moon [A/832* J.\n175.\tThe time has come to reach agreement on universally mandatory rules which would be binding on all States and which would ensure the study and utilization of the moon in the interests of the present and future generations for peaceful purposes only. We hope that our proposal on the conclusion of a treaty concerning the moon will receive the support of all States Members of the United Nations.\n176.\tPreparations are being made for two important international conferences, one on problems of the human environment and the other on the law of the sea. The United Nations must make its contribution to these conferences, since they will be discussing questions which in modem times are closely linked with conditions of human life and the further progress of civilization.\n177.\tThese are new problems, arising from life itself. The United Nations is also faced with not a few old problems, which have not, however, lost their urgency for its Members, especially for the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The problems of international economic co-operation have been discussed in the United Nations for many years, but this has not led to any improvement in the economic situation of most developing countries. That situation remains serious.\n178.\tThe struggle of the developing countries against one-sided, agreements and other forms of neo-colonialist oppression and lawlessness is constantly expanding. It is being conducted both by the young States which have recently gained political independence and by developing countries which ceased to be colonies long ago. The United Nations cannot stand aside from this struggle. It is in duty bound to support those who are defending their legitimate rights to liberation from economic oppression, to free national development and to labor for the well-being of their peoples, not for the profit of foreign monopolies.\n179.\tMore than a quarter of a century has passed since the United Nations was founded. This is a considerable period.\nDuring this time the Organization has experienced some failures. It has not always acted with sufficient resolution in cases where it should have shown firmness and energy. But on the whole it has proved that it can serve as a useful instrument of peace and development of international co-operation if it follows the right course and strictly observes the United Nations Charter.\n180.\tNevertheless, even now the question sometimes arises of the priority that should be given to certain United Nations activities. The answer was given in the days when the foundations of this Organization were established, when the Charter of the United Nations was signed. The principal task of the United Nations', the basis of all its activities, is the maintenance and strengthening of peace and the prevention of a new war. The United Nations was established for that purpose and that is its very first priority in its work. The peoples of the world evaluate the results of every session of the General Assembly and of every meeting of the Security Council by considering whether effective steps were taken towards the attainment of that essential goal. The Soviet Union, for its part, will do everything in its power to ensure the success of this session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "62.\t I should be giving no evidence whatsoever of originality if I were to recognize, along with all of the preceding speakers, that the opening of a dialog between Peking and Washington is an event of extraordinary importance, one which may indeed profoundly modify the international political situation. The \\\"realists\\\" have at length and unanimously been expressing their delight. I willingly concede that it was essential for 700 million human beings no longer to be left outside the community of nations. However, I shall not surprise you if I say that, as far as the Government I represent is concerned, the Malagasy Government, our misgivings outweigh our satisfaction.\n63.\tOn the one hand, because the Peking authorities have not, as far as 1 know, given up exporting their policy of subversion-the pernicious character of which is felt all the more strongly by the countries of the third world because of the feebleness of their resources and their still-fragile structures-it would be wise, before we raise this grand new banner, to make certain that our new partner intends to respect one of the basic principles of the Charter: noninterference in the internal affairs of other States.\n64.\tOn the other hand, the circumstances in which this new event was prepared, decided upon and announced must necessarily leave smaller nations somewhat perplexed. Those circumstances in fact seem to indicate that in the conduct of their affairs the great Powers are not hampered by ideology or previous agreements and are guided only by their own interests.\n65.\tFrom this rostrum I have often deplored the all-too- obvious dichotomy between words and deeds. My fears, unfortunately, were only too well founded, and, as far as I am concerned, I am apprehensive of a new Yalta leading to a new marking-out of areas of influence, to the detriment of the rights of peoples to self-determination.\n66.\tMay I stress this point, because I know that there are many here who share my anxiety. It would be indeed tragic if the hopes that were raised by decolonization, a process which has restored the rights of the subjugated nations of Africa and Asia, were to end up in another form of domination, even if that new form were to prove more subtle and less apparent. It would be even more tragic if the super-Powers were to wage by proxy a war which they do not dare wage openly,\n67.\tThe Malagasy Government will of course be following with the greatest attention the development of the discussions and the negotiations that will take place. Our attention will be particularly keen for two reasons.\n68.\tThe first is the existence in Madagascar of a large Chinese community, to whose loyalty and industry I wish to pay a tribute. The existence of that community is not at all in question; however, we cannot be entirely indifferent to the question of whether it is culturally attached to a democratic or to a totalitarian State.\n69.\tThe second reason is the friendship that ties us to the government of Formosa. It is a friendship based on mutual esteem that has been remarkably strengthened by most valuable and highly appreciated technical assistance in the field of rice-growing and cottage industries.\n70.\tIn these circumstances, add subject to whatever new factors may be introduced -something which, in my view, seems very improbable- the Malagasy Republic will maintain diplomatic relations with the Government of Taipei,\n71.\tIt is not within Malagasy traditions to abandon our friends, especially when they are going through hard times. One of our proverbs expresses the strength of this idea very well: \\\"Do not give up the domestic fowl in your own yard in order to go out chasing a wild guinea-hen with colored feathers\\\"\n72.\tIn this course, the Malagasy Republic remains faithful to the ethical standards of its people, to the ideals of justice and freedom enshrined in its Constitution, for after all, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek who affixed his signature to the Charter that founded our Organization.\n73.\tI come to another crucial point, in the diplomacy of Madagascar, which has to do with the relations between Madagascar and South Africa.\n74.\tThroughout my life I have struggled against racism in all its forms. As a black man, I have suffered harsh repression, imprisonment, a sentence to hard labor for life, and exile all of which were imposed on those who were at the forefront of the struggle to free our oppressed brothers. At this very rostrum on many occasions I have denounced the concept and consequences of apartheid. As far as patriotism or love of Africa are concerned, Madagascar has nothing to learn from anyone. No nation can or ought to assert the right to give lessons to others.\n75.\tIn the fullness of its sovereignty, the Government to which I belong has concluded an agreement on trade and co-operation with the racist Government of Pretoria and my deputy, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, visited Pretoria at the beginning of last August.\n76.\tI have had an opportunity to point out that, as a close neighbor of South Africa, Madagascar has every interest in maintaining good relations with that nation, for economic as well as strategic reasons.\n77.\tI should also stress that ideological differences between the eastern countries and the free world have never prevented them from carrying on a particularly active trade. What I should like to stress most of all is that our position stems from this fact: the warlike utterances of the past years, the repeated condemnations, have proved fruitless. As for what I modestly call the direct action desired by some, that would unfortunately lead only to a worsening of the position of the people mainly affected and would bring chaos to Africa. War would only cut down the finest flower of African youth and we in Madagascar do not want to see that.\n78.\tWe think that the solution should be approached from a different standpoint. A dialog must be begun. We must talk and ensure that the dialog leads to a gradual whittling away of a situation which must be condemned from every point of view.\n79.\tIf the whites in South Africa prove themselves to be such racists it is because they are afraid of what they consider to be the black peril. So we must exorcise them from this demon of fear. I am convinced that this is the proper course of action because, as the Minister from Malawi said after President Banda's visit: \\\"South Africans will never be the same again after they have seen their leaders receive us Negroes so well.\\\"\n80.\tdialog, negotiation, provided of course that they take place among the parties concerned-these in the opinion of the Malagasy Republic are the basic methods for settling the disputes and conflicts from which mankind is suffering at present.\n81.\tMay negotiations be initiated between Israelis and Arabs on the basis of recognition of the rights of all the peoples of the region and respect for the political sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States. May the Paris conference on Viet-Nam cease to be an eternal dialog between the deaf while that unhappy country, a military proving ground, continues to see its children mutilated physically and-what is even worse-ravaged spiritually and culturally!\n82.\tNor can we be indifferent to the fact that millions of Bengalis are being expelled from their homes and, after long wandering on land and water, being packed into improvised camps in conditions of indescribable misery.\n83.\tOf course it is not for us to interfere in the domestic affairs of Pakistan. However, would we be doing so if we were to ask for some humaneness in the conduct of repressive operations?\n84.\tOn the other hand, it is certainly a duty of our Organization to mobilize the resources which are indispensable to alleviate the unspeakable sufferings of the refugees. It is absolutely scandalous that, when the industrial Powers are stockpiling large surpluses of powdered milk, wheat, meat, and powdered eggs, women and children should be dying by hundreds of thousands. Will it be said that the consumer society was indifferent to their fate? Of course I do not wish to minimize the efforts which have been made by certain States, in particular by India. What I am saying is that not enough has been done and that it is urgent that the problem should be viewed in its proper perspective.\n85.\tFollowing our eminent Secretary-General, I should like in this connexion to address a pressing appeal to the major Powers. They have supplied, and are continuing to supply weapons to both sides. Would it not have been wiser simply to provide clothes and food? Would not the solution to the conflict itself have been much easier if the super-Powers had not found there a new opportunity for fanning the flames of regional rivalries and fighting one another by proxy?\n86.\tHere I return to one of the main themes of my statement. Small nations should not continue to be the play tilings of large nations; self-determination should no longer be a stylish slogan but should become reality.\n87.\tI shall not dwell on the problems of disarmament. My country's position is well known. A peaceful nation, it wants a limitation of armaments and the outlawing of atomic weapons. An under-developed nation, it wants the funds now being set aside to build up the forces of destruction to be used to finance action in favor of economic and social progress in the third world.\n88.\tThis naturally leads me to mention the problems of development and to recall the main concerns of my Government once again. As we are about to enter the Second United Nations Development Decade, we must note that the implementation of the resolutions of the New Delhi Conference  has not been satisfactory.\n89.\tIn 1970, the total contribution of all States members of the Development Assistance Committee still represents only 0.78 per cent of their gross national product, as against a target of 1 per cent in 1972. The amount of public assistance has only risen slightly, so that if we take into account the rise in prices, its real volume has dropped if compared with 1969.\n90.\tFurthermore, the assistance given by these same countries members of the Development Assistance Committee includes a greater proportion of loans, the amount of which is now comparable to the amount of donations. When we realize that in the ledgers of the private sector their contributions are posted as insurance credits for exports, we cannot fail to be somewhat disturbed at the development of this assistance, since it seems to increase only to the extent that it is a commercial proposition.\n91.\tConcerning the generalized preferences, I must note that certain donor countries have excluded from the scope of generalized preferences products which are of particular interest to the developing countries, whether these be textiles, fuels or processed agricultural commodities. As a representative of a State which is associated with the European Economic Community, I must also note that the advantages of the association are reduced by the entry into force of a system of generalized preferences without the legitimate compensations which the associates had a right to expect being granted.\n>2. I could give many more examples. I could also point out how precarious the results are. In fact, the current monetary crisis has had as its immediate consequence a noticeable decrease in the assistance given by the main donor country, the United States, and we cannot view without great concern the decision of the same country to apply to the poorer countries the 10 per cent surcharge imposed on imports of manufactured or semi-manufactured products or even on such primary commodities as vanilla. Can we even think of putting Japan, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France and Germany in the same boat as Upper Volta, Rwanda, Burundi, and Madagascar and the Comores? We think this is an unspeakable injustice.\n93. I shall not go so far as to say, as some experts have, that this measure sounds the death-knell of the preferential system, on which a bad agreement had only just been reached after years of laborious negotiations. I shall merely say that the interest of the poorer countries does not seem to have been the main concern of the rich countries.\n94.\tHowever, I am convinced that, the demands of the poorer countries could easily be satisfied if they could benefit from a diversion of the considerable funds which are allocated by the rich countries to armaments, the conquest of space, agricultural price supports, and leisure. Recently, the headlines of a major French newspaper proclaimed that the American astronauts had left $100 million on the moon. As a human being, I must bow to the scientific achievement represented by the exploration of our satellite, and to the heroism and the courage of the men responsible for this achievement. But I cannot help thinking at the same time that peasants in Africa, Madagascar and possibly South-East Asian countries as well are still using agricultural implements which date from the Middle Ages and that very often they must carry their crops away on their backs.\n95.\tIt is quite clear that under present conditions the gap between the rich and poor countries is constantly growing, in spite of the fact that, as the world progresses, the position of some of the poorer countries has become less unbearable.\n96.\tI have on more than one occasion stressed in this very hall the risks of conflict entailed by this state of affairs and the insidious aggravation of North-South antagonism which flows from it. I shall not revert to this matter. What I would like to do, however, is to draw the attention of the industrialized countries to another aspect of the problem, with the hope-although it is a tentative one-that they will take heed of this because it involves their interest, their balance and their future.\n97.\tIt has become quite clear-and the forthcoming United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held at Stockholm in June 1972, will stress this-that industrial civilization is confronting Europe, the United States, and Japan, and the countries of the East, too, with considerable dangers because of overcrowding and pollution. Life as such is becoming more and more difficult. The increase of industrialization and its corollary, urbanization, is posing problems which everyone is describing as insoluble over the medium term.\n98.\tWe in the developing countries have some difficulty in understanding the importance and scope of these problems. In any case, we are ready to help solve them. Since we are the purveyors of commodities and energy, why not transfer some activities to our country? The only result could be a better balance for mankind as a whole. The decline in living conditions in the industrialized countries would be arrested, on the one hand, and on the other, economic and social progress in the third world would be accelerated.\n99.\tNow it will be argued that the problem is easier to state than to solve. I agree. Indeed, as far as my country is concerned, I would not agree that those transfers of activity should be converted into a new form of colonialism.\n100.\tBut it does seem to me that the interests of both sides could none the less be safeguarded. It should be possible to accelerate the process of industrialization in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and South-East Asia while safeguarding the interests of investors as well as of the nationals of the countries concerned. Ho* would that be done? A certain number of principles may be stated: the choice of the activity and its establishment should be worked out by common agreement; nationalization-in the sense of Africanization or \\\"Madagascarization\\\" for example-of property and management within limits to be determined should be envisaged and described in detail; and the bulk of the resulting profits should remain in the country concerned. On the other hand, the Governments concerned should offer guarantees for the security of capital and should promote the establishment of national savings and be more active in bringing about regional co-operation.\n101.\tI am quite aware that these problems are being debated at great length, by experts certainly more competent than we are in other bodies, such as UNCTAD, UNIDO and GATT. I mention these matters because I have the feeling that those studies and meetings are sufficiently advanced for a decision to be taken. But I also feel that such a decision will not be forthcoming until such time as a clear political will to that end has emerged. It seems to me that we could in fact provide that political will and become that driving force for new initiatives and new accomplishments.\n102.\tThose are the principal concerns of the Malagasy Government in the face of the great problems of the world today.\n103.\tYou will thus understand, Mr. President, how pleased we are to congratulate you on your election to your high post. Leaving aside the basic affinities between the people of Madagascar and the fraternal people of Indonesia, whose pride you are, we are sure that under your presidency our debates on all these essential items will take place in a climate of tranquility ensured by your impartiality, and in a businesslike manner, which has been your hallmark throughout your brilliant international career. Madagascar salutes you.\n104.\tIt is not without regret, however, that I raise these grave matters, mindful that henceforth we must deal with them in a climate overshadowed by the decision of our devoted Secretary-General to leave us. I hope that U Thant will find in my tribute the fervent echo of the gratitude of Madagascar, and I must say I have been instructed by the President of the Republic, Mr. Philibert Tsiranana, to urge him to remain at his post for the better functioning of our Organization-an Organization which he has so well served and in the interests of a fruitful search for peace for troubled mankind.\n105.\tUntil recently, man depended strictly on his environment; in such circumstances, it was inevitable that the struggle for life assumed brutal forms, such as wars between clans, tribes and nations, or profound inequalities among men of the same clan, tribe or nation. Today, thanks to hi? intelligence, man has really become master of his own destiny. He has tamed nature, has increased his control over birth, and has found ways of postponing death. It would be absurd for the old quarrels to continue and for inequalities to persist when it is now possible to bring about peace and to make prosperity accessible to all, especially when such quarrels and inequalities can only result in a terrible tragedy indeed, the destruction of mankind itself.\n106.\tMindful of that danger, but aware also of the immense potential of the human intelligence, my Govern- ment-and I hope the arguments I have put forward have left you convinced of this-has ceaselessly striven, and will continue to strive, for dialog and universal progress.\n107.\tI am sure that I will be heard by this Assembly, but what I particularly wish is to be heard by the Governments that have sent their representatives here. Our Organization must cease to be a mere meeting place and must become once again a centre of action and decision, as its founders wanted it to be. In this way, nations great and small will be associated in the joint search for solutions to the great problems in respect for the rights and interests of everyone. It is this wish that I express, in concluding my statement, for the triumph of peace, justice and freedom.\n\n\n\n\n"

If that were true, Mr. President, you would have made a very bad statesman and our Assembly would have made a poor choice in electing you to preside over our debates and to guide our work. In any case, the representative of Tunisia, together with his distinguished colleagues from friendly countries, are honored to have chosen in you a man with heart and spirit and who, in addition to distinction, has both serenity and wisdom and the calm determination of faith.\n158.\tThat President Hambro, a Norwegian, should be succeeded by President Adam Malik, an Indonesian, is more than a happy coincidence; it is a fine symbol, a comforting sign which we should like to see always there, constituting a whole program of mutual assistance and solidarity: the tore' being passed from the North to the South; Europe strengthening forth its hand to Asia in order to associate it with its hopes.\n159.\tIn associating your name in the same tribute, Mr. President, with that of our distinguished colleague, President Hambro, we should like at the same time to pay a tribute to the tremendous efforts made by Europe in its policy of political detente and co-operation, and to bow before martyred Asia, which a tendency to intolerance and hegemony has plunged into the warlike tensions of the Middle East, the absurd war in Viet-Nam and the fratricidal confrontation in Bengal.\n160.\tIn greeting you, Mr. President, we should like to voice the hopes that your presidency will mark for Asia the end of this long journey through blood and stormy weather, and the beginning of a new ear of concord and peace.\n161.\tThis wish which we all share has, as we know, always encouraged U Thant, our Secretary-General, who is a credit to Asia because of his origins and to humanity because of his qualities.\n162.\tIn the midst of the tempests, pitfalls and difficulties which arise repeatedly; despite the great Powers, which are not always encouraging, and small Powers which are often defiant, and though budgetary vexations continue to add to your daily worries, you have been able, Mr. Secretary-General, undoubtedly by sacrificing your health, to keep our Organization on the right path. For that, Tunisia expresses its gratitude. The exceptional role of guardian and guide which, for 10 years, you have played is something, you owe, which we all owe, in fact, to your exceptional\nqualities, We also owe it to the devotion of your co-workers and lastly, we own it to the value of this institution, our Organization,\n163.\tEntering into this year of grace after 25 years of continuous striving for peace and progress, the United Nations remains the most effective instrument for bringing man to man, and endowing him with an ever-growing universal conscience and public spirit. With its specialized agencies, which constitute as it were its skeleton, with its membership, which is as it were its flesh, and with its peoples and their profound aspirations, which form its soul, it is growing stronger from day to day, and will soon, we hope, gain renewed strength with the admission of the People's Republic of China, and will be recognized everywhere as the universal expression of modern democracy.\n164.\tThanks to your tenacity, Mr. Secretary-General, and your calmness, the action which you initiated 10 years ago is beginning to yield fruit. The concern for peace is becoming more and more pressing both in South-East Asia and in the Middle East where, unfortunately, the results of your efforts have not been very encouraging. Europe is becoming more and more wedded to a policy of collective security and co-operation,\n165.\tThe People's Republic of China will shortly be taking its true place in our Organization in order to assume its role as a great Power, which is justified by its history, its geography and the extent and virtues of its population.\n166.\tThe Second United Nations Development Decade, by sharpening the will of small nations and arousing the competitiveness of the great, constitutes the spearhead of progress-some fruit at last, after so much effort.\n167.\tIn view of these and many other facts, it would be only right that you, Mr. Secretary-General, should be able to taste the fruits of your numerous efforts. In requesting, in beseeching, you to sacrifice yourself again in the service of the United Nations, I am aware, of course, that I am going too far and demanding too much of your strength, but we all know that when you serve, you always rise to the challenge and serve well. I am not the only one to address this appeal to you, Sir, and I hope you will accept it as a tribute and an expression of the friendship and gratitude which Tunisia feels for you.\n168.\tI should like to make a few comments in relation to the situation in the Middle East, which, by deteriorating is rotting the peoples and countries of a very sensitive area.\n169.\tFor half a century Zionists and Arabs from Palestine and elsewhere have been in a state of warlike tension, the one faction defending its recent conquest, the other awaiting its revenge, alternating thus between arrogance and hatred. The Palestinians, the Arabs, bloodied but unbowed, and the Israelis, carried away by the strength of their arms but not victorious, continue in the face of the uncertainties of tomorrow to contemplate violence. Even those who mention the Israeli-Arab conflict here or elsewhere are looked upon with suspicion if they do not speak a certain language. One is obliged to use certain words, as one uses a certain currency, a currency which has been coined for war and which serves only to peddle hatred and to bring together men who are devoid of feeling and imagination. It is a counterfeit currency which continues to circulate, however, and falsifies discussions, human relationships and the entire situation in the Middle East.\n170.\tThose who believe they can settle the Israeli and Arab conflict according to the accepted rules of war or in accordance with the requirements of our era, with the logic of the calculating machine and in the manner of a sporting gentleman playing the game and probably having to pay up are deluded. The problems of the Middle East are specific; they are too emotional; they cannot simply be turned into punched cards. In every facet of the situation and at each step of the solutions envisaged, the complexity, density and intensity of the problem becomes apparent. Let us not forget it is in this region that heaven has met earth in order to touch it with its grace, that there has been a longstanding rivalry which continues to err against the spirit, to commit crimes towards men and sacrilege towards God. Let us be on our guard; this is the time when faults are committed through pride, prestige, self-love and overheated passion, and, in such cases, the degree of error, particularly that of the great Powers, could be commensurate with their colossal size and, when it is fatal, it is always the small nations which fall victim.\n171.\tIt is true that ways of tackling the problem go completely astray when they touch upon this sensitive area. It is true that they can seem disordered, always heated, and often merely superficial. It is true that they are more metaphysical and mythical than real. The fact is that problems in this part of the world are essentially matters between men in the full sense of the words, matters of the heart where the requirements of dignity and pride, of honor and generosity, and of privation as well arise spontaneously and almost in their pure state. One should not be contemptuous of this approach. One must have enough humility to realize that fortunately many problems of our planet are emotional ones and that the heart still has its reasons and its requirements in the lives of men.\n172.\tAbove all, let no one believe that, in the Middle East, we are unmoved by reason and solutions which appear to be logical. But let not pride delude us into thinking that logical solutions will always succeed. Let it not be believed that everything falls into place according to the calculations of the computer. It is true that the Arab countries give the appearance of chaos, with extreme abundance in certain cases and extreme wretchedness in others. There is a tendency for both to try to seek protection from the great in order to perpetuate their quarrels, or to shelter from the blows of fate. It is also true that the great Powers believe that they can ensure their domination by having proteges, nay, even clients. It is quite obvious today that the great Powers are opposing each other, goading each other and getting each others' measure through small countries, sometimes foisting on them their surpluses of out-of-date arms or by trying out on them new forms of conventional arms.\n173.\tIf in the past the Arab countries have been frequently guilty of errors and failures let us at least have the courage to say that it is in their camp that the right can be found today, and a sincere readiness to abide by the rules of the international game.\n174.\tLet us be honest enough to notice that it is the unreasonableness of Israel which stymies decisions in the United Nations, clouds all prospects and encloses us in a sort of dialectic of despair, which incites some to commit the folly of hijacking aircraft, some to mortgage their development effort by channeling the major portion of their energy and resources into armaments, others even to risk disorganizing the State by legitimately trying to inculcate respect for it, and still others to change regimes by a military coup d'etat because they are unable to change events any other way.\n175.\tYet, never have the Arabs in the Middle East found themselves so oppressed, so misunderstood and in such a completely hamstrung situation as they are now. If, for them, the worst is never certain, the best seems, unfortunately, for the time being, to be escaping them-the best, of course, being the prospect of peace. This dead-end situation is particularly serious because the Arab countries  mainly Egypt-have- done everything they can to create objective conditions which would put an end to tension and which would set peace-making machinery in motion.\n176.\tAt the same time, in the position of Israel, there is such a lack of reason, such an excess of contempt, such excessive arrogance, such a desire to flout this Organization, its Secretary-General, its Security Council, its General Assembly, its bodies, the four great Powers and each and every one of us at the same time, that it is really enough to move whole mountains of indifference and inaction. The great Powers may be very touchy about affairs of amour propre and prestige but how can they let the authority of the United Nations and public opinion become so degraded? This is what is really shocking and, when the time comes, this wit sot fail to bring changes in trends, policies and even alliances.\n177.\tIn the case of Israel and South Africa, certain great Powers just let things take their course, even seem to desert the United Nations; its recommendations have no effect and its moral authority fluctuates and becomes devalued like common currency.\n178.\tThere is a sort of unintentional aptness when certain great people in America, Europe and elsewhere consider the United Nations as the image of passing youthfulness, the refuge of certain nostalgic memories of a long departed bitter-sweet era. What leaves us nonplussed about Israel is its nature, its policy, its tendencies. What gives us pause is this attitude of constant defiance, which is constantly displayed by the Israel leaders towards this Organization, which brought them into being by arbitrarily, in 1947, imposing on the Palestinians the creation of this land in a country which was undoubtedly under British Mandate, but which had its own nationals, the Palestinians, including Moslems, Christians and Jews. The fact that the roles have, today, been reversed to such an extent that the victims of yesterday, the Arabs, are now committed to respecting the resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations and the Israelis, those who were favored in 1947, consider the United Nations as I quote what certain people are saying in the Israeli press the \\\"burial-ground of aborted\nresolutions\\\" says a great deal about the way the minds and customs have evolved on both sides. In the case of the Israelis we cannot refrain from thinking of the type of a spoiled child-mentioned by Montsigne -who are plump and spoon-fed and who spit on the breasts of their mother and yell their anger in the face of those who gave birth to them.\n179.\tMay I tell Mr. Abba Eban whose courtesy, whose skill is equaled only by his tremendous oratory which he has pleasure in so frequently exercising in this Assembly-of the position we Tunisians hold, who although we are nowhere near the frontiers of war are touched in our very hearts by the fact of an Arab-Israeli war. Mr. Abba Eban, as you know we have no hatred for you, we Tunisians, nor do the Palestinians, whom you have deprived of a homeland and homes and whom you have destined to be eternal refugees; nor do the Arabs, whose territories you have seized, nor do the Christians, nor do the Moslems, in whose case you have been guilty of violence by continuing to desecrate Jerusalem. No, none of these harbours resentment towards you. In Tunisia, thanks to what has been done by President Bourguiba, we, who were forged in the white heat of solidarity for the love of our cause, we are making a constant effort to banish odium, which is so sterile, to avoid red herrings, and to look reality in the face in order to see it closely, to know it better and to reach properly to it.\n180.\tThe reality of the present situation in the Middle East is not in accordance with what you have said in your statement [1946th meeting/, Mr. Abba Eban; to offer to see Mr. Riad, on the basis of what you proposed, is something, I think, which you did much more to produce an oratorical effect than to arouse any response which Mr. Riad might be prepared to give you and which it is not fitting for me to speculate about. But to use up your tremendous mental energy over wretched squabbles about meetings, refugees and procedure and all this in order to open the canal that really takes the cake! Really, this is not up to the standard of the great Arab-Israeli debates with the extent and complexity of which your are well acquainted. You are still very wide of the mark, Mr. Abba Eban, I say this to you simply and calmly.\n181.\tIt is also true that you have a large helping of unreasonableness and excess, but the danger which threatens you, which threatens us all in this region, is your tendency to overlook realities. It is your tendency not to think about the future or, rather, to think about it like a miser, and to make small cheeseparing proposals. Unless it be that you want to treat as an inferior one who is your enemy in the present state of human law, namely , the one upon whom the United Nations imposed you in 1947. Oh, I know quite well that during those 25 years you have been hardening your heart. It is even said that your 'hawks' are so savage and so exclusive that the 'doves' have deserted Israel.\n182.\tPlease do not always be so quick to show arrogance, contempt. Do not be slow in seeking reparation, in offering a reasonable initiative if you sincerely want peace. You are being oppressed, you are being tortured because you do not want to change, because you do not even allow yourself to take the least step, you hold yourself in check by being formal and confining yourself to a rigid procedural frame-work. To hold territories occupied as direct sureties to bring about a fait accompli, here, to move people out there and to mobilize oppression against Palestinians everywhere is to ensure for yourself and the region future misfortune, to thwart from the outset any efforts towards peace it is to opt for the enforced maintenance of this exaggerated nationalism. In fact, it is also to opt, both inside and outside, for a type of man and society which feeds on chauvinism, which preaches intolerance and fanaticism, which inside the country carries out witch hunts against those who do not share the same opinions and multiplies threats against those outside who do not accept their conditions.\n183.\tYou have referred to international ethics. You have made much of the scale of values which leads the antagonists to negotiate with each other. But did you not think that in your dealings with the Palestinians and the Arabs all values have been destroyed and flouted? In your case, as in the case of the Palestinians, humble shopkeepers, workers, even women, have been turned into killers. Have not you given some thought to the fact that the content and the significance of ethics has changed, that the scale of values has been turned upside down: robbing, smuggling, lawlessness, armed attack, political assassination, violation of property and quite recently the hijacking of planes have been considered as acts of patriotism? Did you not give some thought to the fact that hatreds have germinated 25 times, that during the three wars which have been won all Palestinian families have been dismembered, dispersed, discarded, ruined? And this is true also of many other Arab families? And these seeds of revolt are scatter throughout the region? So, what scale of values are you speaking about? What precedents are you referring to? To meet with you? Sc. what. Of course we could meet, but why? To what end? To confirm your attitude of arrogance, which has so often been proclaimed and made public?\n184.\tLeave to one side, I beg you, Sir, the Americans, the Russians, the Chinese, Mr. Jarring and the United Nations. Tell us, you, yourself, if you are prepared to leave Jerusalem. Come right out and tell us that you never accepted the Security Council resolution and that the day before you spoke it was even announced that you would reject it. Tell us here and now if you are prepared to accept a Palestinian homeland, a Palestinian State. How do you intend live in this Palestine? What form of coexistence with the Palestinians would you choose? Are you objectively considering the possibility of peace? Actually, Sir, your errors, all your errors are essentially errors of the mind. Your principles, your conditions, you enunciate them for yourself. They have no effect because they lack that touch of universality and generosity which affects men's hearts, which guides them towards a solution. They do not concern man but 9 category of man, the elect, Zionists.\n185.\tA mental error cane seen in this trend which you have to construct a society on the caste of the elect to the detriment of the Palestinians and the Arabs, who are perhaps the pariahs. As you cannot find in the principles of reason, in the teaching of civilizations, any justification for your supremacy you have sought them therefore in mythology. As you could not support yourself with law you have supported yourself with military force. You know\nthat it is impossible to build anything valid on myths and brute force. It is also a mental error because there can be no lasting peace and valid coexistence without consent and adherence on the part of those who accept it, and experience has shown that those who accept it only act like whipped dogs because they undoubtedly find themselves closer to the whip. This is true of certain Palestinians whose territories continue to be improperly occupied by you. No. You cannot go on indefinitely and with impunity acting against religion, reason, morality and faith. I think, Mr. Eban, that you are sincere in your five-point Declaration. I even think that this is perhaps the worst and most disquieting thing about it. We are beginning to wonder more and more whether it is in the nature of your regime to be able to bring about peace. Please do not say that the Arabs, the Palestinians themselves, are balking at peace talks. In the conditions of war the parties can only speak war to each other. Propose conditions for a valid peace and you would be astonished yourself by the sense of responsibility and constructive spirit of the most adamant of Arab leaders, including the Palestinians.\n186.\tThe meetings, direct discussions, international precedents, logic, scale of values, are all merely words. And it is not because you use these words that we should necessarily fear them henceforth; it is not because you lack peace that we should not make a further bid for it and it is not because you want to exclude the Palestinians who are essential partners that we necessarily have to exclude you.\n187.\tOnly an open, tolerant Palestine which would see both Jews and Palestinians coexisting in forms to be determined, which would give us a society with common laws and a power assumed by its lifelong members the Christians, Moslems and Jews, would ensure that you no longer sow the seeds of hatred in the Middle East, and be the powder-keg which is always on the point of exploding.\n188.\tA question of dates? Perhaps , But also and above all it is a question of behavior and of commitment. Let the Israelis conduct themselves in a manner permitting coexistence between Jews and Arabs, as was and is still the case in Arab and Moslem countries. The only way to reach this is to agree to commit oneself to a de-zionization, as Germany earned coexistence with the European countries and the rest of the world when it pledged itself to denazify the country. And we believe that those who helped the Germans to exorcise the demon of nazism, the Americans, the Russians and the Western allies particularly, could help the Jews to exorcise this demon of Zionism. In doing so, they would contribute to peace in the Middle East. They surely would not help to bring about a just and lasting settlement of the problems in this region by spying on one another, testing each other, seeing each other's hand behind the antagonists and playing hide-and-seek of a new type, which is more dangerous than the cold-war because it is more underhand.\n189.\tIn point of fact, under the pretext of having the detestable principle of the balance of strength between belligerents maintained, the great Powers have created an explosive situation throughout the Mediterranean, which is all the more explosive because it feeds on the state of war between the antagonists. The attempt to balance the strength of the belligerents has led to two equally detestable results: gradually there has been an unwitting escalation of armaments among the great Powers and at the same time there has been escalation among the small Powers.\n190.\tThis situation has turned the Mediterranean into the focal point of antagonism between two of the great world Powers; it directs energies towards military preoccupations rather than economic ones, which eventually is a disaster in so far as inadequate progress and development thus open the door to political adventures within the country, to instability, to chaos and to misfortune.\n191.\tHenceforth, it is less important for the Russians and the Americans to quit this bubbling morass of intelligence and counter-intelligence than that Europe should be there in full view as an effective and exemplary presence in order to show that it has a more dynamic, more peaceful, more edifying and more attractive viewpoint to offer. With Europe and the great Powers, we should like to return to the spirit of solidarity and magnificent mutual assistance which has made it possible for Aswan to be brought about and not that which enabled Malta to polarize the military Powers, because Malta is considered more as a strategic fortress which it is important to control than as a human community which should be assisted in its action for development.\n192.\tIn this Mediterranean, which is the mother of civilization, the cross-road of races, ideas and religions, where the East meets the West, the North with its technology and its terrifying requirements meets the South with its under-development and its no less terrifying consequences, the profane, the sacred, liberalism and its fascinating allurements, dirigisme and its no less formidable over-simplifications. In this Mediterranean which has become the eye of the hurricanes the arena of despair, we should like to find a new source of inspiration, a new reason for acting together with the Europe is and those who would like, throughout the world, to see the Mediterranean reflecting the world about which our youth is dreaming, a Mediterranean where relations would be based on the exchange of ideas, experiences and men, a Mediterranean where we prefer peaceful emulation to rivalries, and co-operation to confrontation and massive assistance and technical aid to the machines of war .\n193.\tThus we are following with particular interest the remarkable efforts which have been made by Europe, which is now coming into its own as a community . We see there the advent of a reassuring force; and, however unaware it is that it is not its sole mission to bring together the Atlantic and the Urals but also to unite the Baltic and the Mediterranean, we are sure that it will radiate so much human warmth, peace and solidarity that it will contribute to illuminating and marking out the roads of the future. Provided that the matters to be taken up in Helsinki relative to Europe's security and to co-operation are not restricted to the problems of yesterday those of Berlin, wartime frontiers, military pacts, etc., but extend instead to the burning issues of the present day those of the Israel-Arab conflict, the tension in the Mediterranean, solidarity between North and South-we welcome that conference of hope and express the wish that it will be held as soon as possible and that it will be successful.\n194.\tThere is another event which is being awaited by the world with some impatience-impatience or curiosity mixed with hope and a certain anxiety, as if to underline the importance of that event. I am referring to the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations as a great Power with the same prerogatives and the same rights as the other four great Powers.\n195.\tFor some time its admission appeared to be an event involving a principle; today it appears to be an event which could prove to be a source of something further: it could be the first in a whole series of acts and consequences hitherto unthinkable.\n196.\tWe of Tunisia envisage the entry of the People's Republic in the spirit of those who are setting out on a long, difficult and hazardous voyage; with it here in this Organization we will undoubtedly discover new shores, and perhaps a new source of inspiration and a fresh reason for working which will be different and will permit the United Nations to launch itself into this new quarter-century with fresh vigor and authority.\n197.\tWith the admission of China into international society, there will of necessity be a new deal, a reassigning of roles, a better adaptation of the Organization and its organs to the changes through which we are living, and a better balanced, more diversified and therefore richer international life. We believe that that Power, which possesses the atomic bomb, will be much more at home in the United Nations, which is so concerned with disarmament, than outside it.\n198.\tThe United Nations, if it admits that country, will undoubtedly gain a second wind, both politically and morally, in its role as the most, authentic expression of the most elevated thoughts of men and of peoples.\n199.\tThus carried along by the wave of the future, the People's Republic of China will fly its flag over Manhattan, with all its mysteries, with all its breadth and with all its tremendous reservoir of moral energy and new values. If it is now perhaps a cause of uncertainties and excesses, it could also equally be the hope of more light and restraint. It could also be the shipwreck of authority and hope. Absent today, without any obligations or responsibilities in international life, it fascinates people; it has a charismatic effect on our minds and excites our imagination with its view of man and the role which man should play in society.\n200.\tThere, in the fervor of Maoism, a new kind of man, a product of the Long March, the red book, the cultural revolution and a monolithic society, is beginning to emerge. If for many he is not the model to be followed, he does nevertheless embody the essence of rejection of the so-called consumer society-the industrial society, where the machine and the computer have taken over power and where man tends to be thrust aside.\n201.\tFor the allegation of Tunisia, the admission of the People's Republic of China constitutes an essential matter; the question of Taiwan, an important one. It might be unfair, perhaps, from the ethical point of view, and incorrect politically, for us to yield to the requirements of one candidate for admission to the United Nations and\nexpel another which is a Member. But is Taiwan that other one? Would it have any existence once the People's Republic of China has its rights restored: That is the question.\n202.\tTunisia, faithful to its traditions and its approach, if called upon to choose between an essential matter and an important one, will choose the essential matter, hoping that what remains, that is the \\\"other\\\", will not, as Sartre said, prove to be the \\\"hell\\\" of the United Nations, We, at any rate, will always find some way of reconciling the forces of rejection and the tendency to schematize things which seems to characterize the People's Republic of China, and we shall also find some way of adapting ourselves to society and modern life to its requirements, with all the subtleties inherent therein. Our path will be one of creative imagination-innovation, and not simply in the systematic rejection which, as I say, seem to characterize China, nor in the alienating indiscriminate acceptance so often imposed by present-day systems and the so-called consumer society.\n203.\tWith the forces which are gaining strength in Europe and elsewhere; with the emergence of Africa and of many Asian countries, with the ethic of non-alignment, which we hold dear, we are struggling to attain the only dreams of which we can conceive; for the meaning of life, for us, is the struggle for man, because our air, our land and our sea do not yet know the problems of pollution which are changing the whole form of life and which are the lot of the developed countries. It is because our people, for all its wretchedness and its blemishes is an inexhaustible source of freshness, spontaneity and purity. It is for this reason that we can envisage a future in which we realize our dream of development in a spirit of solidarity, dignity and independence, of course within the international framework of a more effective United Nations-a more flexible, more universal, more human Organization, a United Nations whose spirit we shall continue to glorify and whose action we shall continue to uphold.\n"

        "file_text": "113.\t Mr. President, on behalf of the Norwegian Government I wish to congratulate you on your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I can assure you that the Norwegian delegation will extend its full co-operation to you in your efforts to make this session successful.\n114.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to our distinguished Secretary-General, U Thant. for his dedicated service to the United Nations during the last decade,\n115.\tThe world has lately witnessed two developments which could lead to a positive evolution in international politics. I have in mind the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and the new development in Chinese-American relations. The Norwegian Government welcomes these developments, which could lead to solution of many of the problems of Europe and Asia. At the same time we regretfully note again that no significant progress has been made in the Middle East; nor is there any change in the situation in southern Africa.\n116.\tOne of the problems that have tended to freeze old positions m post-war Europe has now, to a great extent, been removed. We trust that the agreement on Berlin reflects a genuine will to establish more normal conditions in that vital part of Europe. We also feel that the main obstacle to a conference on security and co-operation in Europe has been overcome. My Government attaches great importance to such a conference.\n117.\tSince the end of the Second World War Europe has lived in a state of tension. Money and energy have been spent to avoid armed conflicts rather than to promote co-operation and development. It is our fervent hope that we are now at the threshold of a new era in inter-European relations. A Europe no longer harassed by wars and disunity should be able to make a larger and more constructive contribution to world-wide co-operation within the frame-work of the United Nations.\n118.\tThe lack of normal relations between two of the greatest world Powers-the United States and the People's Republic of China-for more than two decades has been an unnatural state of affairs. We hope that the steps now taken will lead to the elimination of distrust between those Powers and contribute to a peaceful future in South-East Asia. We are aware that this is not achieved overnight, but we have the feeling that a vicious circle of long standing has finally been broken.\n119.\tWe hope -hat the General Assembly now will finally decide to restore the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in our Organization, We look forward to the active and constructive participation of the People's Republic in the work of the United Nations. This will add new strength and authority to the Security Council,\n120.\tFurther efforts must be made to find a solution to the tragic conflicts in Indo-China. Lasting peace in that area can be achieved only through a political solution based on the rights of the peoples of Indo-China to determine freely their own future.\n121.\tMan is too often a slave of the past. Remnants of the cold war distort the perception of the present and prevent us from having a clear picture of the problems of today. The battles of yesterday keep us from moving forward with imagination and courage when conditions are ready for new policies. We are now in a period when the frozen positions of the past are breaking up. In this situation we must take care that new alignments do not create new antagonisms.\n122.\tDue to the lack of political will among Member States, the United Nations has not succeeded as we had hoped and wanted. Political circumstances might now be more favorable to a better use of the world Organization. At the same time there is a growing recognition that certain problems can be approached and solved only in a multi-lateral framework and in a pragmatic way. The very nature of these problems will in our view necessitate closer international co-operation, The United Nations family of organizations is the best framework for this development. Norway is ready to offer its full participation in this process and to share the responsibilities.\n123.\tSome of the problems on our agenda can be solved only through multilateral action. Prominent among these is the threat to our environment. In the course of this decade we will have to decide whether humanity is willing to take effective action to meet this challenge or let nature, and thereby the basis for life on this planet, be gradually destroyed. The forthcoming United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm offers a great opportunity to launch the first massive attack on this vital problem. Norway is determined to take an active part in that work.\n124.\tMy Government has noted with concern the ever- increasing danger of maritime pollution. Together with the other Nordic countries, we are convening next month in Oslo a conference of the countries bordering on the North Sea and the North-East Atlantic, for the specific purpose of preventing pollution of the oceans. The recent dumping of poisonous waste in that marine area has made it imperative to develop stricter international rules in this field.\n125.\tAt the August session in Geneva of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, Norway presented a draft resolution on preliminary measures to prevent and control maritime pollution [A/8421, annex V, sect 2], My Government proposes that the General Assembly make an earnest appeal to Member States to take appropriate preliminary steps to prevent and control marine pollution emanating from sources within their national jurisdiction. We deem such preliminary steps necessary and useful until adequate international instruments have been worked out in Stockholm in 1972 or at the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea. It is our intent to work for the adoption of a resolution along these lines during the present session of the General Assembly.\n126.\tThe problems related to the regime of the ocean floor and to the preparations for the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea are of vital importance. We must seek practical ways to ensure that the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction will in fact be the common heritage of mankind.\n127.\tNorway is committed to the task of finding equitable solutions to the other outstanding issues of the law of the sea. We hope that the third United Nations conference on the law of the sea will be convened at an early date, if possible during the spring or summer of 1973.\n128.\tAnother important problem is the pollution of the human mind caused by the abuse of narcotic drugs. This problem has become of particular concern to an increasing number of nations. Vigorous and concerted international action to combat the illicit production of, traffic in, and abuse of, narcotic drugs is essential and the only effective way to cope with this social evil of steadily increasing proportions.\n129.\tMy Government attaches great importance to the question of human rights in armed conflicts. The primary purpose of our Organization is the prevention of armed conflicts. Nevertheless, once such conflicts do break out we must have the rules and the machinery to ensure that basic human rights are safeguarded. This also applies to types of conflicts not traditionally covered by the Geneva Conventions. Developments have shown that the distinction between international and other armed conflicts is no longer relevant. This fact should be reflected in the elaboration of new rules of international law for the protection of war victims.\n130.\tHowever, rules and machinery are not enough. Equally important is the will to assume the financial burden :o alleviate the sufferings of the civilian victims of armed conflicts. For years we have lived with a problem of that kind. I have in mind the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East [UNRWAJ. Last year the General Assembly unanimously decided to establish a working group to look into the financial crisis of that Agency [resolution 2656 (XXV)/. We note with concern that, in spite of the dedicated work of the group and its able chairman, only a limited number of Member Governments have responded positively to the appeal for contributions. The Agency needs a more solid financial basis in order to continue its important humanitarian work.\n131.\tIt is of paramount importance to find a just and lasting political solution to the problems of the Middle East. That is not possible unless due regard is paid to the rights of the Palestinians.\n132.\tIt is the duty of humanity to alleviate the hardships of the East Pakistani refugees in India. This is a problem of such magnitude that it cannot but affect the international community. The Indian Government deserves credit and respect for the way in which it has handled the refugee situation. A political solution to the problem must be found. Other nations may ease the burdens of the refugees, but it is important that such conditions be established that the flow of refugees be stopped and the refugees return home.\n133.\tThe Norwegian Government has contributed substantially to the United Nations relief program for East Pakistani refugees in India. My Government gives full support to the program now being undertaken by the Secretary-General for East Pakistan. It is imperative that sufficient financial resources be made available for these programs.\n134.\tDecolonization has in most instances taken the form of peaceful and orderly transition of power. Freedom and independence have been restored to formerly dependent peoples. But hard-core colonial problems remain. The peoples of southern Africa are still oppressed by colonialism and apartheid.\n135.\tWe have presented our views on the question of Portuguese colonialism in the United Nations. We also raised this question at the Ministerial Meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 June of this year. Our position has been and remains the following: the Portuguese Government must bring an end to its colonial rule.\n136.\tThe advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice* has confirmed the illegality of South Africa's presence in Namibia. We now have a new point of departure for our efforts to make freedom and independence realities in the life of the Namibian people.\n137.\tA solution must be found to the problem of compensation to those independent countries in southern Africa which are suffering economically or in other ways burdened by the sanctions against Southern Rhodesia and by the racial and colonial situation in southern Africa. Our major concern must, however, continue to be the dependent peoples in that area, They are struggling to attain the rights which have been established and confirmed in international declarations and countless United Nations resolutions. My Government will provide the peoples of southern Africa that are struggling for national liberation with humanitarian and other forms of economic assistance. The Norwegian Government will increase its efforts in that respect both through the United Nations and through direct contacts with national liberation movements in southern Africa.\n138.\tThe financial crisis of the United Nations is even more acute today than when we last met. It is clear that this crisis is in its essence political. The budget of the United Nations is very small indeed compared with the enormous sums spent on armaments in the world of today. It is tragic that the nations do not attach a greater priority to our Organization. My Government sincerely hopes that the Members during this session will find means to place the finances on a sound footing. Also in this respect we must look forward instead of losing ourselves in debates about the past. We must show our faith in the political future of the United Nations.\n139.\tStructural changes and innovations are also called for in the world organization, especially in the context of the Second United Nations Development Decade. An appropriate evaluation machinery to review progress and performance during the Decade is essential. Adequate machinery to deal with the scientific and technological challenge facing us in the process of implementing the provisions of the International Development Strategy is of great importance.\n140.\tThese development issues should be considered under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council, in accordance with the role accorded to that Council in the Charter. The Norwegian Government recognizes, however, that the present size of the Council does not make it adequately representative of a total United Nations membership of 130 countries. Consequently, Norway supports the enlargement of the Council and would express the hope that the so-called \\\"package\\\" resolution that was adopted by the Council last July [resolution 1621A (LI)] will serve as a useful basis for the Assembly's deliberations,\n141.\tIn this Organization we are accustomed to think in multilateral terms. This will be even more so as the process towards multilateral action in international affairs develops. Let us not forget, however, that bilateral contacts have not lost their importance in the relations between States, But the instrument ought to be adjusted to the needs of modern times. Many of thg rules guiding traditional diplomacy are inherited from another era and seem pompous and out of date in the modern world. Very often they tend to emphasize ceremony at the expense of efficiency and reality. Is it not a task for the United Nations to break new ground in this field?\n142.\tMany of the questions I have mentioned have in common that they all call for international action. They can only be dealt with in a realistic and constructive way if nations are willing to co-operate and act together, some-times by surrendering part of their formal and traditional sovereignty. It is true that the United Nations is based on the sovereign equality of all Members. It should be remembered, however, that the most constructive use of sovereignty in this age is to pool national sovereignty in a steadily increasing effort to solve common problems, be it on a global or a regional basis. Thereby we can gain real control of developments.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "110.\t  This session of the General Assembly is meeting at a time when new dangers and threats to international peace and security have been added to those that already existed, at a time when the problems which concern the world are becoming still more complicated. The aggression of American imperialism has gone beyond the frontiers of Viet-Nam and has spread to the whole of Indo-China. Arab territories are still occupied and the prospects for peace in the Middle East seem to be more favorable than before. The Powers that practice the old and new methods of colonialism persist in their policy of oppression and ferocious plunder, of hateful racial discrimination and of the massacre of patriots and colored populations. The two great Powers have increased the arsenals of war and are brandishing weapons in the four corners of the world. Never perhaps have the demagoguery and hypocrisy of the aggressors on the subject of \\\"peace\\\" and \\\"security\\\" been so unbridled and so cynical as they are today; never have they used such resources or expended so much energy to brutalize the human spirit and poison man's conscience.\n111.\tBut never have the imperialists and the aggressors encountered such strong and determined resistance on the part of the peoples, which have risen up and are struggling to defend their freedom, their independence, their rights and their sovereignty. An ever-growing number of sovereign and peace-loving countries are resisting the hegemonic policy of oppression and aggression and are repulsing it. The defeats suffered by the imperialists and the aggressors have shaken their positions from top to bottom. The international isolation of United States imperialism and its allies is becoming more and more obvious; the more stubbornly they persist in their policy of exploiting peoples and robbing them of their freedom, the more numerous are their failures and their difficulties.\n112.\tThe capitalist world is now shaken by a grave crisis in its monetary system, which is the biggest and the most 'disturbing of the period since the Second World War and whose epicenter is the crisis of the United States dollar. That crisis has given rise to a new state of tension and great perturbation in relations between capitalist countries, particularly between the countries of Western Europe and Japan on the one hand, and the United States of America on the other. It is the expression and the inevitable consequence of the general crisis of the capitalist system.\nThe United States dollar crisis has led to the appearance, in all their acuity, of deep-seated political, economic and social contradictions, and domestic and foreign antagonisms, which gnaw at the main imperialist countries, particularly the United States of America. Thus, what was to be expected has taken place what, indeed, could not but have taken place.\n113.\tFaced with a situation in which the law of the unequal development of the economy of the capitalist countries has its inevitable effect, confronted with aggravation of the contradictions and of the struggle for world markets, and as a result of its entire policy of aggressive expansionism on the international scene, the United States of America has gradually lost many of its privileged and dominant positions in the capitalist world. The policy of world dominion, aggression and war constantly practiced by United States imperialism, the militarization of the economy and the frenzied arms race, the maintenance of military bases and of numerous armed forces throughout the world, the diversionary and subversive activities which * it conducts on every continent and its efforts to extend its tentacles to the economies of the developed and the under-developed countries have obliged it to undertake enormous expenditures that the United States economy is unable to cover. The dollar crisis, in one aspect, is the economic expression of the political defeats suffered by United States imperialism.\n114.\tTo meet the colossal expenses required to follow its expansionist course of world dominion, the United States circulated large sums in dollars both at home and abroad; and through, threats and blackmail on the political, economic and financial levels against other countries, it endeavored, with difficulty, to maintain the old nominal value of its currency.\n115.\tFor some time the United States of America withstood the worsening domestic inflation and the drain on its gold reserves, and its partners resigned themselves to making their contribution to correcting the difficulties of the dollar. But when the privileged and dominant positions of the dollar as the basic currency in the international monetary system were endangered, the United States Government sounded the alarm and started new efforts to solve its crisis without too many painful convulsions. It unilaterally proclaimed the measures with which everyone is familiar, without asking the prior assent of its partners, and flouting the interests of those partners and its undertakings under international agreements.\n116.\tNixon's new protectionist policy, his pressures on other countries to revalue their currencies, and so forth, are a flagrant challenge to the partners of the United States and tribute that United States imperialism is trying to impose on the peoples of those countries. The gravest consequences of these measures, namely, growing unemployment, rising prices at a time of a wage-freeze, reduced expenditures on public services and increased taxes will weigh more heavily on the working masses than on anyone else, and their living standards will decline still further. The United States Government has taken these measures not only to prevent the devaluation of the dollar but also to save the whole course of its aggressive policy. These measures imply means and methods of finding new possibilities for carrying through the wars already begun and for preparing new ones in order to exploit and plunder other peoples.\n117.\tThe panic which seized the finances and the economies of the European Common Market countries, Japan and the Latin American countries following the dollar crisis clearly shows the difficulties in which United States imperialism can put its partners when it comes to protecting its own hegemonic positions; it reveals how precarious is the basis on which relations among themselves are built. It would be naive to suppose that those countries will stand idly by and that they will quietly submit to United States economic diktat. No, they too will struggle; they will resist and defend their positions and interests. All that will inevitably aggravate the struggle between competitors on the world market, will change relations in international trade and will entail a resurgence of the struggle of monopolies to grab new markets. We already see the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan and a number of other countries that are the most harmed by the United States measures maneuvering to find a way out.\n118.\tThe United States of America, which is clinging to its dominant positions, will step up pressure and blackmail in order to prevent its partners from going too far in the measures they may adopt in their own defense, and it will multiply its efforts to intimidate them by invoking the danger of communism and revolution in order to force them to undertake the greatest possible share of the burden by acquiring as many commodities as possible on the United States market, particularly armaments, by increasing military expenditures and their contribution to the cost of maintaining United States bases and troops on their territory.\n119. Taken as a whole, the present monetary crisis will exacerbate all the contradictions of the capitalist world. The dollar crisis will damage, in the first instance, the economically weak countries at whose expense the United States is seeking to make profits. The inequality in their trade will only be accentuated. The crisis will lead to a weakening of the economic potential of capitalist countries, to a decline in production, to the closing of factories, and so forth. There can be no doubt that those countries, each on its own account or within the framework of various groupings, will resist United States imperialism in the defense of their own interests and their national independence, that they will try to confront the situation and that in so doing they will step up the rivalries and the competition among themselves. The trade war, which has already begun, is governed by its own savage laws which are as pitiless as those of war proper. The history of past conflicts has taught us that the struggle for markets was the basis and the prelude of the greatest conflagrations.\n120. Before this situation, it is becoming even clearer what dire consequences may ensue from close bonds with the United States of America and its economy, with its inevitable inherent conflicts and crises. This once again confirms how important and essential it is for any country which is concerned to develop freely and independently, and particularly for any developing country, to rely on its own strength and to concentrate its efforts on exploiting' its own natural resources and domestic possibilities. We have every confidence that the situation created will raise the political consciousness of the peoples and the working masses, who will not bow before this new attack on their vital interests but will use it to strike heavier blows at the positions of imperialism headed by the United States, in order to advance their struggle; for this will assuredly be so.\n121.\tFor more than 20 consecutive years the General Assembly has faced the problem of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and the expulsion of the representatives of the Chang Kai-shek clique from the Organization, a problem the just solution to which would be very advantageous to the cause of peoples and peace-loving States, to international peace and security and, to a very large extent, to the normal functioning of our Organization itself. The Government of the People's Republic of Albania has long drawn attention to the tremendous strength of the People's Republic of China and the unquestionable role that it plays in the present development of the world, and emphasized that without its participation no important problem of our time can be settled. We have emphatically pointed out that the world, and above all, the United Nations, has great need of the People's Republic of China and that it cannot do without that great socialist State, which represents a quarter of mankind and which has consistently followed a policy of peace and international co-operation.\n122.\tBlinded by their deep hostility towards socialism and the great Chinese people, the United States of America and its allies have, since the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to this very day, striven by every means to subjugate it; they have pursued against it a policy of war, have undertaken armed provocations and flagrant acts of aggression and have girded its frontiers with a vast network of bases and military pacts to enclose it in a circle of fire. They have organized against it an embargo and a ferocious political and economic blockade, and they have endeavored to isolate it diplomatically. The Soviet-social- imperialists, too, have joined these anti-Chinese activities in recent years and have directed the iron lance of their expansionist policy against the People's Republic of China. They constantly inflate their frenzied propaganda, replete with calumny and fiction and hatch aggressive plans against it. They have committed armed provocation and acts of aggression, and today they are concentrating their armies close to the Soviet-Chinese frontier.\n123.\tBut the United States imperialists and the Soviet social-imperialists, as well as all their collaborators, have totally failed. Great China is going ahead with giant steps, and it has won tremendous victories in the socialist revolution and in the socialist construction of the country. It is now stronger than ever; it stands like an unshakable citadel of revolution and socialism in the world. It is a powerful supporter of the struggle of peoples for freedom and national independence and is making an immense positive contribution to the course of events in the international arena. Its prestige and authority are constantly growing. The eyes of the world's peoples and of peace- and freedom-loving sovereign States that seek friendship and sincere support in their struggle to build an independent life are turned towards great China.\n124.\tTime has vindicated the judgment of our party and our Government in assessing the strength' and the role of great socialist China in the world. It has shown that our judgment was no mere propaganda, but the expression of a great reality-the expression of our correct Marxist-Leninist view of world developments.\n125.\tThe day has already come when in the face of this great reality, following the determined revolutionary policy of the People's Republic of China, many States of the world have had to change their attitude towards it. Finally convinced that they could no longer proceed by ignoring the Chinese colossus, that the policy dictated to them by United States imperialism was leading to an impasse, and also thinking of their own national interests, many countries have begun, one after another, to recognize the People's Republic of China and to establish diplomatic relations with it. These signs of realism in the attitude of these countries vis-a-vis the People's Republic of China clearly show that the hostile and short-sighted anti-Chinese policy of the United States of America has suffered a heavy defeat on one key point. It proves that the United States is unable to isolate the People's Republic of China or even to prevent the increase of its influence in the world and the extension of its international relations.\n126.\tIn the United Nations, too, there has been a striking turn-around of forces in favor of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China. Suffice it to note the well-known fact that here in this Assembly there has been a year-by-year increase in the number of States voting for the draft resolutions submitted by Albania and various co-sponsors-draft resolutions that we have constantly and firmly upheld. While in 1968 the result of the voting was 44 in favor and 58 against, in 1969 the score had risen to 48 in favor and 56 against; and, in 1970, to ?>1 in favor and 49 against, thus ensuring the number of votes required for a solution of the problem.\n127.\tFaced with the new conditions thus created, fearing a total failure of the policy it had practiced thus far in regard to the People's Republic of China and of its own ever-deepening isolation in this matter, the United States has changed lis tactics and now pretends to have adopted a new attitude tGT-'&ds the People's Republic of China. But nothing has changed in the essence of its traditional anti-China policy, since the United States has not renounced the artificial obstacles it raises to the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and the immediate expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and since the United States has not withdrawn its military forces from Taiwan-that indivisible part of Chinese territory-and the warships of its Seventh Fleet from Chinese coastal waters. These are the first essential steps that the United States must take.\n128.\tIts proposal placed on the General Assembly agenda under the title \\\"Representation of China in the United Nations\\\" [see A/8442] is a new hostile maneuver, a new effort to accomplish the old United States plot of \\\"two Chinas\\\" and to legalize, through the United Nations, the separation of Taiwan from the motherland, and its military occupation of that Chinese province. By its proposal the United States is attempting to disorient the work of the Assembly and to postpone to as distant a date as possible the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in this Organization. Yesterday, at the 1950th meeting, the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers, while openly distorting realities, or resorting to unfounded, contradictory arguments, once again tried to sow confusion in this Assembly and to throw up a smoke-screen to conceal the hostile policy of the United States towards the great \u00bb Chinese people.\n129.\tWe also note that the United States of America is constantly bringing pressure of all kinds to bear on a large number of States not to vote at this session for the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China and for the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, despite the fact that many of them wish to do so, since they take the realistic view that the world, the cause of peace, and the very progress of this Organization would have nothing to gain if a puppet which represents nothing, and is nothing other than an instrument in the hands of United States imperialism, were to remain here.\n130.\tWe are convinced that even those States that in determining their attitude on this question are still under United States influence, because of political, economic and military links with that country, will finally find the necessary strength to reject the United States diktat and to join the majority of peace-loving States. This is the propitious moment for them to act with courage, as their own national self-interest dictates.\n131.\tThe People's Republic of Albania and many other countries have long stressed that the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, a founder Member of the Organization and permanent member of the Security Council, is a simple and clear question. There is only one China in the world, the People's Republic of China, and Taiwan is an integral part of its territory, and the Chinese people of 700 million is resolved to liberate that part. Only the Government of the People's Republic of China has aU the necessary qualifications and powers to represent the Chinese people and the whole of China in international relations and in the United Nations. The Nixon Government's present proposal is nothing more than a brutal and unprecedented intervention in the domestic affairs of a sovereign State, a flagrant violation of our Organization's Charter. On 20 August this year the Government of the People's Republic of China condemned and resolutely rejected this United States maneuver and categorically declared:\n\\\"Should a situation of 'two Chinas', 'one China, one Taiwan' or 'the status of Taiwan remaining to be determined' or any other similar situation occur in the United Nations, the Government of the People's Republic of China will have absolutely nothing to do with the United Nations. This just stand of the Chinese Government is unshakable.\\\" [See A/8470.J\n132.\tThe United States and those that take their cue from its hostile anti-Chinese maneuvers should seriously take account of this formal declaration. The foreign policy of the People's Republic of China is a consistent policy of principle. Great socialist China will never bargain away the principles of Marxism-Leninism which underlie its policy. The peoples of the world are profoundly convinced of this, and imperialism and social imperialism must clearly recognize as much. Let no one deceive himself. The strategy and\ntactics of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, guided by Chairman Mao Tse-tung, and the Chinese Government, are based and built upon the principles of Marxism-Leninism, which they always apply with dedication and with which they act in rigorous and unchanging conformity in the interests of the great Chines? people, socialism and revolution.\n133.\tMy delegation believes that time presses and that the present session of the General Assembly faces an important test in seeking justly and definitively to resolve the question of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The only just solution of this question in full conformity with the will of the Chinese people and the provisions of the Charter is that proposed by the resolution submitted to this session by the People's Republic of Albania and 21 other co-sponsoring States [A/L.630 and Add. 1]. We invite States Members to join their efforts so that the General Assembly not allow itself to be drawn into the United States game, and not sanction the Organization's complicity in the anti-Chinese activity of the United States; we also invite them to struggle energetically for a comprehensive and jL-t solution of the question of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, in the interest of defending the rights of peoples and sovereign countries, of peace and. world security. This would undoubtedly be an important step forward, to the advantage of the Organization itself.\n134.\tAn objective and realistic appreciation of the development of events shows that the oppressive and aggressive policy practiced by the United States and by the revisionist Soviet Union to establish their world dominion is now suffering more and more crushing defeats under the blows of the revolutionary and liberation struggles of the peoples. An important role in this sense is played by the just policy of the People's Republic of China, which supports and defends- the rights of peoples, their freedom and independence. A great contribution in this direction is also made by many sovereign peace-loving and freedom-loving States, irrespective of their size. My country considers it an honor to be in the front rank of the fighters against imperialism and social-imperialism and to uphold and assist, through its just and principled policy, the struggle of the peoples for freedom and independence.\n135.\tTo remedy the grave situation in which they find themselves, the United States imperialists and the Soviet socialist imperialists are not only using demagogy and deceit but also having more and more recourse to brute force. They are interfering in the domestic affairs of other countries and committing armed aggression. To this end they are trying to activate aggressive alliances that they have set up and that they control and which they often use against their own partners.\n136.\tBut this too does nothing to reduce their difficulties. Within these aggressive alliances, particularly NATO and the Warsaw Treaty, there is no unity, and these alliances are going through a phase of disintegration rod disarray impelled by centrifugal forces from within and by the general contradictions of imperialism and revisionism. Numerous member countries of these alliances no longer regard them as means of defending their interests but as an instrument in the hands of the great Powers to attain the objectives of hegemonic policy. We are convinced that the more and more marked tendency to escape from United States and Soviet control to the extent possible will be intensified, and that the State- members of these alliances will not sacrifice their interests to those of the United States and the Soviet Union.\n137.\tNeither is there any unity in the United States-Soviet alliance, which in fact exists and is acting throughout the world and is a serious threat to the freedom of peoples, to international peace and security. It goes without saying that such an alliance, by its very imperialist nature, cannot exist or develop without disputes and inevitable contradictions which proliferate or are reduced with the changing political situation, with the weakening or strengthening of the positions of each of the great Powers, which is clearly reflected in their efforts to use them to one another's detriment, to undermine the partner's power and positron.\n138.\tIn the conditions of the deep-seated crisis through which the United States and the Soviet Union are now passing, the clash of their interests is becoming more and more obvious and bitter. We note that, while United States imperialism is trying to find a solution to the problems which have it by the throat, the Soviet socialist imperialists, without departing from the path of close co-operation with it in pursuit of their own imperialist great-Power interests, have become more active and do not fail to exploit the contradictions which exist between the United States and its allies. There is meaning too in the visits abroad now being made simultaneously by the main Soviet leaders, Brezhnev, Podgorny and Kosygin, and in their continuous insistence on treaties, agreements and other means by which to bind various countries to their imperialist policy as closely as possible. The Soviet revisionists often speculate on anti-imperialist slogans which we hear repeated here by their representatives, but none of this means anything.\n139.\tDespite ever growing contradictions which arise between them, the United States and the Soviet Union, as imperialist Powers, unite when it comes to carrying out their plans to establish their dominion in the world. They find themselves united when it comes to oppressing peoples and to opposing the influence of the revolutionary policy of the People's Republic of China in the world and in preparing war against it.\n140.\tThe leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, has said in this regard:\n\\\"What unites them now is more important for them than what divides them. In the first place, the two parties, in order to survive, to maintain their vast empires and conserve their super-Power status, are obliged to draw closer and to co-operate, to make the struggle against revolution, socialism and the popular liberation movements the basis of the defense of their system, the fundamental hope for the realization of their strategy of expansionism and enslavement.\\\"\n141.\tIt is no longer a secret that these two Powers do not fail to make deals, to divide up spheres of influence and, in the international arena, to flaunt common attitudes which, through deceptive slogans, they attempt to impose on peoples and or. peace-loving States. In the course of this year alone the United States and the Soviet Union have concluded, or are in the process of concluding, a series of dangerous agreements and hatching plans which are quite as dangerous to the interests of the peoples and of peace. But the peoples cannot allow the two great imperialist Powers to interfere with their destinies. They do not need the role of arbitrator that these two Powers wish to arrogate to themselves. They are quite capable of solving their own problems.\n142.\tAt present the Soviet leadership is trying particularly hard to implement the so-called European security plan. Here the two great imperialist Powers are in no way moved by any \\\"concern\\\" or \\\"desire\\\" to make a real contribution to strengthening peace and stability in Europe, but rather by the intention to serve the Soviet-American alliance and establish their domination over that continent, to divide it into zones of influence, to preserve their imperialist interests in Europe, to enslave the peoples of Europe and to create a relative peace in that area so that they may have their hands free in Asia and other parts of the world. The accomplishment of the plot concerning European security now enjoys the favor of the Federal Republic of Germany too, which, since the conclusion of the Moscow-Bonn Treaty, which gave it the opportunity of rising to the rank of first partner of the two super-Powers, is playing a more active role on its own account.\n143.\tMy country, as a peace-loving European socialist State, is fighting resolutely for a true and lasting security in Europe and it is opposed to the European security which the two great imperialist Powers wish to impose upon us. It is not the only country to take such an attitude. I shall not now enumerate all the States which, while stating their general support for this kind of security, in fact for various reasons do not overtly assert their true attitude but maintain many reservations on the question.\n144.\tWe understand the concern of all European countries that sincerely desire real security and peace on their continent, but irrespective of their wishes, considering things as they are, we come to the conclusion that in Europe the necessary conditions for such a thing are not yet created, since the United States and the Soviet Union have installed there a vast network of military bases and maintain their troops in many European countries, since the aggressive blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization exist and act, and since problems outstanding since the end of the Second World War have not yet found just and effective solutions.\n145.\tThe European peoples cannot feel secure as long as the United States imperialists and the Soviet socialist imperialists follow a policy of threat and interference in the domestic affairs of European countries, as long as they brandish weapons and often undertake offensive military maneuvers in the framework of NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization. What is this demonstration of force for, and against whom is it directed, when the whole world knows that the United States and the Soviet Union co-operate closely between themselves? It goes without saying that they do all this to intimidate peoples and to safeguard and strengthen their positions of hegemony.\n146.\tIt is in the framework of such a situation that the Soviet social-imperialists continuously strengthen their military occupation of Czechoslovakia, despite their statements to the effect that the West German danger no longer exists, that they maintain several Eastern European peoples under their yoke, that they threaten other peoples. If allowed to do so, they might behave elsewhere as they have for the past three years in Czechoslovakia. But if, as they have a tendency to do, the social-imperialists should undertake similar action against Romania or Yugoslavia, the people of those countries will not take it lying down; they will mount a resolute struggle against the aggressor. In that struggle they will not be alone; they will enjoy the support of many other peoples. The Soviet revisionists would do well to take this seriously into account.\n147.\tIt is quite clear that, in the circumstances, the convening of a conference on European security not only would fail to serve the higher interests of the peoples of the peace-loving States of Europe, but would be a dangerous trap for them. Dominated by those two Powers, the conference would not even function as a forum where the true sentiments and aspirations of the European peoples and States could be voiced on a free and equal footing. The decisions and principles concerning peace, security and co-operation approved by any such conference would remain a dead-letter, The United States imperialists and the Soviet social-imperialists were scarcely concerned with the well-known principles of international law or the provisions of the United Nations Charter, any more than with other international, bilateral or multilateral agreements, when they unleashed their armed aggression against Viet-Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Czechoslovakia and other countries.\n148.\tThis year's events have further strengthened our conviction of the justice of my Government's estimation of the Moscow-Bonn Treaty and of the true intentions of the contracting parties. Contrary to the sensational promises of its signatories, the Treaty has brought nothing of benefit to the peoples of Europe. It is the revanchist policy of the Federal Republic of Germany that has mainly profited by it. The Treaty has served to speed up deals on the question of West Berlin, in the process of which the Soviet revisionist leadership, it the interests of collaboration with the American imperialists and subsequent rapprochement with Bonn, has made important concessions culminating in the conclusion of a new imperialist agreement at the cost of the sovereign rights of the Democratic Republic of Germany and the strengthening of peace and the interests of the peoples of Europe,, which contributed their blood to the victory over nazism and have long awaited a just and final solution to this question.\n149.\tThe agreement on West Berlin  in reality does not put an end to the anomalous situation which has existed for 26 years in the heartland of Europe; on the contrary, it prolongs it. It creates conditions for the annexation of West Berlin by the Federal Republic of Germany, encourages the annexationist designs of Bonn on the German Democratic Republic, and has not deigned to take it into -account as a sovereign State directly concerned in the question. It has given fresh impetus to co-operation between the Soviet\nUnion and the Federal Republic of Germany, which emerged even more clearly in the recent visit of Willy Brandt to the Crimea, where he was treated by the Soviet revisionist leadership as the representative of the main political power in Western Europe, with which the Soviet revisionists wish to harmonize their actions in order to achieve their plans for expansion and domination on the continent.\n150.\tAs representatives of a Mediterranean country, we cannot pass over in silence the situation created in the Mediterranean by the presence and intensified activity both of the United States Sixth Fleet and of units of the Soviet Navy, which behave there as arrogantly as if they were in their own territorial waters.\n151.\tThe Mediterranean peoples are fully aware that the United States warships, which for more than 20 years have been in the Mediterranean, thousands of miles from their own country, are a strike force in the service of United States plans for the establishment of its dominion in that part of the world, for bringing pressure to bear, for exercising blackmail and provocation, and for intervening, even by force of arms, in the domestic affairs of Mediterranean countries. The many aggressive activities and the very grave acts of war carried out by the American imperialist Sixth Fleet are still present in the memory of the Mediterranean peoples, particularly the brother Arab peoples who, in many instances, have been the direct victims.\n152.\tIt is because it pursues the same objectives that the socio-imperialist Soviet war fleet has likewise made its appearance in the Mediterranean; for the Soviet Union, like the United States, to serve its own neo-colonialist interests, is seeking to secure military bases and establish itself for good in the Mediterranean basin and the Adriatic. It has now gone so far as to find a \\\"historical-juridical\\\" argument for the presence of its fleet in Mediterranean waters; its official propaganda does not hesitate openly to identify the present \\\"interests\\\" and \\\"rights\\\" of the Soviet Union in the Mediterranean with the imperialist aims of Tsarist Russia in the past.\n153.\tThe presence and the movements in the Mediterranean of these two aggressive fleets in their rivalry and their collaboration alike are a threat to the freedom; independence and sovereignty of the peoples and countries of that area, and are, furthermore, thoroughly illegal and unjustifiable, whatever pretexts and \\\"arguments\\\" the United States and the Soviet Union may use to justify them. The peace-loving peoples and countries of the Mediterranean area are rightly concerned at, and justifiably opposed to, the presence off their coasts or in their ports of the fleets of the two great imperialist Powers. The situation thus created requires that they be even more vigilant and that they act with greater firmness to oblige these fleets to quit the Mediterranean.\n154.\tThe events unfolding in Viet-Nam and throughout Indo-China remain the clearest example of the profoundly aggressive nature of United States imperialism and prove that the United States is powerless to subjugate peoples fighting with weapons in hand for a just cause. The heroic Viet-Namese people in its armed struggle has inflicted on the United States of America the heaviest defeat in its history. Neither the escalation of the war in Viet-Nam nor the extension of armed aggression into Cambodia and Laos have eased the difficult situation in which the United States aggressors find themselves; in fact it has pushed them deeper into the impasse in which they find themselves in Indo-China. Similarly, they have seen the collapse of the hopes they had placed in the tactic of \\\"Viet-Namization\\\" worked out in accordance with the Nixon Doctrine, a tactic that is in fact nothing but an escalation of the aggression throughout all of Indo-China, making use of the armies and puppet regimes of Saigon, Pnom Fenh, Vientiane, and so on. The efforts of the United States to pit the Indo-Chinese against the Indo-Chinese have met with a deserved rebuff from the peoples of Indo-China, who have raised their fighting unity and their armed struggle to an even higher level.\n155.\tNot having succeeded in bringing the Viet-Namese people md the other peoples of Indo-China to their knees by force of arms, and confronted with the failure of their plot to \\\"Viet-Namize\\\" the war, the United States of America continues further to intensify its double tactic. On the one hand, it trumpets its desire for peace; on the other hand, it pursues its aggressive activities and barbarous crimes. However > the attempts by the leaders of United States imperialism to create the impression that they want \\\"peace\\\" and that they are preparing to leave Indo-China cannot bend the iron will of the Viet-Namese people and the peoples of Laos and Cambodia to carry their armed struggle to total victory. The United States imperialists will not willingly leave Indo-China; it is rather through their heroic struggle that the peoples of Indo-China will expel them.\n156.\tThe Soviet revisionists also bear part of the responsibility for the continuation of the situation in Viet-Nam and Indo\u00abChina by reason of their double game which actually assists the United States imperialists in their aggression. Sometimes openly, sometimes through demagogic processes, they carry on activities that undermine and sabotage the armed struggle of the Indo-Chinese peoples and undertake actions contrary to the aspirations of those peoples to national freedom and independence. They make tremendous efforts to discredit, through every kind of slander and fiction, the comprehensive internationalist assistance that has been and will continue to be given, until their complete liberation, to the peoples of Indo-China by the People's Republic of China, the sincerest ally and most powerful support of those peoples. Their attitude to the reactionary coup d'etat in Cambodia and the United States aggression against that sovereign country has still further unmasked the Soviet revisionists and revealed them as false friends of the peoples of Indo-China. Their continued relations with the Lon Nol clique, a docile instrument of the United States of America, shows up all the falsity of their declarations claiming to support the struggle of the Indo-Chinese peoples,\n157.\tThe brave people of Viet-Nam, united in combat with the other peoples of Indo-China and enjoying the powerful support of the Chinese people and the solidarity of all the peoples of the world, will most certainly, in carrying through its armed struggle, win the final victory against the United States aggressors and their lackeys. There will be no genuine peace in Viet-Nam until the day when the last United States soldier is withdrawn.\n158.\tAlthough more than four years have passed since the unleashing of the armed Zionist-imperialist aggression against the Arab countries, the situation in the Middle(East remains grave and fraught with dangers to the peace and security of that area. The Israeli Zionists are pursuing their policy of aggression and war. They are committing monstrous crimes against the Palestinian and other Arab peoples; they are seeking to impose their own terms from positions of strength; they continue to occupy large parts of the territory of Egypt, the Syrian Arab Republic and Jordan, and are employing the most barbarous means to strip them of their national identity, They now dare to proclaim openly their plans far annexing those territories, arrogantly declaring that they have no intention of \\\"going back to the old frontiers\\\". It is clear that they would not behave in this way if they were not supported by the ceaseless political, economic and military assistance of the United States of America, which incites and supports the grasping designs of Tel-Aviv and wishes to maintain Israel as an instrument in the service of its imperialist plans for the Middle East.\n159.\tThe United States and the revisionist Soviet Union have attempted from the outset, and are still attempting, to exploit to the maximum the situation created after the aggression of June 1967, with each of the two partners working for its own expansionist designs and the realization of its nec-colonialist aims in that region. Neither of these two great imperialist Powers wants to see a just and final solution to the problem of the Middle East. They are interested, rather, in maintaining a continuing state of tension, in encouraging the Israeli-Arab conflict, for this will make it easier for them to penetrate the countries of that area and extend their influence there.\n160.\tIt is clear that the Middle East region is today a sore spot where the hegemonic interests of the two great Powers clash. But given the firm resistance of the Arab peoples to foreign aggression and interference, the two Powers do not hesitate to act in collusion and make compromises to the detriment of the sovereign rights of the Arab peoples, thus giving satisfaction, if only partially, to the annexation . claims of the Israeli aggressors. We now see United States and Soviet emissaries shuttling back and forth between their own countries and the countries of the Middle East, and we see how in Washington, as well as in Moscow and here in the corridors' of the United Nations, \\\"peace\\\" proposals are formulated and plots are hatched for a \\\"partial solution\\\", for \\\"settlement of the problem by stages\\\", while at the same time plans are being worked out to station American and Soviet troops in the vicinity of the Suez Canal under cover of \\\"international guarantees\\\".\n161.\tThere is reason to regard as particularly dangerous the plot to liquidate the Palestinian question and to destroy the liberation movement of the valiant Palestinian people which, through its armed struggle, has become a serious obstacle to the Israeli aggressors and the execution of the imperialist plans in the Middle East. It is a shameful role in the pursuit of this plot that continues to be played by the reactionary regime of King Hussein of Jordan through the intensification of the campaign of terror and bloody massacre against the Palestinian patriots, which is a grave challenge to the national conscience of all the Arab peoples.\n162.\tBut the enemies of the Arab peoples would do well not to build illusory dreams and not to nourish the hope that they can do whatever they see fit in the Middle East. The Arab peoples are strong enough to destroy their plans and they will surely succeed in doing so, no matter how great their temporary difficulties may be. They will not accept a solution which would be contrary to their higher national interests. They know how to distinguish their real friends who sincerely assist them in their struggle from the false friends who offer them assistance only in order to tie their hands.\n163.\tPeace and stability in the Middle East cannot be secure* through compromise and partial solutions engineered by the great imperialist Powers; it cannot be secured if the Israeli aggressors do not leave unconditionally all the Arab occupied territories. It can be secured only through the firm struggle,- of the .Arab peoples. As sincere friends of those peoples, we have the unshakable confidence that they will carry their just struggle to its end, that they will redouble their vigilance, that they will clear the way of obstacles and elements put at the service of foreigners who, through their work of domestic sabotage are creating breaches in the unity of the Arab peoples and countries, that they will strengthen and consolidate that unity, in the struggle against imperialist and revisionist intrigues. This is the only way they can face their Zionist aggressors, liberate the occupied lands, and achieve all their sacred aspirations.\n164.\tThe People's Republic of Albania is a small country but one which consistently follow* an independent foreign policy and works with perseverance side by side with other peace-loving States to make its modest contribution to the positive development of world events. We have had many enemies and they are still numerous but the Albanian people has always confronted and will always confront them with courage, always maintaining inviolable the freedom and independence of the homeland and guaranteeing the victorious construction of socialism. Thanks to this revolutionary policy and to the just attitudes it has maintained and maintains vis-a-vis the most important issues of our time, the People's Republic of Albania has secured a solid position in the international arena and represents a factor of peace and stability in the Balkans and in Europe. This has influenced world opinion in a manner favorable to the People's Republic of Albania as may also be seen in the fact that many States have recently established diplomatic relations with us. This testifies to the respect they have for our policy of principle.\n165.\tGuided by the policy of peace and international co-operation, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania has constantly striven to extend and develop its relations with all countries, irrespective of their political and social systems, cn the basis of the principles that govern relations among sovereign States, and in this context it has done everything possible to establish and improve relations with neighboring countries, in conformity with the good-neighbor policy. It is in this spirit that we have improved our State relations with Yugoslavia and, irrespective of our irreducible ideological differences with the leadership of that country, we are in favor of constantly extending and deepening them, for our people and the peoples of Yugoslavia have been and are friends and this is in the interests of our peoples, We have established diplomatic relations with Greece. This was a just and reasonable act, compatible with the interests and aspirations of the two people, an act made possible by the just and consistent policy of the Albanian Government and the goodwill it has constantly demonstrated, as well as of the realistic approach of the present Greek Government. The Albanian people has always had feelings of friendship towards the Greek people and we desire to develop our relations with Greece basing ourselves always on the well-known principles of equality, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, unconditional respect for frontiers, non-interference in domestic affairs, and mutual advantage.\n166.\tThe People's Republic of Albania will always stand side by side with freedom-loving peoples and will spare no effort powerfully to support their struggle to conquer and defend freedom and national independence, to put an end to colonial oppression and racial discrimination. We resolutely condemn the aggressive acts by the imperialist Powers against various independent, progressive countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, the interference in their domestic affairs and the coups d'etat organized against them, as well as the open support those Powers give to reactionary regimes in various continents and to the racist policy of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. We condemn the armed aggression against Guinea, unleash i ;y the Portuguese colonialists with the support of their N^TO partners, which failed pitifully before the resolute rebuff that the freedom-loving people of that country gave it. The Albanian people hails the important measures recently taken by Chile, Peru and other Latin American countries to defend their sovereignty, territorial integrity and natural resources, thus courageously resisting the political and economic aggression of United States imperialism.\n167.\tThe Albanian people, under the guidance of the Albanian Worker's Party, headed by our beloved leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, is working in a spirit of self-sacrifice to develop and continuously strengthen our homeland; we have won great success in all fields and are advancing with assurance towards new victories on the joyful road to socialism.\n168.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Albania, guided as ever by the just policy of principle of its Government, will make every effort at this session too, side by side with other peace-loving States, to contribute to the defense of the great cause of the peoples and of peace.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "38.\tMr. President, on behalf of the people of India, we offer you our warmest congratulations on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. This is a fitting tribute to your achievements as the Foreign Minister of Indonesia and to your interest in the political and economic problems of the world. As a fellow Asian. I take particular pride in your elevation to this high office. Indonesia and India have worked together in so many fields since we both achieved\nour independence, and we have so much in common through history and geography, that I need hardly assure you of our fullest co-operation in the discharge of your responsibilities.\n39.\tWe should also like to compliment our outgoing President, Mr. Edvard Hambro of Norway, for the skill, independence and patience with which he guided our deliberations and for his stewardship of the commemorative session last year. The world may not care for nor long remember the millions of words we utter here, but the important documents which we adopted last year will certainly guide and inspire us in our work for years to come. For this achievement much of the credit must go to Mr. Hambro.\n40.\tDuring the year that has just passed, our Secretary- General, U Thant, has once again manifested his devotion to the cause of world peace by his scrupulous regard for the purposes and principles of the Charter and by his indefatigable efforts to improve our Organization in all possible ways. We can still hope that his decision to relinquish this rewarding, though onerous, office is not final. The Secretary-General of this Organization has always to be a person of the highest caliber, sensitive to the changing needs of the world situation and fully prepared to meet the administrative requirements of an ever-growing institution. He should also be able to contribute to the creation of conditions in which all nations, big or small, can live in peace and friendship and work in their own ways for their national progress and prosperity.\n41.\tWe extend our special welcome to the three new Members that joined us a few days ago: Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar. We look forward to working in the closest co-operation with these new Members, with which we have had long and friendly association in several spheres. Their entry into the United Nations should increase the value of our debates and the strength of our decisions.\n42.\tOne of the most important issues that we hope will be settled during this session is the question of the rightful representation of China in this Organization. There is only one China; there is only one Chinese seat, and only the Government of the People's Republic of China is entitled to occupy it in the United Nations. We have always been convinced that the presence of the People's Republic of China will make this Organization more effective. Too long have we postponed a realistic decision on this issue; let us not procrastinate any further.\n43.\tWe have also repeatedly pleaded for universality of representation in the United Nations and we believe that the entry of the divided nations into our Organization would help in the reduction and removal of tensions. They could also contribute effectively to our work in many other fields.\n44.\tFor India, the year 1971 opened with many promises. The economy was poised for a high rate of growth. In March we had our general elections. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was returned to power with an overwhelming majority. Her success reflected the solid support of our people for a concerted program for socio-economic progress. Externally we had tried to establish warmer\nrelations with all countries, particularly with our neighbors. The fact that Pakistan had a little earlier, in December 1970, held the first general elections it had ever held was welcomed in India. The introduction of a democratic process in Pakistan would, we had hoped, bring about improved relations with this important neighbor of ours. Yet the entire picture was changed overnight when the events in the eastern wing of Pakistan took a catastrophic course. An international problem of utmost gravity and concern was created. Several Governments and international authorities have recognized the true character of this problem. The Secretary-General, U Thant, not only has brought the situation to the attention of the members of the Security Council but has included his views in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Al8401/Add.l]. The Assembly has already heard the concern which the outgoing President, Mr. Hambro, expressed in his speech on 21 September [1934th meeting].\n45.\tBy the middle of April it had become clear that Pakistan had no intention of abandoning its military methods and that we would be faced with an unprecedented flow of Pakistani refugees into our country. Refugee camps had to be speedily organized, and the systematic and detailed registration of the large number of foreigners had to be undertaken. Ration cards and temporary permits for stay in India had to be issued, transport and food supplies had to be organized and medical attention had to be provided. These relief measures could, however, meet only a fraction of the needs of the refugees. We asked the international community for help, and although the response to the Secretary-General's appeal has been warm, it is but a very small part of what is actually needed. By far the largest contribution towards the upkeep of the refugees has had to be made by India from its badly needed resources. We are sheltering and looking after the refugees on behalf of the international community. We simply do not have the capacity and the resources to bear this burden. While we gave them-on purely humanitarian grounds- shelter and refuge when they were fleeing for their lives, we have made it repeatedly clear that they are with us only temporarily and must return home. This has been accepted and endorsed by the world community. It has been impossible to make any firm estimates of what it would cost us in the coming months, but on the basis of the present figure the total cost may well be more than $800 million by the end of next March.\n46.\tThe consequences of this massive influx-some have called it a civilian invasion-of refugees into India cannot be determined in terms of money alone. We are facing grave social, economic and political consequences. In the areas where the refugees are now living in difficult conditions in comps, all of our schools have had to be closed to find shelter for them. All of our hospitals in these areas have had to tend to the urgent need of the refugees rather than to the normal needs of the local inhabitants. Prices are rising as a result of a higher demand for essential commodities. Wages are falling. Crimes of various kinds are on the increase. Local friction and tensions are not unknown. Our local administration has had to be diverted to the work of looking after the refugees, and that in turn has further affected adversely all of our development projects. The fear of epidemics is ever present, even though the outbreak of cholera has been controlled. \n47.\tThe refugees must go back. The question simply is; How? Can anyone reasonably expect them to go back when thousands and thousands are daily fleeing from the same area? Pointless declarations and exhortations will not make them go back. On 21 May the President of Pakistan, Mr. Yahya Khan, called upon the refugees to go back; yet, since then, more than 5 million more have come into India. They will go back only when they are sure themselves that they can live in their own homeland in safety and freedom, when they are allowed to work as they wish, and when they are assured that their properties will be returned, their jobs restored and their daily lives not interfered with.\n48.\tTo appreciate and understand the background to this unprecedented influx, it is necessary to recall the conditions prevailing in East Pakistan throughout Pakistan's existence. Pakistan is a unique country, in the sense that two parts of it are separated by a distance of 1,000 miles of Indian territory. The majority of the people-75 million- live in the East, and the West has a total population of less than 60 million. None the less, political, military and economic power was concentrated in the West, while the East continued to produce basic raw materials, such as jute and tea, and provided the largest source of foreign exchange for Pakistan. Even the Government of Pakistan has acknowledged that persistent discrimination and exploitation of East Pakistan by West Pakistan has taken place ever since the country became independent.\n49.\tJust to give one example, in the entire civil service and in the armed forces of Pakistan the Bengalis did not have a share exceeding 10 per cent. The East Pakistanis continued to protest and agitate against that discrimination and exploitation, and, for want of any effective remedy, their grievances accumulated.\n50.\tHowever, after the fall of President Ayub Khan in the middle of 1969 a new situation arose. Another General- President Yahya Khan-took over, and declared that he would hold general elections for the first time, on adult franchise with representation to both wings, proportionate to their population. For the first time the people of Pakistan saw in that democratic process a possible rectification of the injustices from which East Pakistan had suffered all those years.\n51.\tThe elections were held in December 1970, after being postponed twice. The results of the elections were greeted in Pakistan as a success of democracy, as indeed they were. The broad results of the elections are worth noting. Out of a total of 313 seats, 169 had been allotted to East Pakistan. Of those 169 seats, the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won as many as 167. Winning 98 per cent of the seats in East Pakistan, Mujibur Rahman gained an absolute majority in the National Assembly and would, in normal circumstances, have been in a position to form the Government and become the Prime Minister of Pakistan. For the elections, the Awami League had adopted a six-point program to obtain specifically a greater degree of autonomy for East Pakistan with a view to putting an end to discrimination and exploitation.\nI do not think the comment made by the representative of Pakistan calls for serious notice. What he says is that the Indian Foreign Minister is describing what is known to others. Then, certainly, there can be no grounds for a point of order if one is describing something which is known to others.\n56.\tWhat I am trying to give this august Assembly is an account of the circumstances that led to that unprecedented influx of 9 million refugees into Indian territory. Members must have noticed that the Secretary-General, in the introduction to his annual report on the activities of the United Nations, has devoted as many as 15 paragraphs, covering several pages, to highlighting, in a very lucid manner the various aspects-humanitarian and political-of the problem of the influx of the refugees f A/8401IAdd.l, paras. 177-179/.\n57.\tIt is noteworthy also that the representative of Pakistan did not care to point out, as is customary in such cases, the particular provision, either in the Charter or in the rules of procedure, under which he was raising his point of order. I am not asking this august United Nations General Assembly to intervene-if he had Article 2, paragraph 7, in mind. I am saying that this is a problem, unprecedented in history, in which 9 million refugees have crossed over into Indian territory, and I am asking: Is the international community interested in knowing what the root-cause of that is, and what should be the direction in which the efforts of the international community should be directed to find a satisfactory solution of this tragic problem? If I may say so, to treat this matter by a point of order in a light-hearted manner is inconsistent with the international community's responsibilities: responsibilities first to find out and analyze what are the root-causes of these most tragic happenings in that part of the world and then to direct its attention to finding a satisfactory solution. I thought that, while dealing with a problem of such magnitude, this Assembly would be interested in knowing the relevant facts of the situation, so that it might be properly appreciated, and attention might be directed to finding a satisfactory solution.\n58.\tI am the last person, I would assure the Assembly, to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, but to give a description of the circumstances which led to the uprooting of 9 million people is certainly neither an interference in any other country's internal affairs nor any comment on what is happening in the country itself. One has to understand properly the circumstances of the\nsituation in order to come to the right conclusion. Therefore, while appreciating the anxiety of the representative of Pakistan, I have carefully avoided referring in any manner to matters which might be barred either by any provisions of the Charter or by any rules of procedure. If anything, we should concentrate on the basic problems, rather than become involved in a procedural debate which is pointless.\n59.\tComing to the facts of the situation, I was referring to the elections that took place in Pakistan, giving Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Awami League a majority of 167 out of 169 seats and thus giving him an absolute majority in the National Assembly of Pakistan. For the elections, the Awami League adopted a six-point program to obtain specifically a greater degree of autonomy for East Pakistan with a view to putting an end to discrimination and exploitation. Apparently, the results of the election so startled the rulers of Pakistan that they saw in them a risk to their economic, military and political domination over ' the eastern wing; this explains their swift action and their desire to continue military rule. So, on the fateful night of 25/26 March, the armed forces set out to crush the verdict of the 75 million Bengalis.\nI am sorry that the representative of Pakistan in his wisdom has chosen this path of raising objections after every sentence or after every paragraph of my speech before this Assembly. I am not discussing the internal affairs of Pakistan and I am not interested in the internal affairs of Pakistan; but it would be a truism to say that the conduct of internal affairs by any country, if it results in the uprooting of 9 million people who cross over to the adjoining territory, should be a matter of concern to the international community, which\nshould be concerned about the circumstances that created a situation in which the conduct of internal affairs in that country compelled 9 million people over a period of a little more than six months to cross into the territory of India. Now, if a strict interpretation were accepted under which conditions in Pakistan could not be mentioned, then we would virtually come to the ridiculous position that a refugee who left his village in East Pakistan should not be described and the conditions prevailing in that part should not be taken note of and only when he crossed into Indian territory should we start mentioning him. I am sure that that would be neither the correct spirit nor the correct manner in which we should deal with such serious matters, I am fully conscious of and have regard for the principle of coexistence. We are not interested in whether there is a presidential system or a military system or a military rule in Pakistan. That is entirely its concern. We have learned to live in a spirit of coexistence with whatever may be the social or economic system prevailing in any part of the world, and this applies particularly to our neighbors. But when, while dealing with their own affairs, within what they describe as domestic matters, they create a situation where 9 million people are shoved on to us, then surely the international community would like to know the circumstances in which these people have left their country. They have not left their country of Pakistan as tourists to do sightseeing in India. This is a very serious matter. Therefore we should view this problem in the proper perspective. The international community will never be able to understand unless it knows the circumstances that prevail in that unfortunate country, where 9 million people, its own citizens, had to cross and come over to Indian territory. I am not interested in its internal set-up, but I am interested in putting across to the international community the circumstances which led to the creation of conditions that compelled these unfortunate men, women and children to leave their homes and hearths.\n64.\tOn the fateful night of 25/26 March, the armed forces set out to crush the verdict of the 75 million Bengalis. However, before the army was given the signal to let loose a reign of terror, protracted negotiations started; in the meantime the strength of the armed forces in East Bengal was considerably increased. \nThe suggestion made by the representative of Saudi Arabia -- who perhaps has a longer association with the United Nations than almost any one of us-has been listened to by me with great care. I was thinking that perhaps he had some point of order which came in the way of my proceeding with my speech, but instead of that, I find that he has appealed to me and placed me in the embarrassing position of being called upon to make my comment upon his appeal. I would appeal to him, and also to other representatives, to judge for themselves who is responsible for creating an atmosphere of tension. We have the accepted procedure that any points which might be mentioned by any leader of a delegation can be replied to substantively and also that another viewpoint can be presented before this august Assembly. But instead of adopting that usual procedure, efforts have been made to obstruct me when I am actually delivering my speech before the Assembly.\n71.\tThe situation is such that I would be failing in my < duty if I were to respond much as I would like to-to the appeal made by the representative of Saudi Arabia. I owe it not only to my country, I owe it not only to the 9 million refugees, but, I believe, I owe it to the international community to tell them these things in the frankest possible manner, while trying always to remain within the procedure and the provisions of the Charter in making my presentation.\n72.\tI believe I have used my words carefully; I have not indulged in rhetoric, But I am sorry that I shall have to crave the indulgence of this august Assembly, and of you, Mr, President, to permit me to place before you in a dispassionate manner the facts which have led to this unprecedented tragedy. It is not pleasant for me to mention these facts, but the situation is so grave and the consequences that might flow from it so serious that I would be failing in my duty, as I said, not only to my country and to the refugees, but to the international community, if, simply for the sake of preventing objections from being raised, I Were not to proceed with giving the facts to the international community. If the facts are wrong, the representative of Pakistan has the right to make his statement and to say that the particular facts I mention are incorrect. Therefore, I would request him, and also the representative of Saudi Arabia, to permit me to present these facts, which are of the utmost importance in an issue that, I think, has resulted in the most tragic events in recent memory.\n73.\tWhat the army did, and is continuing to do, in its massive assault on the civilian population is now well known and I do not wish to take up the time of the assembly in describing the innumerable instances of killings and atrocities. A reign of terror prevailed and still prevails. The leader of the Awami League, Mujibur Rahman, was arrested and is still in prison. He is now being secretly tried in a military court on a charge which carries the death penalty. The freedom of the press and civil liberties were totally suppressed, and the foreign journalists were expelled. The International Red Cross was not allowed to visit the area and all attempts were made, not always successfully, to conceal what was happening in. that part of the world. Killing, raping, burning and looting became widespread. The inevitable consequences followed: the people fled from tenor and violence to India, leaving behind all that they had. Their number rose from less than a million, at the end of April, to nearly 4 million at the end of May, crossed the 6-million mark before June was over, and has been rising steadily ever since. Their number now exceeds 9 million, and the exodus still continues. This is an exodus of refugees unprecedented in history, across any international frontier.\n74.\tPakistan\u2019s military action and the snuffing-out of all human rights, and the reign of terror, which still continues, have shocked the conscience of mankind. There is a popular revolt against these actions. Some have fled from the tenor, while others are resisting it as best they can. The hard core of this resistance was provided by thousands of men who had defected from the army and the police and various paramilitary organizations at the time of the -military crackdown. They have been joined in ever-increasing numbers by people of all ages.\n75.\tThe Pakistani authorities have tom up solemn declarations and conventions to which Pakistan had subscribed. Pakistan has desperately tried to divert attention from its outrageous actions. Its actions have made so many serious inroads into much that our Charter stands for that it would indeed be a travesty of international law and a mockery of international justice to suggest that what is involved is an internal issue. It is even less an internal issue when one keeps in mind that other nations are having to support the enormous cost of the massive exodus of Pakistani citizens into India.\n76.\tApart from accusing others of their own most unwise and deadly activities, the rulers of Pakistan have taken a number of measures which are no more than eyewash. How unrealistic these measures are can be judged from the impact they have had on the flow of refugees. The \nResident of Pakistan has from time to time called upon the refugees to go back; yet, the flow continues in ever- increasing numbers into India. A so-called civilian government has been formed in East Pakistan consisting of men who have no representative character whatever and who are mere figureheads, obliged to take orders from their military commanders. An amnesty is proclaimed, but Mujibur Rahman and other elected representatives are at the same time treated and tried as traitors. We witness the strange spectacle in which the party which would have been, by right, the Government of Pakistan, has been banned and disqualified from political activities. Half the elected representatives have been disqualified from sitting in the National Assembly. In our view, the flow of refugees will not stop, nor will the refugees already in India begin to go back, until a political solution acceptable to the elected representatives of the people has been found. Secretary- General U Thant and many other distinguished statesmen, politicians and leaders of public opinion have consistently maintained that the problem is essentially political. As a first step towards a political solution, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the Awami League, should be set at liberty without delay, and negotiations should be started with him. It has been proved beyond doubt that he alone can speak on behalf of the people of East Bengal. He, and he alone, symbolizes and represents the aspirations and will of the people of East Pakistan. Apart from these actions, which the Pakistanis themselves can take, what can the international community do in these circumstances? The first and foremost action which this Assembly, and all other international organs within or without the United Nations system, can take is to impress on the military regime of Islamabad the fact that force will not succeed and that, therefore, a political settlement between the military regime and the already-elected leaders is essential. We consider it wholly short-sighted to wait until worse crises have arisen. Bilaterally, all Governments can do their utmost to ensure, by whatever means are available to them, that the military regime stops its repression, enters into negotiations with the elected leaders to achieve a political settlement with their consent, and sends the army back to the barracks. Only by these measures will the flow of refugees be stopped and the refugees already in India be able to return home. Our only fault has been that we gave temporary shelter to millions of refugees homeless, food-less, without clothing; sick and aged, men and women, helpless children and dying infants-who were fleeing from terror, many of whom bore marks of recent army brutality. Only by the measures I have suggested can the threat of famine be alleviated and normal conditions restored. If these measures are not taken, and if attempts are made to divert attention by false analysis or wrong accusations, then the prospect is indeed gloomy. We here in this Assembly may argue in a sophisticated manner as long as we like, but those who have been the victims of aggression and who are fleeing from terror and massacre will not have such a tolerant outlook. They will not forgive us or those who did not stand by them in their hour of trial.\n77.\tIt is only natural that I should have devoted some time to an important matter which is uppermost in the minds of most Indians, but we are not insensitive to other important issues that the world has faced during the last year. We believe that the world scene is changing and rearranging itself in a manner which is often difficult to comprehend\nand even more difficult to analyze. Whether it is in Europe or Asia, in Africa or in the Americas, several trends are noticeable which can affect our traditional values and even some of the concepts on which the Charter is based.\n78.\tDuring the last 12 months there have been many welcome signs of reduction of tensions among the great Powers. The progress in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT], though slow, is an important step forward. The treaty between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin    are important landmarks and should lead to a better understanding of the German problem. The greater degree of accommodation now evident will contribute to European peace, progress and prosperity. We congratulate all those whose untiring efforts have resulted in an accord over some of the most difficult issues facing the international community.\n79.\tAt the same time, I must utter a note of caution. The concerns of the nations assembled in this hall are far wider than the preoccupations of the great Powers. One of the basic concepts underlying the setting-up of the United Nations was that in the solution of world problems and in the achievement of the political, social and economic objectives of the human race all sovereign States should have a voice. While talks among the great Powers can on suitable occasions be helpful, the viewpoints of other States, and particularly of the developing countries, must not be ignored. The concept of non-alignment, of which Jawaharlal Nehru was one of the principal exponents, was meant to modify the bipolar view of the world. The relevance and validity of non-alignment are not diminished by the lessening of East-West tensions in some fields.\n80.\tIndeed, with the lessening of cold-war tensions the importance of non-alignment has become even greater. The issues are no longer so clear-cut and, therefore, the non-aligned countries will .have to examine the ever- changing situations in a much more detailed and comprehensive manner. Decisions can then be based on principles, taking into account ail the factors. It is for those reasons that the Lusaka Declaration  was widely welcomed by many speakers in this Assembly last year. It is also for those reasons that we have found it necessary to continue discussions among the non-aligned countries on all important problems. Such a regular and systematic exchange of views will enable us to come to some agreed conclusions, even at short notice. As this Assembly is aware, in two days the non-aligned group of countries will meet at the Foreign Minister level.\n81.\tIn Asia a new political equation is discernible, with rapid industrialization and economic development in several countries. Not only is a new relationship emerging among the Asian countries themselves, but several outside Powers are working for the establishment of new contacts and relations with Asian countries, including China. India is \nconscious of those developments and is adjusting its own attitude in the context of those important changes.\n82.\tThe agony of the people of Viet-Nam has not yet ceased. Their freedom is still to be achieved, although large-scale warfare and massive slaughter are not so much in evidence. Raids, local fighting and a daily toll in lives continue throughout Viet-Nam. We regret particularly that there has been a recent resumption of bombing in parts of North Viet-Nam. Policies, especially in South Viet-Nam, have not shown any signs of moving towards the goal for which many lives have been sacrificed and for which the people of Viet-Nam have suffered so much. We welcome the United States and other foreign troop withdrawals that have already taken place. We hope that, through negotiations in Paris and elsewhere, the agony of Viet-Nam will be brought to an end without further delay; that United States and other foreign troops will be withdrawn completely by a definite date; and that the people of Viet-Nam will be allowed to decide their own future in accordance with their own wishes, without any outside interference. In that context the seven-point proposals made in Paris appear to us to provide a reasonable basis for a negotiated settlement.\n83.\tIn the Middle East, the lack of progress in the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is creating new tensions. The cease-fire, accepted as a, temporary measure to help the parties negotiate a settlement through Ambassador Jarring, has unfortunately tended to freeze the situation in favor of the aggressor, despite the willingness shown by the Arab countries to go to the farthest limit m meeting their obligations under the above-mentioned resolution. Our own conviction that no country should be allowed to retain foreign territories taken by force of arms remains unshaken, and we would reiterate that this problem will not be solved unless Israel withdraws from the Arab territories which it has occupied since 5 June 1967 and restores the legitimate rights of the Palestinian refugees.\n84.\tIn Latin America, too, new economic and political forces are emerging. Various developments in various States in that continent have proved beyond doubt that the conflict between traditional politics and a growing awareness of national interest is adding new dynamism to the situation. That will no doubt have an impact on international issues.\n8$. The result of all those trends and tendencies has been to bestir people to new lines of -flunking and to a new realization that problems of great concern to the world cannot be solved by force. It is in this context that our discussions this year on the question of international peace and security will assume added significance. Such a discussion, by enabling all Member States to express their considered views, will substantially increase the effectiveness of the United Nations,\n86.\tIndia pointed out at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [1932nd meeting! that post-war developments had amply shown that disputes in the traditional sense are not the only situations which become a threat to international peace and security, the structure of which today is more often than not imperiled by actions which\namount to systematic violations of many other important objectives and principles of the Charter. This Organization must acquire and develop the skill and the strength necessary for dealing effectively with complex problems which have far-reaching consequences.\n87.\tThe Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, adopted last year by the General Assembly [resolution 2734 (XXV)], recognizes the integral link between peace, on the one hand, and disarmament, decolonization and development, on the other. General and complete disarmament under effective international control remains the imperative and most urgent need of our time. We are concerned with the threat to mankind posed by the ever-increasing arms race, by the existing large stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and by the impending new qualitative advance towards even more devastating nuclear armaments.\n88.\tWe are pleased at the emergence of an agreement on bacteriological weapons as a result of the discussions in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, and we look forward to early steps towards an effective agreement on chemical weapons. We are pleased of course that the United States of America and the Soviet Union continue their discussions in the field of disarmament and that those contacts are helping to lessen suspicion and are creating and improving the atmosphere for negotiations in many other fields. However, the proceedings of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament have not been marked by any significant progress this year and we should consider how to strengthen further the mechanism of the Committee on Disarmament. We could perhaps do so by adopting the suggestion made in that regard by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [AI8401/Add.l, para. 52]. It is imperative that China and France participate in the deliberations. India also believes that it would be useful to convene a world disarmament conference, after due preparation, with the participation of all the countries of the world.\n89.\tThe Fourth International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy has demonstrated the need to make nuclear energy and technology available to a greater extent to the developing countries of the world. We are convinced of the important contribution that the technology for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can make to the economy and the progress of the developing world.\n90.\tIf the lack of progress towards total disarmament continues to be a threat to peace and security, there are other factors which also contribute to that threat. Colonialism and racialism have taken many forms in recent years, and all the efforts of the United Nations have been unavailing in bringing about the independence of such large and important colonial Territories as Angola, Mozambique, Guinea, Southern Rhodesia and Namibia.\n91.\tWe are gratified at the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on Namibia  and our efforts should be concentrated on concrete steps to be taken in asserting the United Nations authority in Namibia. The liberation movements in other colonial Territories need to be encouraged. We are disappointed that the progress in. these fields has not been significant and we shall, at an appropriate stage, propose steps which can be taken to bring all colonial Territories to independence,\n92.\tSecurity and political stability cannot be achieved if the international community does not organize economic co-operation for speedy development in a rational and dynamic way. The International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] was a major step forward, but the developments which have taken place since the Strategy was adopted are causing us some uneasiness. The commitments made in the Strategy are still to be fulfilled, and yet attempts are being made to take advantage of the differences of interests, which undoubtedly exist in the developing countries, to modify this commitment. We hope that these attempts will not succeed, and that, on the one hand, the developing countries will present a united front on their basic needs and, on the other hand, that the developed countries will fulfill to the utmost the obligations they have accepted.\n93.\tThe world today is facing a major economic crisis comparable to the one that arose when sterling went off the gold standard and new trade barriers began to disrupt world trade. Something similar is threatening the system of international trade and payments which had been built up after the Second World War. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development have not between them been able to provide the kind of orderly and balanced growth in world economy which was hoped for. The developing countries, which had very little say at the time of their establishment, have long cherished the feeling that a new look at the articles of these three bodies is called for, if the widening gap between the rich nations and the poor nations is not to grow wider each year, as it has unfortunately done in the last two decades. In the crisis that now confronts them,-some of the most developed nations have also begun to feel that the charters of these institutions do not provide adequate answers to the emerging problems. What we are unhappy about is the attempt to ignore and bypass these institutions and to try to seek solutions to the world's economic problems in a small group of the 10 richest countries. We believe that, while we must reform these institutions, we must not wreck them. Concerted thinking on the ways in which a new dynamism can be imparted to them has to be given in a forum which is truly representative of developed and developing countries alike,\n94.\tAlready some of the measures that have been taken to solve the problems of prosperous nations have created serious problems for the less developed countries. Then- trade is confronted with new obstacles. The inflow of capital so essential to their growth and development, which is well below the target of 1 per cent of the gross national product adopted by the United Nations is in danger of being reduced. Poor countries of the world are victims of measures taken in the name of alleviating the payments crisis of the richest nations in the world, even though they themselves had not contributed to the crisis in any\nconceivable manner. Without a concerted and cooperative approach, such progress as was made in the first United Nations Development Decade can easily be wiped out in the Second.\n95.\tLast year the Assembly gave much time and attention to formulating a just regime on the utilization of the resources of the sea and on the preservation of the human environment. During this year some progress has been made for the solution of these problems, but much more remains to be done. Similarly, on the problem of outer space we have achieved some success, particularly in formulating a draft Convention on Liability for Damage Caused by Objects Launched into Outer Space. We would like to record our appreciation to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union for reaching agreement regarding expanded co-operation towards developing compatible rendezvous and docking systems for the spacecraft of both the nations. We look forward, as a developing country, to increasing benefits from progress in the field of earth resources, surface remote sensing and other connected matters.\n96.\tI have mentioned all these specific problems in order to take into account the various major factors which are changing the conditions of the world we live in. The United Nations, reflecting all these concerns, has to adjust itself to these changing conditions. Our Charier was drawn up 26 years ago. Our methods of work and the procedure of our debates, as indeed our budget all subjects of separate studies-have to be adjusted and adapted to new demands and conditions. We must maintain a flexible attitude towards these matters and we hope that the present session of the Assembly would, in coming to decisions on substantive problems, keep in mind the need for this adjustment. No organization in this rapidly changing world of ours can hope to face successfully new trends and new developments unless its basic concepts can be modified speedily and effectively. Last year we had a World Youth Assembly. Although the people who attended this Assembly did not achieve any concrete results, they did demonstrate a need for the world Organization to be more responsive to the changing situation.\n97.\tThe Prime Minister of India, while speaking at the last session of the General Assembly [1881st meeting], had referred to the unfinished revolution the completion of which is our common purpose. We have endeavored to fulfill purpose though we may not have succeeded fully in our efforts the world still continues to be in turmoil and to. be subject to natural and man-made disasters and tensions. In such an atmosphere of strife and ferment, the United Nations remains the only hope for States and peoples all over the world. The ideals of the Charter are not static norms to which we rededicate ourselves for form's sake every year. Each year representatives from Member countries assemble here to reaffirm their faith in the objectives and activities of this august Organization. It is strange, therefore, that in spite of these declared commitments, the conscience of mankind finds itself reticent and cautious in face of crises born of violations of the very principles of the Charter, violations which are at times deliberate and calculated. If this Organization is to survive and contribute constructively toward a new world in which the rights of the individual are safe, and his welfare ensured\nin a just and honorable environment, it is essential that the United Nations assume a credible image on the basis of tangible activities, The foundations for this purpose were laid during the last commemorative session. It is for all of us now to see if we have the strength to build on these foundations. It is my earnest hope that representatives assembled in this session would give thought to this imperative necessity and act in concert to make this Organization an instrument of their common endeavor to achieve peace, stability and justice all over the world.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "33.\t On behalf of the Argentine Government I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. We know that with your well-known ability you will guide the discussions of the Assembly successfully. I should appreciate your conveying to Edvard Hambro the appreciation of the Argentine delegation for the efficient and successful way in which he presided over the twenty-fifth session.\n34.\tMy delegation is happy to welcome the three countries that have joined the Organization at this twenty-sixth session. From its seat in the Security Council, Argentina has already had the chance to support their admission and to express its satisfaction at the fact that the United Nations was very soon to benefit from the active participation of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar.\n35.\tThe Secretary-General has expressed his decision not to continue to perform the tasks that he has been so wisely and devotedly carrying out for the United Nations. The Argentine Republic is still hoping he will reconsider that decision. But if that is not the case, we should like, from this rostrum, to express our thanks to U Thant for the efforts he has made over the years he has dedicated to our Organization. Much of the success achieved has been due to his will to strive and his concern to put into practice the principles of the Charter. For that reason, his voluntary retirement spells a loss that will be felt by those of us who believe that the United Nations can come closer to a fulfillment of its goals if it has a Secretary-General who not only carries out resolutions of our Organization but also possesses sufficient political sensitivity to be able to co-operate in the analysis of and search for solutions to world problems. Since this exactly describes U Thant we can do nothing other than pay a tribute to him for his worthy and fruitful performance.\n36.\tThe United Nations, like any other valid normative system, can be considered form two different points of view. On the one hand, it is possible to assess this Organization bearing in mind the principles on which it rests under the rules that constitute it. On the other hand, one may use as a yardstick of its effectiveness the degree of adaptation it shows to the reality it is designed to regulate.\n37.\tFrom a strictly legal point of view the United Nations represents the most significant model of the establishment of a universal system in the history of mankind.\n38.\tBy its very nature the United Nations has always aspired to constitute a complete and coherent regulation of international relations. But in its fulfillment that ambition has been conditioned by the actual reality of the world.\n39.\tThe characteristic features of the normative model of the United Nations are the scope of its criteria, its adaptability to a changing world and the capability of incorporating in its framework new actors on the inter-national scene. If peace, security and the promotion of human rights were and are the guiding principles of our Organization, it is also obvious that their maintenance in 1971 calls for the adoption of measures that cannot be the same as those of 1945.\n40.\tDuring the last quarter-century the world has multi plied its possibilities of economic, political and cultural development. Not only has the political structure of the world changed with the appearance of new States that have brought with them new concepts of life and have enriched the international dialog, but at the same time the progress of science has created a greater interdependence among the different regions of the world. This means that the implementation of the principles of the Charter demands new methods in order to ensure its efficacy and to prevent it from resting solely on mere declarations. Therefore any evaluation of the tasks that the United Nations performs presupposes an analysis of those conditions of international life that have been changed since 1945.\n41.\tTwenty-five years ago the world was divided into three large groups: that of the victorious Powers that drafted our Charter, that of the vanquished nations, and that of those other countries that had somehow not been involved in the conflict. The war that was drawing to an end had not only been the result of economic or political factors. Ideological factors also were involved. It was only natural that ideologies should continue to play a preponderant role even after the war, especially if we bear in mind the existence of a strong opposition between the political and social conceptions held by the victorious Powers themselves.\n42.\tIt would be false to deny the importance of ideologies as a factor in the transformation of national and international realities. There can be no doubt that the most radical changes of the last two centuries have, to a great extent, been brought about by ideological factors. The belief in the dynamic power of certain principles many of which were considered Utopian when first formulated has led people to bend serious efforts to modify the situation of their respective countries or regions. Furthermore, these ideologies have been the lenses through which reality has been viewed. But since ideologies themselves are swayed by historical conditioning, it is obvious that with time they too must change and that their validity is dependent on outside factors.\n43.\tWe can at present discern the inverse relation that exists between reason and political maturity, on the one hand, and ideology on the other. As the former grow so the latter seems to shrink in importance, particularly in the field of international relations. While from the seventeenth to the middle of the twentieth centuries ideological conceptions were above political decisions and defined the goals of the State, today they have become explanations, justifications of what purely and objectively must inevitably happen. For that reason political theoreticians have very often without knowing it become the deviser of justifications for what must happen. The technical argument carries weight non-ideologically; it works regardless of the political regime and eliminates fields of decisions that were at one time the purview of ideologies.\n44.\tThis fact is the direct result of another basic factor: the growth of the importance of science and technology in human relations. The rational control of nature has reached such a degree that it has substantially altered relations among men and between them and the things that surround them. The scientific and technical yield has become one of the most accurate yardsticks with which to measure the development of a country. Brain-power is now a decisive element in the independence and sovereignty of nations. Those countries that are not able to keep up with the increasing speed of scientific and technical discoveries risk falling into a type of subjection that is incomparably more complete than was classical colonialism. Control over the future will depend on science and technology. A race began some time ago to win dominion over scientific civilization. Contrary to the typical forms of state hegemony, this new type no longer aspires to extend itself in territorial space, but is measured rather by the intensity of the scientific and technical yield of the competing countries, Since the free availability of the means for scientific and technical innovation has become the basic criterion whereby to measure the sovereign power of a State, it is obvious that the dependence of some countries on others is conditioned by their real or potential capability in this field. It is also obvious that no country can renounce its participation in the possibilities opened up by science and technology.\n45.\tOur Organization has already begun a process of adaptation to these requirements of the present day. The establishment, within the Economic and Social Council, of a standing Committee on science and technology to advise and recommend on the application of science and technology to development is a measure with which my Government agrees. The membership of the Advisory Committee on the Application of Science and Technology to Development has also been increased, and we belie is necessary to widen the spectrum of specialization 'is members in accordance with the requests and interest of the countries that are still at a stage of insufficient scientific and technological development.\n46.\tMy country has followed with interest the creation of an Inter-Governmental Group on Transfer of Technology, in 'he United Nations Conference on Trade and Development /UNCTADJ. We understand that this Group, of which Argentina is a member, will perform important tasks during the present decade within UNCTAD'S sphere of action.\n47.\tBut scientific progress, together with growing industrialization and the increase in demographic density, has brought into being certain negative aspects that threaten to alter the biological balance in practically all regions of the world. This is not a necessary and therefore unavoidable result of progress. Contamination of the human environment is a consequence that can be rationally controlled. There is no incompatibility between economic development and conservation of the environment. They can both exist concurrently. What is needed is a way to ensure their reconciliation.\n48.\tInternational collaboration is also imperative in this field. The environment-not only its most obvious aspects such as the air and the seas, but also the aspects of the great waterways and their river-basins, the underground water resources, the reserves of natural resources, the conservation and improvement of animal and vegetable life-are all the heritage of mankind. Therefore mankind must ensure their preservation and their recovery where they have been modified and the ecological balance thus shattered. For this reason, the Argentine Republic attaches great importance to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to be held in Stockholm in 1972. We are taking an active part in the Preparatory Committee of the Conference and we were present at the Latin American regional seminar on problems of the environment, held in Mexico in September of this year.\n49.\tIt is a known fact that the so-called law of human environment or international law of environment is today a pragmatic and rather non-formalistic branch of international economic law. In that area, a preponderant role is\nplayed by the principle of good neighborliness which appears in the Preamble and in Article 74 of the Charter. The same holds true for the principle of international 1 solidarity; for the avoidance of the improper application of laws; for reparations for damage caused; for care to avoid injury to the interests of other States, even when exercising a legitimate right. Argentina has endeavored to put these basic principles into practice in the recently signed agreements with Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n50.\tTogether with this process which surpasses the ideological barrier and stresses the scientific and technological aspect of the relations among peoples, there has appeared an increasingly clear tendency to reject what is purely formal and to replace it with concrete programs permitting the effective development of nations. There no longer is any people that can be satisfied with the mere voicing of the principles of justice, equality and liberty. What is needed at present is to strengthen the principle of legal equality with measures that take into account the real needs of each country. That principle is an irrevocable postulate of any organized society. But when legal equality is limited only to the granting of a more or less conditioned vote or a seat in the international organs, there is a risk of justifying or formalizing a notorious injustice. Equality , among States must today be understood as meaning that each country shall have the same possibilities for development; that Is to say, the possibility of utilizing to the maximum its own human and material resources.\n51.\tThis concern with concrete matters is also a characteristic feature o.f our day. International co-operation can no longer be a mere expression of desires. Feasible and realistic plans must be carried through, plans that will take into account the needs of the various peoples. Thus, the Second United Nations Development Decade and the plan for an International Development Strategy offer a means and open up an opportunity for achieving the highest degree of international co-operation in a world at peace. The goals set in the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)] for achievement during the present decade can be reached only through close co-operation between the developing and the developed nations, regardless of their political structure and their social and economic levels.\n52.\tArgentina views the Development Decade within the general framework of international co-operation, and not merely as an isolated fact or a program of individual action within the United Nations. There can be no development in a world that lacks political harmony, and there can be no peace in a world without economic and social harmony.\n53.\tWe have successfully identified the elements upon which efforts by nations themselves and international co-operation are to be based. Through unanimous agreements in some cases and a determined desire to compromise in others, we have adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. Now we have to undertake the practical implementation of what we have agreed to, and there, the success of the project depends on us.\n54.\tIn a constant effort to promote development, the work of the United Nations Development Program is worthy of praise from Member States. Argentina believes that the reorganization that was begun last year should be completed along lines dictated by experience. This will ensure the necessary flexibility for the Program. Moreover, it is evident that without the financial support from States the targets set cannot be reached. To this end, we think it advisable that the contributions of countries be increased during the next five years.\n55.\tAs a legal organization, the United Nations is also a political institution endeavoring to carry out the ideals of coexistence. The resolutions adopted are in many cases adequate guidelines for the settlement of conflicts that affect the international community. But to contend that peace is necessary and to adopt resolutions to maintain it, and then to fail to implement them , would be to assume an inconsistent and therefore untenable position. Turning the formal into the real is also a requirement of our day.\n56.\tFor this reason Argentina calls for the implementation of Security Council resolution 242(1967), unanimously adopted on 22 November 1967, in whose drafting the Argentine delegation took an active part.\n57.\tThat resolution is still the instrument most likely to solve the crisis in the Middle East, one which is of very deep concern to my country since it pits against one another countries with which we enjoy ties of cordial friendship. The principles and obligations contained in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) must be complied with and carried out unreservedly. Neither side can expect the other to fulfill some or all of the obligations incumbent upon it if it, in turn, does not fulfill its own duties. The Argentine delegation fully shares and endorses the views expressed by the Secretary-General on this matter in his last report dated 5 March 1971.2\n58.\tWe are all aware of the fact that in this conflict time is not necessarily an aid to a peaceful solution. Passivity and lack of progress may well lead to a renewal of hostilities. Therefore it is necessary that the mission entrusted to Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, whose efforts deserve the appreciation of the Organization, should be resumed.\n59.\tPeace is also threatened in a region of the world that is inhabited by tens of millions of human beings. The events taking place in the Indian subcontinent are a source of deep concern to the Government of my country.\n60.\tFor the moment, and for humanitarian reasons, we believe the United Nations should continue, as at present, carrying out as effectively as possible the tasks of assistance\nto the victims of the events that are taking place there.\n61.\tWith this end in view the Argentine Government decided some time ago to donate 4,000 tons of wheat in order to co-operate in the endeavor to relieve the sufferings of the displaced persons who find themselves in India.\n62.\tBut, as the Secretary-General pointed out in the memorandum to the Security Council of 20 July 1971, we, too, believe that:\n2 See Official Records of the Security Council, Twenty-sixth Year, Supplement for January, February and March 1971, document SI 10070/ Add.2.\n.. the United Nations, with its long experience in peace-keeping and its varied resources for conciliation and persuasion, must, and should now play a more forthright role in attempting both to mitigate the human tragedy which has already taken place and to avert the further deterioration of the situation.\\\"\n63.\tAn Organization such as ours that has solemnly proclaimed its determination to reaffirm its faith \\\"in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person\\\" cannot be indifferent to the existence of relics of a form of domination by one people over another that repels the human conscience and flouts the most elementary rules of coexistence. I refer specifically to the colonialism that still exists in certain parts of the world.\n64.\tFrom the time of our entry into the Organization, Argentina has held a clearly anti-colonial position which I once again reaffirm.\n65.\tThere can be no doubt that General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) has been a useful instrument in accelerating the process of decolonization and that the bodies dealing with these questions constitute one of the main sources of pride and faith in the work of the United Nations. Yet there still exist colonial situations which engender constant friction and tensions.\n66.\tThat is why my country is redoubling its efforts to ensure the most scrupulous compliance by all with the United Nations decisions in this field. To this end, my Government informed the Secretary-General in a note of 2 December 1970 that it had officially notified the Government of South Africa that the Argentine Republic does not recognize any South African authority over Namibia.\n67.\tMy Government attaches the greatest importance to the activities of the United Nations Council for Namibia as well as to those of the Sub-Committee of the Security Council  whose vice-chairmanship we now hold with full awareness of the responsibilities that such a position implies.\n68.\tFurthermore, it is to be hoped that the recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) will have an influence on the satisfactory solution of the problem.\n69.\tWe also hope for a peaceful solution of the question of Rhodesia through United Nations participation. In this matter my Government has endeavored to contribute actively to the successful work of the Committee established in pursuance of Security Council resolution 253 (1968).\n70.\tThere is one question which is particularly close to the Argentine Republic and whose solution is also of importance to the Organization: I refer specifically to the situation of the Malvinas Islands.\n71.\tIn my statement of 30 September 1970 [1859th meeting], when speaking of this matter, I stated that conversations at a diplomatic level were continuing with the United Kingdom in order to open up two-way communications between the Argentine mainland and the Malvinas Islands.\n72.\tThose talks have resulted in the approval of a joint declaration [see A/8368 and A/8369] covering different aspects of the exchange of peoples and goods, and are to continue at Port Stanley during the next year.\n73.\tThe Argentine Government recognizes the value of the results attained. But this does not, however, close the chapter of negotiations. These negotiations should continue until full implementation is achieved of the terms of General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX) and the objectives of the process of decolonization of the United Nations are fully obtained.\n74.\tWe are linked to the United Kingdom by traditional and close ties of friendship. Argentina will continue its endeavors with a spirit in keeping with this long relation-ship, in the assurance that the self-same spirit is shared by the United Kingdom and that, in an atmosphere of mutual understanding, the problem will soon be definitively solved with the restoration of the Malvinas to the national territory of the Argentine Republic, Thus, we will have cleared away the only obstacle to excellent relations between our two countries.\n75.\tIt would be simplistic to believe that the international system is a homogeneous entity as far as the norms that constitute it are concerned, and the States or political bodies that compose it. We are witnesses to the simultaneous existence of different types of subsystems which also have their own different rules. But the common denominator is the shared concern also within the regional boundaries with the strengthening of peace and security and with ensuring the welfare of all.\n76.\tThe Argentine Republic is part of a continent that has been characterized by its universal approach and its concern to ensure international peace and coexistence. The peoples of Latin America have also achieved a high degree of political maturity. The fraternal ties that have linked us since our beginnings as independent States have been constantly brought up to date with events that tend to make our interdependence more effective. Our countries are increasingly the masters of their own fates and are not to be satisfied with any situation which might leave us outside the current of the universal historic process. We are determined to carry out a dynamic and up-to-date policy that will not be hampered by ideological differences as long as respect is assured for the domestic jurisdiction of every State and their forms of life and political philosophies.\n77.\tNot long ago, Argentina and Chile gave evidence of their freedom of views and political wisdom when they strengthened their ties and laid the solid groundwork for a solution to the last of their border problems. Faith in the law and the conviction that frontier problems can, in our day, be settled peacefully have led Argentina and Chile to submit pending questions concerning our 3,COO kilometers of border to arbitration. I believe that this is one case that deserves mention at this time and place because it stands as a patent example of how positive results can be attained when the principles of peace and international cooperation, on which our Organization rests, are put into practice. We are thus proving that the Charter has living validity as long as the Member States are really willing to fulfill it.\n78.\tWe wish to carry out specific projects with the other sister republics of the region, to allow a reasonable utilization of our natural resources and to take into account the needs and interests of the different countries in the area.\n79.\tWith reference to international economic relations, my country wishes to outline, from this lofty rostrum, the importance that the recent agreement with the European communities has for the commercialization of our products. This document, which is the fruit of a political decision on the part of the contracting parties, will open up a new era in the relations with countries with which Argentina has been traditionally linked by its origins and culture.\n80.\tThe United Nations has far too often been considered a Utopian organization or a normative luxury that exists outside the margin of the great problems that beset the world. In the first instance, it would then appear to be a desirable, albeit useless, institution, and in the second, an expendable legal framework. It is up to us to see that it is neither the one nor the other.\n81.\tI ha- ; referred to the determining factors of the present international situation because I believe that they are the elements on which any realistic assessment of the United Nations must rest. It is not difficult to see that there is a universal feeling that the United Nations cannot be a legal superstructure, satisfied with merely approving more or less vague resolutions that evade the demands and requirements of Member States. There is a known tendency to dwell on the purported universality of the system which, thus far, despite having admitted a large number of countries that have acceded to independence since the Second World War, has nevertheless ignored political realities of decisive importance in our days. There can be no challenge to the need to adopt concrete measures in the field of international co-operation, for it can no longer be just another way of securing historically untenable privileges. It is also obvious that all forms of colonialism or discrimination have been rejected, and it is finally also evident that as a determining factor in the relations among countries, ideologies have lost their sway. And so today, international life is characterized by such elements as the rejection of normative formalism, of the restrictive nature of the system, of disguised or open forms of imperialism, colonialism or discrimination as well as the repudiation of ideological criteria.\n82.\tThis negative listing, a contrario sensu, allows us to deduce the positive consequences of measures or principles that must be adopted to keep our Organization viable and up to date. The Organization cannot adopt multilateral measures which, to a certain extent, are anachronistic compared with those adopted bilaterally.\n83.\tI wish to point out that, pursuant to this view, at the beginning of September in Bucharest, representatives of the\nArgentine Republic met with representatives of the People's Republic of China in order to explore the possibilities of normalizing diplomatic and trade relations between our two countries, This position is the logical consequence of a consistent historical stand adopted by Argentina regarding our respect for the principle of universality in international relations. I referred to it from this same rostrum during the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly. On 16 March 1970, the Argentine representative to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament asked for the participation of the People's Republic of China in the negotiations on disarmament. In his turn, when referring to President Nixon's projected visit to Peking, the President of the Argentine Republic stated:\n\\\"I believe that by accepting an invitation to visit the People's Republic of China, President Nixon is giving a clear example of the scope and flexibility with which international problems and relations must be dealt. I feel that President Nixon's decision shows that in these days, foreign relations must be conducted without prejudices, strings, preconceptions or taboos although, at the same time, without yielding any of the principles that define our way of life and our philosophy.\\\"\n84.\tTo a large extent, the history of man is a chronicle of his efforts to unmask myths and to progress in a rational interpretation of the world. But paradoxically, the trend to turn reality into a myth seems ever latent and very often serves to disguise failures and to cover up problems we would prefer not to face squarely. Thus, the most serious danger confronting our Organization would be to fall into this myth-making. The more we refuse to act realistically, the greater that risk becomes. This realism requires that we bear in mind the needs of the present historical moment. The United Nations must subject itself to a constant and empiric stock-taking so that it will not lose sight of the real elements that condition international relations: elements which, no doubt, are different from those of 1945.\n85.\tThe responsibility for keeping the United Nations up to date is not the exclusive privilege of the great Powers. We all have a task to perform in this endeavor to achieve the ideal of the legal and political universal regulation to which we all aspire. Those States which for historical or geographical reasons have already attained the benefits of modern civilization are in duty bound to share its advantages. Those which are still at other stages of development must become aware that welfare is not achieved merely by defining needs but by separate and joint efforts. Some of all this was already hinted at by one of the founders of international law, Francisco deVitoria, who contended that, because of the varied distribution of productive resources, the very nature of things dictated the consideration of the unity of mankind as the basis for the freedom of world access to such resources, setting aside man's differences of belief; and, mutatis mutandi, the teachings of that master are still valid in our day.\n86.\tMore than ever before, man today stands in need of peace and security, precisely because the risks of losing them are greater than ever before. Two possible attitudes can be adopted in the face of this danger: fear of failure or hope for success. I prefer the second. There is in it a dynamism and an impulse towards the future that have always been present in the great achievements of man. Those who drafted our Charter and also the Member States which contribute to the achievement of its principles are imbued with the firm hope that in this way they are promoting the welfare and happiness of man on earth. When all is said and done, this is the utmost that a normative system can hope for.\n87.\tBecause we believe that the United Nations is a good instrument to achieve that goal, we are ready to continue to support it.\n"

        "file_text": "122.\t  Mr. President, it is my privilege to address this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly on behalf of the Government and people of Jordan, and to convey a solemn message of salutation and hope from our people on both banks of the river Jordan, a river whose meandering flow reflects the checkered fortunes, and misfortunes, of the people living astride its historic water-bed, from the dawn of history.\n123.\tMy message is, of necessity, mute, but none the less sober and deep-felt. For half our people, on whose behalf I have the honor to address this august gathering, have been suffering the indignity and ordeal of bondage for well over four years since the cataclysm of 1967 and its aftermath.\n124.\tAllow me, Mr. President, to associate myself with all the other delegations in extending to you heartiest congratulations on your highly deserved election to the pinnacle of our universal Organization as President of the General Assembly. Your illustrious career in the service of your great country, your wisdom and dedication, will be invaluable in steering the work of our Assembly to fulfillment of the high expectations which humanity at large cherishes, and which is its only alternative to an appalling and irrevocable course of self-annihilation.\n125.\tMy delegation takes joyful pride in welcoming to the fold of the United Nations the three new Member States of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar. We are firmly convinced that their membership will be a positive and most worthy contribution to the goals of universal representation, which goals have all along represented the United Nations aspirations, striving and accomplishments. As they are sisterly countries with which Jordan is inextricably tied by nothing less than national identity, it is particularly my unbounded happiness to welcome to our fold the States of Bahrain and Qatar, and to express the firm conviction that they will, in conjunction with the larger Arab family of people, always be in the forefront in furthering the common ideals of the United Nations.\n126.\tThe Jordan delegation has studied with utmost attention the report of our esteemed Secretary-General U Thant [A/8401 and Add J] concerning the present state of affairs of the world. Its panoramic and incisive analysis of the deepening world crisis is an ominous warning of what lies ahead if the individual and collective will of the United Nations remains lulled into a state of masterly inaction in the face of mortal challenge.\n127.\tIn certain areas of conflict partial progress has been achieved. In other and more serious arenas of conflict little or no progress has been attained. In the forefront of such explosive and unresolved situations loom the dark shadows that envelop the Middle East.\n128.\tThe mortal threat inherent in the situation is not confined to the peace, stability and even survival of this cradle of civilization and its people, for it has all the elements of overflowing to encompass the whole world.\n129.\tMy delegation is not oblivious of the dangers inherent in other areas and in other situations of conflict. We should have liked to follow the usual pattern of running through the long catalog of the items with which the agenda of this year's session abounds. We are fully aware that our fortunes and our fate are inextricably bound to the fortunes and the fate of the world community as a whole, of which we are but. a part-an integral part.\n130.\tBut there are overriding considerations that impel my address to this august gathering to focus on the so-called crisis of the Middle East, even at the risk of appearing self-centered and limited-though, I assure you, we are by no means unconcerned.\n131.\tThere are unique features in the Middle East crisis that make the use of the term \\\"crisis\\\" a misnomer, if not downright misleading. A crisis situation invariably involves a conflict between two or more ideologies, Governments and varying patterns of national or international modes of existence,\n132.\tIt is a sad and tragic fact that what is commonly referred to as the Middle East crisis should in fact be nothing less than a total reversal of everything the collective will of the United Nations has painstakingly and proudly pursued over the past quarter-century.\n133.\tThe Assembly is fully aware that one of the cardinal corner-stones of the United Nations Charter is that no country large or small under whatever pretext-should be allowed to conquer and despoil the territories and enslave the peoples of other States, let alone Members of the United Nations. The territorial integrity and inviolability cf every Member State is sacrosanct under the Charter, and forcible conquest is the very antithesis of its being and its rationale,\n134.\tForgive me for repeating platitudes, but when platitudes describe a present, continuing and blatant state of affairs then those platitudes become a stark novelty deserving of our most serious attention.\n135.\tI represent a Member State half of whose people and territory have been the victims of aggression and occupation for more than four consecutive years, and the end is by no means in sight. The situation is as novel as it is tragic, yet who can dispute its existence?\n136.\tWe solemnly, and in the name of our aggrieved people, request this General Assembly to assert in the strongest and most unequivocal terms its determined stand against this unprecedented and unabashed violation of everything the United Nations has been set up to safeguard. We all realize that the United Nations as originally constituted was specifically intended before all else to safeguard peace and to preserve the independence and sovereignty of its Member States., We appreciate full well that Members of this Organization abhor and condemn the flagrant Israeli disregard for those principles of the United Nations, a disregard demonstrated by Israel's continued occupation of its neighbors' territory and its loud and deliberate defiance of United Nations resolutions and pronouncements on the issue.\n137.\tYet the question that imposes itself upon all of us should be this: is the role of the United Nations one of observing, disapproving, condemning and, by inaction, acquiescing in situations that run so blatantly counter to its fundamental premises and innermost fabric?\n138.\tWhat is commonly referred to as the Middle East crisis represents in plain and forthright taJk an openly declared and very-much-boasted-of aggression by Israel on the dawn of 5 June 1967 against three States Members of the United Nations: the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Syrian Arab Republic. The so-called preemptive strike against us occurred with cold and deliberate calculation at a crucial moment when the United Nations and all the Powers, big and small alike, were frantically exerting every effort to arrest the awesome drift to war in consequence of Israeli threats against Syria and inevitable Arab precautionary measures to attempt at least to stem such a threat.\n139.\tThe sequence and unfolding of events since the 1967 aggression and the resulting occupation up to this day are even more telling and more ominous. By words as well as by deeds Israel has nde no secret of its penchant to retain and possess the territories it acquired by aggression and by conquest.\n140.\tFor, as Members all know, shortly after the war the Security Council adopted resolution 242(1967). That resolution was intended to define a just and lasting solution to the problem. Its points were clear, its intent specific. It reaffirmed the established principle that the acquisition of territory by military force is inadmissible and cajleii for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territory they had occupied. It called for an end to belligerency in the area, it guaranteed the right of all States in the area to live in peace and security within recognized boundaries and it guaranteed freedom of passage for all ships wough international waterways. It also called for a just solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees. It struck a balance between the obligations of both sides. It met the natural Arab demand that Israeli occupation of our territory be decisively ended. It provided the guarantees for future peace and security in the area, which the Israelis alleged were the only aim of their policies, and, conditions for ending a temporary military occupation, r\n141.\tTwo principal Arab parties, Jordan and Egypt, accepted the resolution and the obligations devolving upon them therefrom. My Government was repeatedly assured by major Powers in the Council, and especially the United States, that, were the resolution accepted, its implementation by Israel would be ensured and their full weight would be thrown behind it to assure Israel's compliance. The Arab Republic of Egypt was given similar assurances pertaining to implementation. And that was done even before the resolution was adopted by the Security Council in an attempt to guarantee Arab acceptance of its terms.\n142.\tIt hardly occurred to our Governments that the process of implementation was to be subverted and even sabotaged by a game in semantics and procrastination which continues up to this day. The game went so far as to overtax the patience and hope of even the United-Nations representative, Ambassador Jarring, an indomitable and patient diplomat by the most stringent standards.\n143.\tMy Government co-operated fully with Ambassador Jarring, whose terms of reference were defined in the Security Council resolution. Like the Governments of Egypt and Lebanon, it received him repeatedly and responded positively and sincerely to all his questions and efforts. Without hesitation we announced our acceptance of Security Council resolution 242(1967) and expressed readiness to implement our part of it. Israel continued to equivocate about the resolution, sometimes referring only to its \\\"spirit\\\", sometimes only to one element in it, 1 sometimes fully ignoring it. Two whole years were spent in this tragic game.\n144.\tIn the second round of Dr. Jarring's efforts, which climaxed in his series of questions addressed to the parties in March 1969, my Government displayed an equally positive attitude. Reaffirming its commitment to an ultimate just peace, it replied in writing:  \\\"Jordan accepts the right of every State in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries, free from threats or acts of force\\\". Furthermore, \\\"Jordan agrees to pledge termination of all claims or states of belligerency\\\". To another question my Government replied that Jordan would not oppose the establishment of demilitarized zones. And in reply to yet another question by Ambassador Jarring, we stated that in case demilitarized zones are established, Jordan accepts that such zones be supervised and maintained by the United Nations. The Arab Republic of Egypt gave equally clear commitments to peace. In addition, it gave assurances on freedom of navigation in international waterways in the area.\n145.\tThis explicit Arab commitment to the obligations defined in the Security Council resolution was certainly noA matched by Israel. Ambassador Jarring could not get any commitment from Israel on an ultimate total withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, even in the context of complete implementation of the Security Council resolution and the achievement of peace.\n\\\"i\n146.\tTo forestall a breakdown in the peace efforts, the four big Powers initiated, in the spring of that year, consultations aimed at breaking the deadlock by getting the Security Council to exercise its responsibilities in the matter. Again we welcomed this move in the Council. We regarded it as natural and necessary. Israel vehemently opposed this initiative and opened a violent propaganda campaign against it. It realized that the intervention of the Council was bound to lead to an agreed position that, while peace in the area was the ultimate objective, Israeli evacuation of the occupied territories was a natural prerequisite.\n147.\tThe following year witnessed a deterioration in the situation in the area and frequent resumption of hostilities. It also witnessed a crystallization of a public posture by Israel confirming what we had always warned against: that, peace or no peace, Israel Intended to keep the territory it occupied.\n143. It was this position that led to Israel's clumsy and nervous reaction to the United States initiative in June 1970 to revive the efforts of Ambassador Jarring on the basis of the Security Council resolution. Israel hesitated, resisted, made angry noises about the prospects of revival of United Nations peace efforts, and finally managed to sabotage the initiative and the renewed Jarring mission. Not before it stated explicitly, however, that total withdrawal was out of the question.\n149.\tThe Israeli position has become clear to all by now. The Foreign Minister of Israel in his statement before this Assembly [1946th meeting] made it even clearer. Rhetoric and diplomatic language apart, let us see what the implications of Mr. Eban's statement are.\n150.\tHe went to considerable lengths in his thinly disguised attempt to sell and rationalize expansion. During the past quarter-century the Israelis claimed that Israel harbored no territorial ambitions and that its only aim was to arrive at a lasting peace. Reading Mr, Eban's statement, this is something which belongs to the past and has no relevance to the present or the future. The basic Israeli thesis is now undisguisedly that, peace or no peace, negotiation or no negotiation, territories acquired in 1967 will not be relinquished. This thesis runs through the whole of Mr. Eban's speech, in which he attempts to soften up the world Organization to accept it.\n151.\tWhere would negotiation lead to when the official Israeli position is that, at the minimum, Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and Sharm El Sheikh are not negotiable and that in the rest of the occupied areas more would be annexed on the pretext of security or sentimental reasons? Yet, the Israeli spokesman speaks of negotiations without preconditions.\n152.\tNegotiations, direct or indirect, are a procedure that must lead to a goal. So are arbitration and adjudication and resort to the Security Council. Negotiation is not an end in itself. Mr.Eban makes it an end in itself, and the exclusively legitimate end. But in his preconceived and prejudged position on the substantive issues of withdrawal and territorial inviolability he destroys the very goal of negotiation. Come to the table, he says, with no right to question our decisions to acquire your territory but with the full duty to give our acquisition your seal of approval. This position deprives negotiation of any meaning and renders Mr. Eban's call for negotiation most deceptive and cynical.\n153.\tBut if Mr. Eban's statement extolling the virtues of negotiation is meant to underscore his claim that the world Organization has confined its role to public debate, then the whole General Assembly would be more than justified in taking strong exception to his statement.\n154.\tFor over four years, as I have stated earlier, the United Nations has attempted to promote settlement of the Middle East problem through the various avenues at its disposal.\n155.\tAmbassador Jarring could hardly be accused of engaging in public debate in his thankless task of working to achieve a settlement by quiet negotiation. His mission, as we all recognize, and, as Mr. Eban admitted in his statement, is stalled and in abeyance. He is still awaiting an Israeli reply to his specific questions of last February.\n156.\tThe four major Powers, over an extended period, attempted to promote a settlement, only to give up in despair because of Israel's adamant refusal to comply with the United Nations resolutions and the dictates of law and justice. They were as tight-lipped as Ambassador Jarring, and the only thing that came out of their endless meetings was an announcement informing the world of the date of their next meeting. Has the work of the four major Powers been a world debate of issues rather than quiet deliberation to resolve the crisis?\n157.\tMr. Rogers, the United States Secretary of State, and his assistants likewise engaged in efforts to resolve the crisis. The motto of their efforts was quiet diplomacy, to the point where it almost ran counter to the United States practice of public disclosures on major issues, Has anything come out of these efforts? The General Assembly, I am sure, is entitled to know.\n158.\tMr. Eban has Openly disparaged and disdained United Nations resolutions, including those of the Security Council. To use his own words:\n.. majorities [have] no moral value, little practical effect and a very short life in the world's memory\\\" (1946th meeting, para. 64].\nIf other Members of the United Nations share Mr. Eban's assessment of its role, then there is little else for it to do but to wind up its business and abdicate its responsibilities under the Charter.\n159.\tMr. Eban was less than discreet when he referred to what he called \\\"automatic majorities\\\" in the United Nations [ibid]. What automatic majorities do the Arabs possess other than a rightful cause and an indefensible Israeli position?\n160.\tThe Security Council recently adopted resolution 298 (1971), regarding Jerusalem, with no dissenting voice. Does Mr. Eban wish to tell us that we have a magic formula by means of which we have succeeded in harnessing the support cf all member States of the Council: the aligned, the non-aligned, the European, the American, the African and the Asian, the major Powers and the non-permanent members, respected statesmen representing every color, race and creed? Has it not occurred to Mr. Eban that there must be a reason much more fundamental than the my th of an automatic majority which has caused the Council to act with such unanimity? Perhaps if the Israeli Foreign Minister examined things introspectively for once, he would find the answer and thereby make it easier for all concerned to achieve a fair and equitable solution.\n161.\tAs I have already said, Israel's position has become very clear. Israel will accept peace only if peace is defined as an Arab formal declaration that their territories under occupation be ceded to Israel; that the people in the occupied lands are not their concern ; that the rights of the Palestinians recognized in repeated United Natidns resolutions are forfeited, and that Israeli hegemony in the area and a privileged economic and political position are submissively recognized.\n162.\tWhat kind of peace is that? Which of you would accept this definition in theory, let alone making his own country a field for its application?\n163.\tIf what Israel Wants is.peace and security, then the guarantees for peace and security have been amply articulated in the United Nations documents during the last four years and in the United Nations machinery which we all respect and agree to co-operate with. But security cannot be achieved by continuous incursions into the territories of neighbors and the reliance upon a military machine devouring and feeding on rich foreign sources and increasingly becoming the idol of Israel's society and its ultimate goal. The United Nations cannot accept this concept of security. The Arab countries adjacent to Israel-with their own security and rights-reject such a concept.\n164.\tForeign occupation of the territories of other States is abhorrent in itself by every internationally recognized standard. But when such an occupation is accompanied by the dispersal and expulsion of the victims from their ancestral homeland, the plundering of their lands and means of livelihood, and the undisguised and openly declared intent to take over that territory irrevocably, sooner or later, then the time has clearly come for the international order and those who wish to be its guardian to take stock of themselves and of the system which they purport to uphold. Has the world reverted again to the jungle status from which it has sought and fought to extricate itself? .Does not the world community realize that peace and justice are indivisible; that, if Israel is permitted to reap the bitter harvest of its aggression, then which country in the world, apart from the super-Powers, could feel safe about its; future and its security? Those are questions very real questions which must seriously be pondered by all peoples who have a stake in world peace with justice.\n165.\tThere are three aspects of Israeli occupation which deserve to be highlighted in this context. They are not by any means the only obnoxious ones, but they are the most flagrant.\n166.\tFirst, may I draw the attention of this Assembly to the plight and agony of the half a million of our brethren in the Gaza Strip. Twice or possibly more in a lifetime, they have been condemned to a life of refuge and squalor, herded in refugee camps. For 20 years they had survived their suffering in the hope that they wouH eventually be repatriated, to their homes in their homeland.\n167.\tAnd now the Israeli forces of occupation are expelling the people of Gaza from their hornet, blowing up their houses and forcing them to find shelter in the wilderness of the Sinai peninsula. This is part of a planned depopulation program that will eventually lead to Gaza's being incorporated into the Israeli State. What happens to the people is no concern of the Israelis. It is the land they covet. There is nothing more certain in our minds than that. But if it is the land they want, they will have to struggle for ever to maintain it. As we have said many times, they may choose land or peace. They can never have both.\n168 , The second aspect of the occupation has been the ruthless and inhuman treatment meted out to our brethren in all the occupied territories, in flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the various Geneva conventions governing the basic rights of civilians under occupation and, above all, the inherent and natural rights of the indigenous inhabitants in their own homeland. Thousands of homes in towns and villages have been obliterated on the flimsiest pretext that they had been harboring resistance. Many thousands of youths, young boys and girls, have been languishing in prisons, in numerous instances subjected to torture, off and on for years. Even United Nations investigation of the plight of civilians under occupation was arrogantly rejected by the forces of occupation.\n169. But the peak of the tragedy in the Middle East and its greatest manifestation is the tragedy of Jerusalem. Tragedies can and do befall individuals. But individuals are\ntransient and finite creatures whose suffering passes with their passing away.\n170. But such is not the case with historic cities whose structures, stones, alleys, sacred sights, memories and associations symbolize a soul, immutable and indestructible. The agony A such souls is all the more infinite because it does not perish no matter what the magnitude of the aberration inflicted upon it. And so it is with immortal Jerusalem whose fate has so often been to suffer agony commensurate with its undying glory. It is a city, beautiful, sad and serene. The burden of history left an indelible mark upon its landscape and its people; the cataclysmic past, the uncertainty of the present and the dread fear for the future.\n17 . Where does Jerusalem stand today? It is being defaced and dismantled gradually but persistently beyond recognition. Ugly concrete structures are ringing the city in all directions in violation of the norms which govern the status of ancient and historic cities. The occupied city is being ruthlessly and systematically swallowed by the Israeli State. Its Arab inhabitants, who lived in it for centuries, are being drowned in a flood of imported Israelis, who are demolishing the ethnic, cultural and national character of the city. Through legislation, administrative regulations, transfer of population, and crude physical action, the Israeli authorities are contriving the demise of the occupied \\rab city.\n172.\tThe Israelis call their annexation \\\"unification\\\". There can be no unification in bondage, where one community tramples upon the human dignity, the soul and the lands of other communities.\n173.\tThe Israelis claim that Jerusalem was never in history the capital of any nation. Would the Israelis deny that Jerusalem has, throughout history, been the object of infinite veneration, worship and hope for countless millions in the Moslem and Christian worlds? For 1 ;400 years we have been the proud custodians of Jerusalem; centuries before that even before the days of Aw~Jiam our ancestors founded and inhabited the city and ail \\\"he land around it. It is the roots cf our religious and historical past that bind us to Jerusalem; and we shall never let them be cut off, despite the present Occupation of the Holy City by the military and political forces of Israel.\n174.\tThe Israeli objective is clearly designed to stifle the soul of the remnant of the Arab city and the remnant of its Arab inhabitants. Indeed, the real aim of the so-called Israeli development plan is to cut off Arab Jerusalem altogether from the rest of the West Bank of Jordan and the Arab world, Moslem and Christian, by means of massive intervening structures, and turn in thereby into a virtual ghetto, which the Israelis hope will wither as the years go by.\n175.\tAt its recent emergency meeting, the Security Council adopted resolution 298 (1971) with no dissenting vote, which once again categorically condemned the Israeli aggression in Jerusalem. The resolution reaffirmed previous Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on Jerusalem; it repeated that all Israeli actions in the city are totally invalid and called on Israel to rescind all those actions and measures; it also requested the Secretary-\nGeneral, in consultation with the President of the Security Council and using such instrumentalities as he deem appropriate, including the dispatching of a representative or a mission, to report on Israel's compliance with the Security Council decision. Israel immediately declared, as it has always done, its rejection of the resolution and its defiance of the will of this Organization. Jordan will await the report of the Secretary-General on his efforts, and if Israel persists in its intransigence, then the Security Council and the General Assembly will have to take the necessary action to enforce their will and +o reappraise their relationship with that recalcitrant Member.\n\n176.\tI must pause here to say, in as quiet and unemotional a way as I can, that there will be no peace in the Middle East so long as the Holy City of Jerusalem remains under the domination of Israel. I do not say this emptily; I say it because it is an accepted truth in the mind and heart of every Arab-Moslem and Christian. The liberation of Jerusalem is the corner-stone of peace in the Middle East; it is the essential prerequisite for any move towards the final solution of the problem.\n177.\tIn conclusion, Jordan would like to put its position on record once again. Believing that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is the right basis for an immediate and just peace in the Middle East, Jordan once again pledges itself to its full acceptance. It subscribes to every one of its principles and it agrees to implement its specific provisions. We accept the call for a just and lasting peace contained in that resolution. We are ready to fulfill our peace obligations as defined in it.\n178.\tLet Israel declare its acceptance of the obligations required of it and contained in the resolution-that it end its or pupation and withdraw its forces from the Arab territories it occupied in June 1967. Let the Israeli Foreign Minister come up to this rostrum and declare in unequivocal terms that, in the context of a peace solution, Israel will withdraw from the west bank of the Jordan, from Arab Jerusalem, from the Gaza Strip, from the Sinai Peninsula, from the Sharm El Sheikh, and from the occupied Syrian heights. Let the Israeli spokesman and his Government declare that Israel wants to live in peace with its neighbors and not to live at our expense, by annexing our Jerusalem, occupying our land and enslaving our people. Let Israel declare all that, and the road to peace in the Middle East will be opened.\n179.\tFor almost 25 years Israel has played the theme of peace and peaceful intentions. Now the challenge and the test of intentions are available. It is Israel which has the answer to the question whether there will be war or peace in the Middle East.\n180.\tHie world Organization is, without doubt, at a most crucial cross-roads in the stupendous challenges which confront it, particularly over the Middle East. It is my country's hope and prayer that it will succeed in surmounting the crisis, thereby ensuring not only its own survival but also the survival of a world based on justice, freedom and the rule of law.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1 Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you, on behalf of the Swedish Government, our warmest congratulations upon your election to the high office of President of this session of the General Assembly. Your election constitutes a tribute to you as a representative of a leading nation in Asia. We are convinced that under your presidency of this session of the General Assembly we will be able to achieve important results, and we pledge our full co-operation.\n\n2 At the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Edvard Hambro of Norway presided over our deliberations. He guided us skilfully and efficiently, with authority and firmness, and we want to thank him for his significant contribution to the work of the United Nations as President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n\n3 On behalf of the people of Sweden and of my Government, I want to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General. For ten years U Thant has served the United Nations and the world community with unselfish devotion and great wisdom, with vision, courage and integrity. His departure from his high office will be a loss for this Organization and will be deeply regretted in my country. The United Nations and all the Member States owe him a great debt of gratitude, and I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express the sincere and warm thanks of .the Swedish people to U Thant and to extend to him our heartfelt good wishes for the future.\n\n4.\tThis year the General Assembly meets against the background of important changes in the international political structure. These changes may soon be reflected in the work of the United Nations. They give rise to hope that the ability of this Organization to fulfill its goals may be increased.\n\n5.\tWe have very good reasons to believe that during this session the People's Republic of China will take its legitimate place in all organs of the United Nations. Finally it has become generally accepted that this people of 800 million must be represented in the United Nations. Sweden has persistently supported the efforts to render possible the participation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.\n6.\tThe progress achieved with regard to the German problems gives cause for expectations that both the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic will soon be seated as full Members, thus closing another of the most unfortunate gaps in the ranks of United Nations Members.\n7.\tThe Swedish Government shares the hope expressed by the Secretary-General that other divided countries also will be admitted to the world Organization [A/84Q1/Add.l, para. 104], conscious of the fact that universality creates better; possibilities of achieving realistic solutions. The trends towards universality are a Consequence of the conviction that international problems cannot be solved by excluding some nations from the international community. Universality reduces tensions and promotes peaceful cooperation. At the same time it is? a manifestation of the detente which characterizes the international political situation of today.\n8.\tSolutions of global problems are, however, frequently found within the regional context. Since nations of one region often are at approximately the same stage of development-in a political, economic and social sense- regional co-operation constitutes a framework for collaboration which does not bestow special favors or disfavors on one nation or another. Of course this does not imply that global co-operation is less important than regional co-operation. On the contrary, strong trends in technological and economic development illustrate the growing interdependence of all nations. We must find a way to global coexistence and see to it that regional co-operation should be an integral link in a universal order of peace.\n9.\tThe European scene is now marked by efforts aimed at a detente between East and West and by the integration process in Western Europe. Renewed endeavors to expand economic relations between Eastern and Western Europe are also under way.\t\u00bb\nA/PV.1942 and Corr.l\n10.\tThe treaties concluded last year between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union  and between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland, as well as the recent Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin,  offer new\n1\tSigned at Moscow on 12 August 1970.\n2\tTreaty on the Bases for the Normalization of Relations, signed at Warsaw on 7 December 1970.\n3\tSigned at Berlin on 3 September 1971.\u2003\nways for improved relations between East and West in Europe. At the same time this development in East-West relations in Europe will improve international relations in general. It is of vita! importance that the agreement on Berlin be accompanied, as soon as possible, by an agreement between. East and West Germany. All these events create favorable conditions for a regional security conference in Europe with the participation of the United States and Canada. The preparations for the conference should benefit from this and now enter into a more active phase.\n11.\tSweden is contributing, in its measure, to bridging the existing gaps between East and West in Europe. We support present efforts to reach a detente in Europe. We intend to take an active part in the proposed security conference.\n12.\tThe integration process in Europe renders possible an end to the existing market split. The expanding economic integration of Western Europe creates possibilities for substantially increased prosperity. The creation of this large market also puts the participating nations in a better position to further international trade and co-operation. Sweden will make its contribution to this process, in forms consistent with its policy of neutrality.\n13.\tThe rapid development towards prosperity and increasingly higher standards of living in the industrialized nations is not exclusively beneficial. We now experience a wastage of resources unparalleled in our history. This is not only a question of pollution and wear in the industrialized countries. Scarce natural resources are exploited at an accelerated pace in both developed and developing countries. But to an overwhelming degree it is the developed countries which are benefiting from and consuming these scarce resources. Thus, the problem of the distribution of resources is added to the problem of the wastage. Both these aspects must be considered when we formulate a future environmental policy on a world-wide scale, Sweden, like other United Nations Members, sets great hopes upon the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held in Stockholm in June of next year. In order for the Conference to have a bearing on future work in the environmental field, it must be held at the governmental level. A change of this character of the Conference is not acceptable to the Swedish Government.\n14.\tThe uneven distribution of resources between developed and developing countries brings me to the situation in the third world. The developing countries are excluded from the process of integration and from the development of modern technology which are the basis '/or the rapid expansion in the developed part of the world. An ever- widening gap thus emerges between developed and developing countries. If this trend is permitted to continue, it may constitute a threat to peace.\n15.\tMany of today's open conflicts and risks of conflict are found in the third world and their causes are related to the demands inherent in the process of development. Economic emancipation has often been considered as incompatible with strong political and commercial interests within the developed world, The far-reaching changes in the socio-economic structures of the developing countries bring about risks of conflict, just as does every process of\n^ redistribution of political and economic power. Only by\naccenting the demands of change con these risks be reduced.\n16.\tAll United Nations Member States, last year, in approving the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade resolution 2626 (XXV)], thus agreed on the necessity of social change. The economic collaboration between developed and developing countries must be founded on a basis which strikes a fair balance between the different interests involved.\n17.\tSolidarity and unity among the developing countries should be welcomed since it strengthens their bargaining position. Until the developing countries have achieved full economic independence, the developed countries should fashion their policies towards the developing countries in a manner which facilitates the economic independence of these countries.\n18.\tThe United Nations has a vital mission to fulfil in the developing process of the third world. It is true that the assistance extended by the United Nations system is still fairly limited in scope. United Nations assistance is, however, of particular importance to the developing countries as it is adapted to their own interests and in accordance with the principles of national sovereignty. The capacity of the United Nations to render assistance must be substantially increased, as outlined in the Development Strategy, to enable this Organization to live up to the great responsibility set forth in its Charter.\n19.\tWithin the United Nations, the Economic and Social Council is the supreme body for all questions related to development. It is essential that the Economic and Social Council should be given a composition suited to its task, and therefore we support the expansion of the membership of the Council.\n20.\tIn the future, the United Nations should increasingly promote co-operation between developing countries on a regional basis, since regional co-operation constitutes one of the most effective instruments for stimulating development. It must therefore be of high priority to increase the resources of the regional organs of the United Nations. The regional organs reach their full effect only when the developing countries themselves can exert a decisive influence on their work.\n21.\tIn many parts of the world the drive for liberation is still being met with violence. No solution has been found for the conflict in Viet-Nam. The war has this year spread to Laos and has turned into a second Indo-China war. The Swedish Government has persistently expressed its support for a political solution to the Viet-Nam tragedy. What is true for Viet-Nam is equally true for Laos and Cambodia. A political solution in Indo-China must take into account the sovereign rights of the Indo-Chinese peoples, their right to choose their own path, their own way of life and their own institutions without outside interference. Only then can we hope for conditions which will permit economic and social development in Indo-China and peaceful co-operation between these countries, as well as between them and the outside world.\n22.\tThe start of the negotiations in Paris in 1969 was made possible by the cessation of the bombing of North Viet-Nam. It is therefore with grave concern that we have to note that bombings on a large scale have taken place again,\n23.\tThe conflict in East Pakistan has led to the collapse of social order in the region. Famine and epidemic diseases are spreading among the population. More than 8 million people have fled into India. The Indian people has, with great sacrifices, made an impressive effort to alleviate the plight of the refugees. The strain on India is unreasonably heavy.\n24.\tThis conflict has generated problems which, to quote the Secretary-General, necessarily are of concern to the international community fA/8401/AddJ, para. 177]. Among the refugees in India, the United Nations has initiated activities which are in line with the best traditions of the Organization in the field of refugee relief. In the efforts to bring humanitarian assistance to the affected people in East Pakistan as well, the United Nations can play an important role also in providing international coordination and control of the humanitarian assistance received from abroad.\n25.\tThe Swedish Government supports the initiative of the Secretary-General to assist both the suffering people in East Pakistan and the refugees in India and has taken financial measures to this end.\n26.\tEven if none of the States in the region desires a conflict we cannot overlook the risk that the severe human suffering and the serious tensions might lead to a widening of the crisis. The Swedish Government joins those who appeal to the Government of Pakistan to show moderation and restraint in order to bring an end to the violence in East Pakistan. Only a political solution, based on respect for human rights and on the will of the people as expressed through the ballot, can solve the problem of East Pakistan.\n27.\tWe note with deep regret that no solution of the crisis in the Middle East is yet in view. The Swedish Government firmly believes that a political solution must be sought on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). It has for us always been a matter of course to support the Secretary-General and his personal representative in their efforts to achieve the realization of the decision of the Security Council, and i wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express again our hope that their endeavors will meet with success.\n28.\tIn \\\"southern Africa, the policies and repressive measures of apartheid have been intensified over the last decade. But, so also has the struggle for freedom in all southern Africa. It is of paramount importance for the international community to assist in appropriate ways the efforts undertaken by the oppressed people of southern Africa to liberate themselves from oppressors and to reach a higher social and educational standard of living.\n29.\tIt is not only in the areas of acute crisis that political solutions to conflicts must be sought. We must strive to \\\"demilitarize\\\" relations between nations. International detente is a prerequisite for disarmament. Progress in the\nfield of disarmament will in its turn lead to further detente. The partial test-ban treaty was a first important step in the disarmament efforts. But so far no comprehensive test ban has been achieved. To our disappointment no agreement to ban underground nuclear tests has materialized. The superPowers continue the qualitative development of their nuclear weapons at their will.\n30.\tSweden has consistently advocated a ban on all chemical and biological weapons. We must work with all our strength to reach agreement to ban the production and use not only of biological but also of chemical weapons.\n31.\tThe comprehensive 'disarmament program submitted in 1970s must be fulfilled. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva should, on the basis of tills program, be given a renewed mandate to negotiate measures leading to general and complete disarmament,\n32.\tSweden will support all proposals which could lead to results in the field of disarmament. Thus, it may, for instance, be justified to study and to develop further proposed plans for nuclear-free zones advanced during previous years. The prospects for reaching limitations of conventional weapons on a regional basis should be examined.\n33.\tAs I said in the beginning of my statement, Governments now appear prepared to draw the practical conclusions from the principle of universality. But the right to participate in international co-operation is not a final goal. True universality presupposes a genuine ability to participate. All nations must participate in global development and in this process arrive at a more equitable distribution among nations of the fruits of our joint endeavors. That will constitute true universality.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t  Mr. President, it is my pleasant duty, on behalf of my Government and delegation, as well as on my own behalf, to extend to you our most sincere felicitations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. This is a fitting tribute both to your distinguished diplomatic career and to the country which you represent. We of the Chinese delegation wish you every success in the discharge of the great responsibilities of your high office.\n2.\tNotwithstanding the atmosphere of euphoria which seems to have pervaded the current scene, the world is still confronted by war or threats of war. The war in Viet-Nam has now been escalated to embrace the whole of Indo-China. The situation in the Middle East continues to be explosive. Conflicts of one kind or another prevail in various parts of the world. Although some of these may be said to be disputes of a domestic nature, their continuance could endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.\n3.\tIn Viet-Nam the Communists continue to seek a military solution. They count on the pressures of world\npublic opinion to force the withdrawal of United States forces. The Paris peace talks have served, as far as the Communists are concerned, more as an instrument for political warfare than for serious discussions. Always with an eye on the anti-war sentiments in the United States, the Communist negotiators have been skillful in stirring up popular opposition to United States involvement in Viet- Nam. Division within the United States has made the eventual American pull-out inevitable. But the withdrawal of the United States military establishment from Viet-Nam, however, should not mean the disappearance of United States interest and influence from South-East Asia. We are confident that the United States will continue to fulfill its commitments in that part of the world, even though a nation directly threatened by aggression must now, in the light of the Nixon Doctrine, assume the primary responsibility for providing the manpower for its own national defense.\n4.\tIn terms of Viet-Nam this means that the brunt of the war must henceforth be borne by the people of the Republic of Viet-Nam themselves. Indeed, the South Viet-Namese people have been doing just that for over two years. All evidence points to the fact that they have given a pretty good account of themselves. There is every reason to believe that they will be able to safeguard their independence and freedom against subversion from within and aggression from without after the withdrawal of United States armed forces.\n5.\tIt is gratifying that, in the midst of war and crisis, the Republic of Viet-Nam has continued to make progress in the social, economic and political fields. A general election has just taken place. Bitter fighting on the battlefields and terrorism in the rear failed to keep the voters from the polls. Given the divisive social and intellectual climate, and the disruptions of the war, no one should expect the Republic of Viet-Nam to master the mechanisms of the democratic process overnight. Of the fact that Saigon has done its best to make democracy the dominant element in its future there can be no question. One is doing no favor to the people and Government of South Viet-Nam if one allows oneself to expect too much to happen too soon. In any case, the Republic of Viet-Nam does not merit the kind of abuse and vilification which some critics have been in the habit of meting out. It is ironical that the same critics, while condemning South Viet-Nam for its undemocratic ways, do not hesitate to pay craven homage to the North Viet-Namese Communists, who have nothing but contempt for bourgeois democracy. Obviously, they are less interested in the development of democratic institutions in South Viet-Nam than in sowing the seeds of dissension among the Viet-Namese people. The last thing they want to see is the creation of conditions in which healthy political institutions can flourish and the Viet-Namese may be enabled to work out their own destiny in their own way.\u2003\n6.\tIn the Middle East, guns have for the most part been silent since the acceptance by Israel, Egypt and Jordan in August last year of the United States peace initiative. The cease-fire, while no longer formally in effect after its lapse in March 1971, has by and large been observed. It is to be regretted, however, that the maintenance of the precarious cease-fire has not been accompanied by any progress towards the resolution of the basic issues which have so long embittered the relations between Israel and the Arab States. It is all too obvious that, unless the parties concerned are prepared to accept reasonable and practical compromises or the major interested Powers are willing to bring their influence to bear on the parties, peace in the Middle East will remain unattainable.\n7.\tThere are conflicts which are technically matters of a domestic nature but whose significance for international peace is beyond question. A case in point is the recent civil strife in East Pakistan. As the Secretary-General has pointed out in his report on the work of the Organization, the problems generated by the conflict \\\"are necessarily of concern to the international community\\\" [A/8401[Add.l, para. 177].\n8.\tIn purely human terms the magnitude of the tragedy is staggering. In the six months since March several million refugees have poured into India. The terrible plight in which millions of destitute and helpless people find themselves cannot but arouse the sympathy and compassion of us all. We of the Republic of China know how serious the problem can be in terms of human misery and suffering. Ever since the Communist take-over of the Chinese mainland, millions of our brethren have suffered the same fate as that whicn has now befallen the East Pakistanis. We therefore urge the international community to do everything possible to give relief to the innocent people who, through no fault of their own, have been deprived of their homes and possessions and have been thrown upon the mercies of an alien world.\n9.\tLasting peace cannot be built on the foundation of a world community in which the greater part of mankind sinks ever deeper into the miseries of under-development and over-population. It is, of course, no easy matter to close the gap between rich and poor nations. There is no question, however, that there are available material resources for this task. The question is whether there is the will to use the available resources to meet the pressing needs of development. In the view of my delegation, the United Nations is in a special position to create that will. The International Development Strategy for the new Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] is an important step in the right direction.\n10.\tThe third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [ UNCTAD], scheduled to convene in a few months, should provide an excellent opportunity for co-operation between developed and developing countries. It is hoped that the developed countries will find it in their own interest to remove the barriers which they have set up and which have operated to the great disadvantage of the developing countries.\n11.\tThe Republic of China is a developing country. It faces many of the problems which plague other developing\n \ncountries. In so far as lies within the limits of its capabilities, it has always been ready to contribute to the solution of problems which confront countries in various stages of development and to share experiences with them.\n12.\tIt must be admitted that the United Nations has in recent years lost much of its prestige and influence. In Viet-Nam it has contented itself with playing the role of a helpless bystander. In the Middle East its attempts to bring about a settlement have achieved no outstanding success. The advance towards disarmament is being decided not so much in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament meeting at Geneva as in the direct Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] between the Soviet Union and the United States. The recent agreement on the status of Berlin  was concluded outside the walls of the United Nations. The inescapable conclusion is that on the main currents of world events the United Nations has exerted only a marginal influence.\n13.\tAs a free association of sovereign States the United Nations can be only as strong and effective as its Members make it. All too often short-range national interests are allowed to prevail over the common interests of the world community. All too often the United Nations has not hesitated to resort to expediency at the expense of vital Charter principles. Its readiness to yield to force, to disregard justice, or to neglect human rights, has been to a large extent responsible for what has often been called \\\"a crisis of confidence\\\".\n14.\tIt is sad to reflect that, at a time when the effectiveness of the United Nations is being called into question, there are those in our midst who press for the replacement of the Republic of China, a Member of impeccable standing, by a regime whose declared policy has been the destruction of the Organization as an instrument for peace.\n15.\tI shall have occasion to speak on the so-called question of Chinese representation when the item comes up for debate in the Assembly. I wish to make here a few observations which may help to clarify certain issues in respect of the Chinese Communist regime.\n16.\tThe first observation I wish to make is that it is erroneous to assume that the Communist regime and the Chinese people are an indissoluble whole. The fact of the matter is that the regime and the oppressed millions are two distinct and mutually hostile entities. The overwhelming majority of the people are anti-Mao and anti-Communist. Twenty-two years of unremitting regimentation and brainwashing, torture and terror have failed to make them accept tho Communist regime as anything more than a transient tyranny which, like other tyrannies in Chinese history, will in time pass away. The Chinese people have never ceased to thirst for freedom, and they will struggle on until freedom is won.\n17.\tIn recent months Western journalists who have visited the Chinese mainland have painted a glowing picture of progress and achievement. It is difficult to believe, however that a brief conducted tour to a few cities and villages in a vast land could provide any genuine insight into the real conditions of the country. The Chinese people arc too well experienced in the ways of the world to reveal their true feelings to an outsider. Yet it is possible to get glimpses of the real situation from some of the dispatches. Not a few correspondents, for example, have written admiringly about the wonderful discipline of the common people. Some have reported the existence of a new species of human being on the Chinese mainland the \u201cMaoist men\u201d-austere, self- controlled, all dressed in the same drab clothing, all relating their every activity to the thought of Mao Tse-tung, all shouting the same slogans, all vowing undying fealty to Chairman Mao. What all this amounts to is that, by means of terror and ruthless regimentation, the masses of the people have been reduced to the level of robots, apparently with no will or mind of their own.\n18.\tYet it would be a grave mistake to view them as nothing but robots. They conform because conformity is the only way to survive in a world in which life is regulated by harsh decrees, intimidating exhortations, punishment without crime. But below the surface of seeming docility, there is a boiling and ultimately irrepressible mass of resentments and suicidal despairs. No one should give them up as irretrievably lost to the Mao regime. Despite Communist news black-out, bloody anti-Communist and anti-Mao uprisings are still going on in many parts of the mainland.\n19.\tNothing is more indicative of the people's profound opposition to the Communist regime than the floods of refugees who have fled, and continue to flee, the mainland. They number in the millions. Today, the border between mainland China and the outside world is closely guarded by army and militia patrols. Yet thousands have daily risked death to escape Communist tyranny. It is estimated that in the first eight months of this year, 12,500 to 15,000 made good their escape. Most of them have done so by swimming, spending up to 10 hours in the water, usually at night, and covering four to six miles. This was reported in The New York Times on 12 September 1971. Clearly, only hatred and revulsion of the first order can account for their decision to leave behind their loved ones, friends and possessions for the uncertainties of life in an inhospitable world.\n20.\tIf the Communist regime and the Chinese people are mutually hostile entities, it follows that the Communist regime cannot possibly represent the Chinese people in the international community. It is thus ridiculous to assert that to bar the Communist regime from the United Nations is to deny 700 million people, a quarter of the world's population, of their representation.\n21.\tThis brings me to the second point I wish to make, namely, that the Chinese Communist Party, whose total membership represents only about 2 per cent of the population, is torn by dissension and factional strife, and that it faces an uncertain future, As is well known, during the Cultural Revolution, the Party apparatus was completely demolished and hundreds of thousands of Party members were subjected to all kinds of indignity and inhuman treatment. Many of them have since been purged. Chou En-lai, in an interview with Arab newsmen in May of\n \nthis year, said that the number of Communists who had been purged in the Cultural Revolution amounted to about 1 per cent of a total of 17 million, that is, 170,000. In the same breath, however, he added:\n\u201cThere are still Communists whose problems have not been solved. We are conducting direct investigations with them. They amount to about 50 per cent of the Party membership.\\\"\\\"\nIn other words, the loyalty of no less than 8.5 million Party members is still in doubt. Obviously, something must be basically wrong with the Chinese Communist Party. It seems that the cancer cf fear is gnawing at its vitals. Leaders are suspicious of one another, suspicious of the rank and file. The rank and file live precariously under the whip-lash of their superiors and at the mercy of lick-spittles and informers among their own comrades. It is not surprising that in recent weeks so much speculation should have centered on the cancellation of the customary 1 October military parade and on other developments on the mainland. There is every reason to believe that a new and serious power struggle is braiding up within the Maoist ranks. The schism within the Communist Party militates against the regime's ability to stabilize itself and consolidate control.\n22.\tThe third point I wish to make is that the world should never mistake Peiping's tactical zigzag for a basic change of policy. The cold fact is that both in words and in deeds the regime remains what it has always been oppressive at home and aggressive abroad.\n23.\tIt is easy to understand why Peiping's change of style has been received with so much fanfare and enthusiasm. Weariness with recurrent crises and fear of nuclear holocaust have engendered in the minds of men a yearning for normality and a craving for world-wide detente. They are conditioned to accept Peiping's gestures of goodwill at face value.\n24.\tIt seems to my delegation, however, that this is a dangerous delusion. There is nothing to suggest that the Chinese Communist regime is ready to give up its policy of world domination. It continues to promote the violence of war; it continues to make a fetish of force. It continues to foment armed insurrection in neighboring countries. It continues to supply arms and ammunition to rebel bands in Thailand, Burma, Malaysia and Indonesia. It continues to train, equip and finance guerillas on a global scale. Rhetoric and friendly gestures notwithstanding, there is no evidence that the regime now intends to pursue a course of action consistent with the United Nations Charter. Indeed, all signs point the other way.\n25.\tThe quest for international peace and security is, and will continue to be, the dominating purpose of our age. It is to the Governments represented here that the peoples of the world look for the peace and security that they so desperately long for. So, let us whole-heartedly pledge ourselves to the noble and challenging task of translating the ideals and goals of the Charter into reality. Let us hope that this great international body will remain steadfast and true to the purposes and principles for which it was founded. Let us hope that the Assembly will refuse to subject itself to the humiliation of bowing before force. As \nthe Organization enters the second quarter-century of its existence, let us remind ourselves that the road to peace is indeed tortuous and long, and that lasting peace will come only when it is built, not on the quicksand of expediency and appeasement, but on the rock of moral strength.\n\n\n\n\n"

At the historic twenty-fifth session his presidency was a very positive element in  our Organization. He made a very important contribution to the celebration of the anniversary when we drew up a balance of our efforts for peace, justice and progress as well as an examination of our conscience for future action.\n58.\tI avail myself of this opportunity to renew to SecretaryGeneral U Thant the gratitude of my Government for his immense work in favor of peace end the progress of peoples.\n59.\tWe are convinced that the major problems facing our leaders today are those of peace and security, of decolonization and apartheid, of disarmament and international cooperation. The future of coming generations is closely corner ;d with the solutions which our generation will find for these problems which face us today. It is for our respective States, independent and sovereign as they are, to shape the future, the basis of which can only be the legitimate aspirations of our people.\n60.\tBut we cannot deny today primary responsibility of the United Nations for the action of a future world where peace, the recognition of fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the human person and the constant search for economic, social and cultural progress must necessarily be the conditions for harmonious relations among men.\n61.\tFor this difficult task, I can assure you that the Upper Volta and its people are constantly mobilized and will make every possible contribution.\n62.\tWe celebrated last year the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and at the same time the twenty- fifth anniversary of the United Nations. This year, while celebrating the international year against racism and racial discrimination, we inaugurate at the same time the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n63.\tEach of these opportunities allows the United Nations to draw up a balance of its efforts in the field of decolonization, its action in favor of equality among men without, distinction as to race and, finally, its contribution to the economic, and social development of peoples. These various occasions have made it possible for us to halt for a moment so as to examine the process leading to peace.\n64.\tTaking the floor for the first time in this Assembly, I have an opportunity to point out to the Assembly the present state of the process on which my country has been embarked for more than five years. Upper Volta at the beginning of this year entered a new phase of its political life, according to the freely expressed wishes of its people. I will say that there is nothing strange in this. We are at a time of great change. The life and welfare of peoples require continuous adaptation to the realities of our time, and the responsibility of governments towards the future of their peoples is considerable. Furthermore, the coming of a new regime in my country was foreseen for a long time. We only had to establish the type of regime and the practical modalities of it.\n65.\tThe population decided, by adopting a constitution on 14 June 1970, to choose a democratic and parliamentary regime based upon the principle of devotion to the nation.\n66.\tThe new Government, formed as a function of the object ;e realities which are the electoral results, undertook the task of national reconstruction entrusted to it by the people and drew up a plan for economic, social and cultural development, a plan drawn up with a general orientation and general objectives, and this will be effective at the beginning of 1972 and will be immediately put into action, since every provision has been made.\n67.\tConcerning the financing of this plan, we count upon exploiting public and national resources to the maximum and we favor the participation of the private sector by practical measures of encouragement and promotion. Our code of investment is very liberal and shows that we are issuing an appeal to businessmen.\n68.\tIt goes without saying that we shall also make an appeal for external financing (United Nations Development program, the European Development Fund, the Fonds d'aide et de cooperation, and other sources of financing). We shall seek loans from the specialized agencies, especially from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association. In 3 word, we have decided to follow the road of development, which will make Upper Volta a society where justice and liberty will prevail.\n69.\tThe Declaration we adopted here last year on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the TTnited Nations [resolution 2627 (XXV)] said, inter alia:\n\\\"Despite the achievements of the United Nations, a grave situation of insecurity still confronts the Organization and armed conflicts occur in various parts of the world, while at the same time the arms race and arms expenditure continue and a large part of humanity is suffering from economic underdevelopment,\\\"\n70.\tIn another document [resolution 2621 (XXV)] we declared that:\n\\\"... the further continuation of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations [is] a crime which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations, the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the principles of international law.\\\"\n71.\tTo those two fundamental statements I would add that a Member State of this Organization, namely, South Africa, practices in its territory apartheid, a system universally condemned which constitutes a shame in our time.\n72.\tToday I can unfortunately make the same remarks, and no doubt next year at the same time we shall still be right where we are now. How strange our times are, when truth is denied and the spirit of solidarity, tolerance, peace, justice and concord is almost absent!\n73.\tYet; in view of the historical circumstances in which we live and in view of the current problems of our time all of which are equally grave we have no possibility other than to cooperate so as to build peace, to bridge the gap which separates the rich and the poor countries and to see to it that the color of the skin, religion and other considerations should no longer be barriers between men.\n74.\tIn order to do that, each State Member of this Organization must make every effort possible and accept a certain part of responsibility; together we must feel collective responsibility and act accordingly. However, I must note with bitterness that the state of mind of certain political leaders is still quite different.\n75.\tThus, more than 10 years after the adoption by this Organization of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)}  a decision which was an act of faith and a solemn commitment to the colonized peoples some States, such as Portugal, continue their domination over Territories and peoples whose only wish !s quite rightly to run their own affairs.\n76.\tThis Organization has requested the Portuguese Government on several occasions to revise its policy by applying without delay to the peoples in the Territories under its domination the principle of self-determination and independence in conformity with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and other pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Last year our Assembly, in its resolution 2707 (XXV), once again asked the Government of Portugal to cease forthwith all acts of repression against the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) and to withdraw all military and other forces employed for this purpose. Since those appeals have hardly been heeded, we must note the inability of the United Nations to meet the challenge of the Government of Portugal for many years. It is true that Portugal is encouraged in its negative attitude by the substantial assistance of its allies of NATO and by all those who contribute to the shameful exploitation of the Territories under its domination. It is therefore not surprising that the holding of the Ministerial Meeting of the North Atlantic Council held in Lisbon last June should be considered as a provocation by all Africans.\n77.\tIn those conditions, Upper Volta cannot but encourage the liberation movements to pursue their struggle to the end, that is, to independence. We shall continue to give them the material and moral assistance which they need; at the same time we issue an appeal to all States to abstain from giving any assistance to Portugal and in particular to discourage their nationals and the financial groups of their countries from participating in the construction of the Cabora Bassa dam, as well as other similar colonialist projects.\n78.\tFollowing the invasion of the territory of the Republic of Guinea on 22 and 23 November 1970, an invasion whose motivations and origins were duly noted by a special mission, the Security Council adopted resolution 290 (1970) of 8 December 1970, which\n\\\"Solemnly warns the Government of Portugal that in the event of any repetition of armed attacks against independent African States, the Security Council shall immediately consider appropriate effective steps or measures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations\\\".\nSuch attacks have occurred again against the Republic of Senegal, and no serious measure has been taken to persuade Portugal to desist. We must do everything possible to prevent Portugal from harming Africa by obliging that country to grant immediate independence to the African Territories under its domination. Those Territories are first and foremost African Territories; they are not Portuguese Territories.\n79.\tIn regard to Southern Rhodesia, we must note again that the sanctions adopted by the Security Council have not put an end to the illegal and racist regime of Ian Smith; moreover, we know that that failure is essentially caused by the support which that regime continues to receive from South Africa, Portugal and other countries, in violation of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council; it is also caused by the strange passivity of the United Kingdom.\n80.\tFor us, the solution of the Rhodesian problem lies in the overthrow of the illegal regime at present there, followed* by the transfer of power to the majority, which has never advocated throwing out the whites, because they also are African.\n81.\tTo bring about that transfer, it is necessary for the Government of the United Kingdom as the administering Power to put an end to the rebellion of the white settlers of Rhodesia. In any case, the struggle that the people of Zimbabwe are conducting for their freedom is a legitimate\n3 Security Council Special Mission to the Republic of Guinea established under resolution 289 (1970).\n7\nstruggle and it should have the material and moral support of all peace-loving States.\n82.\tWith regard to Namibia, the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 21 June 1971  places the problem and the responsibilities in the proper perspective: the continued presence of South Africa in that African land is illegal; South Africa is duty bound immediately to withdraw its administration from Namibia; States Members of the United Nations are also duty bound to recognize the illegality of the presence of South Africa in Namibia, whereas nonMember States must assist in the action undertaken by the United Nations.\n83.\tAs far as we are concerned, we feel that it now falls to the Security Council to take the appropriate measures in this matter in the light of the opinion of the International Court of Justice, measures which would put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. That is the object of the suggestion made by the President of Mauritania, Mr. Ould Daddah, when he spoke yesterday at the 1583rd meeting of the Security Council in his capacity as Chairman of the eighth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity.\n84.\tSouth Africa continues to practice its policy of apartheid, a system universally condemned. Need I repeat that that region of Africa has become an immense prison for its true inhabitants? Voices have been raised to say that mankind would be able to put an end to the scourge that is apartheid if a dialog were to begin between the African countries and the racist authorities of Pretoria,\n85.\tWe sincerely believe that we must face certain truths so as not to cheat the international community.\n86.\tUpper Volta, both in the United Nations and in the OAU, has always spoken out against any form of government based on color; we have always affirmed our unfailing attachment to the principle of equality among men, without distinctions of color or religion.\n87.\tMy country has often condemned recourse to violence as a means of resolving conflicts, and oppression as a form of government. However, we think that if there is to be a dialog it must be begun between the authorities of Pretoria and the blacks of South Africa, who are after all those most concerned. The duty of Africans today is certainly not to negotiate to the detriment of those who suffer under the regime of apartheid.\n88.\tWe sincerely desire and seek the restoration of the dignity of man in that part of Africa. To achieve that end, all Members of this Organization should conform to the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council concerning apartheid. The international community must pursue and intensify its policy of harassment against the champions of apartheid. We think that States which strengthen South Africa by selling it arms in violation of Security Council resolutions 181 (1963) and 191 (1964)are not contributing to the solution of the problem of apartheid. Foreign investments, which need cheap manpower provided by the system of apartheid, contribute to perpetuating that system.\n89. Apartheid is a challenge not only to our times but also to our conscience, and we must meet it before it is too late.\n90* As can be seen, Africa is facing the evils of our times, namely, aggression, colonial domination, apartheid and racial discrimination. Thus we. seize this opportunity to recall that the Heads of State of the OAU have called upon this Assembly to recommend a special session of the Security Council in an African country during 1972a session which would be devoted to measures to be taken so as to implement the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly on decolonization, the struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination in Africa.\n91.\tI should like to make a few observations concerning other burning questions of the moment, but first, I must emphasize the positive fact that the journey to Peking by the President of the United States, Mr. Richard Nixon, has been announced. The psychological effect which this historic journey will have on the great political problems of the day cannot be denied, and we must go beyond certain ideas and admit that the bipolar world today has been changed. This could not be other than a good thing because the experience of a quarter of a century has shown us how bad the policy of political blocs is.\n92.\tMistrust of others is slackening. It may be possible to find a solution to the disarmament problem, for the armaments race is still a sad reality; the feeling which the developing countries have when they see billions swallowed up every year in the armaments race can only be one of sadness, and Raoul Follereau, that apostle of charity, was right when he said: \\\"One day of war for peace.\\\"\n93.\tObviously, we shall be told that negotiations are under way between the principal protagonists which may lead to measures of disarmament. It is obvious that if these measures are to disarm others, then we shall not have made any progress; the trade in armaments has always flourished and flourishes even more today.\n94* What we want is general and complete disarmament. We know it is a very complex problem, but it is necessary for the great Powers, who hold the most perfected armaments, to find a solution to this problem.\n95.\tOn the other hand, it is generally recognized that the question of disarmament is of vital importance for the future of humanity; that is why we must ask ourselves, as the SecretaryGeneral mentioned in paragraph 48 of the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8401/Add.l], whether the United NaUons should not be officially informed of the progress of the negotiations on the limitation of armaments.\n96.\tIn spite of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, the situation remains very tense in the Near East, On several occasions blood has been shod In that region, and worse may happen at any moment. We condemn this escalation of violence which will lead to no solution. It is not realistic to challenge the existence of a State, whatever it may be, because the appropriation of territories by force constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law. Of course, it is necessary that parties should show moderation and cooperate sincerely with the Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Gunnar Jarring, because resolution 242 (1967) of the Security Council, constitutes in my eyes the basis for a just and lasting settlement,\n97.\tThe Near East, unfortunately, does not constitute alone the only hot spot of war. The situation in SouthEast Asia has been present in pU our minds through the whole of this year. A quarter of a century of war is too much. We dare to hope with the peoples of VietNam, Cambodia and Laos that the coming trip to Peking of the President of the United States of America will allow peace to be achieved once more in that long suffering area.\n98.\tThe People's Republic of China has for a long time been kept out of our Organization, and efforts have been made to find a solution to this great world problem. In our opinion, this diplomatic isolation of a State of more than 700 million people is more harmful than beneficial to the international community.\n99.\tMy Government has on several occasions found itself obliged to vote against the admission of the People's Republic of China to this Organization because the concepts of that country in the matter of international relations according to the declarations of its leaders have been contrary to the aims and principles of the Charter.\n100.\tMy Government has declared on several occasions that it was ready to cooperate with all countries, without distinction, on the condition that those countries thoroughly understand that we are sovereign, independent, and intend to remain so.\n101.\tHas anything really changed in the People's Republic of China? If it has, Upper Volta might envisage joining those States which believe that from now on the People's Republic of China should be brought into the sphere of cooperation among nations for the benefit of the peace of the world and of the United Nations.\n102.\tHowever, it must be understood that our country, which cherishes friendship, is not among those countries which believe that it would be possible to solve the problems of the United Nations and of the world, whatever their importance, by expelling the Republic of China from this Organization.\n103.\tIn our eyes, all the principles and purposes proclaimed in the Charter are intimately linked; thus, international peace and security, the solution of the problems of colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination condition the economic and social development of our respective States. All these factors have certainly played a considerable part in the failure of the first United Nations Development Decade. Our discouragement is the greater in that we believe that not everything was done by the international community, especially the rich countries, to make it succeed. The failure cannot be attributed only to the developing countries; the lack of determination on the part of the developed countries, which normally should contribute to the success of this vast enterprise, was the main cause. For, what do we see? A national mobilization on the part of the developing countries in order to implement a policy of economic and social progress has been made to fail by obscure external forces, entirely escaping the control of the developing countries. It becomes clear that our policies of development cannot succeed if we cannot overcome these external forces. We have inherited economic structures which are not adaptable, based as they are on dependence upon the foreigner. It is not useless to recall the relations of a colonial type, with all the consequences which ensue, which we have suffered for so long.\n104.\tThe effects of this situation, which existed before our political independence, are still felt in all sections of our economy. The logical consequence of our independence must make it possible to achieve a progressive break with this type of relation. Of course, the structures that we have in view have built up sentimental links; nevertheless, we must see that there shall be no exploiters or exploited.\n105.\tWe believe, first of all, in the efforts undertaken on the regional level for integrated regional development. It has been said that a great number of those less advanced among the developing countries are to be found in Africa. This situation is no doubt due to the fact that, out of a total of 18 landlocked countries, 13 are in Africa. The geographical position of these countries constitutes a major obstacle to the development of their economy for basic reasons of which we are all aware: high cost of transportation, insufficient infrastructure, mediocre storage facilities, and so on. Of course, we feel that joint efforts in a regional sphere can rationalize development policies, particularly in Africa, and allow them to open up the landlocked countries to commercial trade. It is in this process that my country has been engaged in the regional framework of West Africa, where so many links bind us to our neighbors yet where so many possibilities have not been exploited. On the other hand, we believe that the international community must make a special effort on behalf of these less advanced developing countries so as to assist them to accelerate the rhythm of their development. Such a program could find its place in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. Roads, air and water are the irreducible trilogy of the development of Upper Volta in particular.\n106.\tAt another level, we think that the industrialized countries can contribute, with a little more goodwill and less egoist to the acceleration of the economic and social development of the developing countries. The first thing which comes to mind when we think of the contribution of the industrialized countries to the development of the poor countries is the comparison which is often made between the standard of living of the rich countries and that of the developing countries. After making that comparison, a matter of desperation for poor countries, we must ask why, in a world of abundance and of scientific and technical progress, the international community is powerless to deal with the problems of underdevelopment.\n107.\tWe have often enough said that the gap has not ceased to widen between the rich and the poor countries;\nwe must now ask ourselves objectively why that gap cannot be filled, why adequate measures cannot be found.\n108.\tThe rich countries should not be deceived: they will never be able to go back and find the historic situations that favored their development. The colonial system which favored the economic expansion of certain among them is today a concept that is out of date, and its vestiges, in Africa and elsewhere, cannot solve the problems of States, such as Portugal, which still practice it, for it cannot resist the test of time, just as today, no country can profit economically from a generalized war the way certain States did during the Second World War.\n109.\tThus, these industrialized countries must discard the idea that they can live and prosper indefinitely while deliberately disregarding the wretchedness of the poor countries. The recent disturbance of the world monetary balance and the feeling of insecurity that followed thereon show to what extent disparity in progress among States, together with national selfishness, can represent a source of tension and discord.\n110.\tThat is what we must fear between the poor and the rich countries in the very near future, if the present trend continues.\n111.\tWe must recognize, however, and we must appreciate the efforts made by certain States and international institutions to assist the developing countries. And here I wish to pay tribute to all the States and institutions such as the European Economic Community and the United Nations Development program that contributing to the economic, social and cultural development of my country, complementing most effectively our own national effort. We must express our great appreciation and satisfaction for the assistance rendered by the French Republic to Upper Volta and the developing countries in general, in as much as that country devotes 1 per cent of its national income to assistance in general. There is one aspect of the assistance policy that I would like to bring up here. Generally, States are asked to participate, to the extent of about 25 per cent of the cost of the projects, in the financing of projects. Now obviously, we have no intention of challenging the principle of that participation, which symbolizes the desire for cooperation among States. We think, however, that, in view of the scope and the cost of certain vital projects, such participation becomes extremely burdensome for underdeveloped countries which cannot afford the cost because of the low level of their income.\n112.\tIf this system favors certain developing countries which can thus draw full benefit from international assistance, it inevitably penalizes the less favored among them by holding back their investments. It thus would be desirable if a more flexible formula could be found, for both bilateral and multilateral actions, so that assistance might attain its true significance.\n113.\tThis then is the modest contribution my delegation wished to make in the general debate at this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n114.\tI have drawn the attention of this Assembly to the grave questions of the hour which concern us all and which endanger peace. Their solution depends upon the devotion of each of us to rigorous respect for the principles enunciated in the Charter, in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect. Although I cannot cherish any hope of seeing these problems resolved during the course of this session, I at least can hope that a new spirit will emerge from our Assembly, a ray of hope for a better world.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The Government of Ecuador wishes to extend congratulations to the man who has been chosen to preside over this important session of the General Assembly. His great gifts, his personality and all the human qualities he possesses are a true guarantee that the General Assembly will be under efficient leadership.\n119.\tI also wish to pay a respectful tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Edward Hambro.\n120.\tWe have been concerned about the irrevocable decision of the Secretary-General to retire from his office at the end of his present term. Until a few days ago we still nurtured the hope that perhaps he might reconsider his position and continue to lend his valuable services to the international community. From this rostrum the Government of Ecuador wishes to state publicly its gratitude to U Thant for the dedication, sincerity, efficiency and ability with which he has worked during the 10 years in which he has occupied the difficult and complex post of Secretary- General of the United Nations. The conduct of U Thant will be a permanent inspiration to all of us and an example to his successor.\n121.\tThe Government of Ecuador is very happy to welcome the three States which have entered our Organization this year. The contribution of Bhutan will be as wholesome, pure and invigorating as the air in its territory, and together with the age-old culture of Bahrain and Qatar, they will doubtless enrich the United Nations. We look with satisfaction upon each step we take on the way to universality, but we also hope that, together with the horizontal growth of the United Nations, this Organization will also become more thorough and effective in its role of maintaining international peace and security and of defending justice.\n122.\tThe Government of Ecuador, representing its people, comes to this new meeting of the world Organization with renewed optimism with faith in the action of the United Nations and with a firm desire to co-operate in the success of this session of the Assembly. But this optimism of the Ecuadorian delegation, which I have the honor to lead, in no way lessens the sincerity or frankness of our deep conviction -since nothing done by man is perfect-that we must endeavor to strengthen the Organization still more than we have done so far.\n123.\tThe United Nations is not and cannot be merely a place where statesmen and politicians debate the great problems relating to peace and the progress of peoples. Besides this precise and necessary clarification of ideas, judgments and attitudes, we must seek to give life to the objectives and work of the Organization, so that the member nations constituting it will find the true and real road to peace, and that each of us according to his true capacities will contribute to the imperative task of achieving for mankind the fulfillment of its destiny and of all its possibilities. The same struggles which are today unleashed on the earth, opposing groups and individuals politically, ideologically and materially, are, in my view, nothing but the sometimes hopeful, sometimes hopeless search for a better future for mankind and for all national communities.\n124.\tThe United Nations is responsible for seeking the way to increasingly great and tangible peace, social justice and progress for all peoples. There is violent upheaval in the world today and our duty is to find the main causes of this violence. If we endeavor with dedication to find true peace and to put an end to the injustices of today, we shall then have found new pillars with which to replace those that are already obsolete.\n125.\tThere is no possible peace, and there can be no possible peace, without economic welfare. New problems beset us today and still the old ones persist. By the same token, we still hear of political and economic crises, and to solve them properly we must face them, meet their challenge, study them in the light of the social and economic position of the various human conglomerates, make the rich nations aware of their duty to help the developing ones and endeavor to ensure co-operation in those fields where it can be most effective.\n126.\tTo strengthen the legal system of the United Nations, to discharge its function of maintaining international peace and security has always been the decision of the Ecuadorian Government. Once again my country wishes to state its unswerving support for the purposes and principles that gave birth to our Organization.\n127.\tBecause of its love for the law and its vocation for justice, Ecuador has always advocated peaceful settlements to all international disputes. Indeed, we cannot speak of the effective and practical existence of international law while problems still pending between certain of our peoples are not solved in a spirit of equity and justice. The programs of integration to which a number of countries of the American continent have turned their efforts, by making them jointly confront the dangerous threats of underdevelopment, also make it more imperative than ever, that any differences that may separate them should be peacefully settled.\n128.\tNow that the United Nations has reached adulthood and entered its second 25 years, the Government of Ecuador must warn Member States of the danger of living on illusions. Neither individuals nor States, nor international organizations can act or be useful if the bases for their action and their actions themselves are not born of true and real facts. Relative reality and truth make all Members of the Organization equally sovereign before international law, but within the Organization there is no real equality nor real equality of rights among its Members. Therefore, ironically, it has been asserted that \\\"some States are more equal than others\\\".\n129.\tThe United Nations Charter incorporated a very old customary rule and gave a predominant role to the great Powers in the maintenance of international peace and security.\n130.\tIt is true that it is not humanly possible to make all men equal, in order to establish a single identity and with it absolute equality. There will always be the bigger, the stronger, the healthier and-thus far-the wealthier. Among States it appears that there will also always be the greater, the more powerful, the more developed, and thus the true inequalities will still exist between men of some States, i.e. the developed and the super-developed States, and those of other States, the under-developed States. But these qualities of predominance, of privilege-the great Powers are organs privileged to exercise international law-then impose upon those same great Powers, if they truly wish to justify their privileges to the world, to themselves and to history, fundamental duties towards other States and the international community as a whole. And it is here that the Government of Ecuador wishes to advise that, just as titles of nobility became obsolete and anachronistic when the nobles no longer justified the privileges they enjoyed by their services to the community, so, too, the great Powers will not be able to justify the privileged position they enjoy in a community organized for peace-and I do not refer only to the veto and to the monopoly of atomic power- unless they give up, in some way at least, their hegemonic ambitions, the desire to ensure that their interests are paramount, the obsession-an expression of intolerance-of imposing their ideologies, and unless they assume the preeminent role which due to their legitimate role which we have allowed them and by virtue of which we are gathered in this Assembly they have in the maintenance of international peace and security, the encouragement of friendship among nations and in the solution of the economic-social problems on the basis of international co-operation. Therefore, it is not the States that appear to be acting but the great Powers themselves, and let us admit this clearly, that are responsible for wars and the different and varied \\\"short of war\\\" measures which, like the colors of the rainbow, now extend between the state of peace and the state of war: determining states that did not exist when people and their relations were less sophisticated. We must therefore tell the great Powers of their duties and remind them that war only exists because of them, because they do not carry out the measures to save men from the scourge of war entrusted to them in 1945 by the peoples that wished to live in peace as good neighbors in a world with united nations.\n131.\tWithin this line of reasoning and to whatever extent the great Powers of all ideological colors may listen to the voice and heed the vote of the small nations, so the Government of Ecuador considers it an imperative duty of international ethics to say that the continuation of the non-recognition of the right of the People's Republic of China to represent China in the United Nations, that is to say, in the Security Council and in all the other principal and subsidiary organs of the Organization, is creating an international situation that may lead to breaches of international peace and security, that must be settled at the present session of the General Assembly, which is the body that must bear in mind the realities of the parties to this question.\n132.\tAnother matter that seriously disturbs my delegation is the conflict in the Middle East. This is a delicate and complex matter which calls for the most careful attention of the world Organization. My country considers that a solution should be found taking into account all the facets of the problem, dealing with it with equity, with justice, without allowing hatred and prejudice to distort reality or upset the law. Therefore anything, like what I have just indicated, that would be conducive to the establishment in the Middle East of a realistic basis for a lasting peace will be supported by us. An effective method would be the holding of talks, on an equal footing, among the parties concerned, for we believe that that would be an effective way of guaranteeing peace.\n133.\tIn any case, we believe that Israel has the right to its existence, and that the United Nations Charter itself according to the principles that inspired it, and its very spirit must surely contain a solution. This is the desire of the people and Governments of Ecuador, a people and a country which, as I have said before, has always given its unswerving support to the principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes.\n134.\tThe exclusive use for peaceful purposes of the sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction was an initiative first taken by the delegation of Malta during the twenty-second regular session of the General Assembly. The illusion was then widespread that the ocean might yield the greatest mineral resources whose future exploitation might counteract the danger of the reduction, and even the exhaustion, of existing reserves in the earth's subsoil, reserves that are constantly being drained by the geometrical progression in the world's population. But what we must point out is that what was originally intended to meet the dire needs of mankind was first taken advantage of by the great Powers to challenge the sovereign rights of the small nations.\n135.\tHere I wish to ratify and reaffirm the views that my country shares with many countries of America and of the world: the right of all coastal States to establish the limits of their sovereignty or maritime jurisdiction in accordance with reasonable criteria, bearing in mind the geographic, geological and ecological characteristics and the need to ensure a rational utilization of its resources.\n136.\tThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, now enlarged to 86 members, is at present examining all problems of the ocean area in order to submit them in due course to a world conference on the law of the sea. The fundamental, and therefore priority problem that is to be tackled by that Conference is that of establishing the international regime for the peaceful uses of the marine and oceanic resources and of the subsoil thereof beyond national jurisdiction and, also obviously, the machinery to govern it. From among the principles contained in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV), on which the regime to be established must be based, great importance must be attached to the principle that the resources of that international zone shall be the common heritage of mankind. The working paper submitted on this subject to the Committee by a group of Latin American States [AI8421, annex I, sect. 8J views the application of .that principle from the standpoint of the developing nations, rejecting the traditional concept of licenses and royalties-which have produced such evil results in the exploitation of the natural resources of the economically weak countries and endowing the international authority to be created* with full powers to carry out scientific investigations as well as in relation to the preservation, exploration and exploitation of the zone, either directly or in association with natural or juridical persons, with which joint enterprises can be created or whose services can be engaged. This will also make it possible to ensure a wide dissemination and constant preparation by all countries without exception so as to organize a rational exploitation of the resources which will permit an equitable distribution of the financial benefits as well as all other advantages that may be derived from their exploitation,\n137.\tI must repeat the unshakable position of my Government that the planned conference on the law of the sea can only be convened to tackle all the problems of the ocean area that are \\\"closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole\\\" [resolution 2750 C (XXV)], Ecuador will never agree to an international meeting to consider partial aspects in which the well-known political and economic interests of the great Powers will play the major role.\n138.\tMy delegation considers that any form of racial discrimination is a violation of the most elementary sense of justice. It is absurd and scandalous that, so late into the twentieth century, when science and technology offer mankind the prodigies of their achievements, when the contemporary world seeks ways and means of raising the standard of living of all men because all individuals have the right to the elementary goods of the earth, we still differentiate between human beings either became of the color their skin or their religion or the philosophical criteria they obey. Furthermore, peace will always be threatened if we allow discrimination, this source of discord which is repulsive to conscience, to continue.\n139.\tIn the light of what I have said, my Government supports the application of the measures on the question of Namibia agreed to by the General Assembly and the Security Council. Similarly, Ecuador considers that the legal situation of the Territories under Portuguese administration falls within the scope of the principles of Article 73 of the Charter.\n140.\tMy country enjoys cordial relations with all countries, but when we tackle problems of the kind I have just defined we cannot subordinate to our friendship towards them, the imperative postulates which must guide our international life.\n141.\tA subject very often discussed because the whole future of mankind hinges upon it is that of disarmament.\n142.\tUnfortunately there has been and there is no genuine international justice of the different levels at which relations among nations exist. While this continues the old aspirations of society and mankind to achieve a state of peace and security-to survive or to see ourselves wiped out in the conflagration of an atomic war will not be fulfilled. The Government of Ecuador feels therefore that firstly States must be made to realize the imperative need to establish international justice which is ensured and made possible by disarmament. Obviously this is so complex a subject that thus far no final definition has been found and it is for this reason that we believe it indispensable that the long and difficult road be followed in stages, beginning with the limitation and ending with the complete suppression of arms at some, as yet, unforeseen time. Therefore the signing of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America  could well be considered an auspicious historic precedent .\n143.\tDisarmament can only be the result of serious and well-pondered acts of security and mutual confidence, which will allow the objectives to be attained. It must be preceded by the establishment of positive procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes and effective and practical provisions for the preservation of peace. A type of common denominator would be the readiness of human minds and thought, to appreciate v.^at is meant by the establishment of international security that precious peace which will assist us to create a single society living without conflicts.\n144.\tLike a light in the mists that so often cover the horizon of international life, we have heard with great satisfaction of the talks held in Berlin by the four occupying Powers, which arrived at successful conclusions which will not only contribute in all aspects to the life of that city and determine its future, but will, to a certain extent, also facilitate negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and be of promise to general peace. My Government considers the negotiations carried out on this very complex question a most excellent omen. We believe that it is a clear and obvious example of how satisfactory and honorable concisions can be arrived at if, in the minds and conscience of those who analyze, discuss and solve these problems, there lies a deep desire for equity, for justice and goodwill. The negotiations in Berlin may well be a magnificent precedent in a world that swings between peace and war and in which twentieth-century man is still beset by political and social contradictions. Peace is one and indivisible; a question that is tackled with the true desire to study and solve it in the best possible way facilitates the consideration of other questions which may give rise to world problems and difficulties. Perhaps they might also catch this spirit and desire, hereby helping us to achieve a solution to all conflicts. Then, perhaps, man will be able to enjoy all the benefits of a stable and truly lasting peace.\n145.\tMy Government is gratified at the progress achieved in the problem of Berlin. I pray that this agreement will aid in the negotiation and solution of other problems. Mankind daily calls for justice and peace. No problem is insoluble if it is dealt with properly.\n146.\tIf, before, we lamented and were moved by the tragedy of Biafra, without going into the aspects of that issue, today, too, we would want the events that have occurred of late on the India-Pakistan frontier and which might carry the world to a dangerous and grave state of conflagration, to be solved in a way that will evince a desire for justice within the framework of respect for law and equity. But, we regret and must protest against the massacres in East Pakistan which are a violation of the sacred nature of human life for political reasons and show contempt for the condition and the very dignity of the human species.\n147.\tMy Government has been especially concerned about the measures recently applied throughout the world concerning monetary, financial and commercial questions. They are in open opposition to the concrete agreements reached by a number of international bodies dealing with trade and development. In this regard my country insists upon the ineluctable need to ensure full respect for the status quo in business and insists that tariffs barriers that oppose the trade of the developing countries be eliminated or progressively reduced. We must insist that, not later than the present year, the generalized system of preferences be applied by all the developed countries.\n148.\tThe Ecuadorian Government views with alarm the recent adoption of economic measures by the United States of America. Apart from having a bearing on important branches of our foreign trade, these measures may unleash a series of restrictions on the part of other developed countries also affected by them, thus creating a situation which would only prejudice the developing countries. Therefore we call on the international community to re-establish previous conditions to avoid unforeseeable maladjustments in international trade and in the economies of our countries.\n149.\tThe Government of Ecuador considers the General Assembly to be the forum that is most appropriate for launching an appeal to the international community to participate with technology and capital in the opportunities of investment and work created by the discovery in Ecuador of one of the richest reserves of oil, together with the functioning of the zone of Andean integration, which grants Ecuador comparatively favorable treatment and in which we enjoy a privileged geographical position.\n150.\tIn fact, Ecuador, as a country that is relatively the least economically developed of the subregional group of the Andes, benefits from a special regime which will allow it to achieve a speedier rate of development through effective and immediate participation in the benefits derived from the sectoral plans for industrial development, as well as in the program for the liberalization of trade.\n151.\tFurthermore, investments for the exploitation of the oil resources of our country have already produced a considerable impact on the national economy, whose rate of growth in a few months, when we have started our regular exports of oil and instituted our next five-year development plan, will arrive at annual rates under which the per capita income might rise by 10 per cent.\n152.\tWe must prepare ourselves for this, by ensuring that we are able to meet the great demand that our economic development will require. It is national policy to see that the exploitation of a non-renewable resource, such as oil, will not, as a sole result, show an increase in the demand for consumer goods due to the new purchasing power of the population, but rather that the wealth be channeled by the creation of favorable conditions for the establishment of new and permanent sources of production and work in the agricultural and industrial sectors as well as the services needed to satisfy the changes in structure and volume of the demand.\n153.\tWe are convinced that this transformation, by its very magnitude and the speed with which it must be carried out, will bring with it a need to complement the available national resources with those that can be given us in the flow of capital and technology from the developed countries, and by mer of other nations, ready to transfer their industrial and agricultural experience to a country that opens its frontiers and the hearts of its inhabitants to those who wish to join us in our efforts to develop.\n154.\tWe emphatically state that foreign investment is welcome in our country, as long as it fits into the framework of absolute respect for the laws, the dignity and the national sovereignty of our country, and we shall guarantee such capital investment in the best way possible. We want this investment to be democratized, in other words, broadly based. We believe that our country, because of its economic situation, offers unique opportunities to many small and medium-sized foreign businesses and investors who may wish to become associated, with Ecuadorian men and capital in national enterprises. We are sure that this association will not only improve the means of production but will also speed up the modernization of the country and eliminate the inherent problems of traditional foreign investment.\n155.\tOn this premise of respect for the expert and the foreign investor, we offer to expend much effort in our search for formulas that will allow for foreign co-participation in our economy within the existing institutional and legal systems and the framework established by the regional and subregional agreements to which Ecuador has committed itself.\n156.\tThe task confronting us all at the present session of the General Assembly is both arduous and complex. We confidently trust that the resolutions which the Committees may submit and which will be analyzed by the General Assembly will lead to positive achievements.\n157.\tThe world seeks confidence and peace; it is tired of the misleading and repetitious siren's song, of speeches which promise but prove to be nothing but voiced theory. As the twentieth century draws to its close, the social and economic problems become more acute and, in strange contrast with the progress of technology, two thirds of the population of the world is still hungry and homeless. What do we, the men of today, do to redress this? Have we done our duty? Are we doing our duty? The generation gap, of which so much is made by sociologists, this uncontainable rebellion of youth, the crisis in the churches which, until a few years ago, were immutable because of the very immutability of their foundations, the terror of the people of the world for today, and even more so for tomorrow, all this tells us that we have wasted much of our time, that We have squandered to little purpose mountains of paper and rivers of ink in planning and promising, but have done little to make social justice more than an unfulfilled promise or words of pious consolation when we could take the redeeming action that will bridge the gaps that separate class from class and citizen from citizen. Today in this world there is still much pain, much political and social injustice, much discrimination, many subjected peoples, much ignorance and much poverty. This is not a favorable balance. But, gentlemen, if we all statesmen, Governments and citizens of all nations understand our duty, there is still time.\n158.\tLet us then, gentlemen, not forget that although we are representatives of our respective Governments, we must also bring to these meetings, the sorrow and suffering of our peoples, which still trust and hope while living in the shadows of a difficult and sombre world. Let us interpret their cries; let us seek the way effectively to serve the cause of peace, without which there can be no progress for society or individuals. Let us work indefatigably to improve human conditions. Surely, these are duties we cannot shirk. Surely, these are the abiding obligations of the universal Organization. Let the energy and constancy of so many illustrious citizens of the world who have battled against prejudice and triumphed over the power of gold and sought to create a more just society, serve us as inspiration. If it be true th, I here in this general debate the various statements made have shown us the different ways of assessing the world situation and different solutions to the main problems, according to the country that spoke, it seems to me that there is an almost unanimous agreement in the determination of the most urgent and important questions, those that are important to intentional life, those that call for the common efforts of all nations to be channeled through the United Nations if they are to be solved. This will, to a large extent, facilitate the work of the world Organization, which is responsive to the cries of all peoples, because the suicidal attitude of indifference is the one that truly generates later difficulties and flaming conflicts.\n159.\tMay I conclude my statement by expressing my personal belief that despite the formidable economic problems confronting us as a society and as individuals, our most important need today is spiritual. If we neglect this aspect of life, the political and social situations may well explode, making all our efforts to change them or control them vain.\n160.\tLife is constituted not only of material values, even though these may to a large extent regulate our lives. Life Is a period of constant self-growth, of love of beauty, good and justice, and the good, in countless cases for communities and societies, and in one word, for man, lies simply in being just and fair just towards ourselves, just towards others, just towards all nations.\n161.\tTo breathe into the minds of all peoples the mystique of the spirit is the revolutionary, but glorious, work of the man of today.\n"

        "file_text": "37.\t.-Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria I should like to congratulate you most warmly on the occasion of your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n38.\tI should like to take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General, U Thant, who for 10 years has been serving in the highest post in the world Organization. During this whole period U Thant has devoted his efforts and his talents to strengthening the prestige of the United Nations, displaying an unshakable faith in the role which the United Nations can play in the attainment of the highest aspirations of mankind towards a future of peace and co-operation among people.\n39.\tThese words through which we wish to reaffirm our deep esteem for the Secretary-General are in no way words of farewell. We wish to believe that his authority and experience will continue to be placed at the service of the community of nations.\n40.\tDebates in the United Nations are a reflection of changes, positive or negative, in the world of international politics waged by States in respect of the great problems the solution of which is expected by all the peoples of the world.\n41.\tTherefore we think that we can say that the general debate is held under the sign of a positive evolution in some areas, which this year brings us the wind of detente and improvement of the international political climate. Was not the important news that we heard this moaning of the visit of President Nixon to the Soviet Union another of those signs?\n42.\tAt the same time, the debates translate the great concern for the fact that the dynamism of this process and its repercussions in the world remain slow and uncertain.\n43.\tTherefore, it is only natural that the problems of international security and the ways and means to settle them in conformity with the political realities of the present world have dominated the debate. The desire to pass from statements of general principles and political philosophy to concrete measures aiming at improving the international situation has been expressed in the most urgent manner. The will of the international community to reach an urgent solution of the important problems and conflicts which maintain mankind in a state of tension and alarm is more categorical than ever, because these conflicts are only too numerous. Military activities in Indo-China continue. The dangerous situation in the Middle East can at any time provoke a new explosion. In other parts of the world, more especially in the eastern Mediterranean, in Africa and in Latin America, acts of overt interference or preparations for interference in the internal affairs of States are ever more numerous.\n44.\tThe war of aggression in Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos continues with the same violence. The inauguration of the present session on 21 September was accompanied by explosions caused by the most powerful bombings by United States aircraft on the territory of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam in the past three years.It is these aggressive acts, and not the official declarations which translate the genuine intentions of the United States Government which are to continue the war in Indo-China through direct aggression and Viet-Namization. The objective of this redoubling of military efforts remains, of course, the same as the one defined in 1954 by the National Security Council of the United States: \\\"The American policy consists of the search for a military victory.\\\" This objective today is much more inaccessible than it was at the time. The United States is not in a position to break the will and ability to fight of the heroic peoples of Viet-Nam and the other countries of Indo-China, who oppose foreign aggression. The latest aggressive acts of the United States can only lead to a new failure for its political and military strategy in south-east Asia, a new crisis of confidence in regard to the Washington Government, especially on the\npart of the American people and its youth, who pay a very painful price for the policy of their leaders.\n45.\tThe strategists of American policy look for a way out but they do not look for it where it is to be found in reality: the total withdrawal of American troops from Indo-China. Therefore the American leaders are looking for new possibilities in Asia, and especially in the Far East, to support their military efforts in Indo-China and their political goals within the country and in the United Nations. Washington does not conceal its satisfaction at seeing that the second visit of the adviser to President Nixon is taking place at the very moment when the United States is trying in the General Assembly to save the seat of Taiwan, immediately after the alleged elections in Saigon and the strengthening of the military activities in Viet-Nam. The United States Government is particularly appreciative of the fact that this new mission to the People's Republic of China will help to divert the attention of the public\n' opinion of the country from new manifestations and demonstrations against the Viet-Nam war.\n46.\tAs long as the United States intervention goes on in south-east Asia the Viet-Namese people, enjoying the support of socialist countries, will continue to deal heavy blows to the invaders. At the same time it continues to bend every effort for a just and realistic political solution of the conflict. The recent proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam constitute a new and constructive program for the establishment of peace in Indo-China. These proposals, supported by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and welcomed with satisfaction and hope in the world, open up new prospects for the Paris negotiations and for a political solution which would take into account the interests and feelings of all the countries concerned. It is regrettable that the United States Government should continue, through its obstructionism in Paris and through its acts in Indo-China, to deepen the conflict and doom to failure all the efforts towards a political solution of the crisis.\n47.\tThe situation in the Middle East has gone beyond tolerable limits and is incompatible with the normal and effective development of peaceful efforts aimed at liquidating the consequences of Israeli aggression. The military aggression of 1967 continues at present under the guise of occupation and political aggression, which for four years has made impossible the implementation of decisions of the Security Council. The responsibility for this situation lies exclusively with the Government of Israel.\n48.\tIn the Middle East also we are confronted with two opposing trends. On the one hand, the Arab Governments are ready to accept a political solution of the crisis, no matter who takes the initiative for it, and, on the other hand, Israel only seeks to keep the fruits of its aggression and opposes any just solution of the conflict.\n49.\tThis policy of Israel meets with increasing disapproval on the part of world public opinion, which sees in it an intolerable defiance of the most elementary principles of international law and justice.\n50.\tIsrael is perfectly aware of this state of affairs and tries to conceal its opposition to measures aimed at the\nrestoration of peace and security in the Middle East. The statement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel in the General Assembly (1946th meeting] was a new proof of this. Mr. Eban generously stated that there were several roads leading to peace; but where do the roads suggested by the Israeli Minister lead? To the illegal consecration of the consequences of aggression and, therefore, new conflicts and war. Only the road leading truly to peace and stability escaped his attention: I have in mind the total implementation of resolution 242 (1967) of the Security Council and its main provision, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from occupied Arab territories.\n51. On the other hand, the constructive position of the Arab countries, and especially of Egypt, has created propitious conditions for the political solution of the crisis in the Middle East on the basis of total implementation of the Security Council resolution. The Egyptian Government has declared its readiness to conclude a peace treaty with Israel on this basis, and this would put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict while safeguarding the interests of all peoples, including the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.\n52.\tThis position was confirmed by the statement of Mr, Riad [1954th meeting], who repeated the readiness of Egypt to accept a just solution based upon the reciprocal security of all the countries concerned. However, Israel does not renounce its dangerous expansionist objectives. In the circumstances, decisive international action is called for. Only the concerted initiatives of the four Powers of the Security Council could pave the way for a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the Arab East. Isolated actions by one single country can only encourage Israeli intransigence.\n53.\tThe situation in the Korean peninsula also remains a cause for concern. The presence of American troops in South Korea for over 20 years has prevented a divided country from achieving peaceful reunification. This is all the more serious because foreign intervention is being carried out under the flag of the United Nations. The normalization of the situation in this part of the world requires the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the end of any interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people. The majority of countries present here are aware of this and that is why the stand taken by some States, which made it possible to impose the decision of adjourning consideration of this question, is a matter of surprise to us. The arguments advanced by the States against the inscription on the agenda of this session of questions such as the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and the dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea would be more weighty were there no foreign troops to prevent the Koreans from agreeing among themselves and achieving the peaceful democratic unification of their country.\n54.\tThat is precisely the objective of the latest proposals of the Korean Democratic People's Republic of Korea. If those proposals are carried out it would lead to the creation of favorable conditions in order to put an end to an artificially created and fostered state of affairs in this part of the world.\n55. Despite resolutions and solemn documents adopted at the commemorative session of the General Assembly, which called colonialism a crime and asked for the immediate an i final liquidation of the colonial system, the solution of colonial problems has not moved forward. On the contrary, we are confronted with redoubled activities of the colonial and racist regimes in southern Africa. Those regimes have strengthened their opposition and their actions against the African national liberation movements. They have perpetrated acts of aggression against Guinea, Zambia and Senegal. The racist Government of the Republic of South Africa has launched a large-scale diplomatic offensive aimed at breaking the unity of independent African countries and at subverting their struggle for the liberation of the whole of Africa. Responsibility for this state of affairs lies with those NATO countries which have not only always brought to bear their moral and material support for the colonial regimes in Africa but have even strengthened their assistance, They openly help and encourage colonialism and neo-colonialism in Africa. The most obvious proof can be seen in the talks held between the United Kingdom and the racist regime of Salisbury, the sale of British weapons to the Republic of South Africa and the NATO meeting in Lisbon. \n56.\tThis situation in Africa also requires the strengthening of international action to help the African peoples in their just struggle for the total liquidation of colonialism.\n57.\tThe problems of disarmament take pride of place among the most important problems of our time. Numerous resolutions, adopted almost always unanimously by the General Assembly, testify to the hopes placed by the peoples of the world in efforts likely to lead to disarmament. During lengthy debates on the various aspects of disarmament some results were reached, whose positive influence is generally recognized. We also welcome the latest progress achieved by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva: the draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction [AI8457-DCI234, annex A]. It is certain that the General Assembly will not fail to approve this first real disarmament measure and that the new convention will very soon become international law, designed to eliminate one of the most terrible weapons of mass destruction.\n58.\tWe should like at the same time to express the hope that the adoption of this convention will bring us closer to an agreement on the prohibition of the production of chemical weapons.\n59.\tEvery time the question of disarmament is debated, one is duty-bound to note that results in this field are not in keeping with the extreme dangers resulting from armaments. In point of fact, the very grave problems of nuclear disarmament remain in a state of suspension; general and complete disarmament is still marking time; the arms race continues to accelerate and stocks of murderous weapons are still being accumulated.\n60.\tThanks above all to the efforts of the socialist countries, far from negligible results have been reached in the field of nuclear disarmament, especially the prohibition of nuclear tests in the three environments, the agreement on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and on the demilitarization of the sea-bed, and the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of strategic arms. This progress is far from sufficient. At this time there are propitious conditions for the conclusion of an agreement on the prohibition of underground nuclear tests, One should not let such an opportunity escape. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation, of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] is already in force. It is therefore necessary that States not having signed or ratified it, especially States possessing the industrial and financial potential for the production of nuclear weapons should adhere to it and ratify it.\n61.\tNuclear disarmament could not be effective without the prohibition and destruction of nuclear weapons. The common agreement of all States possessing nuclear weapons is indispensable for this. That is precisely the objective of the Soviet proposal for the convening of a conference of the five nuclear Powers [A/8328]. The initiative was greeted favorably in all countries, since progress in the field of nuclear disarmament will greatly contribute to the strengthening of confidence and the creation of favorable conditions for the solution of the fundamental problem: that of general and complete disarmament.\n62.\tThe proposal of the Soviet Government on the convening of a world disarmament conference [A/8491] is also of paramount importance. This is a new initiative likely to ensure progress in the problem of general disarmament, thanks to the participation of all the States of the world. That proposal is widely supported and represents the most democratic way to solve a problem which is a matter of concern to all peoples. It is regrettable that the Government of the United States should have hastened to express reservations about this proposal and we should like to believe that that is not its last word on this problem.\n63.\tThe Government of Bulgaria unreservedly supports the new Soviet initiatives since they represent an effective way of reaching one of the essential objectives of the program for the strengthening of world peace.\n64.\tA policy aimed at strengthening collective security in Europe has of late progressed in a most encouraging manner. The beginning of this positive process was marked by the initiative of the socialist States for the convening of a European conference on security and co-operation. The constructive nature of this proposal, which is in keeping with the aspirations of peoples and the needs of the European continent, has exerted great influence on the political situation in Europe. It made it possible first to embark upon a dialog between East and West and then-and this is by far the most important-among all the European States. Never have there been so many contacts, conversations and consultations among the countries of Europe as in recent years. Despite the complexity of the problems and some dramatic episodes, all this has created a propitious political climate for the consideration and solution of the important European questions, the settlement of which had not advanced at all during whole decades.\n65.\tIt is in this new climate, created thanks to the positive actions of the socialist countries, that the policy of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the East has been able to take a concrete and more realistic form. This was the necessary element enabling the Soviet Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland to sit down at the negotiating table for talks that have resulted in the signing of certain well-known and historic treaties.\n66.\tFurther, it was in the same circumstances that it was possible to undertake and carry through successfully the four-Power talks on West Berlin, thus eliminating one of the most sensitive sources of tension in Europe.\n67.\tThis important progress had salutary effects on the situation in Europe. The Bulgarian Government hopes that the talks among the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin will lead to positive results, and that the simultaneous ratification of the Treaty of 12 August 1970 between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Treaty of 7 December 1970 between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany, and the approval of the agreement on West Berlin, will not be further delayed.\n68.\tWe are convinced that the negotiations between Czechoslovakia and West Germany will likewise be crowned with success.\n69.\tIt is therefore evident that the time has come to pass from bilateral consultations to concrete multilateral preparations for the European security conference, with no prior conditions or reservations of any kind. During consultations carried on in a spirit of mutual understanding, agreement has become apparent on a considerable number of questions. The European conference on security and cooperation has already become an essential element for promoting relations among the European States, a genuine hope for a more stable and tranquil Europe facing a peaceful future. The conference will be an important step towards eliminating the division of Europe into blocs, towards building in its place a system of collective security, and towards liquidating artificial obstacles preventing the achievement of the real possibilities for wider political, economic, technical and cultural co-operation among the European peoples.\n70.\tYet, certain measures taken by the United Kingdom Government and likely to create new tensions in East-West relations and to delay the improvement of the political climate in Europe have given rise to profound amazement. One begins to wonder whether the United Kingdom is ready to assume responsibility for this.\n71.\tTogether with the other socialist countries, Bulgaria has played an active part in the efforts towards ensuring progress in the problem of European security , which is the key question in international relations.\n72.\tProfoundly convinced that the promotion of regional and bilateral co-operation contributes to a sound international situation as a whole, our country exerts untiring\n5 Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, signed nt Berlin on 3 September 1971.\nefforts to improve its relations with all countries, paying special attention to the situation in Europe, more particularly in the Balkans, In this connexion, Bulgaria has undertaken a great many bilateral and multilateral initiatives for strengthening political, economic and cultural co-operation in the Balkans. Meetings and talks have been held this year with responsible representatives of most of the Balkan countries, among them Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. At these meetings, matters of common concern and practical measures were discussed with a view to ensuring better conditions for the encouragement of good-neighborly relations among the Balkan countries.\n73.\tThese positive developments have had a favorable reception throughout the Balkan Peninsula. It is our hope that with the participation of all the Balkan States these trends will be further strengthened. The Bulgarian Government, on its part, will spare no effort to maintain and strengthen confidence and mutual understanding, the indispensable conditions for co-operation among the Balkan peoples, and for transforming the Balkans into a region of stability and lasting peace, free from nuclear weapons.\n74.\tEfforts aimed at establishing new international relations cannot be limited solely to bilateral and multilateral arrangements. Such efforts are unquestionably necessary, useful and effective. However, it is obvious that today, within the framework of the United Nations, the international community has at its disposal wider means and possibilities.\n75.\tOne of the conditions that would make it possible to utilize those possibilities is the total application of the principle of universality of this Organization. And it is here that we see the capital importance of restoring the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China, and of the simultaneous admission to membership in the United Nations of the two German States: the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.\n76.\tI would like, in this connexion, to remind you of the role being played by the German Democratic Republic in international life. All its political activities and its international relations testify to the fact that it bends every effort to serve the cause of peace and understanding among peoples, in its desire to make its special contribution to the strengthening of security in Europe. The admission of the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations will therefore be an important contribution to the strengthening of the principles of the Charter.\n77.\tThe question of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China has been before the United Nations for 20 years. The negative position of the United States alone has prevented its solution. The United States to this very day continues to act in the same vein, although in a different guise and obviously with less chance of success. Bulgaria, like the other socialist countries, has always favored, and continues to favor, restoring the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in all United Nations bodies, regarding that Government as the only legitimate representative of China. Our country categorically rejects any proposal involving \\\"two Chinas\\\".\n78.\tThe Bulgarian delegation shares the interest felt by the majority of Member States in the problems of economic development. The interdependence of the problems of peace and international security, on the one hand, and the problems of the elimination of under-development, on the other, have been brought out in previous discussions, especially during the last session.\n79.\tAt present, international economic relations are characterized by phenomena which give rise to serious concern. Financial and monetary troubles, inflation and unemployment are causing increasing instability in the Western economy. A large number of speakers before me have stressed the danger these phenomena represent for international economic relations, especially the success of the Second United Nations Development Decade. Any worsening in this situation will inevitably result in a greater exploitation of the third world countries, as was pointed' out with particular emphasis by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France [1942nd meeting]. One thing is unfortunately quite certain, and that is that the success of United Nations initiatives in the field of economic development is confronted with new and very grave obstacles.\n80.\tInternational economic relations during recent years have confirmed the fact that economic and social progress for the developing countries is possible only in certain conditions: complete economic independence, total mobilization of national resources and implementation of programs for accomplishing profound social and economic transformations.\n81.\tIn the struggle of the developing countries tr ensure favorable international economic conditions i ,t their economic progress, the United Nations must resolutely stand by the side of these peoples and defend their interests.\n82.\tOn the agenda of this session we find other important questions which the Bulgarian delegation views with all due attention. Before concluding, I should like, however, to emphasize that it is the problems of international security and the safeguarding of peace that must have absolute priority. In this connexion, I wish to stress the importance of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, unanimously adopted by the General Assembly at its anniversary session [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. The solution of the problems underlined by that Declaration in fact can create the conditions necessary for the solution of other problems of the present-day world, and international peace and security always remain the most important task of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "79.\tMr. President, I should like in the beginning to join with those of my colleagues who have spoken in saying how happy I am that we meet under your guidance and to express my full confidence that you will steer us with complete success through the many difficult problems which face us. I am happy, too, that the honor which is done to you is reflected on your country, Indonesia, with which we have and still maintain the closest and most friendly relations.\n80.\tI have found myself on this platform on a number of occasions compelled to call attention to a feature of international life which has plagued for far too long the lives of ordinary men and women. It is in short the abuse of the function of politics and diplomacy by what I may call the cult of confrontation and the denial of dialog. To promote dialog is the essential function of this Organization, and, indeed, it is implicit in the very name \\\"United Nations\\\". So it is here, above all, that we should show concern at a development that threatens to drag civilization backwards, down the-road to violence.\n81.\tConfrontation may develop as an internal problem, as the distinguished Foreign Minister of Canada has just reminded us. I speak today from experience.\n82.\tIn Northern Ireland a terrifying manifestation of the old danger of religious confrontation has reappeared, complicated in this case by other political and social problems.\n83.\tAll through history, in every corner of the world, religion has been the reason or excuse for wars which caught up peoples in their toils and left a trail of misery for ordinary people behind. In the last century or two dogmatic political ideology has supplanted it. But the danger is the same and in fact as we survey the world's scene it is greater than ever. With the rapid communication of ideas, the sophisticated propaganda, these divisions can be exploited^ and exploited on a vast scale. Millions-and we see this every day when we look at the modern means of communication are duped into adopting the prejudices of the few even though they have little or no idea what the confrontation is about. The way is thus open for the anarchist who believes in revolution and sees nothing beyond his nose and no formation of society beyond that; he believes in revolution by destruction. The way is open, too, for the terrorist who wishes to enforce one point of view and rejects compromise and reason.\n84.\tIn the unhappy situation which exists today in one part of the United Kingdom, such people care nothing for the beliefs and legitimate views of Roman Catholics or Protestants. Their snipers and bombs and land-mines are intended to bring about the total disintegration of society. They are able to exploit the fears and prejudices of others, to intimidate witnesses and even to stir up children to destroy, to throw fire-bombs and to harass forces whose only task is to keep the peace.\n85.\tI illustrate my theme with this example because our experience of it is first-hand. And though it is our own internal problem in Britain, and it is not always possible so easily to compare internal and international confrontations, the lesson to be drawn is surely universal, It has application to every one of the intractable international problems which face us in this Organization. Each of us has the means to redress legitimate grievances within our own community; that is what gives u& the right to insist that violence within the borders of our State shall not be used. But international confrontations cannot be so easily resolved.\n86.\tWe have not yet succeeded in providing effective remedies for international wrongs. Peace-making is at a discount because we have no means to impose solutions, and a tiny minority interest, therefore, which is interested in confusion can thwart the majority will. I think we are all familiar with the perennial agenda of problems before the international community, situations that have threatened peace in the past and situations that could do so in future. I do not underrate for one moment the difficulty when the parties believe that their vital interests in security, or even their survival, are at stake. But I think the evidence must be-and it has accumulated in these last few dangerous years that time does not resolve many of these confrontations. On the contrary, time works for the anarchist. Sooner or later, uncompromising confrontation leads to violence; neighbors who will not live together will one day fight together. When intransigence escalates into violence the anarchist will find his opportunity and the innocent will be drawn in and will suffer and will die.\n87.\tI remember last year on this platform, speaking in the context of hijacking of aircraft, I drew attention then to this danger of anarchy-anarchy superseding the law of nations and with it the inherent challenge to all governmental authority. For us to face the fundamental dangers of condoning those who take the law into their own hands I said:\n\\\"We must call on those who have taken up arms to lay them down ... even though they claim to be carrying them in the name of justice\\\" [1848th meeting, paras. 128429],\n88.\tLast year's General Assembly resolution on aerial hijacking [resolution 2645 (XXV)] and the subsequent Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft,  which my Government has signed and will shortly ratify, have brought encouraging progress in this particular field. Last week my Government also signed the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation.  I hope that as many nations as possible will sign and ratify both those Conventions so that this particular form of anarchy can be stopped. It may be modest progress, when we survey the whole field, but it is some progress.\n89.\tThis year my plea goes wider. It is that in every case where there is international confrontation, existing or threatening, a conscious and urgent effort should be made by all the parties engaged, talking each situation one by one, to achieve a modus vivendi before the stage of open violence is reached, before the anarchist, armed with all the modern techniques of terror, infiltrates and takes charge and levies his fatal toll on society and on the law. This obligation lies plainly on each and all of us. But I think the effort \u2022 must first and foremost be made within the framework of the United Nations. Our Charter has equipped us with a whole range of remedies for these situations. There are the traditional diplomatic tools of mediation, conciliation and inquiry. If these fail us we are bound by the Charter to seek other peaceful means, and it provides new powers to investigate and to recommend.\n90.\tI think if we are honest with ourselves in this Organization we must admit that we have failed to make full use of this potential. Our Secretary-General-whose coming retirement deprives us of a devoted and wise counselor has lately given us a timely reminder of the true character of his role as a peace-maker as envisaged by the Charter. We have not allowed him or his predecessors to realize that capacity to the full. He has also made recently an important comment on the influence of this Assembly in peace-making. He said:\n.. the majority must make it plain that they will listen to both sides of a case and not only to the larger faction. The majority must prove that they will seek a realistic way out of difficulties rather than resort to condemnations or threats\\\" [A/8401jAdd. 1, para. 95].\nI feel that he is right; but we have not taken those words of his seriously enough as yet. Too often in this Assembly and in the Security Council undisguised propaganda and the search for tactical advantages by this or that group block efforts to reach a just and a comprehensive solution of a problem.\n91.\tBut until we can perfect the remedies which the United Nations offers I must also address this plea concerning confrontation to those who find themselves at this moment in direct and dangerous dispute. At this time of day challenge and confrontation are-to put it in plain language-just too dangerous. Compromise may be dull, but it is the sole recipe for peace and, with patience, it can usually-1 am tempted to say always-be had in honor.\n92.\tThe confrontation which today carries the greatest risk of war is that between Israel and the Arab States. It is one which could draw into the lines of antagonism the most powerful countries in the world.\n93.\tA whole generation has matured in the Middle East in the shadow of war. A generation on the one side has grown up as homeless refugees; a generation on the other ride has been brought up in the fear of being swept by force into the sea. Violence and counter-violence have been the order of the day; and war has been and remains very near. And that war-so great has been the escalation of armament in the area in recent years-would be fought with modern weapons amply reinforced by the greatest Power.\n94.\tThis dispute is concerned with the most emotional of all issues: the security, and therefore the life, of those who confront each other. The Arabs are totally convinced that the Israelis want to expand their territory at the Arabs' expense, and Israel is convinced that the Arabs want to encircle and destroy it.\n95.\tIn such circumstances, what can others, or the United Nations, do? For unless action is taken, that war will come, I take it that we are resolved, in so far as we can influence events in this United Nations, that on this issue there should be no war. It would be catastrophic. We have, in fact, taken one positive step to help to avert it. Few can doubt that Security Council resolution 242 (1967), although not perfect, contains the essential ingredients of a peaceful settlement. I know it will be tempting to try to change that resolution for another. I consider, myself-I think that perhaps the great majority here would be with me-that it is the only resolution upon which we can count to command substantial support in this Assembly and in this Organization.\n96.\tWe have, too, in the context of trying to find a solution to this problem, within the grouping of the four Powers, indicated a readiness to guarantee the terms of a settlement between the parties. That is not a task which any of us particularly relishes, but where distrust has run so deep for so long, we must take risks, and it may well be the only way to build the confidence which will lead to a permanent peace, taken together with, of course, measures for demilitarization and for the placing of United Nations personnel in evacuated areas.\n97.\tBut if war is to be avoided, those who are in confrontation must actively help to promote a dialog. The main ingredients of peace are known, and I will not rehearse them. On the one hand practical proposals have been put forward which would satisfy the Arab desire for Israeli withdrawal, and these are contained in Security Council resolution 242 (1967); on the other hand, there are ways and means of meeting the legitimate Israel need for permanent physical security. I will not debate the particular possibilities here in a program of peace-making in this dispute, but I will say this, and positively: that, unless a mechanism of dialog can be established, sooner or later-and maybe sooner than later-the fighting will start again.\n98.\tConfidence can only be established in this case through dialog: here an interim arrangement providing for phased withdrawal and the opening of the Suez Canal, with a link to the next and final stage of withdrawal, could serve to build confidence and to prove to the parties on the ground that there is more to be gained by dialog and coexistence than by war. I still believe that Mr. Jarring has a crucial role to yiin this process of establishing contact. But whoever stages this dialog, the tempo of it must be quicker than it has been until now, and it must be at closer range. When there is distrust between the parties of this depth and scope, it cannot be removed by long-distance correspondence, and the onus of adopting dialog must rest with those who now confront each other in arms. It is for us to help them to find the way to do it and I emphasize again that the time is short. This is a case where dialog must supplant confrontation.\n99.\tIn spite of the experience of wars in Europe and the Middle East, new confrontations loom. In Asia the world watches the frontiers of India and Pakistan with increasing anxiety. India, by reason of civil disturbance in Pakistan, has been faced with a problem of refugees which distorts its economy and stretches its resources to the limit, and beyond. It has been valiant and resilient in meeting this burden. It has rightly asked for international help. Much has been given through this Organization, but we shall need to mobilize a lot more help in cash and kind than we have yet done.\n100.\tThere is now an added danger of famine in the months to come in East Pakistan, arising mainly from a break-down in communications following civil strife. Relief will be needed here too on a massive scale. I hope that we are all conscious of an obligation to help, and to help urgently, because there could be no greater tragedy for the world-even including that in the Middle East-than that India and Pakistan should find themselves unwillingly at war. The United Kingdom has given \u00a38 million to relief in India and \u00a31 million io East Pakistan, and we are ready now to add substantially to that. Relief is beyond the capacity of Pakistan. Therefore, the machinery of the United Nations on the ground must be strengthened, and if it is to. be adequate to the task of recreating the necessary network of communications, then action must be taken to meet local conditions of famine and to meet them in time.\n101.\tAgain, there is not much time, for recently this problem between India and Pakistan has assumed a new and appalling dimension. Guerrilla warfare and sabotage are adding to the fear and are hampering rescue. I am not sure if we yet understand the scale of the guerrilla warfare in that area; but the operations of the guerrillas, taking advantage of this situation, could create another panic in East Pakistan and start another avalanche mass movement of population from Pakistan into India. So this situation could run both countries unwillingly into war,\n102.\tReconstruction of the Constitution of Pakistan must be an internal matter for the people of Pakistan. But the risks to peace, if they fail in that reconstruction, are appealing, and the truth of the matter is that the danger will be finally averted only when there is a return to civil government in East Pakistan which gives confidence to all Pakistanis to stay at home, to return home, and to develop their country in peace. Meanwhile, let the United Nations do the humanitarian work. It must never be said of the politicians that we met here and argued about who was to distribute food while millions of innocent people starved.\n103.\tIn Africa we see the evil of apartheid and the frustration of many at its continued existence. Frustration and impatience can lead to violence. And as we have seen so often that violence, from which the innocent suffer, provokes counter-measures, and the lines of war thus become more sharply drawn.\n104.\tI am glad to see that, in spite of the deep feelings aroused by apartheid, which we share, the urge to dialog grows and it is being to some extent put into practice. There in Africa, as elsewhere, neighbors have no choice but to live side by side; and ultimately dialog must be resumed and must take charge.\n105.\tIn the Far East, we have seen that China has for too long isolated itself from the world community. That had its dangers. When it plays its full part here in New York, a mighty voice will be added to our counsels and a major step will have been taken towards the true representation here of the balance of world power and world opinion, from which consensus can be hammered out, however painful at. times that process may be. With all the difficulties, I think the majority here recognizes that the future lies, not in isolation, not in confrontation or in ostracism, but in dialog.\n106.\tI hope that in Western Europe after centuries of conflict we have learn our lesson. The confrontation of Germany and France which nearly destroyed civilized life on our continent was ended because two great nations and two great statesmen were willing to take a risk, to pull down the historic barriers between them and peaceful coexistence. Those two great statesmen in particular took a risk with public opinion.\n107.\tOn that essential political foundation is being built !ready the integrating Community of th? Six, the\nEuropean Economic Community. The United Kingdom and other European countries will, we hope, soon expand the Community to one of ten. That should usher in a new era of economic expansion and greatly enhance the prospects for peace. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of France, Mr. Schumann, yesterday, in one of his most felicitous phrases, described that enlarged community as a \\\"community of hope\\\" [1942nd meeting, para. 50}. I would underline that forecast. That Community is already committed, by reason of the many special provisions for territories once connected with France and the United Kingdom, to be outward-looking. It exists to encourage trade, and that is the healthiest form of assistance,\n108.\tNevertheless, aid from the developed to the under-developed countries is a vital need, and my country and the Community recognize their duty in this. I am glad to be able to announce today that my Government has decided to increase its contribution to the United Nations Development Program. In 1972 to $19,2 Million, an Increase of one third, We had also made an advance pledge of $50 million to the International Development Association, to remedy the failure of the third replenishment this summer. Yesterday in Washington we announced that wo were raising this to $103,680,000, which completes our first year's contribution to that replenishment. Wo hope In this way not only to enable the International Development Association to continue its work but to encourage others to take action also.\n109.\tThere is nothing we in Western Europe should till like better than closer economic and political relations with the countries of Eastern Europe. It was the policy of the Federal Republic of Germany again with a German statesman taking a risk to seek accord there, and thus open the way to East'West agreements, In particular agreement to ease the conditions of life for the people of West Berlin. Once that has been achieved, it should be possible to prepare a conference on the security of Europe, If that is to have any chance of success, each country must demonstrate that it respects the security of others; that is a .sine qua non of cooperation* and that alone can give confidence. With confidence we can do much; without It we can do very little. If this essential respect for one's neighbor Is shown, then in Europe we shall be embarking on a (UHvntv which is embracing and on which better and more enduring relations can be built. The trend, then, in Europe is to turn away from confrontation to detente,\n110.\tI have been concerned today to stress the responsibility we all bear to find the peaceful way out of our difficulties and differences. 1 believe that the first essential is to make a conscious effort to get back to a climate of good-neighborliness, with those with whom we disagree as well as with our friends.\n111.\tWe have been exhorted to do more about last year's Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)J. I have no quarrel with that; but general declarations are of no avail unless our basic approach is the right one. Surely the right approach is laid down quite specifically in the Preamble to our Charter, where we declare that we are determined \\\"to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors\\\". \\\"Tolerance\\\" is a word that is all too seldom heard today in these halls. I suggest that it is as Important now as it was in 1945, when the Charter was drafted. When differences and disputes nevertheless arise, neither side can escape the duty of looking to negotiation to secure the peace. Nor can we collectively escape the duty of overcoming the obstacles which stand in the way of the United Nations making an effective intervention before dispute hardens into confrontation and confrontation into conflict.\n112.\tPeace-keeping is the center of the problem, because so often peace cannot be made until all concerned are confident that it will be kept. The Charter foresaw the Deed. Hie machinery exists and it is available for our use. What has been lacking and I hope is not now lacking is the w21 to use it or to support it.\n113, There is even, I regret to say, at the present time one operation of peace-keeping, established by the Security\nCouncil, that Is Involved in a serious financial shortfall. I refer to the endeavor that has successfully maintained the peace For more than seven years In Cyprus and consequently in that part of the Mediterranean. There is now a deficit of up to $70 million, half of which relates to former peacekeeping accounts, and this deficit Is growing every year, Therefore I share the Secretary-General's view that unless a remedy Is found In the very near future It will no longer be possible for us to fulfill the basic purpose and objective of the Charter,\n114.\tWe must not slide backwards in peace-keeping, Every symptom of division In the international field urges us to do better, So let us each and all bend our minds to positive peace-making and positive peace-keeping, Let us prove it in each case where the danger of confrontation raises its stubborn head,\n115.\tTo break the present stalemate In a number of the confrontations will not solve the problems of the world; but we can In this Assembly give the world a sharper instrument for peace, That will narrow the area for the anarchist and his operations and broaden the rule of law.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "51.\t  Mr. President, your unanimous election to the presidency of this august body, on which I congratulate you most sincerely on behalf of the Government and people of the Philippines, was a proud moment for Asia. In your modest and unassuming person, the members of the General Assembly discerned and recognized the indomitable nationalist who fought heroically for Indonesian independence; the far-sighted Asian leader who is one of the architects of regional solidarity in our part of the world; the initiator of the Djakarta Conference in May 1970 on the peaceful solution of the Viet-Nam war; and the international statesman whose exceptional diplomatic skill helped to achieve a peaceful settlement of the West Irian dispute, enabled Indonesia to return to the United Nations with undiminished prestige, and contributed decisively to Indonesia's present economic rehabilitation with the understanding and co-operation of its major economic partners regardless of their differing ideologies.\n52.\tYour predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, who presided with admirable skill, perceptiveness and dedication over the historic twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly deserves our unstinting admiration and gratitude.\n53.\tMr. President, it is particularly appropriate that an eminent Asian should preside over this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We have welcomed three new Members of the United Nations, Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar, all from Asia. The Philippines has co-sponsored the admission of yet another Asian nation, Oman, whose equally welcome entry into the United Nations now brings the Organization's total membership to 131.\n54.\tFor the past quarter century the world has been in the throes of dynamic, revolutionary changes. The founding of the United Nations was an historic attempt to channel those changes along constructive lines. The history of the first quarter-century of the United Nations may thus be said to have consisted in essence of the fateful struggle to form a viable world community in the face of persisting, powerful and divisive national ambitions in time to save mankind from the ultimate catastrophe of extinction. As our Secretary-General, U Thant, aptly pointed out during the commemorative meetings of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly last year:\n\u201cIt is intolerable that the peoples of the world should have to live on the brink of disaster and that so many of them continue in a state of utter misery\t\n\u201cThus it has been for the most part in the first twenty-five years of the United Nations. With some notable exceptions. Member Governments have, in practice, been more preoccupied with using the United Nations as an instrument to promote their own national policies than as a new kind of organization in which the nations of the world in co-operation could forge and execute solutions to world problems and work together for a better futurE\\\" [1883rd meeting, paras. 63 and 64].\n55.\tUnexpectedly, however, the second quarter-century of the United Nations has opened with a year of remarkable events -Events that seem destined to affect favorably the course of world history for years to come. Most spectacular of these, of course, is the developing detente in Asia, Here, as in other regions of the world, we are rapidly moving from an era of dangerous polarization to one of pluralization.\n56.\tThis new era of pluralization will certainly be marked by a multiplicity of interests and relationships and will carry with it great opportunities for harmonization and co-operative action. Relations will become interrelations, partly political, perhaps, but even more economic, cultural and educational in character. Not only Asia but tHe world community generally can expect to benefit from these important changes.\n57.\tThe remarkable initiative of President Nixon appears as the single event from which new possibilities must directly proceed. The first results have been both the complication and the clarification of the policies and intentions of nations in the region. The implementation of the \\\"Nixon Doctrine\\\", the clear enunciation of the policies of the People's Republic of China as, for instance, in the unprecedented interview given by Premier Chou En-lai to Mr. Reston of The New York Times; the intense and continuing policy discussions in Japan; the adjustments in the policies of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics-all these point to realistic realignments among the four great Powers whose interests meet in Asia.\n58.\tAt the same time, \\\"pluralization\\\" means the opportunity for more creative participation in the affairs of the region by the smaller nations in joint, co-operative enterprises where their common interests meet, and for more independent initiative regarding their national interests. Speaking individually the voices of the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and others may not weigh heavily in the consideration of major decisions in Asia, but speaking with the collective voice of 300 million people, their roles and contributions must be more seriously regarded. It is against this background that the significance of joint efforts within regional organizations such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] and the Asian and Pacific Council [ASPAC] should be assessed. Other effective and special-purpose regional groupings can be expected to emerge and play their part. The strengthening of economic and social co-operation is certain to occur and be increasingly looked upon with favor since it will offer real possibilities for solving economic problems which the individual Asian countries find it difficult or impossible to solve alone.\n59.\tInterest in collective regional defense arrangements can be expected to decline. They have had their day. In their place may well develop collective political forums among the Asians-such as the Asian Forum long proposed by H.E. President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines  for the solution of political differences which may arise in \nthe future. It is predictable also that the future will see on the part of the Asian nations an increased interest in and reliance on the United Nations. In this context, the keen and continuing concern of the Philippines to maximize the effectiveness of our world Organization will be more fully understood.\n60.\tFor the forest in the future, it is plain that the paramount force in Asia is likely to remain nationalism. Nationalism is of two kinds. For the small developing third world countries in Asia, nationalism is largely defensive in nature-an attempt to maintain the conditions in which a viable nation can be created and sustained in the face of internal dissensions and the effects of external circumstances. Great Power nationalism is different in quality; it assumes international dimensions and greatly complicates relations between States big and small.\n61.\tIt is now evident that in Asia both types of nationalism are beginning to move toward more constructive expressions than have been the case in the past: the international nationalism of the large Powers is seeking accommodation, while the protective nationalism of the smaller Powers is seeking co-operative modes of expression for mutual benefit. In this connexion, I am refraining from discussing in this policy statement the question of Sabah because it is now a matter involving the highest level of both Governments concerned.\n62.\tA new era of reality is opening before Asia. In this respect, the question of die representation of China in the United Nations is of the greatest importance to us Asians. In the past, the Philippines had taken a position against the seating of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The new realities have led the Philippines to reconsider its position.\n63.\tOur position on this extremely important question is based four-square on the state-of-the-nation message delivered by President Marcos of the Philippines before the joint session of the Philippine Congress on 25 January this year. These were his perceptive and forthright words:\n\u201cVast forces are at work in Asia today. Although the full implications of the new developments are not yet clear, they bolster my belief that a process of change is under way which will radically alter our traditional view of our part of the world.\n\u201cAccordingly, the principal aim of Philippine foreign policy in 1971 is to seek an accommodation with reality. Realism will be the hallmark of our foreign policy. The objectives are to augment and diversify relations with other countries, where we feel that such will promote the national interest; and to seek new friends while strengthening ties with old ones.\\\"\\\"\n64.\tThis policy statement of the head of State of the Philippines, made in January of 1971, some time before the dramatic announcement of President Nixon's intention to visit Peking, is the basis not only of Philippine efforts to normalize relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries of Eastern Europe, but also of our support for the entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations, without depriving the Republic of China of its own United Nations membership.\n \n65.\tThe Philippine position is based on the recognition of the fact that two Governments -the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of China-claim the right to represent the Chinese people or the Chinese State in the United Nations.\n66.\tThe reality of the situation has two aspects. It is an undeniable fact that, since the founding of the United Nations, the Republic of China has continuously represented China in this Organization. Year after year, the General Assembly has upheld this continuous representation of China by the Republic of China in all bodies of the United Nations, including the Security Council.\n67.\tBut it is also a fact that since 1949 the Government of the People's Republic of China has had effective control and authority over mainland China, while the Government of the Republic of China has had effective control and authority over other parts of the Chinese State, particularly Taiwan. Each has been accorded diplomatic recognition by an overwhelming number of nations. Recent statistics show that the Republic of China has diplomatic relations with 59 countries, 56 of which are States Members of the United Nations, while the People's Republic of China has diplomatic relations with 55 States Members of the United Nations'\n68.\tThese facts indicate why it has not been easy to reach a precise and clear-cut solution to this question, and why it has confounded this Assembly for the last two decades.\n69.\tIn this connexion I should like to recall that last year I stated for the record [1855th meeting (addendum)] that the Government and people of the Philippines have no desire to be in a posture of permanent opposition to the People's Republic of China. I expressed our sincere hope that our biggest neighbor in Asia would do everything in its power to merit membership of the United Nations on terms consonant with the provisions of its Charter.\n70.\tI must emphasize this last point, namely, that the People's Republic of China should enter the United Nations on United Nations terms, not on terms which it apparently seeks to impose by proxy through its spokesmen in this Assembly. The People's Republic of China is a big Power, but it is not bigger than the United Nations, and it should not attempt to dictate the terms of its own entry into the United Nations even before the question has been decided by the General Assembly and the Security Council.\n71.\tThe Philippine delegation, in a spirit of frankness and objectivity with respect to the existing situation, believes that the fair, just and realistic solution would be for both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China to be seated in the General Assembly and be eligible to become members of other bodies of the United Nations system.\n72.\tBut with respect to the permanent seat of China in the Security Council, my Government would be prepared to agree to its allocation to the People's Republic of China with its 750 million people, in recognition of the direct and logical relationship between permanent membership in the Council and the maintenance of international peace and security.\n73.\tAt the same time, the Philippine delegation will oppose any proposal that will, explicitly or by implication, result in the expulsion of the Republic of China from the United Nations. Expulsion, in our view, would be an act of injustice to a Government and people that have consistently shown sincere adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, It would be unfair to a Government that has faithfully fulfilled its obligations under the Charter since the founding of the United Nations to be deprived of its legitimate seat in the Organization.\n74.\tThe Republic of China's population of some 14 million people is bigger than the populations of two thirds of the Members of the United Nations. Moreover, the Republic of China has attained a noteworthy degree of economic progress and stability. These are facts too relevant and important to be overlooked. Consequently, my delegation will support the position that any proposal which would result in depriving the Republic of China of a seat in the United Nations is a question important enough to require a decision by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly.\n75.\tWe feel that this Assembly simply cannot ignore the fact that the Republic of China, respecting the obligations of a Member nation, has not only represented China in the United Nations all these years but has also developed a separate social and economic system, with its own distinctive character, different from that on the Chinese mainland. And the clock cannot be turned back. What is history is fact.\n76.\tMajor steps towards accommodation and detente have likewise occurred in other regions of the world since the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly. We have witnessed a major breakthrough in the re-establishment of good relations in Central Europe, particularly between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. This development is due in considerable measure to the commendable courage and statesmanship of Chancellor Willy Brandt. It is our earnest hope, shared, we believe, by Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko of the Soviet Union among others, that the remaining difficulties will soon be overcome, thus paving the way for the entry into the United Nations of these two States at the earliest possible time and bringing yet nearer to realization our goal of universality. At the same time ways should be found to provide for the simultaneous entry into the United Nations of the other divided States, without prejudice to whatever arrangements they might later wish to make between themselves. And in this connexion, the retention by the Republic of China of its membership in the United Nations is most relevant. The expulsion of that country may close the door to the admission of divided States into the United Nations.\n77.\tThe completion of initial agreements at the Strategic Arms limitation Talks in Helsinki, although these agreements are not yet of great consequence in themselves, and the commendation to this Assembly of a draft convention on biological weapons,    even though it does not yet extend\n \nto chemical weapons, are other hopeful straws in the wind. While favorable winds are blowing, the international community should resolve to consolidate these gains with concrete undertakings and initiate new efforts in the areas of possible accommodation and consensus which are now open to us.\n78.\tIn this connexion it is vital to recall the new opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of our United Nations. The recent reorientation of the United Nations Development program, the report of the Special Committee on the Rationalization of the Procedures and Organization of the General Assembly [A/8426], which we will shortly consider, the attention being given to the revitalization and enlargement of the Economic and Social Council, our review at this session of the role of the International Court of Justice [item 90] and the report of the Committee for the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations [A]8425], our agreement to consider during the twenty-seventh session the overdue review of the United Nations Charter [resolution 2697 (XXV)], and the deepening concern for effective action to cope with the population explosion are all evidence of the recognition by Member States of the necessity for endowing the United Nations with the means to discharge more adequately the responsibilities entrusted to it in an era of accelerating interdependence and community of interest.\n79.\tWith regard to resolution 2697 (XXV) asking the Secretary-General to invite Member States to communicate their views and suggestions on the review of our Charter, the Government of the Philippines is preparing a detailed exposition of its views, as expressed at the twenty-fifth session, for circulation well before the twenty-seventh session. We trust that this subject will be given priority consideration by Member countries so that our discussion next year will prove as fruitful as possible.\n80.\tSince the founding of the United Nations a major goal in the realization of international peace and security has been the achievement of safeguarded disarmament. Efforts in pursuit of this goal have been seriously handicapped by the absence from the disarmament negotiations of two of the nuclear Powers-France and the People's Republic of China. Here again, new opportunities have opened up to us in recent months. An entrance to the disarmament negotiations for the two missing nuclear parties might well be provided by the proposal for a world disarmament conference [A/L.631]. It should be understood, however, that although such a conference might well serve several purposes, including that of a timely review of the progress made thus far towards disarmament, it could in no way take the place of the kind of detailed working out of specific problems that is now being done in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. Even if the result? are not always up to expectations, the work of the Committee is characterized by a high degree of seriousness, commitment and competence. It may be necessary, however, to reconstitute the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in order to secure the participation of those additional countries which should be taking part in its deliberations.\n81.\tA world disarmament conference would be a major step towards giving meaning and substance to the Disarmament Decade, now running concurrently with the Second United Nations Development Decade. In two years the Assembly has not succeeded in taking any other new initiatives on a scale or of a content sufficient to justify the designation \u201cDisarmament Decade\\\", or adequately to emphasize the interdependence between a Disarmament Decade and the Second Development Decade. It will be recalled that the Government of the Philippines advanced some preliminary suggestions in this regard during the twenty-fifth General Assembly.4 We will return to these proposals at an appropriate time.\n82.\tMeanwhile' we would suggest that any world disarmament conference should either be held under the auspices of the United Nations or be organically related to it. Thought should be given to the activation, for this purpose, of the Disarmament Commission, that body of the whole which has not been utilized in recent years. The present new opportunities may make it possible, for the first time since the founding of the United Nations, to move beyond \\\"non-armament\\\" measures to measures providing for actual, concrete steps towards the reduction and destruction of armaments. Thus will begin the redeeming of a vital promise made to the world's peoples a quarter of a century ago.\n83.\tRather suddenly, the United Nations is faced with a number of new issues having global aspects beyond the possibility of resolution by the efforts of individual States alone. Foremost among these is the question of the deterioration of the human environment. Under the auspices of the Stanley Foundation, this important subject was discussed in depth at the Sixth Conference on the United Nations of the Next Decade, held at Sinaia, Romania, last June, by world statesmen, and a report on the conference proceedings was submitted to the Secretary-General. Nothing can serve to illustrate more vividly than the problems of environmental pollution the common destiny of mankind, the profound, global ramifications of local actions and the urgent need for a unified, integrated approach to economic and social development. Air and water are the first lifelines of space-ship earth. If they are anywhere impaired the total system is to that extent impaired. Most specific pollution problems can and must be dealt with locally, but that does not absolve the international community from the ultimate responsibility to see to it that they are resolved.\n84.\tThe time is past for mere lip-service in this vital matter. For instance, we continue to hear pious protestations of grave concern over the pollution of the human environment. Yet nuclear tests, with their concomitant danger of contaminating the air and the seas with their radio-active emissions, continue in disregard of the expressed wishes of the peoples affected. The Philippine Government has repeatedly protested the testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean, which washes its eastern shores, but these protests have gone unheeded.\n85.\tA second major subject of global scope concerns the utilization of the resources of the sea-bed beyond national jurisdictions as the common heritage of mankind and the elaboration of an international regime for that purpose.\n86.\tMy country, which is an archipelago, is vitally affected by this problem. In the course of the current general debate, some countries, particularly Iceland [1945th meeting] and Fiji [1951st meeting], referred to the question of archipelagos in connexion with the conference on the law of the sea in 1973. My Government expects that in the forthcoming conference this problem with other related issues will be settled along the lines demanded by the progressive development and codification of international law affecting peace and stability in ocean space.\n87.\tIn his report, the Secretary-General calls our attention to the fact that to deal with, such global issues it may be necessary, \\\"in the near future, to envisage new subsidiary organs or substantive departments in the United Nations\\\" f A]8401lAdd.l, para. 91], He correctly states that the creation of such new bodies \\\"should be viewed by the membership as an appropriate response to the ever new challenges of our world\\\" [ibid.].\n88.\tShould we fail to endow the required efforts with the requisite resources or authority, then, of course, we shall have nobody but ourselves to blame if the unwanted conditions persist. Our hopes are high that the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held at Stockholm in 1972, and the projected conference on the law of the sea will take the first major steps toward meeting the issues involved at the level and on the scale necessary to be effective.\n89.\tOnly a year ago this Assembly made an historic decision. It adopted for the first lime an International Development Strategy which would serve as the program of action for implementing the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. Today the international trade and monetary crisis, which is still unresolved, threatens to undermine that Strategy and casts a pall of uncertainty over the prospect of attending the goals of the Development Decade itself.\n90.\tBy far the most deplorable aspect of this crisis is the plight of the developing countries. Innocent bystanders, with no role either in precipitating me crisis or in its solution, these poor countries stand to suffer the gravest injuries from its consequences.\n91.\tThe predicament of the developing countries has been recognized by the President of the World Bank Group, Mr. Robert S, McNamara. In the introduction to his address to the World Bank's Board of Governors on 27 September, he declared and these are very important words:\n\\\"It is clear that we are in for a difficult period of basic readjustments in international monetary and trade arrangements and that the repercussions may continue for some time. Although the solution of these problems is not the responsibility of the World Bank, We are deeply concerned with the manner of their resolution because of the impact it may have on the external trade of the developing countries, and on the resource Rows to them\\\".\n92.\tMr. Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, Chairman of the Executive Board and Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, was even more explicit in his statement of the same date. He said:\n\u201cI am particularly concerned about the impact of the current situation on the developing countries. Inflation and balance of payments difficulties in the industrial world ... The present exchange rate uncertainties add a new and serious impediment to the development efforts of these countries, which also must contend with the effects of the U.S. import surcharge and the cuts in U.S. aid. All this is not an auspicious beginning for the Second Development Decade, when developing countries have the task of finding new avenues of productive employment for their growing populations. \n93.\tBoth officials stressed the need to take into account the plight of the poor countries in the search for a solution to the international trade and monetary crisis.\n94.\tMr. McNamara said:\n\\\"Whatever steps are taken to improve the operation of the international monetary system must be such as to permit a continuing increase in capital flows to meet the targets to which the developed countries have subscribed: an increase in public development assistance from $8 billion per year in 1970 to $12.5 billion in 1975\\\".\n95.\tMr. Schweitzer expressed the hope that the solution of the monetary crisis by the industrial countries would be followed \\\"by an increased willingness in these countries to maintain a steadily improving volume and quality of development assistance and to widen access to their markets\\\". \n96.\tSuch is the hope. But what is the reality? Mr. McNamara\u2019s own report contains the following sad and ominous admissions:\n\u201cThe developing countries have justifiable grounds for complaint that they are being treated unfairly in their attempts to expand their manufactured exports to those markets [the markets of the richer countries]. On the average, tariffs are higher on the kinds of manufactured goods imported from poor countries as compared to imports from rich countries\t\n\\\"Even worse than the absolute level of tariffs is their structure. Tariffs rise with the degree of fabrication ... This ... could well offset the comparative advantages in processing found in many developing countries\\\" \nHe continue.,.\n\\\"Finally, and perhaps worst of all, non-tariff barriers to trade have proliferated throughout the rich countries in\nrecent years ... They too are more severe for developing countries\\\".\n97.\tIn other words, the promotion of economic diversification, of a fair and rational international division of labor, and of the progressive industrialization of the developing countries, goals which are accepted in principle in the United Nations, are in fact being impeded if not actually negated in practice.\n98.\tNor is the sombre situation limited to manufactures. The Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization, Dr. Boerma, has called attention to what he has described as tlkD \\\"completely unbalanced\\\" state of world agriculture, warning that if this condition is allowed to persist, it might provoke intensified trade war.\n99.\tThere is something fundamentally wrong in an international economic order under which such things can happen. The Philippine delegation feels that the time has come for the United Nations to discharge fully its duties under paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 1 of the Charter with respect to international co-operation in the economic and social fields. It should henceforth be one of its urgent major concerns to help devise means of protecting the poor countries from the adverse effects of international monetary and trade crises concerning which these poor countries have little or no say but which could ruin them financially or set back their development efforts for years with disastrous economic and social consequences for their peoples. We must arrest the present accelerating drift towards a new age of domination based on economic advantage.\n100.\tIn other major fields if United Nations concern, the glaring discrepancies between principle and practice, between the felt needs of the international community and the limited action permitted by national ambitions and interests, are also apparent.\n101.\tDespite the welcome signs of growing detente in Europe, to which I have referred, peace in the Middle East continues to hang by the thread of a cease-fire tenuously maintained amidst a mutual escalation of armaments.\n102.\tIn this International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, no substantial progress has been achieved in the struggle against apartheid. Meanwhile, the flow of trade and investments, as well as the supply of arms, that sustain the practitioners of apartheid continue, hardly abated by United Nations sanctions against that universally condemned policy. Remnants of classical colonialism, which is also a form of racial oppression, likewise continue to exist in its last strongholds, particularly in Africa, in defiance of the United Nations Charter and of the repeatedly expressed will of the international community.\n103.\tEvery year, references are made to the need for a stronger support for the United Nations. Yet this same Organization has been permitted to reach the brink of financial bankruptcy. One major Power concerned has announced that it will contribute an \\\"important\\\" sum to help cover past United Nations financial deficiencies; other Powers equally concerned, however, have remained silent.\n104.\tThe present international trade and monetary crisis has simply dramatized the central dilemma that has afflicted the United Nations since its inception. The Member States, particularly the great Powers with the special responsibilities inherent in their status as permanent members of the Security Council, have never quite accepted the requirement, implicit in the Charter, to subordinate narrow national interests to the general well-being of mankind, or-as last year's Conference on Human Survival so aptly put it-to recognize that \\\"human sovereignty transcends national sovereignty\\\".\n105.\tIn moving from the era of frozen polarization into a new period of pluralization. it is essential to accept that the first requirement is for a flexible common instrument through which that pluralization can be constructively and creatively expressed. But although *hat instrument already exists in the United Nations, its full utility as the focal point for forging collective decisions has yet to be realized. \\\"Foreign policy\\\" in this sense is becoming obsolete. Nations now hold collective responsibility for r, non- divisible world. The policy-making emphasis will be more and more toward joint problem-solving for planetary development and management. Only in such a context can the security and freedom of nations and peoples be assured and the great promise of our earth for the well-being of mankind be realized.\n106.\tAnd now permit me to conclude my statement with three expressions of well-deserved tribute. The first is to Mr. Paul Hoffman, the exceptionally able Administrator of the United Nations Development program [UNDP], who is about to retire after some 12 years of devoted service to the cause of that indispensable component of lasting peace: economic and social development. Under Mr. Hoffman\u2019s inspired and dedicated leadership, UNDP has become the largest operational agency of the United Nations in the field of development with good prospects of doubling its operational funds to $500 million by 1975. This impressive progress has been achieved through far-sighted planning, sound operational methods, including the application of pre-investment aid in the vital sectors of national development programs, and effective response to the keenly felt needs of the developing nations. The United Nations owes Mr. Hoffman an inestimable debt of gratitude for his work in building up UNDP to its present size and its enhanced potential for service towards the accelerated development of the poor countries.\n107.\tMy second tribute is to the United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF], which is observing its twenty-fifth anniversary this year. Supported entirely by voluntary contributions, UNICEF has rendered invaluable service to countless mothers and children in needy countries throughout the world. Starting as an emergency operation, it has with admirable flexibility adapted its work to the changing requirements of the developing nations and is now involved in vital aspects of development concerning mothers, children, youth and the family. It deserves a special tribute for a quarter-century of devoted service to mankind under the direction of that distinguished humanitarian, the late Maurice Pate, and his worthy successor as Executive\n \nDirector, Mr. Henry Labouisse. The United Nations Children's Fund has merited our gratitude for having projected across national and ideological frontiers during the past 25 years the profound concern and compassion of the United Nations for the new generation of children and youth, who will have the responsibility of building a better world.\n108.\tFinally, I would like to pay a tribute to our modest, loyal and highly esteemed Secretary-General, U Thant. He has had the unprecedented responsibility of leading the United Nations Secretariat through an entire decade of grievous trials and crisis. And he has discharged this heavy responsibility so admirably that he could, if he wished, command unanimous support for continuing to occupy his eminent position. Much of his work for the preservation of peace, the promotion of human rights, and the attainment of a better life for all mankind has been accomplished by quiet diplomacy, an art in which he has few equals. A place of high honor is assured for him in the history of our time. And it is most fitting that this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly, which may be the last that U Thant is attending as Secretary-General, should salute him as one of the immortals of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": " I am most happy to have the opportunity and privilege of addressing this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to bring members the greetings of the people of Ceylon. May I at the outset convey to you, Mr. President, our warmest congratulations and best wishes on your election to the high office of President of this Assembly. It is a matter of particular pride and satisfaction to us in Ceylon that the Assembly has chosen, as the custodian of its rights and privileges on this occasion, a distinguished Foreign Minister of a neighboring country with which Ceylon has a history of close and cordial relations. Your ability, skill and experience are well known and I am sure will stand you in good stead in guiding our deliberations.\n2 I should also like to express our sincere appreciation of the valuable services rendered by your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro.\n3 I wish to take this opportunity also to add the warm tribute of my Government and of the peoples of Ceylon to UThant, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It has always been a matter of especial pride to us in Ceylon that a fellow Asian, indeed a national of a country with which we count many affinities and bonds, including common religious links, should not only have been chosen to be Secretary-General of this Organization but also have been, over so many years, honored with the confidence of the nations of the world. The United Nations has been fortunate in -the incumbents of the office of Secretary- General, and U Thant has stood in that great tradition. He has not only discharged the onerous responsibilities of his office with distinction, but has made important contributions to mold and shape the character of this office in accordance with the changing conditions of our times. We regret his retirement from this familiar scene where he has been preeminent, and we hope that he will continue to give of his wisdom and experience in the cause of humanity.\n4 Four new States have during lis session been admitted as Members of this Organization Bhutan, Bahrain, Qatar\nand Oman. We are happy to welcome them and are confident of their active co-operation in the achievement of the aims and objectives of this Organization.\n5.\tThis is the first time I have found myself in a position to appear before the Assembly and address a session of the United Nations. In doing so, my mind goes back to the eleventh session of the United Nations General Assembly, 15 years ago, when a Prime Minister of Ceylon, the late Mr. S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, last had occasion to address a session of this Assembly [590th meeting]. My late husband had an abiding faith in the United Nations and described it on that occasion as \\\"the only lifeline of humanity today\\\". As I stand on this rostrum today, as Prime Minister of my country, where also my late husband stood a decade and a half ago, the melancholy act of reminiscence evokes in me poignant memories of a deeply personal nature,\n6.\tMay I begin with a few preliminary remarks about my country. Ceylon is a Buddhist country which for 2,500 years has drawn its inspiration from the Dhamma as the guiding philosophy of the great majority of our people.\n7.\tPolitically, we enjoy a parliamentary system and a democratic way of life, which we are determined to preserve. We can point with legitimate pride to the fact that since we regained our independence in 1948 we have had five democratically elected Governments. It is through reliance on constitutional means alone that we are achieving the most decisive political, social, and economic changes in our country.\n8.\tDemocracy in Ceylon faced its severest test early this year, when an attempt was made by a revolutionary group to shatter the fabric of the system by violence. The protagonists were avowed enemies of the democratic process and were committed to a career of reckless destruction with no coherent policy or program of social and economic reconstruction to offer. Our success in quelling the insurgency is to be attributed to the strength of our political traditions, our way of life, our faith in democracy and the parliamentary form of government, our social and economic system under which class brings neither privilege nor disability and, above all, to the broad-based character of my Government, which ensured for it the support of the peasants and workers and the great mass of the youth of the country.\n9.\tCeylon's unhappy experience in this regard is not unique. There is a spirit of restlessness and frustration particularly among the youth of the world. It is the duty and the responsibility of Governments to show a proper understanding of the problems of the younger generation and to give them a greater sense of participation in the function of government. This means more than the exercise of the right of every citizen above the age of 18 to vote, a right that is already enjoyed in my country. It is my Government's firm resolve to do its utmost to fulfill the rightful aspirations and expectations of the youth of our country. In return, we ask of them a modicum of patience, a measure of trust and unswerving fidelity to the principles and practices of democracy. In dealing with the critical situation to which I have referred, we were fortunate in the prompt and substantial assistance that we received from many friendly States: the United States of America, the Soviet Union, India, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom* the Federal Republic of Germany, the Arab Republic of Egypt, the German Democratic Republic, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. We also received valuable help in the form of drugs and medical supplies from the International Red Cross. To them all I offer the grateful thanks of the Government and the people of my country. Our good fortune in being able to rely on assistance in this crisis from countries differing so widely from one another in their political and economic systems is a measure of the value and validity of the policy of non-alignment which we pursue.\n10.\tThe year 1956, when I first came to this Assembly with my late husband, is also linked with important developments in my country, for it was in that year that he committed Ceylon to the way of socialism and democracy, to non-alignment and to an independent foreign policy based on friendship with all countries, irrespective of differing ideological and social systems. He described his objectives at that Assembly in the following words:\n\\\"We have to build up a new society for ourselves; one, as I have said, which best suits the genius of our country. We should like to get some ideas and some principles from this side, and some from the other, until a coherent form of society is made up that suits our own people in the context of the changing world of today. That is why we do not range ourselves on the side of this power-bloc or that power-bloc\\\" [590th meeting, para. 38].\n11.\tA great deal has happened since those words were spoken. The United Nations has become more representative of the peoples of the world than it was when there were only 51 Members. There is a distinct possibility that it will soon become even more representative with the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in this Organization. International relationships have undergone profound changes, the most significant of all being the apparent end of the cold war. The division of the world into two power-blocs, each vying with the other to draw into their camp nations yet uncommitted, is steadily being blurred.\n12.\tThese dramatic changes have no doubt been due largely to the determination of small nations-the economically weak and the militarily insignificant to maintain their sovereignty and territorial integrity and to establish among themselves a unity founded on common interests and aspirations. This determination found-expression in our acceptance of the policy of non-alignment, which some 60 nations now espouse and whose testament of faith and purpose is inscribed in the Lusaka Declaration.  Ceylon, in common with these nations, has chosen to walk in the light of that wisdom which, in my opinion, is a blend of the noblest religious and ethical values in our human heritage. We believe that the philosophy of non-alignment combines the essence of the Buddhist doctrine of a middle path that eschews extremes and the democratic concept of a free society that recognizes the legitimacy of dissent with the dialectical vision of dynamic conflict and synthesis. It also represents the final repudiation of the colonial heritage and its replacement by a world of free sovereign and equal States.\n13.\tAlthough threats to peace continue to distract us, there has been some slight relaxation of tensions. In particular, there has been a marked trend towards the removal of artificial barriers which have prevented communication between powerful nations or between parts of divided nations and kept the world in a state of psychological turmoil. The most noteworthy of these developments are the decision of the President of the United States of America to visit the People's Republic of China, the recent Berlin accord  and the prospect of a European security conference, which will include the United States of America and Canada. The Moscow Treaty of 1970  and the Warsaw Treaty of December 1970  could, upon ratification, together with the Berlin accord, offer the promise of a durable understanding in Europe the effects of which wouU be felt throughout the world.\n14.\tAsia continues to be the scene of ruthless war and intractable conflict. In Viet-Nam the opposing sides continue to reject each other's peace plans and only a bold act of statesmanship can resolve the present deadlock.\n15.\tThe continuing crisis in West Asia is a matter of deep concern to us. Almost four years have passed since the Security Council unanimously agreed on a settlement, but a solution appear* as remote as ever. Worse still, the policies of the Government of Israel in the occupied territories bear all the marks of the permanent consolidation of an illegal occupation. The United Nations should not neglect or forget its responsibilities towards the Palestinian people.\n16.\tThe recent political disturbances in East Pakistan have produced a problem that is not confined to the territory of Pakistan. The influx of refugees from East Pakistan into India has placed a heavy burden on India's resources. The refugee problem is a humanitarian one and must be the concern of the entire international community. The settlement of this problem calls for urgent and imaginative action. Ceylon scrupulously adheres to a policy of abstaining from interference in the internal affairs of States. While emphasizing this policy, I must express the earnest hope that accelerated democratic and constitutional procedures will be allowed which would enable the refugees to return to their homes in East Pakistan and eliminate any possible threat to international peace and security,\n17.\tThe main purpose of my address today is to place before this Assembly a proposal which, if accepted, could make a positive and far-reaching contribution to the cause of peace. I propose that the Indian Ocean be declared a zone of peace. The item has been inscribed on the agenda of this session [item 98] as an important and urgent one.\n18.\tThe proposal is not a completely new one. The concept of a zone of peace is inherent in the concept of non-alignment, which requires that the land territories, air space and territorial waters of non-aligned States must be closed to great-Power conflicts and rivalries. All areas under the jurisdiction of non-aligned States should, therefore, be by definition zones of peace. The peace-zone concept as applied to ocean areas, however, goes back to the Second Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, held at Cairo in October 1964. We were concerned then with one aspect of the question: the establishment of zones free of atomic weapons in various parts of the world, including Asia. In September 1970, at the Lusaka Conference of Non-Aligned States, we went a stage further and called for a peace zone in the Indian Ocean, which would be one not only free of nuclear weapons but also one from which great-Power rivalries and competition would be excluded. It was the intrusion of those power rivalries into the Indian Ocean that resulted in the loss of political freedom in Asia in the eighteenth century. We certainly do not wish to see a recurrence of that situation. Our object is to contain the activities of foreign Powers and ensure that they do not make our part of the world a battleground for their rivalries.\n19.\tThe global implications of the proposal require that it should receive universal acceptance and be fitted into the larger design of world peace and security and of general and complete disarmament. These were among the considerations that led me to present the proposal to the meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in Singapore at the beginning of this year. I now commend it to the General Assembly of the United Nations. The proposal should not be regarded merely as part of a scheme of collective security confined to the Indian Ocean. On the contrary, it is intended as a direct and tangible contribution to the Disarmament Decade and to the strengthening of conditions for world peace.\n20.\tIn recent' years there has been a trend in the development of international law and practice towards the principle that areas not assimilated to national jurisdiction constitute an international domain that should be subject to international regulation and international responsibility. Existing circumstances in the Indian Ocean, as distinct from other oceans of the world, are especially conducive to the application of this policy to the area. There are no nuclear Powers or any major maritime nations among the littoral States of the Indian Ocean. All such nations are in fact geographically remote from the area and have no reason to consider the Indian Ocean as critical or vital to their security and strategic interests. The military and naval forces of the great Powers in the Indian Ocean have not yet assumed significant proportions, and the adoption of the Indian Ocean peace-zone proposal would not involve us in the necessity of making elaborate provision for the dismantling of existing military bases and installations, as would be the case in other areas.\n21.\tWe recognize the fact that important commercial sea-lanes lie across the Indian Ocean. The use of these sea-lanes is crucial to the interests of the great Powers and other non-littoral States. Any arrangements to give effect to our proposal should, accordingly, take due account of these interests. The littoral States, however, have a paramount interest in the defense and security of these lines of communication. At their level of development they need conditions of peace and tranquility to transform and modernize their economies. Their energies and resources must be preserved intact and employed exclusively for the advancement of the social and economic well-being of their peoples. They could be freed from all liability for the defense and security of the area if all other nations would refrain from any military intrusion into the area.\n22.\tSeveral questions will be raised in regard to the proposal. What geographical limits are contemplated for the zone of peace? What are the implications of the proposal for the principle of the freedom of the seas? What is the regulatory system envisaged? What is to be the future of already existing bases falling within the prescribed zone? Will present treaty commitments be affected? What type of international instrument would be needed to establish such a regime? We have given some thought to these matters and have some general ideas as to the answers. We hope that countries interested in the proposal will join with us in resolving these issues.\n23.\tThe essence of our proposal is that in the Indian Ocean a defined area shall be declared to be a zone of peace and which shall be reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes under an appropriate regulatory system. Within the zone, no armaments of any kind, defensive or offensive, may be installed on or in the sea, on the sub-adjacent sea-bed or on land areas; ships of all nations may exercise the right of transit, but warships and ships carrying warlike equipment, including submarines, may not stop for other than emergency reasons of a technical, mechanical or humanitarian nature; no maneuvers by warship of any State shall be permitted; naval intelligence operations shall be forbidden; no weapons tests of any kind may be conducted. The regulatory system to be established will be under effective international control.\n24.\tIt may be argued that a zone of peace in an ocean area would be incompatible with a body of customary and conventional international law which seeks to preserve the seas beyond territorial waters as open to all nations. There is no reason why this concept should not be modified to accommodate the needs and realities of the world of today. One may go so far as to say that the principle of the freedom of the high seas does not adequately serve the fundamental interests of all nations alike but is clearly weighted in favor of the interests of the dominant user nations. This inequality must be redressed.\n25.\tI sincerely hope that this session of the General Assembly will take concrete measures for the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean and thereby make a signal contribution to the cause of international peace and the well-being of a large section of mankind.\n26.\tThe problems and difficulties that have afflicted Ceylon's economy for the past 15 years or more persist, with no signs of alleviation or improvement. The prices of our exports have continued to show a remorseless and sharp decline. A 1971 report of the World Bank, commenting on the current economic situation in Ceylon, points out that, through price declines of its major export products alone, Ceylon lost roughly $U.S. 680 million in exchange earnings in the 1960s. Our total export earnings in 1970 were lower than the export earnings in any year between 1954 and 1968. In 1970 our earnings from our three major exports were only 4 per cent higher than the earnings in 1950. The most striking example of the failure of increased productivity and increased export volume to produce commensurate rewards in the form of higher export earnings is provided by our principal export, tea. Between 1947 and 1970, although the volume of our tea exports rose by 60 per cent, our total earnings from tea exports increased by only 10 per cent.\n27.\tIn contrast, there has been a sharp rise in the prices payable by us on our imports. This problem has been accentuated by the even higher prices payable on imports obtained on credit or other aid arrangements.\n28.\tSeveral increases in freight charges have also imposed a further strain on Ceylon's external payments position. These factors and the poor prices obtained for two of our major exports, tea and rubber, have been mainly responsible for the deterioration in our terms of trade. That is clearly demonstrated by the fact that, had the prices of our exports and imports remained at their 1959 levels, the actual volume of our exports and imports in the period 1965-1969 would have resulted in surpluses rather than deficits in our current account.\n29.\tForeign aid is no substitute for fair and just prices for our exports and for the expansion of trade. It carries with it the obligation of increasing debt-service burdens to which special reference has been made in the World Bank report, with Ceylon cited as a case in point.\n30.\tThe most pressing problem my Government has to face is the high and rising level of unemployment. The creation of employment calls for a high level of investment. While I am prepared to call upon our people to make the sacrifices which even a modest program of development would demand, I hope that a conscientious effort will be made by the developed nations to ensure the conditions necessary for steady economic growth in countries like mine namely, fair and stable prices for our exports, equitable terms of trade, the avoidance of punitive freight surcharges and a steady and assured flow of foreign finance on much less stringent terms than at present.\n31.\tThe International Development Strategy adopted at the twenty-fifth session [resolution 2626 (XXV)] points the direction. In a few days from now the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in preparation for the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] will begin in Lima. The message that Conference should convey to the community of developed nations is that social pressures within the developing countries can be eased and political stability ensured only if a steady level of economic growth is maintained. What we seek is social justice on an international scale.\n32.\tOne of the purposes of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples. Although many countries have succeeded in freeing themselves from colonial rule, there remains a large area of southern Africa whose peoples continue to suffer under the oppressive burden of foreign domination. J. refer particularly to Portuguese colonialism in Africa, South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and the racist minority regime in Zimbabwe.\n33.\tAlong with many other countries that respect the principles of the Charter, we have, both at the United Nations and in other international forums, consistently urged the liquidation of the last vestiges of colonialism. At the Lusaka Conference of Non-Aligned Countries, in September 1970, a definite program of action was adopted to that end. The General Assembly has a clear duty to intensify its efforts to complete the emancipation of the human race.\n34.\tThe vicious policy of racial discrimination that continues to be followed by Governments and regimes that are totally insensitive to enlightened world opinion calls for its immediate eradication through concerted measures on the part of countries within this Organization and outside it which respect the spiritual and cultural values of our civilization. The United Nations should not allow the millions who continue to be the victims of racial discrimination to languish in despair.\n35.\tThe last three decades have witnessed spectacular advances in technology that have transcended the most imaginative forecasts of fiction. The moon and outer space have been conquered. In the seas and oceans man may now not merely take his traditional harvest of rood but may also extract from the ocean depths the mineral wealth that could bring increased prosperity and rapid improvement in the quality of his life.\n36.\tMy Government warmly welcomed the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction adopted without dissent by this Assembly during its twenty-fifth session [resolution 2749 (XXV)]. Some two thirds of this planet are thereby declared to be the common heritage of mankind, to be reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes and to be explored and exploited for the benefit of mankind as a whole and for the developing countries in particular. That Declaration will remain a monument to those whose vision of a just and orderly world first inspired us to preserve that vast area of our planet from competitive exploitation for selfish ends. I am particularly pleased that Ceylon's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, as Chairman of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, contributed in no small measure to the negotiation and adoption of that important Declaration.\n37.\tMy Government also welcomed the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof [resolution 2660 (XXV)] as a first step towards excluding those areas from the arms race.\n38.\tIt is my earnest hope that the same high level of statesmanship, co-operation and mutual understanding that called into being those two historic instruments will be displayed in the current negotiations by the Committee on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, which has been entrusted by this Assembly with the responsibility of preparing for a third conference on the law of the sea.\n39.\tMy Government sincerely hopes that this session of the General Assembly will see the final disposal of the question of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and its related organizations. We have throughout maintained that the China that was the founder Member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council was not to be identified by reference to a particular group of individuals, that is, Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters. Rather, it is to be identified as a geographical, political and juridical entity which is now known as the Peopled Republic of China and has been known as such ever since Chiang Kai-shek was ousted from power and sought refuge on the island of Formosa, taking with him only the name but not the allegiance of the country and people on whose behalf he signed the Charter.\n40.\tThe reality can no longer be ignored , and there is hope that at long last the incongruous and legally insupportable contention that Chiang Kai-shek and his group represent China will be unequivocally rejected and that the real representatives of the real China the People's Republic of China will assume their rightful seat in this Organization. There is no question whatsoever of the expulsion of a Member of the United Nations. Taiwan has never enjoyed the legal status of membership in the United Nations.\n41.\tIt has been both an honor and a privilege for me to address this Assembly. The 131 nations represented here jointly share the responsibility and the power to establish justice, to maintain peace and to ensure progress in our troubled world. We have the Charter and a formidable body of international law, including declarations and resolutions, to illumine our path towards those goals. It is in our minds alone that darkness still exists, a darkness created by fear, hatred and suspicion. Our problem is to rid our minds of those darkening elements. To this problem, as to many others, the answers were provided 2,500 years ago in the teachings of Gautama Buddha as expressed in the Dhammapada:\n\\\"In all, the primal element is mind; pre-eminent is mind; by mind is all made. If a man speaks or acts uprightness of mind, happiness follows him close like his never-departing shadow.\\\"\n\n\n\n\n"

I should also like to add the voice of the Polish delegation to the many and well-deserved expressions of deep gratitude to the President of the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session, Mr. Edvard Hambro.\n4 Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 16.\n108.\tI should also like to welcome the admission into the United Nations family of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar, which from now on will be able to participate actively and constructively in the realization of the great purposes and tasks of our Organization.\n109.\tThe Polish delegation takes a favorable view of the development of the international situation at the beginning of the second quarter-century of the existence and activities of the United Nations. We share the sober but far from pessimistic view contained in the introduction to the port of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"It is well to remember that the decade under review has seen a number of encouraging trends in the political life of the international community. These developments justify reasonable hopes that the climate in which the United Nations operates is improving and will continue to improve.\\\" [A/8401/Add. 1, para. 1 0.J\n110.\tAs the representative of the Polish People's Republic, a country which has also, with justified hopes and broad, favorable prospects, entered a new period of development a development that has; not always been easy for us I should like to give an assurance that, in accordance with the basic peace-loving principles of Polish foreign policy, the Polish People's Republic will make what contribution it can towards a detente and towards peaceful coexistence in Europe and throughout the world. In close co-operation and friendship with the Soviet Union and the other States of the socialist community, we will advocate the further development and expansion of relations of all kinds with all States which are willing to reciprocate our readiness to co-operate and in practice, together with us, implement the principles of peaceful coexistence. It is in this direction, towards the goal of practical, realistic and fruitful international co-operation, that we shall continue to act in the United Nations and in other international organizations.\n111.\tIn particular, we should like to give real force to the efforts directed towards the strengthening of international security, that most important question on which the interest and the activities of our Organization are focused in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. The fact that a Declaration on this matter [resolution 2734 (XXV)] was adopted unanimously at the commemorative session of the General assembly is proof of the growing trend towards strengthening peace which can be observed within the United Nations.\n112.\tAll States, in the east and the west, the south and the north, large, medium and small, can play an important role in the great and essential task of strengthening international security and developing multilateral co-operation in political, economic, social and cultural matters. It is true that, according to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, which have been proved correct in practice, the principal responsibility for maintaining peace and strengthening security rests on the great Powers. In the modern world, where all States are interdependent, no one can deny that general responsibility for attaining this important goi rests on mankind as a whole.\n113.\tContemporary international relations are developing at a time of profound revolutionary transformations. A\nspecific factor which is leaving its mark on the history and development of the United Nations is the struggle of progressive forces in ail sectors of modern life against the forces of reaction and conservatism, and the struggle of supporters of peace against supporters of policies based on a position of strength.\n114.\tIn recent times, the Polish People's Republic has once again demonstrated its resolve to give active support to the forces of peace and international co-operation. Polish diplomacy has made and will continue to make efforts directed towards the establishment of a regional security system in Europe which would become an important link in strengthening world security. We wish to contribute to progress towards normalization in Europe both by our day-to-day practice of constructive bilateral co-operation with individual countries and by active participation in efforts directed towards developing multilateral cooperation. We welcome the fact that the proposal for the convening of a European conference on security and co-operation has already neared the stage of implementation. Intensive consultations in which Poland is participating actively have produced a far-reaching identity of views among all States concerned on such questions as the desirability of convening such a conference, the location of the conference in Helsinki, the participation of all European States and also of the United States of America and Canada, the possibility of planning a series of such meetings, and the desirability of establishing a permanent organ as a result of the conference. Some progress can also be noted in the consultations directed towards reaching agreement on the main elements of the agenda of the first conference, which in addition to the question of strengthening European security, should give due consideration also to questions relating to the strengthening of economic, scientific, technical and cultural ties linking the peoples of Europe.\n115.\tThe establishment of a stable system of security and co-operation in Europe requires a further continuation of the dialog which has been begun, and also an expansion of that dialog in order to prepare for an early convening of the conference in the course of multilateral consultations. Poland will continue to participate actively in the preparations for the conference and expects a constructive attitude on the part of all States concerned. We have noted with satisfaction the statements made here by a number of outstanding representatives of European States, especially the Minister of Foreign Affairs of France, Mr. Schumann [1942nd meeting], in favor of the earliest possible convening of the conference.\n116.\tWe consider that in such circumstances no State can or should delay, directly or indirectly, the preparations for the conference, which have already reached an advanced stage. Each State should determine its conduct in international affairs on the basis of how that conduct would assist or impede a detente and bring nearer or delay the conference. To permit and encourage the activities of subversive centers, or to return now to cold-war methods in relations between States, could only lead to the isolation of those initiating or instigating such actions.\nrecognition by all European States of the realities resulting from the Second World War and the acceptance of the political map of central Europe. The Treaty on the Bases for the Normalization of Relations between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, signed at Warsaw on 7 December 1970, and the Treaty between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, signed at Moscow on 12 August 1970, which is of even greater political significance, constitute an important step towards the general and complete normalization of relations in Europe. The next essential step, and one which must not be delayed, is the ratification and implementation of both these Treaties. We hope that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, in accordance with its declared intentions, will as quickly as possible take the appropriate steps on its side to ensure that those Treaties enter into force as soon as possible. That is an essential condition for the further normalization of relations between the socialist countries and the Federal Republic of Germany. For its part, the Government of the Polish People's Republic has expressed its readiness to establish diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany immediately after the Treaty signed on 7 December 1970 comes into force. That would serve the interests of both parties to the Treaty as well as the peaceful development of relations in Europe.\n118.\tWe are convinced that the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland, and also with the other socialist countries, will make it possible for the Federal Republic of Germany to participate fully in efforts to promote European security and co-operation, since we consider that the Federal Republic of Germany can and must play a positive and constructive role in international affairs, especially in Europe.\n119.\tWe hope that in the near future relations between Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany will also be normalized. In this matter we fully support the position of the fraternal country of Czechoslovakia that the Munich Agreement should be recognized as invalid from the beginning.\n120.\tOne of the basic factors in the post-war balance of forces in Europe has been the establishment and successful development of the German Democratic Republic, with which Poland is linked by close ties of friendship and co-operation and which is playing an active and increasingly important role in Europe and in the world.\n121.\tA new and extremely important political event has been the achievement of a four-Power agreement on West Berlin.5 As a result of the realistic position taken by all the parties concerned, possibilities are opening up for the elimination of a dangerous hotbed of conflict which has existed in the very heart of Europe for 20 years. The Treaty safeguards the interests of all parties and should help to strengthen peace in Europe.\n122.\tA further essential step directed towards removing the vestiges of the past in Europe must be the universal recognition of the two sovereign German States and the\n117. The basic condition for the general normalization of relations and stable security on our continent is the\nestablishment of relations with them on the basis of existing norms of international law, Relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should also be based on these same principles. Both these States should be admitted simultaneously to the United Nations. Before this takes place, there should be an immediate end to the discrimination against the German Democratic Republic which has continued to this day and which is reflected in the German Democratic Republic being denied the right to have its own permanent observer at the United Nations, while the Federal Republic of Germany does have such an observer.\n123.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, U Thant correctly draws attention to the need to settle this question [A/84011Add.l, para, 106J.\n124.\tThe principle of universality, which is so strongly emphasized in the Charter of the United Nations, is based on the premise that the composition of the United Nations should reflect the real alignment of forces in the world. On the basis of this principle Poland has for many years advocated, and still advocates, the restoration to the People's Republic of China of its lawful place in the United Nations and its full rights, and the simultaneous exclusion of the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from all United Nations organs.\n125.\tAmong the reasons for our favorable view of current trends in the international situation and possibilities for constructive action by the United Nations are certain genuine successes in the field of arms limitation. Poland sees a very dangerous element in the continuing arms race which could lead to unforeseeable consequences for mankind. We see the senselessness of expending on armaments enormous material resources which should be used to raise the standard of living of the peoples. Our economy, too, feels this burden, and we would like to reduce it. We are convinced that world security should be built not on a spiraling arms race but on the constant and progressive limitation of armaments.\n126.\tWe consider that an international system of legal prohibitions and limitations should be established which could prevent, limit and, finally, remove the threat of war. Proceeding from this premise, Poland has during recent years contributed to the achievement of a number of agreements limiting the arms race.\n127.\tIt is difficult to overestimate the impact on international relations of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. We hope that it will become possible in the near future to conclude a treaty banning underground nuclear tests, too. We cannot understand the position of some States which are putting artificial obstacles in the way of further measures to reduce the threat of a nuclear war. I am referring in particular to those States which are refusing to sign, or are delaying ratification of, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and thus making its full implementation impossible.\n128.\tPoland attaches particular importance to the full and practical implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the crucial area of central Europe. For that reason we hope that States in that area which have so far not ratified the Treaty will do so without further delay, and will participate in negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency with a view to signing safeguards agreements. Poland was already agreed upon the text of an agreement with the Agency on this matter.\n129.\tWe hope that the present session will approve the draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons [AI8457-DC/234, annex A], of which Poland is a sponsor. At the same time, it is our profound hope that a convention on the complete elimination of chemical weapons will soon be drawn up. We hope for further progress towards the exclusion from the arms race of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof and, eventually, the complete demilitarization of that area.\n130.\tThe long list of measures which could contribute to the halting of the arms race on a regional level and to regional disarmament includes the concept of nuclear-free zones, with which Poland has been closely involved. At an earlier stage we initiated that concept. We are pleased that the establishment of nuclear-free zones is now spoken of frequently and with very specific reference to certain areas of the world. We continue to take an interest in the establishment of such zones, especially in central Europe, where the powder kegs-if I may use that traditional metaphor in referring to the most up-to-date nuclear weapons and delivery systems-are particularly dense. I recall that our concept of the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in central Europe provided not only for the limitation and subsequent elimination of nuclear weapons. We have always linked the establishment of such zones with concrete measures for the freezing and subsequent limitation of conventional armaments under appropriate forms of supervision.\n131.\tWe still have the same approach to regional disarmament measures. I cannot but observe here that the list of proposals made by Poland and the other socialist States on regional disarmament measures has always been more concrete and fuller than any proposals ever made by the Western allies. I should like, however, to stress the concrete nature of the proposals put forward by our northern neighbors. I should like here to remind you of the Kekkonen and Unden Plans. We continue to be prepared to discuss regional disarmament in Europe, and we shall consider every proposal on the matter if it is sufficiently clear and concrete and does not violate the balance of security of which Europe has so much need. We want to consider this problem not just for the sake of considering it, but in order to attain a specific goal which would benefit Europe.\n132.\tWe are observing with great interest the progress of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between- the Governments of the Soviet Union and the United States of America. We welcome the progress which has been achieved in those talks, and we hope that they will achieve still more tangible and positive results, as the entire international community expects.\n133.\tWe also support the proposal made by the Government of the Soviet Union regarding the convening of a conference of the five nuclear Powers [A/8328J. We should like to be confirmed in our view that the negative attitude of certain nuclear Powers is still not a final position. We are sure that it would be extremely significant for world security if all States which possessed nuclear weapons made joint efforts to reach agreement on the limitation and subsequent elimination of existing nuclear arsenals.\n134.\tPoland gives full support to the proposal of the Soviet Union put forward by Mr. Gromyko in his statement on 28 September [1942nd meeting] regarding the convening of a world disarmament conference [A/L.631], the purpose of which would be to enable all States in the world to consider essential and realistic measures designed to limit the dangerous and \\\"expensive arms race, and agree upon joint measures for disarmament. This conference, in our opinion, should be held in the near future. It should open up prospects for real progress in disarmament, must give new concrete force to efforts towards implementing the principle of peaceful coexistence and peaceful cooperation among peoples.\n135.\tIt is obvious that the policy based on positions of strength pursued by certain States, which results in acts of open aggression, neo-colonialist policies and domination over other peoples, is at variance with these principles.\n136.\tThe aggressive war against the peoples of Indo-China continues. Despite the demands of world public opinion, including a considerable section of American public opinion, the Government of the United States continues to refuse to adopt a constructive approach to the peace proposals put forward in Paris by the delegation of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam and supported by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam. These proposals also enjoy the full support of the Polish people and Government. Neither the continuation of the war in Indo-China with the aid of local mercenary forces, nor the co-operation of sham Governments with no authority or popular support, will bring peace in Indo-China any nearer. On the contrary, the setting of an early date for the final and complete withdrawal of foreign troops from South Viet-Nam and respect for the rights of the Viet-Namese people to self-determination constitute the correct approach for a peaceful end to the conflict. From this rostrum we express the hope that these proposals will finally be accepted by the party responsible for the war in Indo-China. Such a step would be in the clear interests of the American people. The expansion of military operations by interventionist forces and the dangerous resumption of the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam are exacerbating the conflict and delaying its end, although there is no doubt as to its final result victory for the right of the peoples of Indo-China to decide their own future for themselves.\n137.\tIt would long ago have been possible to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Middle East if Israel had shown a minimum of goodwill in the matter. In reality, that State, which V \u201es been illegally occupying Arab territories for several years, stubbornly rejects and ignores Security Council resolutions, including the latest Council resolution on the question of Jerusalem, resolution 298 (1971), and also General Assembly decisions.\n138.\tIsrael does not even reply to the letters from the Secretary-General and his representative, Ambassador Gunnar Jarring. The international community should no longer tolerate such a blatant challenge from Israel and its rich protectors. A peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Middle East is possible only if full respect for the rights of the Arab peoples, the victims of aggression, is ensured, and if Israel withdraws from all the occupied territories.\n139.\tPoland, like other European States, has an interest in the opening of the Suez Canal, which was closed as a result of aggression, to the detriment of the economic interests of many countries. We support the efforts directed towards opening the Suez Canal to shipping, but we regard the attainment of a possible agreement on that matter only as a step leading to a settlement of the Middle East conflict as a whole.\n1^0. There is no doubt that a peaceful and just settlement of the situation in Korea could have been achieved if the basic conditions had been met to enable the Korean people to exercise their right to self-determination: the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. We regret that these urgent and pressing questions have not been included in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. Poland gives full and decisive support to the realistic proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which set out a correct program and platform for the peaceful unification of the country without any interference from outside.\n141.\tThe developing situation on the Indian subcontinent is a subject of serious concern for us and for the whole international community. The fate of millions of refugees from East Pakistan seeking shelter across the border in the territory of India is a dramatic humanitarian problem on an unprecedented scale. We are certain that all possible efforts should be made to save human lives in such difficult conditions. Poland had contributed within the limits of its capacity to efforts to provide help to the innumerable masses of refugees. We hope that the Government of Pakistan, for its part, will take measures to achieve an appropriate political settlement of the critical situation in East Pakistan, so that it will be possible to begin the process of returning the refugees to their native land and remove the tension in relations between Pakistan and India.\n142.\tOne of the most important and complex tasks which continues to face us in this second half of the twentieth century is the need to eliminate the anachronistic colonial and racist regimes in a considerable part of the territory of Africa. Events which have occurred recently in Guinea and Senegal are a convincing illustration of a well-known truth that aggression is an intrinsic characteristic of colonialism. The Special Missions sent by the Security Council in connexion with the situation which had arisen in Guinea and Senegal, in which Poland had the honor to participate, confirmed that a state of threat does exist there. We express our full support for the African peoples and for the Organization of African Unity in their just struggle against the Portuguese colonialists and against the racist regimes in Southern Rhodesia and the Republic of South Africa, which are supported by foreign monopolies and imperialist\ncircles. The joint struggle of the anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist forces must in the near future bring the freedom which has been awaited by all peoples still suffering under the colonial and racist yoke, in accordance with the right of peoples to self-determination, a right which was once again recognized as universal in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the question of Namibia.\n143.\tThe appropriate organization of international economic relation's has an important influence on the contemporary world situation as a whole. It should be based on full respect for the sovereignty of all States, large and small, and the interests of their economic development, and should also ensure that each country has opportunities for economic growth and occupies a place in the international division of labor corresponding to its needs and circumstances.\n144.\tOne of the most regrettable consequences of the policy of imperialism was the imposition on many enslaved peoples of the exclusive role of suppliers of cheap raw materials and cheap labor, while those who arrogated to themselves the right to a privileged place in the sun retained for themselves a monopoly over wealth and knowledge, technology and civilization. The lamentable consequences of colonialism for the development of the international economy can still be felt. The present currency crisis in the Western countries, which is causing serious interruptions in international trade, has a particularly powerful effect on the economies of the developing countries. How can we remove this historical injustice and establish normal conditions for the development of each country, and place international economic relations on a correct basis?\n145.\tFirstly, we must strive to identify all overt and covert forms of neo-colonialist exploitation in the developing countries by foreign monopolies, an exploitation which so often exceeds the loudly publicized assistance granted to those countries. Secondly, we must ensure the removal of all forms of economic discrimination and all other barriers and limitations to the development of international economic co-operation.\n146.\tIn the \\\"cold-war\\\" period the practice spread through the capitalist countries of discriminating against imports from the socialist countries for political reasons. Simultaneously, an embargo was imposed on large quantities of goods which might with benefit have been exported to the socialist countries and there was discrimination in the field of credit policy. Poland has an interest in extensive and mutually beneficial trade with Western partners, too. In striving to strengthen and extend the policy of detente and peaceful co-operation in all fields, we have shown and are continuing to show, on all suitable occasions and in all areas of activity, including GATT, great initiative in the practical development of trade and economic co-operation with the Western countries. In particular, we have made efforts to establish industrial co-operation with the highly developed Western countries, thus increasing opportunities for the revival of trade relations.\n147.\tOur own national experience also determines our position regarding the economic problems of the developing countries. We are making consistent efforts to fulfill the\nobligations which arise from our sense of international solidarity. We note a significant growth in trade with those countries and changes in the structure of trade which are beneficial to them. We have consistently expressed and continue to express our readiness to expand and intensify economic relations with them and we are prepared to conclude long-term treaties and contracts for the supply of goods. In accordance with the wishes expressed by many countries, we are also considering the possibility of concluding an agreement concerning the partial division of labor. We are also ready to establish joint undertakings, in cases where that would be of mutual interest. As far as possible, ,we shall make a contribution to the training of the necessary skilled personnel for developing countries.\n148.\tHie elimination of all existing forms of discrimination and barriers in trade relations, the promotion of increased imports from the developing countries and changes in the structure of trade in order not to impose on those States the role of mere suppliers of raw materials, the extensive development of various forms of industrial, scientific and technological co-operation, assistance in the training of skilled personnel, full respect for the sovereign rights of each State over its own resources and, in particular, for the free determination of its own future and its own form of existence-these are the principles on which international economic relations must be based so that our efforts may be rewarded with peace and prosperity.\n149.\tIn this context I should like to draw attention to an important aspect of international co-operation, namely, the establishment of the most favorable conditions for the dissemination of up-to-date information in the field of technology. We are convinced that the United Nations has a very important role to play in this field. In our opinion, this task can and must be carried out in particular by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, in which much attention has already been given to these problems. An important role should also be played by the United Nations Development program, with which our country cooperates actively.\n150.\tAs we see it, United Nations activities in the field of science and technology should be directed not only towards direct temporary assistance to the developing countries in this field which is important but also towards the establishment and improvement of conditions for general technological progress. To this end we believe that it is important to organize an exchange of technological achievements between the developed countries with the help of the appropriate United Nations bodies. Scientific and technological co-operation, in its modern sense, should encompass the whole developmental cycle, that is to say, research, development and application. Failure to take these requirements into account retards technological progress and is a symptom of discrimination against certain less developed countries by more developed countries. Such forms ox discrimination result in delaying the establishment of a base for the development of technology .in countries which do not yet possess such knowledge.\n151.\tAnother important and increasingly significant problem is the protection of the human environment. Poland is expanding its widespread activities in this field at the national level, and has associated itself actively with the\nwork of organizations in the United Nations family, including the preparations for the United Nations conference on the Human Environment to be held in Stockholm in 1972. In this matter we proceed from the premise that only international action can limit the consequences and reduce the danger of irresponsible, rapacious, unplanned exploitation of the natural resources of the earth, and of the air and the sea.\n152.\tAt its present session the General Assembly has a very full agenda before it. It reflects important international problems during the consideration of which the Polish delegation intends to co-operate actively in the search for constructive solutions. The general picture of the development of the international situation which I have outlined in this statement shows, in particular, the need for our Organization, whose fundamental structures and principles are set out in the Charter of the United Nations and have withstood the test of time, to look for new, more creative and effective methods of achieving its goals. This cannot be achieved by mechanical increases in the Organization's expenditure, which have already brought it to a serious financial crisis, nor by an excessive expansion of its machinery. The Polish delegation holds the view that only if efforts are concentrated on the most important tasks and the role of the United Nations in the field of peaceful coexistence and the security of peoples is strengthened will the Organization be able to carry out fully its important task in the second quarter-century of its existence.\n153.\tAs we have already stated, the effective discharge of those tasks depends on the constructive co-operation of all States. In> those joint efforts, my country and my Government will make their conscientious contribution. In that connexion, I should like to state that my Government is now prepared to place a Polish armed contingent at the disposal of the Security Council of the United Nations, which could in case of need use it for actions necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n154.\tI do not think that there is any need to speak i n detail of the significance we attach to the role and activities of the Security Council. We would merely like to point out once again that our Organization has not so far made use of all the opportunities which the Charter of the United Nations offered to the Security Council, especially in Chapters VI and VII. I consider that a more thorough approach to we haw hitherto had to all the provisions of the Charter can give us the answer and demonstrate how our Organization can act better and more effectively to strengthen international security.\n155.\tOf course, we have a proper appreciation of the responsibility borne by the Secretary-General. It is with this in mind that we note with regret that the Secretary-General, U Thant, who enjoys our fullest respect, intends to relinquish his duties as Secretary-General at the end of his present term. Experience and continuity in the post and a profound knowledge of the administrative machinery of the United Nations and the political possibilities of our Organization are undoubtedly an extremely important argument against frequent changes in that post, as far as that is possible.\n156, Allow roe in conclusion to express the hope that the favorable issues which have emerged in recent years on\nthe international scene will be consolidated, and that the United Nations will become a more effective center of co-operation between all peoples in solving the difficult and important questions of the modern world than it has hitherto been. Only then will we be able to say with a large measure of justification that we and our Organization have carried out well the tasks confronting us and have heJped to ensure that humanity makes a more rational and fruitful use of the trust placed in it by history.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n154.\t : It is not only in order to keep up a tradition that I shall start my statement by presenting to you, Mr. President, the congratulations of my delegation, and my own congratulations, on your election as President of this session. Your election is not only an honor to you but also a tribute to your country and the whole Asian continent, to which we are linked by so many common concerns and common aspirations. Your long political experience and your clear awareness of the problems of today's world are, we are convinced, the best guarantee for a successful session.\n155.\tIt is also a pleasant duty for me to address our thanks to Mr. Hambro, who presided with competence and authority over the twenty-fifth session, which will remain an especially important one in the history of our Organization.\n156.\tFour new independent States have been admitted to our Organization. Those four countries-Bhutan, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman-whose arrival among us we greet with the warmest sympathy, will make their contribution to the search for and strengthening of peace in the world, that peace without which the independence of young States would have only a formal significance. In bidding them welcome to the international community I should like to present to them the best wishes of Algeria and its people for a prosperous future and happiness for their peoples.\n157.\tEach session of our General Assembly, in offering us an opportunity of undertaking a general consideration of the international situation, of drawing up a balance-sheet of our activities, and an inventory of our difficulties, invariably leads us to a somewhat pessimistic assessment of the evolution of the world. Constant resort to violence and intimidation, the persistence of conflicts, the expansion of zones of unrest, the aggravation of threats weighing upon mankind from all sides are factors which, among others, lead us to be skeptical or become discouraged.\n158.\tIndeed, we rejoice, together with all delegations that have spoken before us from this rostrum, that relations among the super-Powers remain characterized by the establishment of a peaceful dialog which, albeit without result for a long time, now seems to be bearing its first fruits, especially in the field of disarmament. The progress thus achieved in that field is, of course, well below our hopes, but we greet it as the beginning of a situation which could lead to more effective action, associating all countries concerned with efforts to put an end to the arms race and reversing the trend towards the perfecting and stockpiling of such weapons.\n159.\tBy the same token, the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971, by eliminating one of the last sequels of the cold war, makes it possible to hope for the disappearance of a hotbed of tension and the advent of an era of peace for the whole European continent. The establishment of a dialog between the two Germanys and the improvement of links between East and West Europe could lead to the convening of a conference on European security, which would strengthen stability in that part of the world and, therefore, peace in the world as a whole.\n160.\tFinally, the contacts established between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China, by being a harbinger of the end of the policy of isolation of Peking practiced by Washington for over 20 years, certainly open up new and promising prospects for the settlement of problems upon which peace in Asia and the Pacific depends.\n161.\tBut on the other side of the ledger, and as opposed to these encouraging findings, the situation prevailing in the rest of the world continues to give rise to the gravest concern. Whether it be in South-East Asia, the Middle East or Africa, we always meet the same problems problems which become more serious over the years through the accumulation of misfortune and destruction. For the countries of the third world the fight against under-develop- ment is being carried on energetically without their seeing in the foreseeable future any signs of a successful conclusion to their efforts. The fight for freedom, for human dignity, for the minimum conditions of a better life remain the only resort of many people confronted with difficulties of nature, vicissitudes inherited from history and the merciless constraints of an international order whose weight they bear without actually being able to change it.\n162.\tI started by speaking of South-East Asia. That is because war is still being waged there. It directly involves one of the super-Powers. It perpetuates a dramatic situation for the people concerned and is a matter of deep anguish to all those who aspire to peace. Many hopes born in preceding years and based on the awakening of international opinion and the intentions proclaimed by governments have been seriously dashed.\n163.\tThe Paris talks aimed at restoring peace to Viet-Nam, the opening of which was greeted as the starting-point of a long-awaited step towards a peaceful settlement have not lived up to expectations and continue to reflect the contradictions, hesitations and obstinacy of the various parties. The will to independence of the Viet-Namese people and their determination to break all foreign domination are clearly expressed in an implacable struggle which, after so many years of sufferings and sacrifices, has not succeeded in shattering their will. Nobody could gainsay the Viet-Namese the right to settle their own internal problems themselves and to decide the future organization of their political institutions and social structures. Intervention in the affairs of the Viet-Namese people on the part of the United States, which continues to support an alleged government discredited both inside and outside the country, a government unable to claim any genuine representative character, is incontrovertibly the essential element which constitutes an obstacle to any peaceful prospects in the area. It is inconceivable-ai:d this has been clearly proclaimed that the Viet-Namese people will abandon their struggle so long as they are not assured their total freedom and the choice of their future.\n164.\tIt is only once the true intention of the United States to abandon any intervention in the internal affairs of South Viet-Nam is proved that the modalities for the cessation of the war can be studied. The first step towards such a development is the withdrawal of United States troops and of all other foreign troops from the area,, The latest proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam in this connexion constitute a valid and reasonable basis for negotiations; they should make it possible speedily to reach an agreement by offering at one and the same time to the South Viet-Namese people genuine possibilities for ensuring free and democratic participation of all currents of opinion in deciding on the future of the country, and to the Government of the United States honorable conditions for disengagement from what now appears to have been an adventure doomed by international opinion as well as by American public opinion itself.\n165.\tUntil the voice of reason prevails in the final analysis, the war continues, increasing disorder and confusion in South Viet-Nam and expanding the theater of operation to the whole of the Indo-China peninsula in flagrant violation of ail international agreements and of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Renewing in Cambodia and Laos the same tragic errors committed in Viet-Nam, the United States pursues its policy of direct intervention in the internal affairs of those countries by imposing government leaders obedient to their instructions, but deprived of any popular base.\n166.\tAlgeria proclaims once again its constant and firm support for the struggle waged by the National Liberation Front of South Viet-Nam and that of the Khmer people, convinced that their just cause will prevail in the end and that there is no other peaceful solution to their problems than that which will guarantee the unity, independence and territorial integrity of their countries.\n167.\tI have spoken about the situation in the Indo-China peninsula, but I cannot gloss over other hotbeds of tension in other parts of the Asian continent. The situation created on the border between India and Pakistan by the arrival of enormous numbers of refugees from East Pakistan raises social and humanitarian problems which, quite justly, have deeply moved international public opinion. The Government of Algeria which has the most friendly relations with both India and Pakistan cannot conceal its alarm at seeing the possibility that this situation could become a source of conflict between the two countries and maintain in the area a climate of suspicion and hostility which would harm, above all, each of the two countries. This friendship that we feel for both leads us to express a wish for the speedy return of refugees to their homeland, the widest manifestation of international co-operation in the field of effective international assistance and the establishment of a climate of national reconciliation to which the Pakistan Government is already devoting all its efforts because, no matter what the concerns of the international community, it is abundantly clear today that, to be a genuine solution and not to create similar difficulties for other countries in the world, the final solution of this painful problem can be ensured only through respecting the unity and national integrity of the territory of Pakistan.\n168.\tThe problem of Korea, of course, is not a new one; nevertheless it is a question deserving of all our attention, first of all because our Organization was involved in it at the outset. The delegation of Algeria deeply regrets that the General Assembly should have seen fit to postpone consideration of this problem until the next session. We already had an opportunity to stress the unjustified character of that decision. We consider, in fact, that it is high time to move resolutely towards normalizing the situation in the Korean peninsula because this area will not know peace as long as the southern part of Korea remains occupied by foreign troops under the flag of the United Nations and cut off from the other part of Korea. That is why we think that any lasting solution of this problem is necessarily predicated upon the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and on the dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. To that end my Government expresses its total support for the eight-point proposal for national salvation which tl|e Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea put forward in April 1971.\n169.\tAlmost all speakers have justly stressed from this rostrum that they are deeply concerned by the situation in the Middle East, by the fact that no progress towards a satisfactory settlement has occurred. Yet, attempts to reach an agreement have been numerous, whether at the level of the super-Powers, at the level of the four big Powers, or within the framework of the mission of Ambassador Jarring, Special Representative of the Secretary-General.\n170.\tAfrica, in turn, is trying to make its contribution to the search for a solution by appointing a mission of four eminent African Heads of State, who would inform themselves on the spot about the state of affairs and the intentions of the main antagonists, and seek ways and means which would lead to proposals acceptable to all parties. Algeria as an African country, is happy to welcome this initiative, which is consonant with the idea of the solidarity of our continent with an African country victim of\naggression, a part of whose national territory, like a part\nof that of some Arab countries, is still illegally occupied by Israeli troops.\n171.\tWe have never had the slightest illusion about the aggressive and expansionist character of Israel. Its creation was marred by flagrant injustice, since it was brought about in conditions that are well known, to the prejudice of the Palestinian people expelled from its national territory. Its existence is based on the permanent maintenance of this original sin which dooms it to showing continuous hostility towards its neighbors. Finally, its policy dooms it to constantly seeking to expand its territory, thus making its own the notorious theory of lebensraum.\n172.\tThe arrogance which has always characterized the attitude of Israel is probably encouraged by the impunity which it has so far enjoyed. We are entitled to wonder, as a Member of this Organization, how far and until when such contempt for our international institution and the principles of our Charter will be condoned. What credence will still attach to our decisions if they can be ignored and trampled on in such a deliberate and constant manner?\n173.\tBut if attempts to reach a solution have failed until now, it is also because an essential element has been forgotten or neglected, an element which is fundamental to any settlement of the situation in the Middle East. I have in mind the Palestinian people, whose inalienable rights have been recognized and reaffirmed by our General Assembly. This people, despoiled of its national territory, is now waging a struggle within the framework of the wide liberation movement evident in the whole world. The echoing solidarity aroused in world public opinion by its struggle confirms the legitimate and just nature of its claims. Indeed, these are founded on sacred notions such as freedom and dignity. They are those for which a people is ready to accept any sacrifice and for which it will always find sufficient resources to attain its objective. It would therefore be dangerous to neglect this fundamental element in the in-arch for a solution, but nothing will prevent it from being strengthened and from developing as it is in line with the normal course of the history of all peoples accidentally deprived of their freedom and their national rights.\n174.\tTo see in the problem of the people of Palestine merely a problem of refugees who must be assisted and for whom one implores international charity is a grievous error whose consequences can be tragic. One can easily understand that Israel prefers for reasons of its own to conceal under purely social humanitarian aspects a problem whose political dimensions are as important as they are incontrovertible. But-and we shall never tire of repeating it -a just and lasting peace cannot be established in the Middle East except on the basis of the integral recognition of the rights of the people of Palestine to national independence and sovereign existence.\n175.\tI now turn to events in Africa, and I cannot help saying how painful it is to us to have to speak about the same topics each year. If we run the risk of tiring those who listen to us or of losing the interest of public opinion we must do so because of the persistence of problems afflicting our continent. This clearly shows the impotence of the Africans to protect themselves from foreign interference and ensure respect for their dignity, but it shows especially and above all the ineffectual nature of our institutions which in these matters, as in so many others, are more likely to adopt resolutions than to undertake firm and decisive action.\n176.\tThe problems of Africa therefore remain what they were for years: the fight against colonial domination, the fight against racial segregation, the fight against underdevelopment. Once again the Organization of African Unity has drawn the attention of the General Assembly to the danger of this situation at present and in the future. I could not plead the cause of Africa better than it was pleaded from this rostrum by the President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, Mr. Mokhtar Ould Daddah, present President of the Organization of African Unity /1938th meeting],\n177.\tBut what I should like to stress here is that several countries, sometimes great Powers, directly or indirectly contribute to perpetuating if not to worsening this state of affairs. Without the support which is granted to Portugal it is ^doubtful that the colonial war waged by that small country in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) could go on for long. The liberation struggle is developing in those Territories. We have full confidence in the final result but the present situation represents a great threat for all neighboring countries, and it suffices to remind the Assembly of the latest Portuguese aggressions against Guinea and Senegal. It will therefore be understood that the African countries consider themselves at one in their will to free their continent in its entirety from any colonial domination. They will always continue to bring all assistance to back the liberation movements and they renew their appeal to world opinion and the countries concerned to put an end to the support they grant to Portugal, which enables that country blindly to pursue a policy that has been unanimously condemned. That small country would be better advised to think of its own development, of its own internal development, instead of squandering important resources which it is now spending in its effort to maintain a colonial empire which ineluctably it will lose.\n178.\tMust we once again mention the problem of Southern Rhodesia where, in spite of the resolutions of the Security Council and economic sanctions imposed on the Ian Smith regime, the African majority of Zimbabwe remains in the hands of a white minority? The United Kingdom, the administering Power, still tries to negotiate with an illegal Government which deliberately opposed its authority. No matter what the results of these talks it remains clear that the United Kingdom is primarily responsible in this matter but that this responsibility must be laid also at the door of all members of the international community which must heed the decisions of our Organization.\n179.\tIf the Salisbury regime was able to defy public opinion and to cause the action taken against it to fail, it is, above all, because of assistance from Portugal and especially from South Africa. The Pretoria regime which made of apartheid a political system has become a gigantic war machine thanks to the complicity of the Western Powers. Possessing ultra-modern armaments in abundant numbers, this country is now able to produce and export war material of all kinds. There is no need to wonder what those armaments are for. It is obvious that no foreign threat seems at present to menace South Africa. This military force is exclusively destined to prevent and to squash any attempt at rebellion by the black population against the racial segregation regime imposed upon it. This is an immediate danger against the independent countries of the area and enables the authorities of Pretoria to strengthen their domination of Namibia in full contempt of the decisions of the United Nations.\n180.\tWe are not among those who think that the Africans would be able to convince the white racists of Pretoria and compel them to abandon their apartheid policy by opening a dialog with them. Such a discussion presupposes that there is a common language, that there is respect for the same principles, the same values and the same meaning of human dignity. Who could claim that such conditions exist in this case when with every passing day we see the most incontrovertible proof of the way in which the South African authorities intend to discuss with the black populations pining under their yoke?\n181.\tI do not think it is necessary for me to dwell any further on these problems which unfortunately are not new and whose permanence would lead us to believe that they are an integral part of our present-day world. If mankind achieves any progress, it is in the field of science and technology, but far from being applied to an improvement in the standard of living of peoples and their relations within the international community they tend to extend to outer space the mastery of man over nature. We applaud the exploits and the achievements on the moon and in the matter of exploring the universe in which our modest planet moves about, but we cannot help thinking that there are many other achievements which must be accomplished and realized which are more urgent and just as prestigious to enable all men to have a worthier life.\n182.\tHuman genius, which was able to reach dimensions which were even unsuspected yesterday, is not incapable of doing this, but such a task is predicated less upon intelligence than upon generosity, disinterestedness, unselfishness and qualities of the spirit and the heart. The behavior of States ignores such feelings and more than ever we see developing selfish national interests, attempts at domination and hegemony. The international situation remains under the influence of the super-Powers which, having reached some equilibrium in their military and nuclear power, are now engaged on peaceful coexistence excluding from its implementation the rest of the world. Their confrontation is at the level of establishing developing zones of influence for the enslavement of other peoples and often brutal intervention in their own affairs. The conflicts which are called local arc born from the direct confrontation between the will of those Powers to impose their political, economic and strategic domination and the stubborn opposition of peoples which defend their freedom and want to preserve their natural wealth, but we cannot accept the thesis according to which, obviously, it is essentially through such localized conflicts that mankind will be able to prevent a generalized war.\n183.\tIt is on this deep conviction that the policy of non-alignment, which Algeria has always made one of the essential principles of its international behavior, is predicated. It is significant that the countries of the third world which adhere to this policy are getting ever more numerous, thus making of the non-aligned group an important element of international equilibrium and their action in the cause of peace and progress will exert a positive influence upon the evolution of the world situation,\n184.\tEverybody seems agreed that the era of colonialism has finally come to an end, that every people is entitled to independence and freedom. The principles solemnly enshrined in the Charter were reaffirmed in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples; and, at its twenty-fifth session, the General Assembly adopted a program of action for the complete application of that Declaration [resolution 2621 (XXV)]. We have seen that in the third world, especially in Africa, there are Territories which still remain under colonial domination. But can we fail also to mention political pressures exerted on small countries, military threats against them, the practices by which their natural resources are exploited for the profit of foreign interests? Because, there again, those are imperialist and colonialist manifestations; they involve not only the super-Powers, but also many countries which have reached a high level of economic development and military power.\n185.\tWith the end of the cold-war period and the accession to independence of numerous Spates, the division of the world into developed and under-developed countries has succeeded the division into blocs based on ideology. The newly independent States rapidly became aware of the vital necessity to promote their economy in order to fulfill the needs of their social development and the aspirations cf their peoples. The recovery of their natural resources was one of the first steps in a long and arduous struggle which recently has been much debated by world public opinion in the matter of natural fuel. That crisis again stressed the injustice of which the under-developed countries are victims in international trade relations, as they are condemned to derive very small profits from their raw materials without being able to compensate for the progressive exhaustion of their reserves for building up new economic structures which would yield employment and income. Indeed, foreign assistance is indispensable to our countries to ensure our development in all fields, but the first means for such action must be found in our own resources. That assistance becomes a mere mystification if it is accompanied by a rapacious plunder of our wealth which, in any case, we shaJ never again allow.\n186.\tThis is only one of the elements of the struggle against underdevelopment. There must be a readjustment in the terms of trade in order to remedy the injustice due to their present degradation. But there are other aspects to this struggle-agriculture, industry, transport, public health, education-which require much effort and sacrifice on our part. The scope of those problems, the immense resources required for their solution, make it necessary that there be concerted action on the international level, the importance of which was stressed by the institution at the level of the United Nations of a first, then a second, Development Decade.\n187.\tThis manifestation, this token of international solidarity, is based upon a conviction that the maintenance of an imbalance in the levels of development is a source of tension in the world and a danger for peace. Such an enterprise obviously requires the contribution of. 11 countries, especially those which have already reached a high level of economic expansion, which have abundant income for which no better use could be found than the struggle for a better distribution of the wealth of this earth.\n188.\tIt is probably in this field that the United Nations has achieved the most positive results in its action and has' most obviously proved its usefulness. The expansion of those activities of its specialized agencies clearly shows to what extent they are needed in our countries. The failures of our Organization are numerous, such as its inability effectively to achieve and carry out its mission for maintaining peace, its inability to ensure the implementation of its own decisions. They reflect, above all, the contradictions in our international community. The evermore pronounced trend of the great Powers to take the place of the United Nations in settling the most crucial problems of peace and security in the world is incontrovertibly the source of the crisis of authority in our Organization. But an important role is also played by the absence from our Organization of several countries, not the least influential, which are decisive elements in the international equilibrium.\n189.\tThe problem of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is not a new one. The most objective analysis of the deterioration in international relations proves, if need be, that no viable and valid solution can be found to world problems without the participation of that great Power. And yet, despite an increasingly favorable view in the matter of attributing to Peking the seat of China in the General Assembly and the Security Council, the question could not be settled until now, because of procedural machinations incompatible with the political importance of the problem and its incalculable consequences foi the maintenance of peace. If we do not seek any credit for having long ago denounced as an unjust and dangerous anomaly the absence from the United Nations of the People's Republic of China, we are satisfied to note that there is a clear-sighted and courageous evolution in the attitude of many States on this matter.\n190.\tTo those who still manifest some hesitancy in accepting an irrefutable reality, those who still want to find refuge in outmoded fiction, we would merely say that political wisdom does not accept any half-measures. Why deny the evidence? This evidence is that there is only one China, that Taiwan is only s province of that huge country and that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only representative of the Chinese people. We have great hopes that this debate, which has lasted far too long, will finally be concluded ana that this session will not end without restoring a situation more in keeping with the realities of our world and the principles of our Charter.\n191.\tBut I cannot speak of our Organization without evoking the pre-eminent role for over 10 years of its Secretary-General, U Thant. It is with the greatest sympathy and the most sincere admiration that we followed and supported his efforts to strengthen the authority of this high institution and to enable him fully to discharge its mission for the maintenance of international peace, I hope he will accept here the expression of the deep friendship of\nAlgeria, which will be especially grateful to him for the vigorous action carried out by him in favor of freedom for all peoples. We can never forget his personal attitude in favor of the independence of Algeria and his contribution to our cause. Sharing the opinion of very many delegations, we should like to see him continue to preside over the fate of our Organization, a task to which he has devoted himself for so long and which has earned him our unanimous respect. No matter what his final decision, may he know that he will always be entitled to our gratitude and our eternal friendship.\n192.\tOur impatience may be too great to see justice and wisdom prevail everywhere in the world and our energies entirely devoted to problems governing the development and well-being of our peoples. We are aware of the fact that, like any new member of the international community, we have a somewhat Utopian conception of relations among States, characterized by an absolute faith in the principles of international morality. Brutal contact with reality leads us to a more correct assessment c! things and convinces us of the need to continue to wage a long struggle to break down all narrow interests and impose strict respect for rules which should govern an international society based upon justice and the primacy of right over might.\n193.\tDisappointing and discouraging as this long journey towards a better future may sometimes be, where in a world reborn the genius of man would serve the well-being of mankind, we shall not abandon this fight which translates ever better the solidarity of our peoples. Our voice, those of all disadvantaged countries, will not always remain without an echo. It carried with i* the hopes of millions of men representing over half of the population of our globe. Why could we not think that one day this voice will be heard and will finally impose a world order placed under the sign of friendship among peoples and fraternity among men?\n194.\tIt is with the expression of this hope that I shall conclude."

        "file_text": "102.\tTo be one of the last speakers in the general debate, which is about to be concluded, entails both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages lie in the fact that, by having listened to so many distinguished and well-informed speakers, one finds it easier to form precise opinions on issues whose intricacies and details are, by their very nature, not all known or not well known to some of us. The disadvantages, on the other hand, are even more obvious, in the sense that one runs the risk of repeating most of the things which have already been said, discussed, stated and analyzed. Being conscious of this, I shall try to limit myself to what I consider to be some of the most essential points.\n103.\tIn joining with all the speakers who have preceded me in expressing to the President of the General Assembly my warmest congratulations on his election to this high office, I trust that my remarks will not be taken as a mere formality. I extend to him my very sincere wishes for his success in his most difficult and delicate task, which still lies ahead. He will be presiding over a session of the General Assembly which might prove to be a landmark in the history of the United Nations, not only because of the renewed effort to promote its universality, but also because of the valid and justified expectation that some significant decisions may be taken and significant progress made as a result of the almost unanimous will, so strongly expressed last year, to take concrete steps towards the furtherance of the purposes and the attainment of the goals of the United Nations.\n104.\tWe all deemed it appropriate, last year, while celebrating that historic event, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, to assess the failures and the achievements of the United Nations. In so doing we reiterated not only our conviction regarding the usefulness of our Organization and our faith in its principles, but also our resolve to do our utmost individually and collectively to make the United Nations succeed in the interest of humanity as a whole.\n105.\tIt was admitted by everybody that it is the Members of the United Nations who are to blame for its failures and it is the Members who can make tLe United Nations succeed. It is the Members who must show respect for the United Nations by fulfilling their obligations under the Charter. It is not necessary to expand any further on that point, for it has been stressed so many times. No cure can be found by merely repeating the diagnosis.\n106.\tWhat we did last year, on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary, was to pledge ourselves solemnly to provide the cure, which, if we wish to avail ourselves of it, is within our reach. Last year, as we have been doing every year, we praised the achievements of the United Nations, which are by no means insignificant, whether in the political, economic, technical, legal, cultural, scientific or humanitarian field. In drawing up the balance-sheet of the achievements and the failures of the United Nations, whatever differences and variations may have been observed in individual assessments, the unanimous conclusion was that much more must be done, and indeed can be done, by the United Nations.\n107.\tDespite the frustrations of the past and the pessimism which was so prevalent over the last few years in regard to the inability of the United Nations to deal in a satisfactory and effective manner with a number of serious problems, it was a good omen and a promising sign that the importance and the authority of the United Nations was generally acknowledged and accepted. This was, in fact, the message which was conveyed to the world from this hall last year.\n108.\tThe fact that we have all agreed that the failures of the United Nations and its shortcomings are exclusively the fault of its Members, the fact that we have all recognized and praised the achievements of the United Nations however limited they may be, the fact that we once again pledged ourselves to the United Nations and its principles, and the fact that from this very hall a message was sent to the world asking it to maintain its faith in the United Nations and to continue to hope for its final success-all of this amounts to a renewed and firmer commitment meaningfully and genuinely to do our utmost faithfully to discharge our obligations and to advance the purposes of the United Nations.\n109.\tThese conclusions and this commitment were repeated again this year, the first session of the General Assembly to be held since our solemn re-dedication last year. It is, therefore, our duty not only to continue to make progress but also to make progress in the right direction and at a quicker pace. But, again, the responsibility lies squarely and solely with the Members. The Members must decide to abide strictly and invariably by the rules and not merely to invoke them when it suits their own interests and not to ridicule the United Nations and its noble task when its rules do not permit them to pursue selfish interests of their own. Nor do some serve the cause of the United Nations in any way when they come to this rostrum full of praise for the Organization while outside it they describe it as a \\\"house of illusions\\\" or signify, in any other manner by words or by deeds, their lack of respect for the United Nations, thus illustrating-to put it mildly -their inconsistency. They cannot be allowed, without\nconsequence, to break the rules and to boast of being false to their commitments.\n110.\tWe have to choose between international anarchy and t'-.e rule of international law, and it is the United Nations which provides the basic and elementary set of standards of international behavior and conduct. To pay lip-service to the principles of the Charter and to the authority of the United Nations is a form of behavior which was tolerated too much in the past and which should not be tolerated any more in the future. If the United Nations is to become our effective, collective organ for peace and security in the world, as was originally envisaged and as we once again confirmed 25 years later, we must all act always in accord with its rules and principles and not permit deviations and violations, whatever their reason and whatever expediency may lie behind them.\n111.\tNot forgetting the experience of the past, from which many lessons have been and can still be derived and which must have a great bearing on our attitudes in the future, we must still strive for what we describe every year as a necessity: we must strive to strengthen the United Nations, As we have often said, we should look upon the United Nations not merely as a forum from which to air our grievances, or as a place from which we can freely disseminate propaganda, or as an arena in which to quarrel and argue for the purpose of scoring points for home consumption; on the contrary, we must look upon it as the place in which differences should be smoothed out, problems resolved, crises averted and conflicts eliminated. This should be done on the basis of and in accordance with the accepted standards of international behavior and in conformity with the principles of the Charter, which, in theory, no one in this Organization has ever questioned. It must be stressed that quite often the real and basic purpose of the United Nations is being undermined because its Members-at least some of them-are not honest or courageous enough to accept these principles and criteria in practice. From now on we must more scrupulously protect the honor of the United Nations. Otherwise its achievements will decrease and its failures \\\"will mount, to the detriment of humanity. We are living in a world of many and compelling necessities-necessities that must be met without delay by the international community acting together in harmony. Above all, there is the overwhelming necessity to fulfill the basic prerequisites for lasting peace and security: equality, universal freedom and universal justice.\n112.\tMr. President, as has already been suggested, this year's session of the General Assembly may prove to be a historic one. You will be required to guide the Assembly in its deliberations on many crucial issues. Some evidence must be offered to the world to the effect that what was said and declared last year in this hall by the leaders of the world was not simply an empty promise not meant to be fulfilled but an earnest of our readiness and determination to act.\n113.\tWe shall again be inspired this year by the wisdom, the rare personality and the experience of our Secretary- General, for whom it is not possible to find enough words of praise. UThant is the man who has devoted himself to the cause of the United Nations, who has for 10 long years been the dedicated servant of humanity and whose faith in the United Nations has never been shaken, despite the very many adversities with which he has been faced. Through his work and his deeds he has proved that idealism and adherence to principles should not be looked upon as something different or contrary to the so-often advocated need for realism. U Thant has proved that moral principles and moral standards cannot be divorced from a realistic approach to various problems. Foresight and vision would help to convince everyone that this is so. It would indeed be a great blow to the United Nations were U Thant to give up his post, as he has announced he will do. No one can question his right to relinquish his post after such a long, hard and trying, but successful, period of service. He has carried on his shoulders for 10 long years an immense burden of responsibility in a manner that has won for him universal respect and admiration. In paying a tribute to the Secretary-General, I submit that we should fail in our duty to the United Nations if we were not to request him once again to reconsider his decision and carry on with his mission. While we shall continue to benefit from his experience and his advice in the time that lies ahead, we still wish to remain with the hope that he will accept our request to stay on. In this connexion, I fully endorse the remarks on this score made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary in his statement this morning [1964th meeting].\n114.\tA number of developments are likely to occur during, the next few months. There are many items on the agenda. All of these items are important, but some are bound to receive special attention at this session. Among such items is the question of the representation of China. That issue, which has been regarded until recently as a perennial one, now appears to be nearing solution. There is going to be a full debate on that question very soon, and I therefore consider it unnecessary to go into the matter at any length at this stage. But I do wish to emphasize that a decision to enable the People's Republic of China to occupy its rightful seat in the United Nations, both as a member of the General Assembly and as a permanent member of the Security Council-a decision which, due to well-known circumstances, has been delayed for too long will be the biggest possible step forward towards achieving the goal of universality for the United Nations.\n115.\tThe acknowledgment and acceptance of that reality is most significant. That development will undoubtedly produce an immense change in the United Nations. We believe that, because of that development, together with other great steps and important developments which are occurring in the world today, greater opportunities will arise for better understanding and for an improvement in international relations, and this in turn may contribute to the speedier solution of many problems. We believe that it would be in the interests of the United Nations if that question could be resolved this year.\n116.\tOf the other questions which are before us, one of paramount importance, which continues to present a potential threat to peace, is the situation in the Middle East. More than four years have gone by since the last war in that area. Almost four years have passed since the Security Council, in its resolution 242 (1967), laid down the foundations for a peaceful and over-all settlement of the Middle East problem. The various efforts which have since been made have produced no results, with the exception of the cease-fire agreement, the significance of which cannot be denied. The problem, however, remains unresolved, and the dangers are ever present.\n117.\tWhile there is talk of an effort to achieve a partial agreement with regard to the reopening of the Suez Canal, and while other initiatives, such as the one by the Organization of African Unity, are about to be undertaken; and while there are hopes-due perhaps to some recent developments for the reactivation of Ambassador Jarring's mission, an over-all settlement is not yet in sight. And the people in the area continue to live in conditions of anxiety and agony about their future. And the involvement of the super-Powers remains deep.\n118.\tAny further delay in tackling the basic issues involved can easily lead to a new explosion with unforeseen consequences. Unless the basic issues are settled, the danger and the threat to international peace and security will not have been eliminated. Resolutions of the United Nations cannot be ignored; the acquisition of territory as a result of war cannot, with the passage of time, become admissible; the drama of so many thousands of refugees cannot go on indefinitely. Partial agreements can help if their result is to increase the chances for an over-all settlement: if they are in the direction of an over-all settlement, and not instead of it. Peace must be secured and ensured, and the basic guidelines are laid down in the resolution of the Security Council of November 1967, which we fully support and have always fully supported. The parties to the conflict must do their utmost to give a new impetus to Ambassador Jarring's mission.\n119.\tApart from the specific items which are on our agenda, there are other important and serious questions which, because of their gravity, have been prominent in the general debate. This is not the first time that we hear of the situation in South-East Asia, but we all hope that it will be the last. Despite the fact that no progress has been made in the Paris talks, and despite the fact that the war is still raging, with continued untold human suffering on all sides and which, again, cannot go on forever despite this basically unchanged situation, there is a strong feeling that those involved in the conflict have come to the conclusion that a way must be found to disengage themselves from the battlefield. In this, as in almost ah other cases, the conflict cannot be resolved by war. Here again; as in the case of the Middle JEast, there exists the basis for a peaceful settlement: namely, the Geneva Agreements of 1954.\n120.\tWars, apart from their inadmissibility as a method of solving problems, in the world of today cannot solve any problems, as a rule, whatever their outcome. The sooner it is realized that violence and oppression cannot replace conciliation and the rule of justice, the better it will be-for the weak as well as for the strong. This should be borne in mind, in particular, by those through whose actions or policies new wars and new conflicts may arise. The task of the United Nations is not only to try to contain and correct situations which have arisen in the past and continue to exist, or only to stop wars, but also to prevent wars and conflicts. In order to do so, it is the task of the United Nations and of all of us to remove all possible causes of conflict and war, and to ask, and to urge, and to call upon all those who bear some responsibility in each particular case to listen to reason, to reconsider their attitudes and to realize to what situations their wrong policies may lead the world.\n121.\tIn this connexion, I would wish to stress that it would be totally unrealistic if the authorities in South Africa and Rhodesia were to think that they can continue without serious consequences to pursue their policies ex' apartheid and racial discrimination. Serious consequences may also ensue if self-determination is denied to the majorities in those and other Territories, and if freedom is denied to Namibia, and if the remnants of colonialism are not eliminated in Africa and everywhere else, and if human rights continue to be violated and denied in various parts of the world. New sources of wider conflicts will sooner or later be created; again, it would be totally unrealistic to believe that those situations can be perpetuated without posing a grave threat to international peace and security.\n122.\tIt is the task of the United Nations to correct those situations. It is true that, in the field of decolonization, the United Nations has done quite a lot, but the process must be completed, because it is not only a matter of justice that the peoples of those Territories should secure and enjoy conditions of freedom and human dignity, but it is also imperative to eliminate all causes of conflict. Not that conflicts in regard to these situations do not already exist: they do exist. But those conflicts, as time goes by, will become wider and deeper, and it will be much more difficult to solve them. Are we ready, this year, to take a more positive step forward towards implementing out resolutions?\n123.\tA new issue that does not appear as a specific item of our agenda is the situation that has arisen in East Pakistan. This is a situation we cannot close our eyes to or pretend that we are not aware of its potential dangers. The consequences of the situation in East Pakistan, which has caused millions of refugees to flee into India, may be described as a humanitarian problem, but humanitarian problems usually have their roots in political situations. The Secretary-General has put the proper emphasis on this issue, and he himself has undertaken commendable initiatives, there must be a follow-up. No one wishes to interfere in the domestic affairs of an independent State Member of the United Nations, but the humanitarian aspect of the problem has acquired such dimensions that the international community will have to play a more active role, and, in so doing, it cannot overlook the real causes of the problem. Let us look at this problem also from the same point of view we took in looking at all other problems: is it or is it not possible that this situation, if it is not contained and speedily corrected, may lead to conflict with wider repercussions?\n124.\tIt would be both difficult and repetitive to refer to all the problems composing the present international situation, but to counterbalance the pessimism that prevails with regard to some-not all-of the problems to which I have referred, I believe I should emphasize the marked improvement that has taken place in the course of the last two years in Europe. Although the developments in Europe-the progress that has been made, the lessening of tensions between East and West and the propitious conditions that have been created, this time promising a real detente, which we all hope will continue are not the direct result of United Nations activities, they cannot be considered irrelevant to the United Nations. After all, the basic pursuit of the United Nations is international peace and security, and it is in that respect that what has been achieved in Europe has great relevance. The Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971, the Treaty signed earlier between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, and all the other developments justify many hopes for further progress to the extent that a European conference on security and co-operation as it was well described and analyzed by the Foreign Minister of France during the first few days of this general debate [1942nd meeting, para. 51] ~can now be considered almost a certainty. The significance of such a conference will not be limited to Europe or to the countries expected to participate. The more progress that is made in Europe, the easier will be the task of the United Nations in pursuing its primary objective.\n125.\tThe great and rapid changes that are occurring in the economic field, the action which is necessary not only to readjust economic relation and trade patterns but also urgently to expedite the development of the less developed countries, and therefore the necessity for some further planning by the appropriate agencies of the United Nations, also require special attention this year, as indeed do many other issues and problems. Questions relating to the Second United Nations Development Decade, to disarmament and to the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] are also of special significance and deserve proper attention.\n126.\tIt is clear from what has been stated in this debate, which we are about to conclude, that we all feel the necessity for a new, determined effort to further the basic pursuits of the United Nations, to complete the process of decolonization that has been undertaken with success by the United Nations and to eradicate the last vestiges and remnants of colonialism, foreign occupation and racial discrimination. We have also concluded and stressed the necessity for providing the United Nations with wider and greater authority in regard to the removal and elimination of all causes of conflict and war, including poverty, slavery, non-respect for human rights, interference with the sovereignty and independence of States, expansionism and gunboat diplomacy. Those are some of the targets we have set ourselves, in a renewed effort, to pursue with more vigor in and through the United Nations at the beginning of a new chapter in its history, after the completion of a relatively successful quarter-century of life.\n127.\tBefore I conclude, and with your indulgence, let me refer to the present situation with regard co Cyprus. For the last three years, we have been having a period of uneasy calm. We have been doing our best to preserve the peace. But it would be. very wrong to take the attitude that we should be content to live with the problem. Problems must be solved. Despite its apparent complexity-as 1 have often had the opportunity to explain and analyse in this Assembly and in the Security Council-the Cyprus problem can easily be solved if the objective criteria and standards laid down by the United Nations in its resolutions and if the principles laid down in its Charter are strictly adhered to and implemented. Those have always been our guiding criteria. That has always been our policy, and this will remain our policy until a solution is finally reached. I am sure that all in this Assembly will agree that force cannot solve this problem, or indeed any other problem. In this respect I wish to state most emphatically once again that we are committed to a peaceful solution. But on the other hand, we cannot bow to the wishes of others, nor can we accept any curtailment of our sovereignty or independence; we cannot accept anything that may lead our small island to division or partition, or anything that would be contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of the people, who are firmly committed to the principles of democracy and to the Charter. The local talks that have been going on for three years have unfortunately yielded no results, and they are now in a state of deadlock. Who is to blame? That will soon be established, but it is certainly not those who wish to preserve and ensure the unity of the State.\n128. Our policy may be summarized as follows: First of all, we aim at preserving the peace. That is the most immediate objective. Secondly, we aim at further improving the internal situation. We believe that that would contribute to the creation of even better internal conditions.\n129.\tThirdly, we aim at securing a solution within the framework of the United Nations, in accordance with the Charter and in conformity with the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. In this respect, any initiatives and any new procedures should emanate from, and should be within the framework of, the United Nations and in conformity with its resolutions.\n130.\tFinally, we aim at a solution on the basis of a unitary, fully sovereign and really independent State. Any kind of divisive arrangements are completely unacceptable. At the appropriate moment we shall explain in more detail our concept of unity as well as the philosophy of division to which we refuse to subscribe.\n131.\tWe shall continue to do our utmost to find a peaceful solution, a solution which will secure for all the citizens of Cyprus, irrespective of ethnic origin or religion, conditions of equality, happiness and prosperity. And, I submit, we know better how this could come about than others outside the country. Although Cyprus is a very small State, it is an equal and full Member of the United Nations. It is a State which, like all the other States, is entitled to enjoy the same rights, the same privileges and the same opportunities as others, and it is ready to discharge to the full its obligations which, by virtue of the Charter and the resolutions, all States are obliged to respect and fulfill. Despite our efforts, which I repeat we shall continue, and despite the simplicity of the problem which we have in detail repeatedly explained and analyzed both in the Security Council and in the General Assembly as we would have no difficulty in doing again and as we shall do if the necessity arises we have not yet been able to secure a solution on the lines that I have described. But we are determined to continue with our effort.\n132.\tI hope and trust that in this effort we shall continue to have the assistance of the United Nations in which we have as is well known from the very beginning placed our faith and our. hopes. And we are confident that the United Nations and its appropriate organs will spare no effort to assist and protect one of the smallest, but at the same time, may I humbly submit, one of the most faithful Members of the Organization.\n133.\tBy way of conclusion, I wish, on behalf of Cyprus, to reiterate our faith in the United Nations and to place on record once again our readiness, within our limited possibilities, to play our role in the common effort to strengthen the United Nations, whose high and noble principles and purposes we shall continue to serve with dedication and absolute devotion.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "225.\t Mr. President, I should like to associate myself with the speakers who have spoken before me from this rostrum, and convey to you, on behalf of my Government and my country, my sincere congratulations on your being elected to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I am very pleased that you were chosen to conduct our debates since your qualities are an earnest for the success of the work of the twenty-sixth session, of which each of us expects that it will mark a decisive turning point in the unrelenting struggle being waged in the United Nations to preserve peace throughout the world.\n226.\tIt is with equal pleasure that I address to Mr. Hambro my warmest congratulations for the remarkable way in which he conducted the discussions of the previous session.\n227.\tIt is also my delegation's duty to pay a particular tribute to the Secretary-General for the tremendous work ht accomplished during his term of office. Summoned to this office, as he was, at a tragic moment in history,\nJ Thant was able to discharge his functions admirably thanks to his outstanding qualities as a great diplomat and, why should we not say it, as a man, by shedding light on the international situation, which at that time was so confused.\n228.\tIn view of his refusal to accept a third term of office, a refusal the reasons for which we fully understand, may we express the hope that the problem of his succession will be considered by the Assembly with due calm and realism. We believe that in view of the incalculable services which have been rendered the Organization by the Secretary-General, in view of the fact that very shortly a certain number of objectives will be realized, for which he personally fought, it is our duty to see to it that his succession will, above all and exclusively, take account of the major interest of the international community.\n229.\tIn other words, whether this succession be taken over by U Thant himself or by anyone else in whom we have placed our confidence, our hope is that the tremendous work that has to be done to serve world peace, and which has been started by the present Secretary-General, will be continued.\n230.\tFinally, the Government and the people of the Congo are gratified that the United Nations family has admitted the States of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar, whose presence among us eloquently reflects the universal character which should remain one of the essential features of our Organization.\n231.\tDespite certain changes that have occurred in the relations among the great Powers since our last session, the essential problems which we referred to at that time still remain before us in their entirety. Throughout the world, unfortunately, we cannot fail to note that the aggressive trend of the world system of imperialism continues to be accentuated. With the new characteristics of contemporary imperialism, which lias taken on a collective form, we are witnessing every day, in various places, the regrouping of imperialist forces as soon as the interests of international monopolies are threatened by the legitimate struggle for the national liberation of oppressed peoples. On every occasion, the machinery of the world system of imperialism is set in motion in order to thwart those regimes which have decided to concentrate their efforts on bringing about their total liberation and safeguarding and consolidating their dignity, their personality and their sovereignty. It is precisely through military blocs and through diplomatic coalitions or by the combined action of sabotage and economic blockade, through these aggressive attitudes, which are subtle and perfidious, that these agents of evil attempt to quell .the resolve of the exploited peoples to struggle.\n232.\tDo I need to cite examples of this on-going aggression of imperialism, its callous and savage violence against the third world? The scandalous and shameful complicity which benefits the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia, the criminal support which is so lavishly accorded to Portugal Portugal which is both atavistic and colonialist the threat which from day to day hangs like a sword of Damocles over the regimes in Asia, Latin America and Africa which are subjected to the basest forms of\nblackmail, the conspiracy of silence which cynically surrounds the crimes perpetrated by American imperialism and its by-products in Viet-Nam, in Cambodia, in Laos, all these constitute eloquent examples of Machiavellian machinations which each of us has a duty to unmask and to denounce.\n233.\tDuring the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization, with its accompanying euphoria, when the flow of oratory ran unchecked, we were promised a world of peace, of freedom, of prosperity, a world would be cast in the mold of brotherhood and international co-operation. If we take a closer look, we catch ourselves suspecting the tremendous credulity which at that time appeared to affect the international community. The same problems, the same danger spots, the same aggressors, who are just as favored and unpunished as they were then, the same victims-such is the harsh reality of facts, the rude awakening of the world of today.\n234.\tIt is really distressing to note that 11 years after the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and notwithstanding the numerous appeals that have been made to it both by the United Nations and the OAU, Portugal continues to wage a war which is as barbarous as it is stupid, as unjust as it is devastating, in order, they believe, to ensure the survival of a system of domination and oppression which is the greatest anachronism of our time and, consequently, an intolerable affront to man's conscience.\n235.\tUnfortunately, it appears that in its refusal to believe in the ireversibility of the historical process the most backward country in Europe is enjoying the complicity of the NATO Powers, which make available to it their military, financial, diplomatic and political machinery.\n236.\tThe numerous discussions which have been held on this matter in all the bodies of the United Nations have proved abundantly that, were it not for the connivance of the imperialist Powers at the Lisbon regime in its criminal enterprise in Africa, Portugal, a small country, would long ago have suffered the verdict of history. However, the truth is that the heroic and resolute struggle of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) to recover their inalienable rights to freedom and independence will triumph, certainly sooner than the assassins of Africa and the other traitors in our continent can imagine.\n237.\tThe People's Republic of the Congo, once again this year, has been confirmed in its fears, which we have frequently had occasion to express from this rostrum, regarding the dangers with which the war of extermination waged by the Portuguese in Africa overshadows the entire continent, more particularly those countries which border on the combat areas.\n238.\tAfter having desperately practiced a systematic scorched earth policy in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), Portugal, which is a bridgehead of imperialism in Africa, is indulging in overt acts of aggression against independent countries in Africa.\n239.\tWho can be unaware of the flagrant and persistent violations of the frontier regions of Zambia, the United\nRepublic of Tanzania, the People's Republic of the Congo, Guinea and Senegal carried out by Portugal, which have been the object of numerous complaints brought before various bodies of the United Nations? Is not the aggression perpetrated by Portugal last November against the sister Republic of Guinea still fresh in our memories? Everyone knows that since March of this year, Portugal has declared a blockade against Zambia by refusing to allow transit through the ports of Mozambique, for commodities going to or coming from that country.\n240.\tFor all African countries-particularly those bordering on territories under colonial domination it is an imperative duty to help those peoples throw off the yoke of oppression. The People's Republic of the Congo, faithful to its ideals and commitments, has continually carried out this noble duty, and because of that now finds itself up against a campaign of systematic defamation marshaled against it by Portugal and its NATO allies by posing a permanent threat of aggression to our country. In fact, Portugal and its NATO mentors are still openly recruiting mercenaries in European capitals to consummate their heinous crime and to plunge our country into wretchedness.\n241.\tIn the meantime, those of our towns that are situated near the theater of war are pillaged by Portuguese hordes and our peaceful citizens and even their children are abducted from their homes by Portuguese commandos. We no longer bring these serious and repeated facts before bodies of the United Nations as we have done in the past. A country like the People's Republic of the Congo, attached to peace and placing its hopes in the United Nations, wishes above all to rely on its own strength by mobilizing its entire people in order to check aggression wherever it may originate.\n242.\tWe have always said and frequently repeated that the problems in southern Africa are the result of the continuing colonial domination imposed on millions of Africans by minority and racist regimes and because of the existence of an illegal regime in Rhodesia in total contempt of the legitimate aspirations of those peoples, in violation of the provisions of the Charter and of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\n243.\tIn addition to this we see the denial of fundamental human rights to the majority of Africans as the result of the criminal and inhuman policy of apartheid and the continued occupation by force of the international Territory of Namibia by the Pretoria regime, which still refuses to apply the pertinent General Assembly resolutions and Security Council decisions which withdrew its mandate over this territory.\n244.\tFaced with such a situation, the United Nations has-we are unfortunately forced to admit-displayed a manifest inability to act. We know that this regrettable failure cannot be ascribed to a lack of goodwill on the part of most of the Member States but rather to the attitude of certain Powers, which, in order to safeguard their selfish economic interests, have continually refused to discharge the obligations which are incumbent upon them under the Charter. These same Powers, applying the theory of divide\nand conquer, have initiated the idea of a so-called dialog which is nothing but a red herring designed to distract the attention of world public opinion at a time when the international campaign against racism and racial discrimination is beginning to gain ground.\n245.\tPractically all of Africa .has rejected this idea of dialog because the African leaders and peoples refuse to bargain with the freedom of their brothers who are waging a pitiless struggle against the forces of foreign domination so that justice and liberty may triumph.\n246.\tNeed we recall that the year 1971 was proclaimed the International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination [resolution 2544 (XXIV)] in order to incite the United Nations to redouble its efforts in the field of decolonization?\n247.\tWe venture to express the hope that the moving appeal which Mr. Moktar Ould Daddah, President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and President of the Organization for African Unity addressed to the Security Council at its 1583rd meeting and to the international conscience on behalf of the African peoples and Governments has been heard, and it is our profound hope that justice will be done.\n248.\tThe Congolese people, its Party and Government, faithful to the sacred principle of the right of peoples to self-determination, has always unstintingly supported national liberation movements and all those progressive forces which, are struggling throughout the world against colonialism, imperialism and neo-colonialism and for independence, justice and peace.\n249.\tIt is in this spirit that we give unconditional support to the valiant peoples of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos who are heroically resisting the barbarous aggression of American imperialism and its allies. In Viet-Nam and Cambodia, despite the use of mechanized warfare to an extent equaled only by its stubborn relentlessness, American imperialists are going from defeat to defeat. The People's Republic of the Congo condemns outright the acts of aggression perpetrated by American imperialism in Viet-Nam, and demands settlement of the Viet-Namese problem on the basis of the proposals enunciated by the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam. My delegation believes that these proposals constitute a reasonable basis for negotiation.\n250.\tThe Korean problem, whose consideration has been deferred to the next session of the General Assembly following a lengthy discussion, also claims the attention of my delegation. By that decision, our Organization once again has associated itself with an imperialist enterprise, the object of which is to perpetuate the division of Korea.\n251.\tIn fact, after more than 20 years, by using various stratagems and delaying tactics, the Government of the United States of America and its allies are perpetrating a gross and dangerous fiction in the United Nations whereby it is made to underwrite their criminal aggressions against the people of Korea. For some years now, various delegations, including that of the People's Republic of the Congo,\nhave denounced this scandalous use of the United Nations, to counter the legitimate rights of the Korean people. In the past we demanded and we continue to demand now that an end be put to this bizarre connivance which exists between the United Nations and the occupation troops of the United States so that favorable conditions may be created to ensure the peaceful unification of Korea.\n252.\tI am gratified to be able to say that today, after more than 20 years of errors and mystification, that the Organization has reverted to wisdom and common sense in the matter of restoring to the People's Republic of China its legitimate rights in our Organization. This is a victory for the oppressed peoples.\n253.\tThe historic debate on this important issue which will open this year will henceforth be clear, without any ambiguity, at any rate devoid of the subterfuges which have hitherto been employed by the Government in Washington whenever it has been a question of redressing the serious injustice committed against the largest nation on earth.\n254.\tThe entire world now realizes that there is but one China. The island of Taiwan is an integral part of the People's Republic of China and has arrogated to itself the status of a pseudo-State, thanks to international imperialist conspiracies, following the crushing defeat inflicted by the Chinese national liberation army on the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This clique has so far been able to maintain itself artificially on the Chinese island of Taiwan because of the support of the United States army of aggression.\n255.\tToday the entire world understands the emptiness of the claims advanced by this clique in Formosa that it will reconquer the continent,\n256.\tFinally, the entire world, if it is not yet aware of it, should henceforth realize that all those accusations which have been leveled against China by imperialism are vile maneuvers intended to mask the truth.\n257.\tToday, this truth shines forth in its burning reality to teach those who have been won over by the imperialist campaign of distortion that the Chinese people, guided by its outstanding leader, Mao Tse-tung, desires only one thing: to draw closer to the other peoples of the world, to co-operate with them in all sincerity, in a completely disinterested spirit, strictly obscuring the sacred principles of equality among States, great or small, mutual respect and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.\n258.\tIn so far as the Congolese people is concerned, we are gratified by the degree of fruitful co-operation and the sincere friendship which have bound us with the Chinese people for over seven years now. In the context of these extremely friendly relations, we have learned to know the Chinese people, whose modesty and creative capacity need no praise and should serve as an example to more than one Government which, undoubtedly through ignorance, but in any case erroneously, believes that the greatness of a country can only be measured by the number of its inhabitants, forgetting in so doing that the will to build itself up in peace with all nations and the capacity to create its own independent existence also serve to increase the strength and greatness of a people.\n259.\tIt is for all these reasons that the People's Republic of the Congo has always demanded that our Organization immediately rectify the grave injustice committed by the international community against the People's Republic of China, the great and peace-loving people of China, and thus benefit from its numerous valuable experiences.\n260.\tTurning now to the situation in the Near East, I should like to affirm once again *hat the People's Republic of the Congo has always been in favor of a peaceful settlement of any conflict. Hence, we support the mission recently entrusted by the OAU to 10 heads of States members of that organization. In looking for ways and means which would be likely to lead to a lasting solution to this conflict, however, the fundamental interests of the people of Palestine should under no circumstances be misinterpreted or sacrificed. Our thoughts should be turned towards these people who have been driven from their lands and who have been reduced to international beggary and condemned to endless wandering. This heroic people has known the most cruel of all fates. It is time that each of us becomes fully aware of the extent of the Palestinian tragedy.\n261.\tThe purposes which the founders of the United Nations sought to pursue in the vital areas of economic, social and humanitarian development, have become the vehicles for the expression of national egoisms, watching jealously from the battlements of their ivory towers. How far removed we are from the principles defined in the Preamble and in Articles 1 and 55 of the Charter, which record the overriding importance of economic and social development in the world, on which international peace and security depend. The threefold objective of solidarity in the face of aggression, solidarity in the face of poverty and solidarity in the face of the violation of those human rights and freedoms which are fundamental for all, which are the corner-stone of the United Nations, is constantly scorned by those who dream of domesticating the Organization. Instead of observing, as recommended by the Charter, the universal and effective respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, imperialism in its unassuaged thirst for the domination of small nations, is only concerned with greedily exploiting the soil and the subsoil of the developing peoples, guided exclusively by the ambition to continue realizing even greater profits.\n262.\tOne can understand in these circumstances why the frenzied imperialist monopolies are attempting to oppose in every way, as they have always done and are still doing, the institution in their zones of influence of regimes that are resolved to break away from the inertia of the colonial condition and to build up an independent national economy. With the taste of defeat in its mouth imperialism continually threatens our still fragile independence in a desperate desire to reconquer the positions which it knows it has lost. Coups d'etat, attempted coups d'etat, blackmail, maneuvers to perpetuate socio-political differences between the African States in order to better divide them, to dominate them, to daunt their fighting spirit in order to exploit them-these are some of the harsh aspects of this\nmonopolistic and exploiting system which is a serious threat to peace and co-operation among peoples.\n263.\tThe first United Nations Development Decade which ended in failure has shown that the international economic order, suffers from a lack which is more fundamental than the simple shortage of capital and skilled labor which affects the poor countries. We can affirm that, far from favoring the process of development in the poor countries, the attitude of the rich nations simply hampers it, precisely because, since they previously exercised authority in the colonies, the imperialist Powers have taken decisions concerning infrastructure, trade flows, training of labor and import preferences which have resulted in confining development solely to the types of primary commodities which served to meet the needs of their own industries.\n264.\tHence, it is clear that whatever efforts are made, no tangible or satisfactory progress can ever be made unless the industrialized Powers revise the selfish and outmoded conception of the structure of international trade they have so far had.\n265.\tSince we are beginning the Second Development Decade proclaimed by the United Nations [resolution 2626 (XXV)] it is therefore imperative that the countries of the third world react swiftly to create the necessary psychological impact. Indeed, the time is at hand for the poor countries to become acutely aware of the need to organize themselves, so that they may contribute positively to finding solutions to their development problems.\n266.\tI could not complete my present statement without warmly commending the goodwill shown by international institutions, which is so well known. But objectivity obliges me to state that the capacity of these institutions to change present conditions remains under par.\n267.\tI have just set forth the views of my Government on the major problems of the hour, whose solution could undoubtedly bring States Members of the Organization to understanding, co-operation and international peace.\n268.\tBy working patiently, assiduously and with perseverance and accepting the full measure of our responsibilities and our duties, we will be able to look forward with optimism to the settlement of these problems.\n269.\tHistory will judge us by the way in which we prepare the future for the generations of tomorrow, the way in which we understand the aspirations and the wishes of our peoples and the way in which we promote the cause of peace.\n270.\tThis is what the President of the People's Republic of the Congo, H.E. Marien Ngouabi, has always taught us and this is also the message which he instructed me to transmit to the General Assembly on behalf of the Congolese Labor Party and the Council of State."

        "file_text": "112.\t  Mr. President. I am happy to convey to you our sincere congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are fortunate that our work will be carried out under the guidance of a man who plays an active part in present-day political developments as Foreign Minister of his country and whom we esteem as an experienced statesman.\n113.\tI further wish to associate myself with the expressions of appreciation by previous speakers to the outgoing President, Edvard Hambro, The distinguished and dignified manner in which he directed the commemorative session of the General Assembly of the United Nations last year confirmed the feelings of gratification with which we had welcomed his election.\n114.\tI should also like to pay a sincere tribute to Secretary-General U Thant for the devotion and dedication with which he has continued to work for the cause of international peace and co-operation.\n115.\tMay I take this opportunity to convey our best wishes to the delegations of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar? We welcome the admission of those three States as a further step towards the achievement of universality of the United Nations.\n116.\tIt is our firm conviction that the high goals and purposes of the United Nations can be reached only on the basis of universality. It is in this spirit that the Austrian Government firmly supports all measures conducive to bringing about, without any further delay, the participation of the People's Republic of China in the work of the United Nations.\n117.\tWe sincerely hope that it will also be possible in the near future to admit the divided countries to membership in the world Organization.\n118.\tLast year's commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization afforded the opportunity of a retrospective appraisal. A review of the first 25 years has revealed with great clarity the limitations imposed on the Organization by political and historical realities. At the same time, we have become even more clearly aware of the potential and value of its work.\n119.\tAn appraisal carried out in retrospect over a longer period of time enables us not only to grasp the complex problems facing the United Nations when confronted with the urgency of taking rapid, effective decisions in acute political crises, but also to realize the constructive role that it can and indeed does play in the long run as an agent and element in the process of international politics,\n120.\tAt the beginning of this session of the General Assembly, our attention is focused once again upon the great unsolved international conflicts. We realize with a sense of frustration how limited the contribution of the United Nations has been towards the peaceful settlement of the military confrontation in Indo-China. As in past years, we express our deep concern at the continuation of the conflict and voice our sense of shock at the human suffering that every new day of war brings to the population of Indo-China. This year, however, we believe we see some sign of a turn of the tide, indicating a de-escalation of the confrontation. Convinced that a solution to this conflict can be found only through negotiations and not through military means, we renew our appeal to all parties to the conflict to create conditions that will facilitate a peaceful settlement.\n121.\tNor has it been possible to neutralize another dangerous crisis area of recent years, one which affects Europe directly the Middle East. I should like to express our profound concern at the serious situation prevailing in that region, which was recently even aggravated by the flare-up of military activities.\n122.\tAlthough the United Nations has not been able to find a solution to this deep-rooted conflict, it has taken a number of steps in the Middle East crisis which, we are convinced, could be of considerable help in settling the conflict. In its resolution 242 (1967), the Security Council has established the basis for a solution in the Middle East. Austria fully supports that resolution and considers it imperative that conditions should be created which would enable Ambassador Jarring, whose impartiality and objectivity are universally recognized, to activate his mission in order to pave the way for a settlement of the dispute. During the past year repeated efforts to reach a solution in the Middle East conflict have been undertaken but we regret that these efforts have not produced tangible results. In view of the complexity of the problem, we feel that partial arrangements could constitute a valuable first step on the road to a comprehensive solution.\n123.\tThe current year has brought into the forefront of our concern another crisis with grave consequences and, inevitably, with international repercussions. The tragic succession of events in East Pakistan gives cause for deep dismay. Millions of people have sought refuge in India. The immense sufferings of the population of this region must prompt generous international aid. We appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General in this context. Austria is to be counted among those that have already contributed to international humanitarian assistance for the people concerned, and we shall endeavor to continue our aid. Tragic events on such a vast scale call for combined assistance by all peoples and for purposeful action by the United Nations. Here, indeed, lies a genuine field of action for all members of the international community.\n124.\tAt the same time we must not lose sight of the fact that, as the Secretary-General has pointed out: .. the basic problem can be solved only if a political solution based on reconciliation and the respect of humanitarian principles is achieved\\\" [A/8401/Add.l, para. 191].\n125.\tIt is also extremely regrettable that there has been no improvement in the situation in the southern part of Africa where, as the result of a policy of racial discrimination raised to the status of official doctrine, a center of unrest and conflict has been created. In view of the persistence of this situation, which has preoccupied the General Assembly for many years, I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate the firm rejection by the Austrian Government of any policy of discrimination, and of the apartheid policy in particular. We have full understanding for the concern felt by the African States at this problem and for the efforts of the United Nations aimed at eliminating this policy by peaceful means.\n126.\tIn my statement before the General Assembly last year [1855th meeting], I welcomed the decision of ihe Security Council, as reflected in its resolution 284 (1970), requesting an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice regarding \\\" 'the legal consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia'\\\". The position which the Court has now taken in its advisory opinion  flows logically from earlier decisions of this Organization which placed Namibia under the direct responsibility of the United Nations. The highest judicial organ of the United Nations has thus clearly established the illegality of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia. The Security Council and the General Assembly will have to take the Opinion of the Court into very serious consideration, I am convinced that, ultimately, justice and equality, rather than the doctrine of racial inequality and racial prejudice, will come to bear also in southern Africa.\n127.\tI have already emphasized the merits of a retrospective review over a longer period of time in assessing the work of the United Nations. This appears to be of particular relevance for the efforts regarding disarmament and the control and limitation of armament.\n128.\tRecent years have brought us a series of concrete and significant, though admittedly marginal, international agreements on the limitation and control of armaments: the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], the partial test-ban Treaty,  the outer space Treaty,  and, last year, the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof [resolution 2660 (XXV), annex].\n129.\tHopefully, we shall be able to take a further step at this year's session: a convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological weapons and on their destruction, Austria supports the efforts to bring about such a convention and will advocate the adoption of a final draft by the General Assembly at its current session.\n130.\tNevertheless, we consider it essential that such a convention should be followed by an early agreement on a similar convention on chemical weapons. The 192,5 Geneva Protocol  constitutes a good basis in this respect.\n131.\tIn this context I wish to stress the importance of fully implementing all disarmament agreements that have already been concluded. Of particular importance is the activity of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the implementation of the Non-ProHferation Treaty. Only recently, on behalf of the Austrian Government, I signed in Vienna an Agreement between Austria and the IAEA on Safeguards as called for in article III of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, making Austria one of the first States to conclude such an agreement with the IAEA.\n132.\tI should like to appeal to the nuclear Powers to honor the obligations they have accepted in article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to engage in negotiations on effective measures relating to a cessation of the nuclear arms race and to nuclear disarmament. We do recognize, however, the determined efforts made by the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the current Strategic Arms Limitation Talks held alternately in Vienna and Helsinki. The hope seems to be justified that an agreement between the two Powers will promote confidence between them and in this way reduce the dangerous threat to the survival of mankind.\n133.\tAustria has always supported and will continue to support all measures and initiatives aimed at achieving genuine disarmament and control of armament?;. In this spirit we welcome the proposal to convene a world disarmament conference.\n134.\tNo continent throughout its history has had to suffer the terrible consequences of the use of force as much as Europe. It is therefore understandable that Austria, located at the center of that continent and particularly affected by the conflagrations of past decades, should regard the maintenance of peace, stability and security in Europe as one of the principal concerns of its foreign policy. We consequently welcome all efforts towards strengthening security in Europe. We therefore welcomed last year the signing of the treaties between the Soviet Union, Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany and we now welcome the signing on 3 September of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin as significant steps in this direction.\n135.\tThe time now appears ripe to proceed to more active preparation of a conference on security and co-operation in Europe. We continue to give our full support to such a conference,\n136.\tAustria's desire to create a climate of mutual confidence in its part of Europe has been and continues to\n12 Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in Wai' of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gasep, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 (League of Nations, Treaty Series, vol. XCIV(1929), No. 2138).\nbe the guideline for all its efforts to solve by negotiations all problems with neighboring States.\n137.\tIn this spirit, a problem which particularly preoccupies Austria and which has for many years strained the relations between Austria and Italy could be brought closer to a solution by negotiation: the problem of South Tyrol.\n138.\tIt will be recalled that the General Assembly dealt with the problem in 1960 and 1961 and in its resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI) urged Austria and Italy to resume negotiations with a view to finding a solution for all differences relating to the implementation of the Paris agreement of 5 September 1946.  The purpose of the Paris agreement is to guarantee the German-speaking inhabitants of the Province of Bozen complete equality of rights with the Italian-speaking inhabitants, within the framework of special provisions to safeguard the ethnical character and the cultural and economic development of tile German-speaking population.\n139.\tLast year, I was able to inform the General Assembly that, after nine years of efforts, Austria and Italy had agreed on a proposal for the solution of their differences, with each party reserving its legal position. The proposal provides for an extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol by the passing of a constitutional law, ordinary laws, executive regulations under the constitutional law and administrative decrees, in accordance with a time-table called \\\"calendar of operations\\\".\n140.\tI am glad to be able to inform the Assembly today that Austria and Italy have made further progress in implementing the calendar of operations since the last session of the General Assembly. Thus, the constitutional law on the extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol was given its first reading by the Italian Parliament in June of this year. The second reading is under way. In July of this year the two Governments signed a treaty according to which the provisions of chapter I of the European Convention for the peaceful settlement of disputes  should be applicable to disputes between Austria and Italy regarding the interpretation and application of bilateral agreements between the two States, even in those cases where the disputes involve facts or situations relating to a time prior to the entry into force of that Convention.\n141.\tThere is good reason to expect that the aforementioned constitutional law will be given final approval by the Italian Parliament in the course of the coming months.\n142.\tThe Italian Government has, with two exceptions, already introduced drafts of the ordinary laws provided for in addition to the constitutional law; I do not wish to dwell on these two exceptions at this moment, on the assumption that the relevant drafts will be introduced in the near future.\n143.\tThe progress so far achieved in the implementation of the calendar of operations has resulted in a noticeable further improvement in Austro-Italian relations. This found \nclear expression during my official visit to Italy in July of this year. There is good reason to assume that the present development, based on the implementation, in letter and in spirit, of the still outstanding measures for South Tyrol, and a sympathetic attitude on the part of the Italian Government towards the needs of the South Tyrolean ethnic group, may lead to ever closer and more friendly relations between the two neighboring countries, Austria and Italy. Austria is sincerely interested in such a development.\n144.\tPermit me now to touch upon three subjects in regard to which I consider increased activity by the United Nations to be both valuable and necessary.\n145.\tFirst of all there is the problem of international aid in natural disasters and similar cases. Repeatedly in past years we have been deeply moved by such events as they occurred in different regions of the world and in differing circumstances. We wish to pay a high tribute to the work of the International Red Cross and other national and international relief organizations in this field. We are also aware of the important assistance that many Governments render to the victims of such disasters. The United Nations has also been able to help in past years, though to a limited extent.\n146.\tYet it seems to me that the United Nations could ply a more dynamic part whenever such disasters occur. Human tragedies on a scale such as we have experienced in the natural catastrophes of past years call for much more generous and effective international aid within the framework of our Organization.\n147.\tThe present session of the General Assembly will receive reports from the Secretary-General and recommendations by the Economic and Social Council in this connexion. The Austrian delegation will strongly support all efforts towards a fundamental reshaping and a considerable strengthening of the effectiveness of the role of the United Nations in international disaster relief and will advocate concrete measures to ensure that our objectives can in fact be achieved.\n148.\tA second pr which would require a stronger involvement of the United Nations is that of the control of narcotic and other drugs. Austria fully supports recent initiatives undertaken by the Secretary-General and designed to give the United Nations a more significant part to play in the international drive against drug abuse.,\n149.\tThere is a third point which, in my view, demands particular attention by the United Nations. The problems of the- younger generation have assumed increased importance for all Governments. For the United Nations it is imperative that youth should continue to feel involved in the work of the Organization, and it will be of special importance for the United Nations to seek a new commitment of the younger generation to the purposes and the ideals of the United Nations. Austria intends to submit specific proposals to this effect in due course.\n150.\tIn recent years the United Nations has considerably widened the scope of its activities. The Organization has directed its attention to a series of technical and scientific areas which require new and imaginative patterns of international co-operation. Austria supports this trend, as we believe that it will in turn favorably influence the political scene by eliminating possible areas of friction.\n151.\tWe are happy that two world-wide organizations which have produced such new approaches to international co-operation in the fields of atomic energy and industrial development have their headquarters in Vienna. In acting as host country to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization [UNIDO] we have given concrete proof of our belief in and our support of the United Nations. Let me recall here that the Austrian Government has put provisional accommodation at the disposal of those two organizations thus enabling them to become fully operational.\n152.\tAs to the planning and the construction of the permanent headquarters of the IAEA and UNIDO in Vienna, the Austrian Government and the City of Vienna, after consultation with the two organizations, have made a final decision on the most suitable design. The size of the project has also been decided upon. Planning in detail, which is done in contact with the two organizations, has already started. Construction is expected to begin in the near future. The Austrian Government and the City of Vienna will provide, at their own expense, office accommodation for a total of 4,500 persons by 1981. With the completion of the construction project in the above- mentioned size which represents approximately a doubling of the original Austrian offer the Austrian Government considers its obligations towards the United Nations in this respect as fulfilled,\n153.\tIn adopting the International Development Strategy for the Second Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] the United Nations last year enacted a bold and forward-looking global concept for economic and social development. We have now entered the phase of giving shape and effect to the program as set out in that historic document, and of devising the necessary machinery to review and appraise the progress achieved. This task will require the streamlining of action and the increased deployment of the United Nations machinery as well as maximum co-ordination within the United Nations system. In dealing with the various and complex organizational aspects of implementing the Development Strategy, our main preoccupation must be to ensure that the momentum which has been engendered by the adoption of the Strategy is not lost. My Government is ready to support all measures which will enable the United Nations to meet the challenge of this decade. We pledge this support in our firm belief that economic and social progress form the indispensable basis for peace, freedom and justice.\n"

        "file_text": "2.\t Mr. President, on behalf of the people and Government of Mexico, I wish to convey to you our warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election, which ensures the impartiality and efficiency necessary to dispose properly of the items to be considered at this session.\n3.\tMexico's faith in our Organization remains unshaken, despite the setbacks to our Organization, since it continues to contribute in an even greater measure than is usually acknowledged to the development of the international community and because it fosters permanent dialog among the nations of the world on a footing of legal equality despite ideological or economic differences.\n4.\tMexico is the product of an extensive racial and cultural mixture. As a result share in a variety of civilizations. Our independent life began x 50 years ago during a period characterized by a world realignment of spheres of domination. For more than a century thereafter we lived through constant threats to our territory, foreign invasions, the loss of a large portion of our land and the systematic depletion of our resources. To a great extent, the history of our Republic is a reflection of the Mexican people's unflagging struggle to do away with the legacy of colonialism and to prevent outside interference in national affairs. Because of our origins and the difficult conditions in which we have developed, we are a country jealous of our own freedom and the freedom of all the peoples of the earth.\n5.\tThat is why the principles that invariably guide our foreign policy are the proscription of the use of force, the\npeaceful settlement of disputes, non-intervention, the juridical equality of States and the self-determination of peoples.\n6.\tOur enthusiastic participation in the work of the United Nations from its inception, and our strict compliance with the commitments entered into within a spirit of loyal adherence to the ideals on which the Organization's existence rests, are not a mere coincidence.\n7.\tI have come to this Assembly to reaffirm Mexico's adherence to the principles of the United Nations and to express its faith in the rapid advent of true international democracy, both political and economic.\n8.\tThe items on the agenda of this twenty-sixth session are particularly significant for the present and the future.\n9.\tMexico's recollection of its own war of independence produces in our people a deep concern for the fate of the millions of human beings in different parts of the world who have not yet won their freedom.\n10.\tSince 1945 we have favored universality for our Organization; therefore, our feeling of satisfaction at the constant growth of its membership from 51 to 130 nations the most recently admitted States being Bhutan, Qatar and Bahrain is easy to understand.\n11.\tA noteworthy advance towards this principle of universality would be to welcome during this session the representatives of a nation inhabited by a fourth of the world's population the People's Republic of China-and to give it its rightful place in the Security Council. At the same time, it w ill be necessary to recognize that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Chinese nation are juridically indivisible.\n12.\tDisarmament, the absolute need to disarm beginning with nuclear weapons-springs from peace as paramount among the values of human coexistence. Mexico has decisively contributed to work to promote disarmament in all the forums in which it has anticipated, and most particularly in the General Assembly and the Committee that specializes in this subject.\nA/PV.1952\n13.\tFurthermore, in the belief that one must practice what one preaches, we put forth our most determined efforts to complete successfully the task of banning atomic weapons in Latin America. The Tlatelolco Treaty  was the culmination of this work. Thanks to this Latin American instrument, there is today an area of military de-nuclearization of\n1 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 634 (1968), No. 9068). \n\n7 million square kilometers, comprising a population of approximately 120 million inhabitants. Our gratitude goes to U Thant, who, in his introduction to this year's report on the work of the Organization, appealed once again to all atomic Powers to provide guarantees against nuclear violation of the area covered by the Treaty of Tlatelolco by signing and ratifying Additional Protocol II of that instrument [A/8401/Add.l, para. 196J-a justified appeal which my country also has been making and which I now reiterate most firmly.\n14.\tThe arms struggle that broke out in the Middle East in the spring of 1967 has given rise to a serious situation, the prompt settlement of which is incumbent not only on the parties directly affected by it, but also on all other members of the international community, since there is sound reason to believe that this conflict constitutes one of the most alarming threats of potential confrontation among the so-called super-Powers. We continue to believe that resolution 242 (1967), adopted unanimously by the Security Council on 22 November 1967, is the right instrument to end this explosive conflict.\n15.\tWith respect to the serious situation posed by the presence of several million Pakistani refugees in India, Mexico requests the international community to make every effort to find a solution as quickly as possible that will allow these displaced persons to return to their homes,\n16.\tThe oceans that separate us geographically should unite us juridically. We should, therefore, strive to formulate a systematic, uniform and equitable code in this field,\n17.\tPerhaps the two most outstanding matters to be settled at the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea are the establishment of a regime governing the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the determination of the width of territorial waters. The approach to the first of these should be on the basis of the 15 principles approved by the General Assembly last year [resolution 2,.49 (XXV)], and particularly on the one which establishes that the sea-bed and the ocean floor are the common heritage of mankind,\n18.\tWe recognize the validity of the concern of several sister Latin American countries which claim maritime limits beyond 12 miles, on the grounds of their need to make use for their people of the resources that are becoming increasingly necessary for their subsistence, and in order to prevent their seizure by fishermen from distant lands. The time has come properly to define the special interest of coastal States in maintaining the productivity of the resources of the seas adjacent to their coasts and in the logical corollary of their sovereign right to establish exclusive and preferential fishing zones.\n19.\tEnvironmental and development problems cannot be solved by the isolated action of any country, nor even by the joint action of a group of countries. A general mobilization is called for since, in the final analysis, what is being sought is the protection of the true protagonist of the drama we are witnessing-man himself.\n20.\tTherefore, the importance of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to be held next year in Stockholm is unquestionable. Not only will the possibility of co-ordinating efforts come under study, but the point of departure will have to be the inescapable reality that most of the earth's surface and air-space are beyond the jurisdiction of nations, and for that reason their conservation demands international agreements.\n21.\tProblems vary from region to region and even from city to city; solutions, therefore, must always be adapted to specific needs. Industrialization often produces pollution, yet it is evident that no attempts should be made to hold back the development process. Any measure that hinders industrial progress in the weaker countries would be even less acceptable.\n22.\tThere has been a radical change in the political structure of the world in the last quarter of a century. The liberation of many nations that were under the yoke of colonialism has been accelerated, even though under the shadow of an armed peace in a time of uncertainty and fear.\n23.\tIt is my fond hope that this era of political \\\"decolonialization\\\" that we have been living in will be followed by another of economic \\\"decolonialization\\\" marked by shared progress among nations and by solidarity and effective action on their part in solving the problems that beset them.\n24.\tThe historical process which brought the benefits of modern civilization earlier to one group of nations caused an unbalanced stratification of the world community. The struggle for power among the industrialized countries went hand in hand with the advantages that accrued to them from their positions of dominance and the establishment of systems of exploitation that have survived into our times.\n25.\tIn the search for a new balance, we are now running the risk that short-sighted partisan interests will prevail over a more far-sighted willingness to co-operate. The only possible way of avoiding this danger is through reason, and this is its forum, the forum of truth.\n26.\tUnited, the poor nations must establish the bases upon which they can share in the world community with dignity, and the limits beyond which they are not prepared to go; for them, international relations are not a matter of dominance but of independence and development. They repudiate all anachronistic power theories, and they hold that the independence of nations must lead them to the abandonment of oligarchic systems and the establishment of an international democratic society.\n27.\tThere will be no peace in the world until there has been a basic reorganization of economic relations among nations. Today, the threat of atomic war is as serious as that of the growing inequality between the rich countries and the poor.\n28.\tConcepts of time and distance have been changed by means of communication, and peoples of all races and regions are at last learning the language of universal civilization. Thereby contrasts are sharpened, poverty is rendered more intolerable, the injustices of wars of aggression and the offenses committed against international co-operation become more evident.\n29.\tWe must ponder the negative effects of allowing prejudices to continue in the form of disdain for peoples and cultures different from those of the powerful nations, and we must stop to reflect on the degree to which a lack of solidarity when it defies the patient work of the United Nations may be considered a different expression of the same motives that lead to war.\n30.\tOne of the great virtues of the United Nations is that it has looked upon many peoples not as they were up to some years ago, but as what they can become in the future.\n31.\tWe must fight for the advent of an era of economic, social, and political equality and we must break the bonds of serfdom, so that all peoples may fulfill their creative potentials at once. We must guide along peaceful paths just aspirations to freedom, health, food, housing, education and full employment.\n32.\tThe demands of the majority of the world must not go unheeded. Our peoples are seeking answers and solutions to problems that have burdened them for many centuries, and they want to find them soon. The nature and the trend of the changes taking place over the face of vast continents depend in large measure on the attitude of the powerful nations towards those demands and on the efficacy of the machinery of co-operation.\n33.\tPost-war hostilities are dissolving. At the same time, frustration and reaction against unfair treatment must be prevented from provoking a new and radical schism in the world between the affluent nations and those struggling to surmount under-development.\n34.\tHowever, no country or group of countries, however powerful they may be, may take upon themselves the exclusive guidance of world affairs, still less the guardianship of other nations.\n35.\tWe are now suffering from the negative consequences of systems that were not designed to satisfy, in the long run, the true needs of the international community.\n36.\tA profound crisis is now manifest in the economic situation of the world-a crisis produced by defects in the regulatory machinery established at the end of the Second World War to reconcile the interests of the strongest countries and set up a financial system that was notoriously favorable to a dominant economy.\n37.\tWidespread concern regarding under-development was far from occupying a position of priority in the organizations-responsible for ensuring peace. The chief concern was to rebuild the economies of the most highly developed countries, re-establishing international trends, and defining spheres of political influence.\n38.\tThe majority had no say in the decisions designed to create a world to suit the most powerful, and the turmoil we are now experiencing was brought on by substantial alterations in the relative economic levels of the rich countries.\n39.\tFortunately, solidarity among the developing nations now represents a political force in the formulation of new strategies. We know that the millions who make up the bulk of mankind are behind the principles set forth in the Latin American Consensus of Vina del Mar, the Charter of Tequendama, the Charter of Algiers, and General Assembly resolution 2626 (XXV).\n40.\tThe liberalization of world trade took years of arduous negotiation. We were relatively optimistic about the future after the adoption of the generalized system of preferences, despite the fact that the exemptions affected only tariff barriers and not the quantitative restrictions produced by import quotas.\n41.\tThe principle under which the industrialized nations grant tariff advantages to poorer ones to enable them to sell their manufactures competitively represents a step forward towards offsetting the existing imbalance among countries at varying stages of development. This is evident particularly if it is considered that the developing countries in fact grant tariff advantages on imports of products of the industrialized nations because they are unable to do without the capital goods, machinery and equipment necessary for their progress.\n42.\tRecently, we have been subjected to forces that obstruct the modest but positive results made to date.\n43.\tIt is a source of satisfaction to us that this General Assembly, when convening the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADj should have expressed deep concern at the movement in certain countries towards the intensification of protectionism which damages the vital interests of the developing countries and stands in the way of the goals of the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n44.\tI consider it my duty to point out that the levying of an additional 10 per cent ad valorem tax on United States imports hurts my country's interests and those of all developing nations. A protectionist race must not come on the heels of an armaments race. We have already suffered from the effects of the transfer of the inflationary trends of the great Powers, and now we are feeling the consequences of balance-of-payments deficits and internal unemployment.\n45.\tThe industrialized countries should bear in mind that temporary or permanent tariff barriers levied against poor countries are not only unjustified and unnecessary, but also self-defeating. Most of the developing countries already have a deficit in their balance of payments, which will now become more acute; their manufactures are just beginning to enter the markets of the industrialized nations and such measures will only force us to reduce our imports.\n46.\tFurthermore, the developing world has been cooperating with the industrialized nations for many years by allowing them to invest in their countries and to obtain high profits, by becoming big customers for the industrialized nations' exports and suppliers of raw materials which they, in turn, process, enabling them thereby to trade anew with other economic Powers.\n47.\tMexico reaffirms the principles set forth in the Manifesto of Latin America, which represents the unanimous consensus of the member nations of the Special Latin American Co-ordinating Committee, adopted at its meeting held at Buenos Aires from 3 to 6 September this year, vis-a-vis the situation brought about unilaterally by the United States on 15 August last.\n48.\tIt also reiterates its support of the theses which make up the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] containing most of the principles supported by the countries of the Group of 77, whose number hps now grown considerably.\n49.\tSpecial heed should be given to the opinions and needs of the developing countries in the reorganization of the international monetary system. The agreement of all is necessary to ensure its effectiveness; hence, there will be no problem in abiding by its rules. It should not be considered an instrument at the service of the most powerful economies, but rather as a factor for the expansion of economic activity to assure increasing flows of capital, on optimum terms and interest conditions, towards countries that need it.\n50.\tOur country places special stress on the importance of the exchange of scientific and technological knowledge. For that reason it is closely watching the work of the Intergovernmental Group on Transfer of Technology. We feel sure the content of its report will contribute to the formulation of national and international policies to surmount the obstacles to public and multilateral action.\n51.\tAlthough advances in the field of economic cooperation have not been spectacular and the serious obstacles I have referred to have indeed existed, there is no doubt that they have wrought a change in the principles upon which international trade theory was based. We trust that the next session of UNCTAD, to be held in Chile in 1972, will at last crystallize the main points upon which the hopes of the developing world rest.\n52.\tWhile multilateral co-operation can be a factor for progress, the continuing growth of each country will be the outcome, primarily, of its own efforts and responsibility, like all the countries of Latin America, Mexico is fighting against time to provide higher standards of living for its people. Its goals concern mainly productivity and modernization of the agricultural economy, reorientation of industrial policy, redistribution of income, training of human resources, reorganization of public finances, and educational opportunities for all.\n53.\tEconomic integration is a collective instrument for accelerating the progress of Latin America. Its attainment should be one of the objectives of the national policy of all the countries of the area. Integration is an irreversible process, since our peoples already know that they cannot be left aside by trends towards the formation of larger economic areas. It is for this reason that Mexico is especially interested in having closer and more dynamic economic relations with all its neighboring sister nations.\n54.\tIf this is to be achieved, it will be necessary to pay closer attention, among other mechanisms, to supplementary industrial agreements by the members of the Latin\nAmerican Free Trade Association, to increase existing margins of preferences, to create truly Latin American multinational companies, to seek to replace our shortages of agricultural products with others of the region, and to improve regional financing machinery in order to facilitate the exporting of manufactures and semi-manufactures to third parties.\n55.\tMexico reasserts, on this occasion, its support for the Latin American integration process and expresses its eager-ness to see this become a reality on a large scale.\n56.\tThere is nothing at the present time to justify great optimism with respect to the immediate future. At the same time, we find hope and encouragement in the knowledge that there are men of all races and ideologies who are giving the best of themselves to establish a just order. One of the most illustrious of these men is our Secretary-General, U Thant, who has devoted to the cause of peace his intelligence and determination together with his unlimited capacity to persuade and conciliate. As he has already announced, this will be the last session of the Assembly at which he will act in his distinguished post. Once again, on behalf of Mexico, at this time I wish to pay attribute to U Thant for the invaluable services he has rendered to the United Nations over the past decade.\n57.\tWith the succinctness the occasion demands, I have reviewed the items I believe to be of greatest importance among the many on our agenda. I offer these thoughts for the consideration of members of this Assembly. There can be no better repository for them than this forum, exponent par excellence of world opinion and the aspirations of the human race.\n58.\tIn taking my leave of you and expressing my appreciation for your kind willingness to hear me, I should like to conclude by reaffirming my faith and that of my people in the future of the United Nations. Our Organization is humanity's guide and mirror, and, therefore, our faith in the future runs parallel to our faith in man and his destiny.\n59.\tThe course of history is marked by advances and retreats, victories and defeats but, in the final analysis^ there is always an irreversible gain. What has been attained domestically through the establishment of government by law must be achieved in the sphere of the international community we have all pledged to build. Its ideal structure is outlined in our Charter, each of its principles and aims represents a daily challenge that we must meet in a fitting manner.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, I feel happy and privileged to be able, in my capacity as Prime Minister of Malaysia, to deliver my first address to the General Assembly under your distinguished Presidency. I have had the pleasure of working closely with you over many years during which we have collaborated together (to forge ever-closer relations between our two neighboring countries and to strengthen regional ties among the countries of South-East Asia. From my long and close association with you I have come to know and to admire your remarkable attributes as a courageous leader of Indonesia and a wise and far-sighted statesman of Asia. Now with you as its President this General Assembly is assured of brisk, impartial and effective guidance of its affairs. It is with special pleasure, therefore, that I offer my sincere congratulations to you on your election as President of the General Assembly.\n2.\tI wish to take this opportunity to convey to your distinguished predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, my delegation's warm admiration and thanks for his patient and statesmanlike leadership in steering the historic and difficult twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.\n3.\tMy decision to come to the United Nations at the first available opportunity upon assuming office as Prime Minister of my country just a year ago reflects my Government's continued commitment to the ideals and the purposes and principles of the Charter. It also reflects my keen desire to renew personally my Government's pledge of support for the United Nations system in all its endeavors to secure for humanity a safe, just and prosperous international order.\n4.\tOver the 26 years of its existence, the United Nations can claim to have played an important role in human affairs. It has often been successful in restraining the wilder excesses of power politics on the international stage. Its\n\nefforts have brought the colonial system almost to an end, except for the stubborn resistance to decolonization in southern Africa. It has formulated and implanted certain basic principles of human rights and human dignity. It has played a considerable role in the field of disarmament. Its activities in the field of economic development have been of immense value to developing countries. All that and more the United Nations can rightly claim.\n5.\tIt will be noticed that I have described the record quite modestly. I have done so on purpose because I believe it is important that we do not lose ourselves or our bearings in a welter of self-congratulations about the United Nations. The achievements of the United Nations are sufficiently remarkable to stand by themselves without any embellishment. But it is important that, as we meet here each September, we should ask ourselves what part the United Nations plays in the lives of our countries and in the formulation of our foreign policies. Are we in fact serious about the United Nations? It is understandable that the bright glow and expectations of the dawn of 1945 have inevitably paled in the cold light of experience over the last 26 years.\n6.\tWe should nevertheless frankly face the question whether the people of the world look with hope and expectation to each session of the General Assembly or whether they, and their Governments, regard it as yet another international meeting which consumes a disproportionately vast expenditure of time and money.\n7.\tLet me say at once that I, for my part, do not regard the annual session of the General Assembly as merely a ritual gathering of world statesmen. Nevertheless, I am acutely conscious of the disillusionment and disappointment experienced by many people and many Governments the world over in the United Nations. This is a fact which we must face; we must not gloss over it; we cannot ignore it in the hope that it will somehow disappear. Of course, the United Nations will go on. But do we take seriously its role in international affairs as a center for harmonizing conflicting interests and as a catalyst for peaceful change? Or have we established alternative networks of relationships for the solution of our problems while paying suitable and regular obeisance to the United Nations? For my part, it is precisely because I value the United Nations-what it stands for and what it can achieve-that I urge the Assembly to take a dispassionate and even a critical look at the direction in which we are going.\n8.\tBy its very nature, of course, the United Nations has to work on the basis of the factors underlying the international society: the interests, the fears and suspicions, the hopes and the expectations of the Member States. It represents the sum total of the national entities of which it\nis composed. But it should be more than the sum of its parts. This annual gathering in New York must be something more than a meeting of representatives of national Governments. It should also be an expression of the concept that there is an international community which bears responsibility for dealing with matters that refuse to be confined within our national boundaries, This does not mean that we should ignore the fact that we assemble here to promote the interests of our own national constituencies. But we must try to go beyond that and to remember that we also comprise a collective body whose electorate is the international society. That is the framework within which the United Nations must operate. One of the great challenges of the 70s is whether the nations of the world can, in their pursuit of national objectives, conform to the underlying concepts and norms of the Charter and work together as a global community,\n9.\tI believe that sometimes we have succeeded. From time to time we have shown our consciousness of the fact that we are ail fellow passengers on this fragile planet Earth. We are on this journey together; we are becoming inevitably more interdependent. It is this consciousness of a world community which we must carefully cultivate and nurture.\n10.\tThe facts of international life in the world today are such that the further development of the United Nations is dependent, in the first place, on the attitude of the major Powers. They have it in them to decide whether the United Nations can become a truly effective Organization which is capable of fulfilling both its purposes and the hopes and expectations of mankind. This is because those hopes and expectations cannot be ignored. The resolutions of the United Nations can be ignored. The weak, developing countries can be ignored. It depends on the major Powers, therefore, what role the United Nations will play on the international stage.\n11.\tThere is at the same time a corresponding obligation on the part of the smaller Powers. Just as we must do our utmost to avoid the alienation from the United Nations of smaller countries because of the dominating role of the major Powers, so also we must strive to prevent the alienation of the major Powers from the Organization through the attempted imposition of the will of the majority. Speaking as a representative of a small developing country, I am acutely conscious of the fact that the simple- mechanical process of majority voting along group, political or ideological lines will not solve any problem. There is often a need for greater realism and restraint. Greater efforts might be made through the process of negotiation and consultation to arrive at solutions which, while they must be solutions of principle, are at the same time realistic and attainable.\n12.\tThere is, however, one aspect of this matter which must not be lost sight of. The rhetoric and resolutions of the United Nations cannot simply be dismissed as a sign of immaturity or irresponsibility, because they are often only the expression of the impotence of the group of developing countries in the United Nations. We cry aloud in the hope that we may be heard. We seek to express our appeal and our outrage at the human condition to which all humanity must bear witness. We seek to remind a callous world of the horrors and injustices of apartheid and colonialism in southern Africa, of the tragic plight of the people of Palestine, and of the continuing struggle against human poverty and human misery which face such a vast majority of mankind. I need not add any more to that list. The problems of the world which cry out for solution are quite familiar to us all.\n13.\tNow let w pause a moment and look again at the situation in southern Africa, The stubborn refusal of the South African Government to abandon its abhorrent apartheid policy and its persistent denial of United Nations authority in respect of Namibia must be regarded as constituting one of the grave challenges confronting the United Nations. There are also the entrenched forces of colonialism in Southern Rhodesia, Angola and Mozambique. Some five or six years ago, there was a glimmer of hope. Since then, dark clouds have enveloped the horizon almost completely. It cannot be denied that South Africa's contemptuous disregard of the United Nations has established a precedent whose corroding influence on the authority and credibility of the Organization has already begun to assume alarming proportions. Today, it is my hope that the recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice  will give the necessary impetus to the Security Council to take positive action which could represent a breakthrough in this tragic issue.\n14.\tI refer to another problem with which the United Nations continues to grapple, and that is the situation in West Asia. Resolution 242 (1967) was unanimously approved by the Security Council to provide the framework for a peaceful settlement. Four years have since passed, and we are almost precisely where we were then. Israel continues to be in, illegal occupation of Arab territory. The people of Palestine continue to be denied their inalienable rights. While noting with deep regret the negative Israeli at'itude, let me express the hope that the positive reply of the Arab Republic of Egypt to the initiative taken by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General will enable the search for a peaceful settlement to proceed forward.\n15.\tI do not wish to sound unduly pessimistic. Looking at the picture as a whole, and looking towards the future, we may find some encouragement in the events of the last session of the General Assembly. That session was characterized by a degree of understanding and co-operation. The culmination of the first quarter-century of the Organization was marked by the adoption of several historic declarations which together sum up the progress already made and the determination to continue with the work of achieving the purposes of the United Nations. I refer to the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]; the Declaration, on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)]; the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction[resolution 2749 (XXV)]; and, finally the International Development Strategy for the Second\nUnited Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. It is in this sense that I view the decade that we have just begun as one of hope as well as one of great challenge and opportunity for the United Nations.\n16.\tI should like specifically to refer now to the problem of economic development, which is the single most crucial issue facing the developing countries. The challenge facing the international community does not concern merely economic development; it is in its totality a challenge to the peace and stability, and indeed the survival, of mankind. What the world is striving for, to ensure a durable peace, is not merely a balance of power but a balance, of prosperity, of opportunity and of well-being-and in this the developed as much as the developing countries have a mutual stake and interest.\n17.\tIt is in this context that I view the urgent and compelling need for the effective implementation of the International Development Strategy of the Second Development Decade. While economic development must remain the primary responsibility of the developing countries themselves, it is essential that their dedication and labors should be matched by development assistance and more favorable economic and commercial policies on the part of the developed countries, equally dedicated and committed to the attainment of the goals of the Second Development Decade.\n18.\tThe problem of development must, therefore, be approached in the perspective of creating the over-all conditions necessary for peace and stability in the world. Unless there is a genuine partnership between the developed and the developing countries, and unless economic development is accepted as a common challenge to all, the prospects for a radical improvement in the world economic framework and consequently the prospects for establishing a sound basis for world peace and security will remain as remote as ever.\n19.\tWhit I am advocating, in sum, is a realistic appraisal of the United Nations as it is today and, in the light of that appraisal, a renewed effort to fulfill the dreams and hopes which were born in San Francisco 26 years ago. I am aware that what I have said is not new: we are all conscious of it, though we may not often wish to express our thoughts-but I believe we must if we value the United Nations. It is useless to come to the United Nations each September to say polite things to one another and then to go on our separate ways. Let us even be a little impatient, a little critical of ourselves. Let us look at our agenda and remind ourselves how many of the items on it have become hardy annuals on which we appear to be going through the same debates every year. Is it any wonder, then, that there is increasing disillusionment about the United Nations? What should we think, what would our people think, if every year in our own national assemblies the same debates took place, the same decisions were taken and then things went on precisely as they had been before?\n20.\tLet us reassess our position, let us take stock of where we stand and apply ourselves with vigor and tenacity to solving the problems which face us. Let us remember that words are only words. We must mean what we say and we must do our utmost to see through to the end what we have agreed upon. We must have a sense of commitment and a clear sense of direction. There must be a definite and sustained follow-through of the sentiments we express here. Only in that way can the United Nations succeed. I believe it is important, indeed vital, that the United Nations should succeed. I should like it to occupy a central place in our consideration of foreign policy. I should like it to capture the imagination and live up to the hopes of our people. To those ends I pledge Malaysia's readiness to play its part.\n21.\tI believe it would be right that in this statement '7 should also address myself to the political and security situation, especially as it affects South-East Asia. There c >n be little doubt that the 70s will be a period of great challenge and opportunity. We are already witnessing the beginnings of a momentous drama dawning on the political horizon. In Asia, in particular, while wars and human suffering admittedly still rage, there are already hopeful signs of a gradual thaw in long-held rigid positions of the protagonists in the ideological and political confrontation in the area. The recent announcement by Washington and Peking of a visit by the President of the United States, Mr. Nixon, to China in the near future is a dramatic manifestation of that thaw. I do not entertain any illusions about the outcome of that meeting, but it is essential that we should be aware of the significance of the moment and that we should seize the opportunity to chart a new course of destiny in Asia and the world.\n22.\tWhile the dialog among the major Powers is a welcome development, it may be well for the other countries of Asia not to be content to be spectators in this unfolding drama; for in the evolution of a new situation which such dialog among the major Powers may well bring about it is essential that the interests of all countries, both the big Powers and the small Powers, should be accommodated. In terms of peace and security in Asia, I believe that South-East Asia would have a great relevance in the establishment of an Asian equilibrium and it is incumbent upon the nations of South-East Asia to play a positive role in this dynamic political evolution.\n23.\tThis leads me to the policy of neutralization of South-East Asia which Malaysia has been advocating in the past year or so as the only possible and viable long-term solution to bring peace and stability to that region. It is in this context that I welcome the initiative if the Government of Ceylon in proposing that the India** Ocean area be declared a zone of peace [A/8492J. The United Nations should take action towards this objective while there is still time and before the military involvement of the major Powers in the area assumes significant proportions.\n24.\tAs regards the proposal for the neutralization of South-East Asia, my Government has on many occasions explained the considerations which have led us to make the proposal. I do not, therefore, propose to elaborate on them again. What is required in South-East Asia, in our view, is a new international order under which the region would be free and isolated from competition and interference from outside power and under which the neutrality of the region, and the independence and territorial integrity of the countries in it, would be fully guaranteed.\n25.\tThe essence of the neutralization proposal must be the recognition and accommodation of the legitimate interests of all Powers concerned in the area-the guarantor Powers as well as the countries within the area itself. There needs to be a harmonizing of all these interests, the end result of which should be an order everyone can live with. The question really is, therefore: is there room for adjustment and accommodation so that there can emerge in time an international order which is acceptable to all and is compatible with the legitimate interests of all? Surely there must be, if there is a determined will and effort on the part of all concerned to work for the attainment of that objective.\n26.\tThe countries in South-East Asia have a primary role to play in bringing about the conditions which are necessary for the realization of the neutralization proposal and to show that a neutralized South-East Asia meets the legitimate interests of the great Powers themselves. The question of peace and war in South-East Asia affects all of us in the region. It is, therefore, my firm conviction that on these questions we in South-East Asia should consult closely together and should move together for the attainment of our common objectives.\n27.\tCentral to this approach is the cultivation of a sense of regional cohesion and solidarity. The movement towards regionalism is gaining increasing momentum among the countries of South-East Asia and there have been established many regional bodies covering such matter, as education, transport and communication, development financing, and so on. Above all, there is the region's own body, the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN], formed and fashioned by us some five years ago to forge closer links and to promote co-operation in economic, social and cultural matters among its members.\n28.\tFor my part, I view the exercise in regional cooperation in South-East Asia exemplified by ASEAN as having a value beyond that of merely economic, social and cultural co-operation. Even more important, such cooperation will engender conditions of stability in the region and a sense of solidarity and cohesion among South-East Asian countries. It will constitute the solid foundation for the realization of the neutralization proposal for South-East Asia.\n29.\tOne of the essential prerequisites for the realization of the neutralization proposal is the existence of a dialog between the major Powers. It is important that the channels of dialog be opened and widened, and the most important of these channels is China's participation in the United Nations. That China should be in the United Nations is, after 22 years, no longer a matter of dispute. There are, however, certain shall I say technical differences among us. I wish, therefore, to take this opportunity to state the position of my Government.\n30.\tMalaysia will oppose any draft resolution which proposes \\\"dual representation\\\" for the se belonging to China because, in our view, there is one China and one seat for China in the United Nations. It is beyond doubt that the Government of the People's Republic of China is de jure and de facto the Government of China. Also, in our view, the seating of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations does not involve the expulsion of an existing Member, as this question does not arise. We shall, therefore, have to oppose any draft resolution that puts forward such a view. As things stand at present, what has been termed the Albanian draft resolution [A/L.630 and AddJ] most nearly meets our position. If there is no other proposal which comes closer to our position, we will support that draft resolution, but I wish to make it clear that, in our view, the question of Taiwan is a separate issue which will have to be resolved by the parties concerned. We are anxious that this question should be peacefully resolved. It is our hope that in the solution of this problem due account will be taken of the wishes of the people of Taiwan, to be ascertained by the process of self- determination.\n31.\tIt is my hope that, with the participation of China in the United Nations, we shall enter a new era of meaningful dialog among all the major Powers of the world so that, as a result of that dialog, conflicts could be blunted and disparate interests harmonized. One of the great virtues of the United Nations as a center for harmonizing the actions of States is that it is not only the consensus of the big Powers that counts but the consensus of the entire membership.. The United Nations is, therefore, the forum in which not only the interests of the major Powers can be reconciled but the consensus of the major Powers can be, reconciled with, and even serve, the interests of the entire international community. That, I submit, is what the United Nations is all about, and it lies within our hands to make our Organization discharge this function.\n32.\tMay I finally say a few words about our Secretary- General. He came into office following the tragedy that befell his predecessor. From that moment of tragedy he has unobtrusively but resolutely held the United Nations together by his strength and quiet dignity. It is very difficult for me to express the deep debt of gratitude which we owe to him. Through 10 full years, with unfailing devotion he has steered the Organization through many perils. We all know how difficult is the task of the Secretary-General. But his unflinching perseverance in his endeavors to give practical expression to aims and purposes of the Charter is an example from which we may draw inspiration. His work will be remembered by present and future leaders of the United Nations, and history will preserve his name as one of the architects of international co-operation and understanding. In many crises, especially in the crises of confidence the United Nations has had to face now and again, U Thant has represented all that is best in the United Nations. We wish to express to him our gratitude. We hope that he will remain available in the future for other great services to the United Nations in fields where his experience and ability would bring the Organization great results. May I, in conclusion, express my wish and my prayer that he and his family will enjoy continued health and happiness in the years to come?\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "191.\tBefore delivering my speech, 1 should like to express the condolences of my delegation to the delegation of Honduras on the occasion of the death this morning of Mr. Ramon Villeda Morales. The family of the deceased may rest assured that it has our greatest sympathy.\n192.\tMr. President, first I should like to convey to you the sincerest congratulations of the Central African delegation on your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This inspired choice is a well-deserved tribute to your qualities as a statesman and distinguished diplomat who has contributed to a greater knowledge of international problems. I am convinced that, under your guidance, the business of this session, which now appears to be so delicate, will be crowned with success.\n193.\tI am also pleased to join in the tribute paid to your predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro, who conducted the business of the commemorative twenty-fifth anniversary session of this Assembly with great talent and ability.\n194.\tFinally, it is with genuine pleasure that I wish to pay tribute to Secretary-General U Thant and to express to him, on behalf of the Government of the Central African Republic, our admiration for his qualities as a courageous and upright servant of the international community; we wish to say to him how much we appreciate his services to the Organization and his constant efforts in the cause of peace and justice throughout the world.\n195.\tMay I now be allowed to perform the pleasant duty of welcoming, on behalf of the Government of the Central African Republic and my entire delegation, the fraternal States of Bhutan, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, which have just recently joined the great family of the United Nations. We would express to their respective peoples our sincerest wishes for their prosperity and well-being.\n196.\tThe last session of the General Assembly, in choosing to commemorate its anniversary with the central theme of \\\"peace, justice and progress\\\", succinctly summed up all that mankind hopes and expects from the United Nations and its work.\n197.\tIt is our task first, to ensure peace, freedom and independence for the people of the world, excluding all forms of hegemony, and, secondly, to create conditions in which the achievements of science and technology may serve the development of mankind.\n198.\tThe United Nations, created 26 years ago, had the mission of establishing a lasting peace and improving the fate of mankind. That mission is clearly defined in the Charter of our Organization and in the Declaration of Human Rights whereby the Central African Republic has most solemnly reaffirmed its belief and firm conviction that men are born free with equal rights. We have, of course, gone a long way towards the realization of this lofty ideal. But, in view of the perils which still loom on our horizon and the concern which has been created by the present international situation, we believe that the United Nations is far from having achieved all our hopes.\n199.\tOur Organization looks today very much like a fragile vessel adrift on a dangerous sea: millions of men are still, prey to conflicts, oppression, poverty and despair. Furthermore, a whole host of new threats and challenges lies ahead: population growth, deterioration of the human environment, the scourge of drugs, and attempts at subverting States internally, to name but a few. But in the face of these scourges, how have the ideals laid down in San Francisco fared?\n200.\tIt is high time that we renewed the commitments which we have to peace and which all States, great and small, have the overriding duty to respect. Simply reaffirming our faith in the United Nations is not enough. We must express our faith by acting in such a way as to resolve the problems which disrupt international relations in a peaceful way under the Charter.\n201.\tWe live in a world where peace is constantly threatened, even disturbed; and that can be denied by no one. Today we are witnessing an unbridled nuclear arms race, the proliferation of which can only serve to increase the concern of all mankind.\n202.\tWhen my country, the Central African Republic, signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], we clearly demonstrated our determination to do away, once and for all, with nuclear arsenals in the interest of general and complete disarmament, under effective international control, in the near future, so that the entire world may regain full confidence in a lasting and universal peace.\n203.\tThe negotiations which have already been begun to reach agreement on the limitation, control and verification of nuclear and biological weapons command our complete support.\n204.\tAs a positive step towards a relaxation of international tension, we also welcome the proposal for an early Conference on European security and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin. \n205.\tAfter stating the position of my delegation on disarmament, I now wish to set forth as briefly as possible our views on other equally important problems which command attention throughout the world.\n206.\tThe situation in Indo-China remains one of the concerns of world public opinion. The war which was limited to Viet-Nam has spread to the entire area, and we whole-heartedly welcome the decision of the United States of America to withdraw its troops from Viet-Nam. We earnestly hope that this withdrawal will be accelerated and that the Paris talks on Viet-Nam will soon enjoy a successful outcome.\n207.\tThe crisis in the Middle East continues to be one of the major concerns of our Organization. The Central African Republic supports any action that will ensure implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) on the Middle East. Here we welcome the position of the parties concerned in favor of maintaining the cease-fire, which is at present in force, and we trust that the Jarring mission, as well as the very recent mission of the Organization of African Unity, will command everyone's support, which is needed if these missions are to be pursued successfully.\n208.\tWhat can be said of the persistence of colonialism and racial discrimination in Africa, and in particular in southern Africa?\n209.\tEleven years ago the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was adopted b, the General Assembly [resolution 1514 (XV)]. We are entitled to question the genuine determination of the international community to ensure the triumph of the struggle of the peoples of Africa, and in particular of the peoples in the southern part of our continent, for the recognition of their legitimate rights to freedom and independence.\n210.\tIn Namibia, as in the Territories under Portuguese domination, in Zimbabwe as in South Africa, we cannot fail to note that the most elementary human freedoms continue to be flouted, notwithstanding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant resolutions of tne United Nations.\n211.\tWhile the United Nations record in the area of decolonization may be very impressive, inasmuch as so many of the Territories formerly colonized or under trusteeship have become independent and today usefully participate in the work of the United Nations, the fact remains that the situation is explosive in the regions that I have mentioned. Colonialism must be uprooted from Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). The international community must see to it that the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly will signal the beginning of the end of colonialism, wherever that anachronistic and retrograde phenomenon exists.\n212.\tThe Central African Republic, therefore, preaches the need by all available means to ensure the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\n213.\tAware of the dangers threatening Africa in our sorely troubled world, my country, the Central African Republic, recognizes that peace in our continent with absolute neutrality is a prerequisite for the successful development of African countries.\n214.\tIt is consistent with this belief that the Head of the Central African State, H.E. General Jean-Bedel Bokassa, has relentlessly opposed the use of force and violence and advocated dialog and negotiations to settle all disputes and to maintain peace in Africa and peace between Africa and the rest of the world.\n215.\tWith respect to apartheid, I wish to remind the Assembly that in February 1965 the second regular session of the Defense Commission of the Organization of African Unity was held on problems of defense at Freetown, Sierra Leone, under the presidency of H.E. General Jean-Bedel Bokassa, then Chief of Staff for National defense. That Conference adopted certain steps to settle gradually the distressing problems of racial discrimination in South Africa.\n216.\tThe intention was, of course, to endeavor to settle this question through the use of arms. After the conference, the Government of the Central African Republic created a section Of its national army which could at any time be mobilized in the event that the Organization of African Unity should decide to take action against South Africa in order to liberate our oppressed brothers in that area.\n217.\tRegrettably, however, with the passing of the years Africans seemed less and less inclined to consider such action through the Organization of African Unity, notwithstanding the militant speeches and slogans which have become traditional at each session of the Organization of African Unity and of the United Nations General Assembly.\n218.\tFurthermore, the entire world has witnessed the constant efforts of the United Nations in the form of economic and other sanctions against South Africa, which, unfortunately, have proven ineffective because, on the one hand, certain European countries allegedly friends of Africa continue to maintain relations of all kinds with Pretoria and to supply it with weapons and, on the other hand, it must be recognized that products produced in South Africa may be found in most of the African continent.\n219.\tIn the face of these contradictions and dilatory moves which only serve to delay a settlement of the disturbing problem of South Africa, the Central African Republic has advocated a dialog. The idea would be to try this course in the same way as many others have been tried, because we are convinced that violence could only serve to harden the resistance of the white minority in South Africa to all change and development.\n220.\tWe believe that for the African countries primarily concerned in this problem there can be only two ways to stamp out apartheid. The first is to wage war against South Africa; secondly, on the opposite hypothesis, which is the present situation, to engage in a dialog with South Africa. That solution appears to us in the Central African Republic to be the only realistic way out of the present impasse to promote the indispensable dialog between white and black citizens in South Africa.\n221 v The Central African Republic, consistent with the principle of universality of our Organization, has followed developments in the question of the representation of China in the United Nations with interest. However, in the opinion of my Government the universal character of our Organization should not be promoted to the detriment of its moral authority. We are not opposed to having the People's Republic of China join the efforts of the international community to carry out the goals and principles of ifie United Nations. My country, however, will not tolerate the idea of expelling the Republic of China, a peace-loving country which has maintained excellent relations at all levels and in all ways with the people of the Central African Republic, a country which, in addition, ever since the creation of our Organization has been a responsible and loyal Member.\n222.\tIt is with this in mind that my delegation considers that any draft resolution which would have the effect of depriving the Republic of China of its representation in the United Nations should be considered an important question) requiring a two-thirds majority vote under Article 18 of the Charter. My delegation will therefore support the draft resolution of the United States of America on this subject [A]L.634 and, Add.lJ.\n223.\tPeace is not only the absence of war. It has also and above all an economic, social and cultural content. In a world where States are independent and economies interdependent, the lack of economic co-operation is dangerous, for if material Well-being is not in itself the only goal of men and nations, it is unquestionably one of the foundations of a decent life. The tragedy of our times lies in the fact that material well-being is not very- widespread in the world. For us, in a low income country, the most important objective is and remains the economic and social progress of our people. That is the top priority.\n224.\tWe are aware of the fact that assistance for development goes through two essential channels: one is bilateral and multilateral, and the other is international. In the former case, we shall never cease to say that assistance should from all points of view be free of all political considerations. Financial organizations should adopt a more flexible attitude, especially by granting longer repayment schedules and reasonable interest rates, making it possible for the disadvantaged countries to increase their economic capacity.\n225.\tIn the latter case the United Nations should bring together the industrialized countries and, the developing countries in a network of more effective co-operation in economic, commercial, technological, social and cultural fields. In so doing it would be making a major contribution to alleviating the plight of mankind in what is becoming increasingly one world.\n726* This inequality, as is well known, is increasing daily as a result of the constant deterioration in the terms of trade which, while depriving the developing countries of sizable resources in their struggle for progress, contribute to widening the gap between the well-to-do countries and the disadvantaged countries.\n227.\tLast year, two United Nations initiatives commanded our attention and should serve to remedy this inequality.\n228.\tIn October 1970, the General Assembly adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], which, it is to be hoped, will succeed in co-ordinating further the action possibilities of the international community and thus assisting the developing countries in their efforts. As the fundamental objective of the Strategy is an average rate of growth of 6 per cent of the gross national product of the developing countries and a program covering the whole range of economic and social development, each developed country should ensure the transfer to the developing countries of an amount from public and private sources equal to 1 per cent of its gross national product.\n229.\tlater last December the General Assembly adopted a series of provisions [resolution 2688 (XXV)] making it possible for the United Nations system of development to provide greater resources more effectively. These changes should ensure closer co-ordination within each recipient country of the activities of the various United Nations agencies,\n230.\tAll these measures justify considerable hope. We are anxiously awaiting their prompt and effective implementation.\n231.\tBut assistance is not enough. The developing countries need new outlets in the industrialized countries for their manufactures.\n232.\tIn this connexion we intend to support the proposal put forward by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium at the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly [1765th meeting] to ascribe greater importance to the \nprocessing and marketing of raw materials at the places where they are produced or developed.\n233.\tIn this regard we would call on the United Nations to use its influence with the specialized agencies dealing with loans and development to promote greater assistance to the less developed countries. As was stressed from this rostrum last year by H.E. General Jean-Bedel Bokassa:\n\\\"We believe also that the United Nations specialized agencies should be freed from the abusive influence of certain States which do not hesitate to delay, even to thwart and to boycott, consideration of background material presented by certain other States whose political leanings are not to their liking.\n\\\"The Central African Republic, for its part, has denounced and will continue to denounce these maneuvers, whoever may be their perpetrators.\n\\\"Those bodies should in particular lend a more sympathetic ear to certain projects of paramount importance to developing countries, and particularly to the less favored among them such as the land-locked countries, when, for various reasons, such projects cannot be financed with the framework of bilateral assistance or by those who can offer private funds.\\\" [1875th meeting, para. 136-138.]\n234.\tWe are aware of the fact that foreign aid cannot be fully effective unless it is supported by an intense effort at the national level. The Central African Republic, under the guidance of its dynamic Head of State and within the framework of \\\"Operation Bokassa\\\" is resolutely engaged in a sustained national effort for social and economic development.\n235.\tThe social and economic objectives of my country have been clearly set forth in the Charter of our National Party, the MESAN [Movement for the Social Development of Black Africa], \\\"To feed, house, care for, clothe and educate\\\" is our slogan.\n236.\t\\\"Operation Bokassa\\\", a vast development strategy set up by the Head of State of the Central African Republic, General Jean-BedeJ. Bokassa, directly after the took power in 1966, has mobilized all the vital forces of the nation to develop harmoniously its economic, social and cultural potential, and has made it possible for my country to double and treble the output of its main products: cotton, coffee, tobacco, wood, diamonds, etc., thereby exceeding our fondest hopes.\n237.\tThe development of the Central African Republic is then first and foremost a national effort. We are, however, convinced of the virtues of co-operation in all fields and at all levels: bilateral, multilateral, regional, subregional and international. However, as was stressed here last year by H.E. General Jean-BedeJ Bokassa, the President of the Central African Republic, we want this co-operation to be dispensed unconditionally, without any thoughts of domination or intimidation, so as to ensure the attainment of the goals and the requirements of the United Nations.\n238.\tOn the subject of the United Nations, one observer has pointed out that endless speeches are made here.\n239.\tLike other speakers, we have spoken about disarmament, the maintenance of peace, apartheid, decolonization and economic and social co-operation between all the peoples of the world. We have all mentioned the purposes and the principles that the distinguished founders of the United Nations laid down in the Charter as the basis and the objective of our Organization, which can be summed up as follows:\n\\\"To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which ... has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and\n\\\"To reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and\n\\\"To establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and\n\\\"To promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\\\"\n240.\tUnfortunately, the recommendations and the resolutions adopted by our Organization in the implementation of these noble objectives have not always met with the results which the peoples of the United Nations had a right to expect.\n241.\tAll this illustrates the thinking of the philosopher Karl Jaspers, who stated that the United Nations is a place where endless speeches are made, and an ill-intentioned observer might be tempted to say that it is a place where fruitless votes are taken.\n242.\tWill the international community be able to ensure international peace and security? Will it be able to ensure respect for human dignity by doing its utmost to stamp out the last bastions of colonialism? Will it be able to ensure economic, social and cultural well-being? Those are all questions which are of concern to mankind and whose solution constitutes the hope of peoples of the world.\n243.\tMay the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly prompt all nations to share and respect the spirit and the letter of the Charter, which remains the foundation of peace and fraternity among all peoples. May it also provide proof that the United Nations is not a place where one is satisfied with endless speeches and fruitless votes.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, on behalf of my Government, I wish to convey to you our most sincere congratulations upon the special distinction conferred on you by the Assembly in electing you its President for its twenty-sixth session. We are greatly pleased with this election because of the special ties which the defense of the legitimate rights and interests of the developing countries has forged between our two countries. Your election is a token of appreciation of your contribution to the cause of the independence of your country and your long and distinguished career in the service of Indonesia and in defense of the lofty ideals of the international community. It is, likewise, a tribute to the age-old continent, the cradle of civilizations, to which your country belongs.\n2.\tWe should also like to pay a tribute of thanks to your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Edward Hambro, who conducted the activities of the last session of this Assembly with skill, prudence and balance.\n3.\tWe are especially happy, on this occasion, to extend a cordial greeting to the new Member States of the Organization: Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar.\n4.\tIn this general debate, we shall refrain from giving our position in detail in relation to specific agenda items. Our delegation will give its views thereon in the relevant debates.\n5.\tI should like, instead, to turn my attention, in this unique forum of the nations of the world, to fundamental principles that my Government regards as essential for the consolidation and progress of international order.\n6.\tTechnological advances have brought profound changes to means of social communication and transportation in general. As distances grow shorter and as relations among people are made easier, our earth, has become smaller and we who inhabit it feel closer to one another. When man reached the moon, a new, vital dimension was created: the space age. More than ever we are aware' of the unity and interdependence of the peoples of the world, that we are all members of the human race and that the whole earth is our great home. Can international borders perchance be seen from outer space?\n7.\tIn addition, this revolution in time and space offered to us by technology has created on our earthly planet a new situation: a similarity in the way of life. We are all beginning to have similar problems, similar dwellings, common concerns, identical preoccupations, similar customs. Thus, on the one hand, national communities are becoming aware of their own individuality, while, on the other hand, we are coming to realize how the fate of one affects the fate of all.\n8.\tGradually, in a somewhat confused though perfectly perceptible manner, we note that States that were regarded yesterday as a whole are today no more than parts of a- greater whole: our earth. Thus there emerges a new concept: that of mankind. We think of mankind as all the peoples of the world and, thus conceived, mankind appears to us as a world-wide society which encompasses us all and which is in opposition to individual societies or States, having their own lives, it is true, but dependent on the development of that greater society.\n9.\tWe understand that society-both national and international-seeks not only to satisfy certain needs but rather to organize collective life in order that it may lead to the development of mankind as a whole. This modern concept of development has placed co-operation, both at the national and international levels, in a completely new perspective.\n10.\tThe collective task is the development of civilization in other words, of man and of all men; of each people and of all peoples. There is need, therefore, for a social discipline capable of co-ordinating the activities of all for the benefit of ail. Today we can therefore speak, even in strictly scientific terms, of a universal duty to co-operate devolving upon all individuals and all communities. We, in fact, are here on earth to carry out together a common task: the development of mankind.\nA/PV.1944\n11.\tThe harmonious and human development of a civilization goes far beyond divisions within and between States. Art, science, philosophy and literature are today, more than ever before, the fruits of our collective work, it is thus that, over and above the particular characteristics of each nation, perhaps still not clearly defined but quite perceptible nonetheless, there progressively emerges the concept of the Universal Common Good towards which the interests of all peoples on earth should be directed.\n12.\tIn my earlier interventions in this same Assembly on relations between peoples, international order and peace, 1 emphasized the fact that we should seek to achieve an international order inspired by International Social Justice and oriented towards the Universal Common Good. I had occasion to refer only to International Social Justice. Today I should like to speak about the Universal Common Good.\n13.\tMan does not stand alone. Society guarantees him a full life and his right to seek perfection. He has obligations towards the community where he lives. Therefore man must devote his endeavors to collective tasks, to the common good, that is to say, the good of all individuals in other words the good of individuals taken as a whole. Society constitutes a whole, because it unifies the action of its members for the benefit of all. It is thus that it has been possible to define the common good as the combination of all social conditions enabling the human person fully to develop all his faculties and perfect himself individually and socially. This is the concept of the common good taken from the point of view of a State.\n14.\tHowever, States are not alone, nor are they isolated in the concert of nations. Health, economy, agriculture, science, the arts, in short all man's activities in the contemporary world, are intimately dependent on the activities of other men and other peoples. Thus, Chen, as it does internally where each State seeks the realization of the common good of all its citizens, in the universal society of nations there is also need for a Universal Common Good wliich is the objective and raison d'etre of international authority and of the action of each of the States making up mankind.\n15.\tThat Universal Common Good requires a contribution from all peoples on earth. Our international structures must be adapted to the realization of the Universal Common Good. That adaptation requires that we replace the erroneous and harmful concept of national egotism with the idea of sovereignty and patriotism prompted by solidarity between peoples in the light of the current values in International Social Justice.\n16.\tThus from an international order based on bilateral agreements between Governments we must turn to another where, through  unilateral agreements, it may be possible to have institutions created by peoples.\n17.\tFrom the sphere of national autarchy we must move towards the creation of a supranational society, through successive stages of integration.\n18.\tWe stated last year in this Assembly:\n\\\"The third condition for peace is the establishment of active solidarity which will truly bind the different peoples of the world together. This solidarity will be dynamic only to the extent that it is directed towards the universal common good, and only if it is based on international social justice.\\\" [184ist meeting, para. 128.]\n19.\tIn effect, the Universal Common Good demands and requires active solidarity among nations. Mere coexistence, where perhaps the disintegration of others is expected or perhaps deliberately encouraged in a struggle for world predominance and triumph, is not enough. Far from it, the common good demands that we pass from coexistence to living together, We must turn from a system of relations, whatever they may be-whether of domination or exploitation or use of one State by another-to relations based on profound respect for the dignity of each State, while creating conditions for the liberation of everyone.\n20.\tThe Universal Common Good requires a system of organized co-operation at all levels and in all sectors. In other words, it is necessary to pass from a system of international disintegration, where there is no harmony or over-all goals in the world, to a system of international integration, where we work with responsibility and a full awareness of what we are trying to do,\n21.\tThe contents of the Universal Common Good are to be inspired by International Social Justice, in whose name we have the right to demand burdens and responsibilities that are in keeping with the possibilities, the power, the degree of development or wealth of some peoples in comparison with others.\n22.\tThus we are faced with a logical development. Peace has a new name, and that name is development. International order cannot exist without harmonious, just and balanced development among nations, and this is only possible if it is oriented towards the Universal Common Good.\n23.\tThe achievement of that Universal Common Good, as we have said, calls for the co-operation of all peoples on earth. Th<3 principle of the universality of the United Nations lies, in fact, in that same perspective. We are convinced that our Organization will fulfill more efficiently its lofty purposes to the extent that we can ensure the participation of the largest possible number of countries in the world,\n24.\tWith this conviction, the President of the Republic of Venezuela on 4 March 1971, at his weekly press conference, stated the following:\n\\\"There is no doubt that the United Nations, in order to be more effective must, if possible, obtain the representation of the whole Universe. A country so powerful and highly populated, so important in many respects, as continental China should undoubtedly play a role in the world forum that the United Nations represents. In this connexion, we shall raise no obstacle, and we sincerely hope that some of the problems connected with the entry of that country will be solved. For instance, we maintain diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, whose Government is in Formosa, and that country's representation should not be scorned by us. We sincerely hope that this problem will be considered and analyzed in a truly suitable and satisfactory manner. I believe, moreover, that this question should be settled in a positive manner and in the not-too-distant future.\\\"\n25.\tThese statements by President Caldera will guide the attitude of the Venezuelan delegation in the very difficult debate that will take place on this item-and I say a difficult debate because this problem is highly complex. We must endeavor to reconcile divergences of view through an open and forthright dialog in order to arrive at a formula that will allow for the full participation of continental China without the expulsion of the Republic of China,\n26.\tMr. President, within each State the Common Good presupposes respect for the fundamental rights of the individual. Similarly, the Universal Common Good implies and demands respect for and recognition of the rights and the fundamental personality of different human communities. Moreover, just as each individual, by reason of the very demands of the Common Good, should be the architect of his own destiny, each State must be allowed to carry out its historic mission and to be primarily responsible for its economic and social development.\n27.\tThat Universal Common Good calls for the redistribution among peoples of the wealth that has been unjustly accumulated by a few countries which we have come to call the developed countries. From that need for redistribution flow several conclusions or corollaries.\n28.\tIt is not compatible with the concept of the Universal Common Good to sacrifice some peoples for the sake of one's own development. In time past the world has seen ritualistic cannibalism which was carried out at the individual level: one man was sacrificed. Today, it is fair to speak of social cannibalism, between nations and peoples. Under the cloak of technological development or \\\"economic assistance\\\", human communities and peoples are swallowed up. In fact, in order that some may develop, the very raison d'etre of the developing countries is taken away from them: their lawful right to forge their own destinies.\n29.\tThe introduction of a subtle neocolonialism is incompatible with the idea of the Universal Common Good. Apart from unilateral benefits derived from primary commodities, in the interests of better technological conditions, the use and exclusive development of new resources such as those of the sea and the atom and outer space are sought by some.\n30.\tNor is the system of foreign investments in the developing countries compatible with the Universal Common Good, when such investments are not oriented towards the development of those countries. Foreign investments that are made only for the sake of gain and one's own benefit are not in keeping with the concept of the Universal Common Good; quite to the contrary, they are a denial of that Common Good since they stem only from egotistical interests that have no social function.\n31.\tIn a recent document a very important religious figure in the contemporary world stated:\n\\\"Under the impulse of new production systems, national frontiers are coming down and we see new economic powers emerging multinational enterprises which, because of the concentration and flexibility of their means, can carry out autonomous strategies to a very large degree independently of national political powers and, consequently, without control from the point of view of the common good. By extending their activities these private organizations may lead to a new abusive form of economic domination in the social, cultural and even political fields.\\\"\n32.\tNeither can we reconcile with the Universal Common Good the struggle for predominance by blocs, their arms race and the expenditures involved in maintaining the balance of power. Those sizable investments are in essence the clearest demonstration of how international relations take precedence over the Universal Common Good.\n33.\tIn the name of the Universal Common Good we must question the pattern of development of today's industrialized nations. That pattern has led to the division of peoples on earth between the haves-an exclusive closed club-and the have-nots. But this is not in keeping with the concept of the Universal Common Good. To continue on that line is to march towards suicide because that would increase the differences among nations and peoples. This cannot be the fate which history has reserved for mankind.\n34.\tThe Universal Common Good presupposes, moreover, a system of international distribution of production. In other words, it is necessary for all countries members of the community of nations to become part of a real and effective universal economic system encompassing all stages of economic activity. This necessarily implies the formulation of a global integral policy of world economy oriented towards the development of mankind-the Universal Common Good-and not towards the development of a small, group of privileged countries.\n35.\tIn this connexion we must also point out that the Universal Common Good calls imperatively for the establishment of an international monetary system. But such a system cannot be effective without the genuine cooperation of all the countries concerned.\n36.\tWe note with fear that the so-called Group of Ten seeks to assume and maintain the privilege of being the only ones in charge of the operation, alteration and reform of the monetary system. Once again, the developing countries have not been allowed a say in the decisions which so seriously affect them.\n37.\tIn international forums the risks involved in the monetary system have been pointed out consistently but the absurd struggle to maintain an untenable national prestige prevented the adoption of realistic decisions with the participation of all nations.\n38.\tMeasures adopted unilaterally, and contrary to the Universal Common Good, today seriously endanger the less developed countries.\n39.\tIn this great forum, it is fitting for Venezuela to reiterate an earnest appeal to the conscience of the developed countries made a few days ago in international meetings held in Geneva and Panama.\n40.\tIt is incompatible with the ideal of a Universal Common Good for a State to seek to set itself up as the sole possessor of truth and the monopolizer of the meaning of history, and it is even more incompatible when that State tries to Impose Its brand (if the truth with violence, People must be persuaded to accept the truth, not forced to accept It. No nation -unless it is willing to be held in contempt by others with regard Itself m the sob possessor of truth. Truth is to be found hi 'he authenticity, hi the nobility of peoples and Individuals.\n41 The political State is not in itself an absolute, Its general mission Is that of being the nucleus and driving tee behind the development and the progress of communities and the human Institutions it encompasses, If due to the moral corruption of power a State assumes the iniquitous right of dealing on the destinies of other peoples as its political oligarchy sees lit, that State violates the Universal Common Good, There exist peoples that are prisoners of their Governments, In such eases their moral right to determine their own destinies Is usurped by their Governments,\n42* The Universal Common Good must not be only a set of material profits and benefits, It Is also and fundamentally a multidimensional balance between the human person, societies and nations, and other human communities and nature in general, That Universal Common Good is and must be material, Intellectual and moral to allow the development of the material, intellectual and moral potential of all peoples, All this presupposes a keen awareness of those realities on the part of the developing countries,\n43* It is quite obvious that participation in the international community cannot be based on the selfish and negative idea of benefiting from political or ideological domination or economic exploitation of other peoples.\n44.\tAnd yet such a state of affairs cannot be removed unless the developing countries are able to set aside their partisan national egotism and unite in order to deal with an unjust international order,\n45.\tPerhaps members think this is Utopian. This same question was asked last year from this very rostrum, Is it, however, not more illusory to continue along the path on which we are embarked at present? Is it, perchance, the way to the development of peoples and peace among nations?\n46.\tIn making these final remarks I cannot fail to invoke the figure of our Secretary-General, UThant. For many years, in the performance of his functions, U Thant has devoted himself to the defense of the great moral principles that should guide relations among peoples. He, too, believes that only by pursuing great ideals will it be possible for mankind to realize its aspirations for peace and justice.\n47.\tHistory teaches us that only human actions inspired by ethical principles have lasting value. We must therefore defend them in the international arena with the persuasive power of truth if we are to free ourselves from the coercive power of violence.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "108.\t The current, twenty -sixth session of the General Assembly launches the second quarter of a century in the existence of the United Nations. With last year's commemorative session of the General Assembly, the first quarter of a century of this international Organization came to a close. Much has changed in this world of ours between the founding of the United Nations and its twenty-fifth anniversary, but so has the Organization itself.\n109.\tHere in the General Assembly hall, much of that change is reflected in the fact that we are already short of room to accommodate all the representatives of Member States. In other words, the architects of this building had not foreseen that, in a historically short period of 25 years, the United Nations would have more than 130, instead of only 51, Member States. That goes to show that neither the architects nor some founding Members of the United Nations could have imagined that the long-standing forms of the colonial system would disintegrate within such a short period of time.\n110.\tIt would seem reasonable to pose the question here and now. What changes can the world, and thus the United Nations itself, expect? Will our children and our children's children celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations?\n111.\tThe victorious Powers of the First World War brought into being the League of Nations, but the League did not live to celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary. The Second World War broke out before the League could celebrate that anniversary. Although it had some useful achievements to its credit, the League of Nations was more than once instrumental in preparing the ground for armed conflicts. What is more, the League played a part in the outbreak of the Second World War, primarily by refusing to adopt proposals for peaceful coexistence, disarmament and the prevention of war.\n112.\tThe successor to the League of Nations, the United Nations, was brought into being after the Second World\nWar, again by the victorious Powers. Already the United Nations has gone through many a crisis. The United Nations has also been made an instrument of armed conflicts, even of threats of world-wide war. Sometimes it was also the instrument of cold war activities. In Korea, for instance, the conflicting sides are still today negotiating under the United Nations flag. In bygone years many have warned in this hall that the United Nations might meet the same fate as the League of Nations. So far, the United Nations has overcome all these crises. This can be ascribed to certain specific reasons.\n113.\tFirstly, the Charter is superior to the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Charter was drawn up by countries having different social systems but a common aim: to help all peoples for the sake of peace. That is why it was expressly stated that the goal was to free all peoples from foreign and colonial domination. It was even enacted that war as a means of resolving international disputes must be banned once and for all through disarmament.\n114.\tSecondly, the composition of the United Nations has undergone far-reaching changes. During the lifetime of the Organization, the new social system, that of socialism, emerged in several countries. This, in turn, has changed the international balance of power. The countries freed from the colonial yoke have made a vital contribution to this modification of tne balance of power. Their presence in the United Nations has effectively contributed to eliminating cold war subjects from discussion and to focusing attention on the fundamental problems in the life of the peoples.\n115.\tNow there can be a new perspective for the United Nations and it may be opened up this year. So far, one quarter of humanity-a country 800 million strong-has been debarred from the activities of the Organization, a country which is a founding Member of the United Nations. The time is growing ripe to restore the rights of the People's Republic of China in this Organization. This is not a question, as some would have us believe, of ousting a country from this Organization but of restoring to a founding Member of the United Nations its fundamental rights. Those who hitherto opposed the seating of the rightful representatives of the People's Republic of China did harm to this Organization, to international relations in general, to the People's Republic of China and, last but not least, to themselves. It is gratifying to note that here at the General Assembly the number of members in favor of restoring to the People's Republic of China its full rights in the activities of the United Nations is increasing. These rights must be restored. There is only one China. Should the General Assembly decide to invite the representatives of the People's Republic of China, this decision should exclude the presence of a second Chinese delegation. Taiwan and mainland China have to settle their disputes between themselves. Clearly Taiwan also professes the \\\"one China\\\" principle.\n116.\tThe fact that a solution of the question of the representation of People's China seems to be imminent is one of the factors that has decisively improved the atmosphere of political discussions at this session of the General Assembly.\n117.\tPeoples and Governments had pinned their hopes on the commemorative twenty-fifth session, when it seemed likely that Heads of State or Government throughout the world would meet here in honor of the anniversary last year. But this came to nought because of a gust of the cold war. As could be expected, those who were the target of criticism on this account were hardly gratified.\n118.\tUnlike last year's anniversary session of the General Assembly, the present session began in an extremely positive atmosphere, indicative of the many positive changes in international relations that have occurred since last year. I have touched on one of the causes of the change: the door is about to open to the People's Republic of China.\n119.\tA much more essential cause is, however, an improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. In the eyes of all democratic forces and humanitarian people, the pivot of international life is the desire to escape the threat of a thermonuclear war. This depends principally-at least under the circumstances of the present balance of power-on relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. The most important piece of international good news concerns the agreement reached between the Soviet Union and the United States on measures to reduce the risk of nuclear war and the agreement on improving the direct communications link between them, both signed at Washington on 30 September 1971.\n120.\tPart and parcel of improving the international atmosphere is the penetrating, realistic attitude being taken at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). Furthermore, a draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction [A/8457-DC/ 234, annex A] has already been submitted to the General Assembly.\n121.\tHumanity can be saved from a new world war, and the hazards of thermonuclear war can be eliminated, only by a gradual approach to general and complete disarmament.\n122.\tThe partial agreements already concluded or still under discussion all serve this historic purpose. No one must be naive as far as these high aims are concerned. In this connexion I refer to the Soviet proposal for a meeting of the five nuclear Powers [A/8328] and a world disarmament conference [A/L.631J. The purpose of those proposals is to keep the questions of the ban on the armaments race and the realization of general and complete disarmament on the agenda of our everyday life. Humanity is capable of bringing disaster on itself, even without thermo-nuclear war, merely by maintaining and stepping up the present arms race.\n123.\tIn addition to improved Soviet-United States relations as part of the positive turn in all-round international relations, recent events in Europe have fundamentally affected the international atmosphere and thus the atmosphere at the present session of the General Assembly.\n124.\tThe enormous progress made by the German Democratic Republic has vitally contributed to those far-reaching changes in the European situation. There is also an East\nGerman miracle; which has prompted the present West German government to take a policy which is more realistic than ever before. This more realistic policy matured in the conclusion of agreements between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany,  and between the four Powers on West Berlin.  Those agreements are the most important milestones in East-West relations in the post-war years since the Austrian State Treaty. At this point none of them has yet been ratified. Before ratification can take place much circumspect work in many fields still has to be completed.\n125.\tThe point has been made that before further steps can be initiated to prepare the conference on European security all three agreements have first to be ratified and implemented. The Hungarian Government, in unison with the other States parties to the Warsaw Treaty, has repeatedly made clear the following point: in international relations it is unwise to make the solution of one question subject to the solution of another, however closely and logically those questions may be related. It has become increasingly evident in recent months, however, that some countries-without which the holding of a European conference on security and co-operation would be unthinkable- wished to make the next logical steps for preparing a European conference on security and co-operation dependent on the entering into force of the agreements relating to the two German States and West Berlin. But we have to be realistic in this matter. The spokesmen of this approach ignore two essential factors. The first is that the treaty settlement of questions fundamental to the future of Europe has been made possible by the more positive, all-round atmosphere created as a result of extensive bilateral or multilateral discussions, chiefly in the last two years, on a European security conference. The second is that it is precisely those who earlier had made the holding of the conference conditional on careful preparation- pending the coming into force of the German agreement  who have now put a full stop to any preparation.\n126.\tAlthough we are ready to sit down at the conference table, even tomorrow if necessary, we are obliged to accept this political situation. All we ask is, let us not sit back with folded arms and wait. In other words, until the time is ripe for all-round, multilateral talks, let us continue, within the framework of bilateral discussions, to clarify our views on how the conference, or rather the series of conferences, should be organized, what items should be included on their agenda, what documents should be drafted, and what the permanent organ of the conference or of a European security system should be.\n127.\tEfforts in this direction would expedite the entry into force of the agreements on the German question just as, in the same way, earlier talks on the European security conference paved the way for the successful conclusion of those agreements.\n128.\tThe issue of European security is connected with the peace of the whole world. In the same way, the ideal of universal peace and security as expressed in the Soviet proposal submitted to the General Assembly is also connected with European security. The Hungarian delegation is ready to co-operate in the preparation of international projects relating to those proposals.\n129.\tA turn for the better can be observed not only in questions in which actual progress has been made, but also when very little or no progress could be registered towards a practical solution.\n130.\tSuch questions are as follows: first, the aggression against Viet-Nam. The war in Viet\u00b0Nam is still going on. From time to time it has flared up and more recently it has spread to even larger areas than before. But respect for the Viet-Namese people deluding recognition of their right, has never been higher than in these days, not only in other parts of the world, but also here in the United States of America.\n131.\tGiven these circumstances I should like to draw attention to the following. At the time when the escalation of war in Viet-Nam was growing in proportion-I mean in 1965 the Hungarian People's Republic was among the first to declare here in the General Assembly that the way to the negotiating table could be cleared only by putting an end to the bombing raids on the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam [135Cth meeting, para. 21]. This has since been proved true. Now we say with the same certainty and with the same sincerity that nothing but a coalition government, which can be established only by the joining together of all South Viet-Namese forces, will be able to put a stop to the fighting in South Viet-Nam and even in Laos and Cambodia.\n132.\tIn the past, some nurtured the illusion that it might be possible, through the influence of one or other socialist country, to induce the Viet-Namese leaders to continue negotiating with their opponents by acquiescing in the loss, or at least the curtailment, of the independence of their people. That illusion has grown dimmer. But now it cannot be ruled out that some think such a goal may be attained through the influence of the People's Republic of China. Those who put their faith in such a view will be disappointed. The efforts of the People's Republic of China to normalize its international relations are inconsistent with the continued toleration >f aggression against the Viet-Namese people.\n133.\tThe devotion of the Viet-Namese people to independence and to their right of self-determination can be broken by no overt or covert attack whatsoever, even by one launched with the catchword \\\"Viet-Namization\\\". Peace in South-East Asia can be achieved only by direct negotiation with the genuine representatives of the peoples cf that area.\n134.\tThe second question concerns Korea. On this question also there is some improvement. Those who earlier exploited this question for cold-war purposes have not pressed the point at the present session. The current talks between the two Red Cross societies in Korea also herald some good news. It could be of help here, in the United Nations, if the United Nations flag were removed from the negotiating table in Panmunjom, and if the members of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification 12\nand Rehabilitation of Korea were to hand in their resignations.\n135.\tThe third question relates to the Middle East. There is still no approach being made towards a practical solution of this question; nevertheless, some improvement can be registered here too. The peoples of the world understand the justice of the Arab cause better today than in 1967.In the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), taking into account the views so far stated by all parties concerned, the following might be considered.\n136.\tFirst, with a view to opening the Suez Canal, an arrangement should be worked out which contains an expression on the part of Israel of its willingness to withdraw its troops from the occupied Arab territories. Secondly, as the President of the United Arab Republic has recently proposed, the United Nations or other peacekeeping forces should provisionally take over from the Israeli occupiers the administration of the area east of the Suez Canal. Thirdly, the administration of all the other occupied territories should be similarly taken over by the same forces pending the settlement of all questions involved in this problem.\n137.\tWe can thus see a number of indications during the current session that international relations are improving. But we know also that the process of improvement comes up against many difficulties and that a number of political elements are taking pains to stop and reverse that process. However, as the general debate in the General Assembly at this session has been characterized by good hopes rather than by recriminations, I do not now wish to specify those difficulties and negative factors.\n138.\tThe foreign policy of the Hungarian People's Republic is guided by the following principles.\n139.\tFirst, as in our domestic policy we wish to work for the fundamental good of the people, so in our foreign policy we are out to ensure more favorable international conditions of existence for the people.\n140.\tSecond, since the future of our people, and of all peoples, is fundamentally dependent on the possibility of preventing a thermonuclear war, we join in all major schemes of international co-operation aimed at warding off the dahger of thermonuclear war.\n141.\tThird, local conflicts also can lead to great wars; therefore we support any movement aimed at eliminating aggression.\n142.\tFourth, in accordance with the principles of the Warsaw Treaty and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, we work towards over-all international cooperation. We are ready to take part in any discussion-for example, in the shaping of a European security system- which could make military alliances superfluous. But as long as the representatives of NATO are not ready to do the same, we continue to strengthen our defensive military organization. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is an institution that does not cut itself off from countries outside the organization. We are in favor of greater integration movements, but we are against discrimination.\n143.\tFifth, close relations within the socialist countries, and first of all with the Soviet Union, arc our aim and purpose. We seek to develop our ties with the other socialist countries as well. We wish to expand our contacts with the People's Republic of China and with all other socialist countries, including Albania.\n144.\tSixth, we are making every effort to develop our relations with the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n145.\tSeventh, on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence we intensify our connexions with the countries of Western Europe and with the American continent. Recently we succeeded in settling a number of questions hampering Hungarian-United States relations. Consequently, new avenues can be opened up in the development of our relations. The improvement of relations between the two German States holds out new prospects for Hungarian- West German relations as well.\n146.\tThe present session of the General Assembly is characterized, m comparison with previous sessions, by a very large number of bilateral talks between heads of delegations. Of course, the United Nations provides the most valuable regular meeting-place for representatives of peoples living in different parts of the world, and those contacts can contribute in this way to dispelling international mistrust and strengthening mutual understanding.\n147.\tI have already had opportunity, on the occasion of a personal meeting, to offer to you, Mr. President, my felicitations and the congratulations of the Hungarian delegation. It is the wish of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic that the United Nations may set out safely, under your presidency, on the path of the second quarter-century of its existence in the service of a peaceful and happy future for mankind.\n148.\tIn conclusion, I should like to say a few very warm and grateful words about our Secretary-General, U Thant. He has been serving as Secretary-General of the United Nations for 10 years now. I wish to lay stress on the word \\\"serving\\\": he really is the servant of the future of mankind. Earlier he had acted as Permanent Representative of Burma, as one of us who were often together in this building. All, without exception, pay tribute to the selfless devotion with which he has dedicated himself to service for a happier future for mankind. Now, for many reasons-some of which may be readily understood-he wishes to retire, but for the sake of the future of the United Nations-partly so that the Organization might avoid the fate of the League of Nations-it would be advisable for Member States to ask our Secretary-General, U Thant, to continue in office temporarily, for at least one or two years, until some consensus is reached regarding a new candidate for the office of Secretary-General. That is what 1 wish the United Nations, for the sake of its future and of the future world situation, and that is what I ask of our Secretary-General, U Thant.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\tMr. President, allow me to extend to you my warm and sincere congratulations on your election to the high office of President of our Assembly. The delegation of Yugoslavia sees in your election a tribute not only to a personality whose statesmanlike qualities we have often had occasion to admire, but also to the representative of a friendly and non-aligned Indonesia, a man who will know how to bring into our work the philosophy of life and age-long experiences of great Asian civilizations and happily merge them with the contemporary trends of the present political moment.\n2.\tAt the same time, I should like to express our feelings of respect and appreciation to Mr. Edvard Hambro, who so competently presided over the twenty-fifth anniversary session of our Organization.\n3.\tMy Government highly esteems the untiring activity of our Secretary-General, U Thant, who, in the past decade, has discharged his responsible duties with his own characteristic wisdom and dedication to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, constantly drawing attention to the numerous difficulties, but even more to the vast possibilities, of the world Organization, while expressing confidence in its future.\n4.\tI wish to avail myself of this opportunity to say how happy we are to welcome the admission of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar to the United Nations.\n5.\tIt seems that a new period of significant changes and turnabouts in the world has begun. Perhaps this is precisely the right moment to take a look at some of the most important events of the period we have just passed.\n6.\tConflicts and crises no longer remain isolated. So-called local disturbances have world-wide repercussions and bring the world to the brink of wider conflicts.\n7.\tWars and outside interventions do not promise easy gains to the promoters of the policy of conquest, imperialism and hegemony. Even when such a policy seems successful, reverse effects also manifest themselves.\n8.\tWars, interventions and foreign interference only strengthen the will of peoples to fight for independence, sovereignty and independent international development.\n9.\tNo genuine people's movement had been broken by force. The fate of the world does not depend on violence alone, but on resistance to violence as well.\n10.\tDiffering social systems have not been the basic causes of conflicts and crises. Quite often conflicts have not bypassed States with the same social systems.\n11.\tIt has been confirmed that universal coexistence is, irreplaceable. Bloc approaches to international problems are in a state of crisis. The movement of non-alignment is asserting itself as a significant factor in international relations, a factor which cannot be ignored.\n12.\tThe world is not willing to reconcile itself to the division into rich and poor, although it has not been able to overcome nor even alleviate this division so far.\n13.\tThe young are emerging on the international scene in a greater measure than in the past, both in their respective countries and at the level of concerted international action. Even in those instances where the young fail to apply the most appropriate forms of struggle, the essential value of their aims and ideas cannot be denied.\n14.\tThe extent to which we shall succeed in our efforts to change the conditions prevailing in the world will largely depend on the extent to which we grasp the difference between what is inevitable and what is likely to disappear. All this has always been important but never more than today when interdependence is a general rule and when the interrelationship of economic, political and moral values is reaffirmed, independently of State boundaries and socio-political systems.\n15.\tDuring the preceding 25 sessions and especially at the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly, we adopt many decisions of the greatest significance. The results fall far short of the objectives set. Nevertheless, they represent some progress in comparison with the starting- point. Which of the decisions and declarations constitute a success and which of them a failure will be determined by the answer to the question: What has changed for the better and what has remained unchanged on the restless inter-national scene? My Government therefore strongly believes that this Organization should become more effective not\nonly in formulating decisions but also in ensuring that decisions become a reality.\n16.\tThe positive changes which were perhaps more numerous last year than previously have not yet extricated the world from a state in which, true, there is no direct threat of a general war but in which genuine peace is not guaranteed either.\n17.\tAmong the positive developments in the present phase of changes we should mention the establishment of contacts between those who have not had them-to their own detriment and surely to that of the international community. My country ranks among those which maintain contacts and co-operate with a large number of countries on all continents, and is thus able to appreciate readiness and ability for dialog between friends and also perhaps even more between those whose views and interests are different or even conflicting. In this world of contradictions but also of growing interdependence, peaceful contacts and talks mean something more. Even when they do not bring about rapid solutions, they generate an atmosphere which promotes agreement and discourages conflicts. Without harboring illusions as to the possibility of rapid favorable changes, we believe in the possibility of substantive progress.\n18.\tWhen I spoke of new developments in international relations I also had in mind the ever-more-strongly expressed desire of the international community to have the People's Republic of China finally occupy the place which in reality belongs to it in our Organization. It is not only a matter of correcting the injustices of yesteryear, but of a more profound process of revising dogmas and norms inherited from the past. It seems that at last a sense of reality is proving to be stronger than prejudice.\n19.\tIt follows that the question of the representation of China must be definitely removed from our agenda. There are not two Chinas-only the Government of the People's Republic of China has the right to be the legitimate representative of the Chinese people in the United Nations.\n20.\tAllow me now to recall the problems of development in the first place, without underestimating thereby any field of activity which is of interest for the further progress of the international community. It is obvious, in that field, that we have taken only initial steps and that we have not reached a decisive level of readiness to change the unfavorable situation. There is a justified fear that the consequences of the chronic crisis of the international economic, trade and, now, even monetary systems will affect the position of precisely the developing countries most adversely. That merely increases the difficulties they will have to face. The monopolies of closed economic groupings and their most powerful protagonists are also contributing to this negative balance.\n21.\tAll those circumstances make it imperative to establish new bases for the trade and monetary systems, promoting a closer integration between the economies of the developed and. the developing countries. For this reason, it is more than justified to demand that the latest protectionist measures should not be applied to the developing countries, Monopoly, discrimination and protectionism at the expense of others not only impede general progress but also widen the material base for conflicts and crises in the field of political relations.\n22.\tWe expect the developed countries to show greater understanding for the solution of this problem. On the solution of the problems of the developing countries depend not only stability in international economic relations but also the perspective of peace and security in the world in general and, by the same token, the long-term interests of the developed countries themselves. In this context, the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], to be held at Santiago in April 1972, is of particular significance. For this reason, we attach great importance to the forthcoming Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 developing countries to be held at Lima later this month, which should contribute much to the preparations for the third session of UNCTAD and consolidate the unity of action of the developing countries.\n23.\tThe international community is faced with a new situation of conflict on the Indian subcontinent. The refugee problem, which has assumed vast proportions in Asia as a result of the mass exodus of refugees from East Pakistan to India, cannot be isolated from the whole complex of economic and political problems. The internal nal community should not remain indifferent to this situation, nor can its involvement be limited to merely providing the material assistance necessary to alleviate the untold suffering of millions of innocent people. It is essential to create political conditions making it possible to remove the causes, without relaxing our efforts to cure the effects at the same time, so that refugees can soon return to their homeland. Unless this is done soon, the existing situation may lead to even more tragic consequences.\n24.\tWe have long since accepted the axiom that peace and security are irreplaceable premises for any normal progress. We have also recognized the truth that, without an effective system of over-all security no one, by himself, is safe. Although there is less likelihood, today, of a world conflict, the possibility of threats to the security, independence and sovereignty of small and non-aligned countries, in particular, far from having been reduced may even have increased. The United Nations has adopted the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], embodying a precise program of action, but it has done very little to establish a system of collective security. Dependence on military alliances and bloc formations lias not proved to be a reliable factor of security, sometimes even for countries belonging to such alliances. We should strive towards greater solidarity with, and greater assistance to, countries which are threatened with, or are the victims of, aggression. At the present session we should take one step forward in implementing the basic provisions of this Declaration.\n25.\tIt goes without saying that the end of the arms race governs any action to reduce the threat to peace. While welcoming the draft convention on the prohibition of biological weapons,  we urge, at the sams time, the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons, the total prohibition of underground nuclear tests and the adoption of other measures of a partial character. The most recent initiative of the USSR for convening a world disarmament conference [see A/8491] which had already been proposed by the non-aligned countries first at the Conference in Cairo  and then at the Lusaka Conference  gives specific form to the repeated demand of many countries who feel that all nations should take part in solving the question of disarmament.\n26.\tIt is difficult to speak of disarmament while weapons talk. The war' in Indo-China has caused great suffering to the peoples of that region, but it does illustrate the paramount truth that the struggle for independence and freedom cannot be defeated. We are deeply convinced that the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam, set forth in seven points, provide a framework within which it is possible to find an acceptable solution and that, before anything else, the United States should fix a time-limit for the earliest possible withdrawal of its troops from Viet-Nam.\n27.\tThere is a certain feeling of weariness and absence of initiative in the search for a solution in the Middle East crisis. I wish to reiterate the conviction of my Government that in the Middle East no solution has any future unless its point of departure is the radical canceling of the results of aggression.\n28.\tThe fallacious truce which Israel is using for purposes of annexation is too dangerous to be able to last any longer. The total withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories as well as the realization of the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine constitute the sine qua non for the solution of the crisis. Ambassador Jarring has done a great deal to assist in finding a solution and has submitted proposals which all-with the exception of Israel, unfortunately-have approved and judged acceptable and just.\n29.\tThe last strongholds of colonialism, neo-colonialism and racial discrimination, particularly in Africa, of course, constitute a great danger for the independent African peoples and for peace in the world. Southern Rhodesia, the Portuguese colonies, Namibia and South Africa are glaring examples of attempts to preserve relations of inequality and subordination. The resistance to the implementation of the decisions of the United Nations by those who are in the best position to contribute to the elimination of the residuum of colonialism is the major cause of the deterioration .of the situation in southern Africa. Therefore the world Organization should-among other things increase its assistance to the movements of national independence.\n30.\tProgress in Europe became possible once the conviction prevailed that European realities cannot be changed by the use of force and that contacts and expanded co-operation can bring benefits to all.\n31.\tIt seems to us that the prospects for the convening of a conference on European security are more favorable because some of the most delicate issues, such as the German and Berlin questions, a way out of the deadlock is emerging. Progress on the Berlin question is important in itself. It is, however, even more important as proof that the most sensitive issues can be settled by patient negotiations and mutual understanding. Fortunately, the dilemma \\\"for\\\" or \\\"against\\\" a European conference no longer exists; it is now only a question of how to ensure its success. This is how we view the role the United Nations can have, as an organization for, and interpreter of, the universally recognized principles of the Charter, in contrast to theories and practices advocating special or distinct norms in international relations. We even more persistently maintain the point of view that not only the central but also the southern part of Europe-particularly the Balkans which, together with the Mediterranean, form a compact geographical and political region should become an area where peaceful relations and co-operation inspired by the spirit of good-neighborliness are governed by the same norms.\n32.\tIt is evident that no real progress can be achieved unless we find a way out of the existing crises and conflicts and unless we are able to accelerate-all of us to an equal degree and all of us together the solution to the long-term problems of security, disarmament and development.\n33.\tThe policy of non-alignment has never been an end in itself. Since the Belgrade Conference,  the tenth anniversary of which is this year, non-alignment has always sought, as a reflection of progressive aspirations, actively to meet the vital needs of mankind. The significance of the Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries seems to be greater today than at the time when it was held. The recent consultations among non-aligned countries have confirmed their agreement on the necessity to ensure the continuity of their efforts, both in the United Nations and on a broader international plane, in the struggle for peace, universal security and general progress in the world.\n34.\tIt has been demonstrated that non-alignment, far from being removed from reality, is an expression of reality . The non-aligned are not powerful enough to prevent brutal blows inflicted by force, but they are sufficiently strong not to bear them passively.\n35.\tYugoslavia, like the other non-aligned countries, highly appreciates the contribution of the United Nations to world peace, to co-operation and to development, even though the results through no fault of our Organization- have not always been satisfactory or complete.\n36.\tOur persistent emphasis of the inviolability of the principles of freedom, sovereignty and non-interference in the affairs of others, etc., may appear monotonous. However, this repetition of these principles is only a consequence of their repeated violation throughout the\n4 First Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, held at Belgrade from 1 to 6 September 1961.\nworld and in reality. We defend these principles because they defend the world to which we belong.\n37.\tWe fully appreciate that we are not entitled to expect more from this Organization than we contribute to it. It is precisely for this reason that we declare our readiness to make our utmost contribution to the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "80.\t Mr. President, at the outset of my statement I want to extend to you the warmest congratulations of my delegation upon your election as President of the General Assembly. The complete confidence which the General Assembly has placed in you provides a happy augury for success in your extremely important task. Your predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro of Norway, has indeed set a high standard in his tenure of this office, for which he deserves great credit. We pledge our support to you, Mr. President, as you uphold that high standard.\n81.\tI would also like to pay a tribute to our distinguished Secretary-General, U Thant, whose departure is imminent. The world community is greatly indebted to him, and his contribution to mankind-will be kept in the records of human hist~.y. Also in his case a tremendous void has to be filled, and it is our fervent hope that the United Nations will be fortunate enough to show the same kind of\noverwhelming support for the election of the new Secretary-General as was shown in your election, Mr. President. Various worthy candidates have been mentioned during the last few weeks for the post of Secretary- General. We must find and elect another able man dedicated to the tradition of strong and independent , leadership, a man who can help to make this Organization into a more effective instrument for peace, justice and progress.\n82.\tMy Government believes that Ambassador Max Jakobson of Finland would be eminently qualified for the post of Secretary-General, and it reiterates its support for his candidacy.\n83.\tOn behalf of my delegation, I want to use this opportunity to extend our congratulations to the thee new Members of the United Nations. Iceland has now been a Member of the United Nations for a period of 25 years, and we cherish that membership as we know these three new Member States will also do.\n84. Like all nations, not least the small ones, the people of Iceland have from the beginning placed high hopes and expectations in the United Nations. It has to be admitted that our expectations have not altogether been realized. My delegation therefore looks favorably on various suggestions put forward for organizational improvements in the work of the United Nations, aiming at increased authority and executive power.\n85.\tSince the adoption of the Charter of t .e United Nations over a quarter of a century ago, the world has undergone some fundamental changes and important experience has been gained in the application of the Charter in promoting international peace and security. We should draw on this experience in an attempt to make our Organization more effective in meeting its responsibilities. In this re-evaluation of our purposes it may be necessary to amend the Charter, just as individual States find it necessary from time to time to change constitutions and laws in conformity with changed requirements.\n86.\tMy Government will support all attempts aiming at the relaxation of tension in the world and the strengthening of peace and reconciliation between nations. We shall contribute to the recognition of the legitimate aspirations of all nations to freedom and the right to self-determination and to representation in the United Nations.\n87.\tTrue to its policy of equal rights for all nations, my Government will at this session of the General Assembly support the membership of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. In the opinion of my Government it is not conducive to world peace, besides being an injustice, to deny a nation of over 700 million people representation in this Organization. We are therefore strongly in favor of ' the principle that the Peace's Republic of China should be admitted to membership in the United Nations with all the rights and obligations involved.\n88.\tWe have profound sympathy for the struggle of the poorer nations of the world for equality and economic self-sufficiency, and feel that it is the responsibility of the international community to make renewed efforts to help\nthem to attain those goals in the shortest possible time. The economic and human inequalities between nations and within nations is a constant source of national and international conflicts which must be eliminated in order to attain a just and durable peace,\n89.\tThe Icelandic people continue to look to the United Nations as the best hope of mankind for international peace and justice. We consider this Organization a guarantor of our own national independence and we seek its support in safeguarding our economic viability. When we survey the record of achievements, however, we are bound to admit that much remains to be done and many disappointments are only too evident. Our distinguished Secretary-General, in the introduction to his report to this session on the work of the Organization [A/8401/Add. 1], has eloquently stated his views on the subject.\n90.\tI am not going to deal with the whole range of issues, but I should like to mention a few positive signs of achievements as my Government sees them.\n91.\tAs we look at recent developments in international affairs there is reason to welcome in particular the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, signed at Berlin on 3 September. That agreement raises real hope for improved relations in Europe. Negotiations have started between the two German States on the implementation of that agreement and on their bilateral relations in general. With perseverance and the goodwill of both parties it can reasonably be expected that they will resolve their differences, paving the way for a new era in East-West relations and assuring them their rightful place in international organizations. For the first time since the end of the Second World War the German problem appears on the verge of solution. Assuming that an accommodation can be reached between the two German States, we can look forward to the convening of a conference on European security, which my Government hopes could remove one of the last vestiges of the Second World War-the German problem which, for far too long, has remained one of the principal sources of tension in Europe and in the world.\n92.\tIn spite of prolonged and determined work by this Organization in attempting to promote peace, the world is constantly living in the shadow of war. Suspicion and mistrust, fed by social, cultural and economic inequalities, are a continuous source of friction. With rapid technological progress the consequences of war assume frightening proportions. We can therefore look with some satisfaction at the progress which has been made in Geneva in the field of disarmament. It is true that disarmament does not cure the basic, underlying causes of war, but it is hoped that it will give added time for finding solutions to them.\n93.\tEven more significant and encouraging is the progress registered in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the Soviet Union and the United States. We can only hope that those talks will result in an agreement putting a halt to the race in the production and perfection of nuclear weapons. An agreement, even on a limited scale to begin with, could contribute in no small measure to mutual trust and understanding and the lessening of tension the world in general. \n94.\tIt is appropriate in this context to mention the speedy implementation of the resolution on assistance in cases of natural disaster adopted at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2717 (XXV)]. Tills is indeed a most timely and necessary action which will help to alleviate the consequences of major disasters wherever they may take place, But we should continue, as has been suggested, and establish as soon as possible an office for assistance in cases of unnatural disasters. The experience in Pakistan has grimly emphasis the need for such an organization.\n95.\tWe should also like to commend highly the excellent work done by the United Nations technical organizations, such as the United Nations Development program and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Only by strengthening the activities of the United Nations in this field will we be able to narrow the widening gap between the rich nations and the needy nations.\n96.\tIt is a much-too-frequent practice in many quarters to criticize the United Nations for failing to maintain law and order in the international community. Some go so far as to blame the United Nations for most if not all of the things that bother a troubled world. Those who are more reasonable realize that what hampers the United Nations is insufficient powers to deal with major problems of war and peace and a lack of will by some Member States to back up the United Nations. In any case, it is extremely important that public opinion should be aware of the fact that, although armed conflicts rage beyond the reach of the United Nations, extremely useful and constructive work in the interest of peace and lawful co-operation is constantly being carried out by the United Nations and under its auspices. And it is only fair that attention should be drawn to those positive assets in the balance-sheet.\n97.\tI should like to dwell briefly on one such matter today a matter which for centuries has had in it the seeds of struggle, conflict and even war, but which is now, with patience and hard work, being dealt with in the spirit of international co-operation for the benefit of mankind. I am referring here to the valuable efforts to prepare the third United Nations conference on the law of the sea, which is scheduled for 1973. At present the representatives of 86 States are engaged in this preparatory work; but since the problems involved are of great and even vital interest to all the Members of the United Nations, they are an appropriate subject in this general debate. They will of course also attract the attention of the First Committee when the report on the preparatory work done this year is dealt with there in due course.\n98.\tThe preparatory work for the third conference on the law of the sea has in effect been going on for more than 20 years. The General Assembly in 1949 instructed the International Law Commission to deal with the law of the sea in its entirety [resolution 374 (IV)], and the First and Second United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea, held at Geneva in 1958 and 1960 respectively, used the work of the International Law Commission as a basis for their efforts. A large number of the problems were successfully dealt with in that way, but the fundamental questions of the text of the territorial sea and fishery limits were not solved. Those two questions, together with other fundamental issues-such as the international sea-bed area, pollution, archipelagos, fishing on the high seas and problems of the land-locked States-still remain unsolved and are now being studied in preparation for the third conference. It is of course clear that the solution of these remaining problems would greatly contribute to peace and stability instead of the present dangerous conflicts and uncertainty.\n99.\tThe Government of Iceland welcomes this opportunity to thank the Committee preparing the Conference for its valuable efforts during the meetings of the Committee in March and again in July and August of this year. Progress has seemed lather slow in the initial stages, but it is hoped that next year further accomplishments will be facilitated by the extremely valuable groundwork already done, although many complicated problems are involved. I am not going to discuss further the work of that Committee here; but since, as I said, the issues involved are also important to a large number of States which are represented in this Assembly but not on the Committee, I should like to make a few additional remarks concerning the views of my Government in this field. -\n100.\tWe fully support the endeavors to establish an appropriate regime for the international sea-bed area and will do our utmost to contribute to the accomplishment of the task outlined by the adoption of the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction by the General Assembly last year [resolution 2749 (XXV)]. The wealth of material already available in this field is being studied by the appropriate authorities in my country with the utmost attention. The same applies to the questions of pollution and scientific research.\n101.\tSince jurisdiction and control over coastal fisheries is a matter of fundamental importance to Iceland and forms an inseparable part of the problem of coastal jurisdiction in its entirety, I should like to take this opportunity to summarize in just a few words the position of the Government of Iceland in this field.\n102.\tA great development is taking place as regards the problem of coastal fisheries. It is generally admitted that the system of narrow fishery limits on the one hand and the so-called freedom of fishing-subject to minimal agreed conservation measures equally applicable to all beyond that area-on the other hand, was heavily weighted in favor of the countries that want to fish as close as possible to the coasts of other nations. This obsolete system is now being replaced by a new pragmatic approach. This new progressive international law is based on two fundamental propositions. The first is that the interest of the inter-national community in the freedom of the seas for purposes of navigation and commerce should be protected. The other fundamental proposition is that the coastal fisheries are a part of the natural resources of the coastal State up to a reasonable distance fir m the coast and that this problem is entirely different from the concept of the territorial sea. The distance required for this specialized jurisdiction over fisheries would vary in different countries and regions, but\nit would be determined on the basis of the relevant local considerations-geographical, biological, economic and \\\" others- The task is now to ascertain the claims of the various States in this field as regards exclusive fishery limits, preferential and conservation zones. Such a pragmatic approach will provide the necessary foundation for a realistic and reasonable system.\n103.\tMy Government is convinced that this new system already has the support of the international community and is preparing the extension of the Icelandic fishery limits in conformity with these views so as to cover the waters of the continental shelf of Iceland. That criterion is clearly indicated in Iceland; that is an area which, for example at the depth of 400 meters, would extend to approximately 50 to 70 miles from the coast. The outlines of this platform on which the country rests follow those of the coast itself, and in these shallow underwater terraces ideal conditions are found for spawning areas and nursery grounds for the fish stocks upon whose preservation and utilization the livelihood of the Icelandic nation depends. That environment is an integral part of the natural resources of the country. Indeed the coastal fisheries in Iceland have always been the foundation of the country's economy. The country itself is barren there are no minerals or forests  and most of the necessities of life have to be imported and financed through the export of fisheries products which have constituted approximately 90 per cent of total exports. The coastal fisheries are the condition sine qua non for the Icelandic economy. Without them the country would not have been habitable. It is indeed as if nature had intended to compensate for the barrenness of the country itself by surrounding it with rich fishing grounds. The continental shelf area in our case constitutes the natural fishery limits and the Icelandic Government has announced that it will issue new regulations in conformity with these considerations before 1 September 1972.\n104.\tThe Icelandic Government considers that as far as Iceland is concerned we have to protect our interests now. It is quite clear that at any time the highly developed fishing fleets of distant-water fishing countries will be increasingly directed to the Iceland area. These fleets have now for some time had huge catches from the Barents Sea. Fishing there is no longer as profitable as it was, and they are directing their attention to the Iceland area. And the absence of highly developed fishing techniques and fishing capacity with huge factory trawlers, electronic equipment, and so on could very well cause irreparable harm to the Iceland area. I might mention in this connexion that the three nations mostly concerned in the Barents Sea area have for some time tried to establish some kind of quota system for that .area, but as far as we know those efforts have not met with success. In any case we cannot afford to take the risk of just doing nothing and we sincerely hope that our actions will be understood in that light by other delegations in this Assembly.\n105.\tWe are hopeful that the forthcoming conference will eventually provide a system that would consider the measures which we are going to take, and must take, to be entirely lawful, just and equitable. Our action is in conformity with that spirit. It is in conformity with the strong conviction that progressive international law will replace the system which for far too long has been\ntolerated. Indeed, more than 20 nations have already proclaimed rules and regulations for their increased protection in this field.\n106.\tA matter which is clearly related to the problems of the conservation and utilization of fishery resources is the protection of the marine environment. That matter is also receiving the attention of the Committee preparing the third United Nations conference on the law of the sea. The Committee had before it a valuable report from the Secretary-General on the prevention and control of marine pollution. \n107.\tWe are now faced with the ominous fact that ocean pollution presents a very serious danger to marine life, and even to man's activities in this environment.. Scientific studies have indeed made it clear that in time all oceans will be threatened with pollution, It is therefore high time that the United Nations should undertake effective and speedy action to reverse these developments and preserve the oceans for rational exploitation of their valuable resources.\n108.\tThe delegation of Iceland joined hands with other delegations at both the twenty-third and the twenty-fourth sessions of the General Assembly in urging that those problems be given priority attention by the relevant United Nations bodies. \n109.\tWe are gratified to observe the progress that has since been made in this field in the preparations for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held at Stockholm next year, as well as by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization and other agencies, and also on a regional basis.\n110.\tThe question is how we can best obtain early and effective results in our endeavors in this important field. We believe that all Member States should as soon as possible take the necessary steps to stop the growing pollution of the oceans caused by their citizens. This should include effective prohibition against dumping poisonous or radioactive waste in the oceans.\n111.\tGlobal and regional agreements must be negotiated to these ends, establishing the obligation of all States to desist from destroying marine resources and the marine environment by pollution and defining pollution standards, liability and damages.\n112.\tOnly by such early and concerted action can we hope ' to avert the present threat to ocean resources and thereby protect alike the interests of the coastal State and the international community as a whole.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "26.\t  Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you the warm congratulations of the Greek delegation on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Your election is a tribute both to your own high personal qualities as a distinguished statesman and to your country, with which Greece maintains relations of sincere friendship.\n27.\tI am happy, too, to express our appreciation for the high-mindedness and great competence with which your predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro, conducted the work of the twenty-fifth session.\n28.\tU Thant\u2019s decision to terminate his tenure of office as Secretary-General saddens us. For 10 years he has devoted himself to the cause of peace and has brought to the exercise of his functions his high moral qualities, his great experience of the affairs of our Organization and an objectivity that has withstood all trials. We would like to hope, together with other speakers who have preceded us, that it is too soon to say good-bye to him.\n29.\tThe admission of four new Members, to which we address our heartiest congratulations, constitutes a positive and welcome development, adding to the many accomplishments of our Organization. Greece, which, ever since the creation of the United Nations, has applied itself to upholding all efforts made towards recognizing the right of self-determination of peoples will give its support, as it has in the past, to the search for realistic and reasonable solutions aimed at the attainment of the principles and ideals that we uphold.\n30.\tThe introduction to the report of the Secretary- General on the work of the Organization is a document of great interest which merits our particular attention. If the record of the United Nations over the last 10 years is not negative, concludes our Secretary-General, it falls, nevertheless, considerably short of our hopes; perhaps also, I might say, of our possibilities. This is due, in U Thant\u2019s judgment, to the fact that \\\"the rivalry of nations continues to be the dominant factor in international life\\\" [A/8401! Add.l, para. 6J. In this respect the most powerful Member States bear the greatest share of the responsibility that naturally is incumbent on all Member States.\n31.\tIt is true that, if colonialism is in the process of disappearing, the confrontation of social ideologies giVes rise to mistrust and explains the feeling of insecurity that pervades various regions of the world.\n32.\tIn so far as ideological dogmatism becomes the instrument of a will to power and to domination, it can constitute a threat to peace. It provokes reaction and defensive measures, as much on the internal front within States as on their frontiers.\n33.\tWe should like to believe that the philosophy of the will to power a philosophy which generates armaments\nand, what is worse, the temptation of aggression has become obsolete. It is doomed to disappearance. It is condemned by all peoples without exception who wish to live in peace and understanding and who do not find cause for disagreement or confrontation in their social systems. That philosophy is destined to vanish because it is contrary to international morality and to the conscience of the developing peoples. Our hope is that it will disappear without having to be buried under the ruins of a nuclear war. May it disappear in the warmth of co-operation and active peace founded on independence, freedom, mutual respect and the elimination of mistrust deriving from doctrinal conflicts and inadmissible interference in the domestic affairs of others.\n34.\tWe think that the United Nations is the best instrument to promote such a development. We believe that it is within the framework of the United Nations rather than elsewhere that crises are defused and lose their virulence, that the mighty recognize that power is created not only by material strength but by moral strength as well, and that the international community represents more than the mere sum of the Members of this Assembly. Universal conscience is forged by mutual understanding and co-operation amongst peoples, and is expressing itself, even though as yet incompletely, in the United Nations, despite the effects of politics and the automatic voting that sometimes occurs.\n35.\tMy country, Greece, has always had faith in the United Nations and does not forget the assistance that the United Nations has rendered to Greece on many occasions. We believe in the universality of the United Nations and in the necessity for bringing before this universal Organization all differences and all disputes.\n36.\tWe think that the United Nations should be kept informed of major political events by official communications, in order to strengthen its presence and even its action in the interests of peace. This would have a beneficial effect in both ways. It would remind Member States of their responsibilities towards the international community assumed under the Charter, and it would provide the United Nations with the advantage of all appropriate preventive action in favor of peace.\n37.\tIt is in this sense that I think it useful, in passing from the universal to the regional, to invite the attention of the Assembly to political developments that have taken place in the Balkans during this year. The re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Greece and Albania normalizes the situation in that region. Furthermore, by the combined efforts of all the Governments of all the countries of that area, by official visits and repeated contacts, a climate of co-operation, of understanding and of friendship has been created. It is interesting to note that the Balkan States are not only endowed with different social structures and institutions, but are also linked by very different political affiliations. This co-operation should not cast doubt on their loyalty or attachment to the international commitments they have entered into or the fundamental principles of their political orientation.\n38.\tThis proves that, to the extent that goodwill exists, it is possible to work together for the benefit of all. From this experience of co-operation in detente we can see that\npeoples, independently of the regime they have adopted, aspire to peace and independence. In the political field, peace and independence are revealed as constituting a common denominator. In the material field, it is natural that all peoples, and particularly the developing nations, aspire to an improvement in their standards of living and to better social conditions.\n39.\tFurthermore, what I have just said is relevant to efforts made to reinforce international security, thus giving effect, in a sense, to resolution 2734 (XX\\ ) adopted by the General Assembly during the twenty-fifth session, on 16 December 1970. I would recall that Greece has already replied [see A/8431, sect. II] in a positive way to the circular note of the Secretary-General inviting Member States to furnish information on steps taken in pursuance of this resolution. My delegation reserves the right to take an active part in the debates to be held on this question.\n40.\tWe also think that it is in this spirit that efforts are being made to prepare for a European security conference. This conference could be held quite soon, under good auspices, in view of the favorable development of the situation in both Eastern and Western Europe.\n41.\tParallel to this effort, we should pursue with vigor the implementation of the Second United Nations Development Decade program. There can be no lasting and stable peace as long as the peoples that are to benefit therefrom are haunted by the specteR of misery and poverty and as long as the possibilities and opportunities for progress and development are not assured.\n42.\tThe question of disarmament, which we ail want to be general and complete, is a matter of concern, as it has been in the past, for the General Assembly. Greece has taken an active part in the work of the United Nations on matters of disarmament. These achievements, which are well known and which I shall refrain from enumerating here, are certainly important developments. However, they are of a marginal nature, and their effect is not yet being felt in terms of the realities that condition our security and our existence. This makes necessary the existence of defensive military organizations and alliances. It is regrettable to note that the arms race continues and that year after year the quantity of weapons which weighs so heavily on the destiny of this world is on the increase.\n43.\tMeetings, conferences and yet more conferences, always on disarmament, are suggested to us. We are ready to participate, as we have done in the past. However, we think that the process of disarmament is essentially political in nature. We must resolve differences by negotiation, abandon dreams of domination, avoid confrontation and bring about detente, through tolerance and the promotion of a climate propitious to psychological and emotional disarmament. Without this, disarmament will remain in the realm of fiction and polemics. No one disarms in a climate of mistrust.\n44.\tIt is well known that the question of the representation of China will be raised from a different angle this year. We think that in the United Nations there can be only one seat for China: one seat in the Security Council and one seat in the Assembly. It is a question of recognizing the\n \nrightful holder of that seat. The question of exclusion or expulsion does not, in our view, arise. If, however, this question, which we consider essentially simple, were to be posed in a complicated form or in the form of a synthesis, we would be inclined not to commit our responsibility in a way that would risk leading us into deadlock. On this point we will have the advantage of being further enlightened when the question is discussed in the General Assembly.\n45.\tIt is natural for us to continue to be concerned with the situation in the Middle East, for as long as this illegal situation persists, recourse to violence remains an alternative and constitutes a danger to all those most directly interested-a danger to peace in this region and a danger to peace in general.\n46.\tOur position in favor of the full implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is well known. The return, in keeping with this resolution, of occupied Arab territories could not reasonably exclude a negotiated arrangement which alone would allow Israel to lead an industrious existence in peace and security. The argument of force is not always the best, and an armed truce is neither the best of solutions nor the best of guarantees. Respect for international legality opens the way to negotiation. Needless to say, as in the past, we hold that the problem of Palestine refugees should be resolved in a just and humane manner.\n47.\tI wish equally to reiterate our attachment to past Security Council resolutions and to a very recent one, 298 (1971), of 25 September, concerning the status of Jerusalem and the protection of the holy places. A considerable proportion of the Christian sanctuaries in this city has always been in the custody of the Greek Orthodox Church. Greece could not remain indifferent to this problem,\n48.\tWith regard to the Mediterranean, and apart from present considerations, one should bear in mind that the Mediterranean States represent also a permanent and important factor. To *he extent that the solidarity of the coastal countries of the Mediterranean could manifest itself in a form more concrete and more in conformity with their interests and the aspirations of their peoples, this factor should be borne in mind.\n49.\tReference is made in the introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization to the question of Cyprus. U Thant expresses his concern that as a result of the impasse reached in the talks between the two communities on the island a new crisis might occur. He states that he has been \\\"ceaselessly urging restraint upon the Government and the Turkish Cypriot leadership\\\" [A[8401lAdd.lt para. 232]. Greece, being extremely interested in the maintenance of order on the island and in the search for a peaceful and just solution, has constantly acted in the same spirit. Not only has it tried to contribute to inter-communal understanding, by suggestions which it has deemed constructive, but it has been very careful to avoid interfering in the polemics which, coming from all sides, at times have poisoned the climate. We have tried to follow a responsible and serious policy.\n50.\tAt present we are making ourselves available to all concerned in order to assist them towards conciliation.\u2003\nFortunately , there is no lack of peaceful procedures. If one attempted negotiation has failed, this does not mean that . other talks would meet the same fate. It is, however, necessaRy to recognize that our possibilities are limited. As far as we are concerned, any assistance aimed at promoting an agreed settlement in the framework of the United Nations is welcome.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "181.\t  Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to associate myself with the speakers who preceded me in extending on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo my wannest congratulations upon your election to the office of President of the twenty-sixth regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n182.\tThis choice was not accidental. Your outstanding qualities as a man and a diplomat, your extensive experience with international problems, your faith in the United Nations and the value you attach to the sacred principles contained in the Charter are the factors which have singled you out to exercise the heavy task that has been entrusted to you. We are therefore confident that the work of the present session will be crowned with great success.\n183.\tBut for the Congolese delegation that election also constitutes happiness for another reason: you represent a country which is friendly to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Republic of Indonesia has been one of the foremost countries in the line of fire of the peoples of the third world against poverty, injustice and exploitation. Indeed, it was in your country, more specifically at Bandung, that the first African-Asian Conference was held in 1955, thus marking the awakening of all the colonized peoples in the fight for their emancipation. But Bandung also rings in our ears as the source of \\\"non-alignment\\\", a doctrine which since then has become an abiding principle of the countries of the third world in their international policies, of which they are quite proud.\n184.\tI should like to address the most heartfelt congratulations of the Congolese delegation to the three new Member States which have joined us, thus enlarging this international family -I refer to Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar. The accession of those three States to international sovereignty brought about great joy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and from this rostrum we transmit to them the friendly greetings of the people of the Congo, of its party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution and of its Government.\n\n185  Last 18 September the Democratic Republic of the Congo marked the tenth anniversary of the death of the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dag Hammanskjold, who died for the causes of peace, for the cause of the United Nations and for the cause of the unity of my country. I should like here to pay to him the tribute of all the Congolese people. with your permission, Mr. President, I should like to request those present to observe a minute of silence to honour his memory.\n\n186 Last year we celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. The twenty-fifth session was therefore a jubilee session and a session for stocktaking.\n\n187 The twenty-six session marks a new start for the United Nations. That is why, in the opinion of my delegation, the work of this session must be a landmark in the history of the Organization. This work must represent the new will of States to remake the United Nations into a genuine organization in the service of peace, understanding and cooperation between all men, in the spirit of the Charter which governs it. Only then can the United Nations fully play the role assigned to it, and mankind be in a position to expect of the answers to the agonizing question which arise in the word.\n\n188 Once again we are gathered to discuss crucial problems, such as those of peace and security throughout the word; decolonization, particularly in Africa and international cooperation.\n\n189 Independently of any procedural considerations or legal subletiers as to which State must or must not sit in the Security Council or in the General Assembly, I should like to recall that what is essential for the safeguarding of peace by our Organization in adherence to the Charter and a scrupulous  application of its principles. The criteria of the number o inhabitants of nuclear power and of economic development. however important, remain inadequate. From an analysis of the present international situation, it clearly appears to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo that a certain Power, the People's republic of China, has never adhered to the Charter. That country which has nearly one-third of mankind within its borders, has never explicitly recognized the Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n190  It is surprising that a country which increasingly asserts its own sovereignty has so little respect for the sovereignty and the independence of other states, particularly in Africa, carrying out a policy of subversion and interference in internal affairs to the point of financially and materially supporting both secession and rebellions.\n\n191\tIn the case of the Congo, that policy of aggression and subversion followed by the People's Republic of China has seriously undermined the great task accomplished by the United Nations in my country. Since we have no assurance that that policy has been abandoned, we are unable to support any draft resolution whatsoever to admit the People's Republic of China to our Organization. A Power-large because of its population and because of the possession of nuclear weapon -which is to sit in the Security Council, must formally adhere to the Charter of our Organization. Are we to believe -and the draft resolution on the restoration of the lawful rights of China implies as much- that the People's Republic of China recognizes that the signature of Chiang Kai-shek ratifying the United Nations Charter is binding upon itself? Are we to believe that the commitments assumed by Chiang Kai-shek on behalf of the whole of China in 1945 will be respected by Mao Tse-tung? How many commitments of the former have been repudiated by the latter?\n\n!92 In any other circumstances the continuity of States implies that international commitments of any given regime will be respected by another regime that replaces it. In the case of China, we must recognize that there is quite a special situation.\n\n193 It is necessary -I repeat this- for the Peking regime to adhere formally to the Charter. Otherwise, we might admit here representatives who would have only rights and absolutely no obligations because they had never committed themselves to any. A blanked endorsement of all those contradictions would bode ill for our Organization.\n\n194 When one speaks of international security, we Africans think quite naturally of protecting our countries against subversion. But we think also of the two world wars into which Africa was drawn and in which it sacrificed the flower of its youth for a cause external to Africa. We do not wish to fight any more wars for others nor to die for foreign causes.\n\n195 Africa indeed deserves to have a permanent seat in the Security Council in order to exercise its veto each time an attempt is made to draw it into conflicts that do not involve its own interests in any way. A large African country, which has suffered from war and which therefore knows the price of peace -I am referring to Nigeria- might well occupy that post and carry out this heavy responsibility to the satisfaction of all, Moreover, if one thinks dispassionately or without rancor about the very structure of the Security Council. one is bound to admit that that Council, where the right of veto is granted  only to the victorious nations of the 1939-1945 war, no longer meets the needs of contemporary peace. Do the vanquished of yesterday - which have been accused of all kinds of wrong-doing  - not have any responsibility of the maintenance of the peace within the Security Council? I am of course referring to Germany and Japan. Those nations, whose economic recovery is familiar to all, must devote the largest part of their resources to the maintenance of peace. That is why their responsibilities must be recognized.\n\n196 In this chapter of international security, I should like to emphasize the full gravity of the conflict in the Middle-East. On 22 November 1967 the Security Council adopted resolution 242 (1967) on the situation in the Middle East. My delegation continues to consider that the resolution is\nthe proper framework within which peace in that part of the world should be sought. Unfortunately, much has been said about that resolution but it has not led to any concrete solution. That is why we place great hope in the committee of wise men of the Organization of African Unity whose Sub-Committee, consisting of four African Heads of State, is to go in the near future to Israel and the Egyptian Arab Republic. Never before has such an important Committee been established to look into this problem. Now that Africa wishes to make a modest contribution, it should be trusted and given every opportunity.\n197.\tThe pursuit of open or veiled colonization in Africa is also a serious threat to the security of our States. Open colonization is the kind that Portugal continues shamelessly to practice in the Territories of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). Veiled colonization-which deceives no one-is the kind practiced by the regime of Ian Smith in Rhodesia and the regime of Vorster in South Africa itself and in Namibia.\n198.\tThe criminal obstinacy and the repulsive insolence displayed by Portugal, a colonial Power which wishes to maintain under its yoke populations having mentalities and cultures different from its own, need no further proof.\n199.\tThe wind of decolonization, which was released among other things by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and more recently by the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], has blown over the continents that were formerly subjugated by colonialist Powers.\n200.\tHeedless of this general movement of emancipation, Portugal refuses to recognize for Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) a destiny different from its own. And in order to demonstrate its irrevocable attitude on this point, it has undertaken to strengthen its arsenal, with the complicity of certain Powers. As a counterpart for the assistance it receives from those Powers, Portugal has placed at their disposal what it complacently calls its African \\\"possessions\\\".\n201.\tIn spite of numerous resolutions and declarations of the United Nations, Portugal is unremittingly pursuing its repression of the populations of these Territories, which it wantonly considers as an integral part of its metropolitan territory but which in fact constitute the last bastions of colonialism and exploitation.\n202.\tSupported and encouraged by that conspiracy of its allies, Portugal is no longer content to practice repression against the populations in the Territories under its domination, and is now turning against the independent African States neighboring on Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).\n203.\tPortuguese aircraft are daily violating our air space; Portuguese troops are committing all sorts of acts against our sovereignty; our villages are pillaged and sacked and our inhabitants massacred, Our determination to see Angola free itself from the colonial yoke is irrevocable.\n204.\tNevertheless we must point out that it is for the people of Angola, once it is liberated, to choose freely its own political philosophy or ideology. Attempts are being made to gain credence for the thesis that so-called socialist liberation movements are good movements, whereas the others are bad. As far as we are concerned, what is important first and foremost is liberation and not the ideological hue of the movements. Having said that, I should like to point out that it is inconceivable to liberate Angola without the assistance of the Congo, and it is even more inconceivable to liberate it against the Congo.\n205.\tThat leads us to speak of South Africa.\n206.\tWhile the United Nations is proclaiming the equality of all men, the white minority in South Africa is resuscitating the outmoded and mistaken theory of superior races; while the United Nations is affirming the right of all peoples to self-determination, the racist regime in South Africa is depriving the majority African population of all of its most legitimate rights and is maintaining it in subjugation unworthy of human beings, considering those people as inferior beings.\n207.\tThe same blind and ludicrous obstinacy which characterizes South Africa's methods of government applies equally to the situation in Namibia. While the General Assembly has divested South Africa of its Mandate over Namibia, the Pretoria racist regime, in turning a deaf ear, continues to administer Namibia as it pleases, despite the fact that that Territory is under the direct authority of the United Nations. A United Nations Council on Namibia, responsible for the administration of the Territory until its independence, has even been set up [resolution 2248 (S-V)], but has never been able to go to that Territory as a result of the South African Government's fierce opposition.\n208.\tThus it is that the South African Government, assured of that support and complicity, continues shamelessly to flout the United Nations and to trample underfoot all of its resolutions and principles, particularly the principle of the self-determination of peoples and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Democratic Republic of the Congo vigorously condemns that attitude of the Pretoria authorities. In these circumstances we cannot consider any dialog whatsoever with the South African racist regime, as has been advocated by certain States. The position of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in this respect has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions: if there is to be a dialog, it must begin first in South Africa itself between the African majority and the white minority. In any event, that dialog must begin first between the whites and blacks in South Africa before being entered into with other, independent States of Africa.\n209.\tThe Bantu chiefs in South Africa are calling for the right to have a dialog with the white minority. Well, let them be given the right and that freedom. In that way shall be able to judge the true intentions of the South African regime.\n210.\tBut there is in Africa another cause for our resentment, and that is Rhodeska, where the African majority has also lost all of its rights and where democracy has been buried and a second apartheid regime installed. What outrages and revolts us even more is the hypocrisy of successive London Governments, which, while claiming to be repositories of democracy, have been unwilling to intervene in Rhodesia to restore to the people of Zimbabwe the rights of which they have been deprived.\n211.\tTo sum up, the situation in southern Africa remains both disturbing and alarming, be it the case of the regime of apartheid and racial discrimination in the Republic of South Africa and the acts of oppression committed by that regime in Namibia, or the case of the usurpation of the rights of the Zimbabwe people by the rebel minority in Rhodesia or of the tortured and martyred populations in the Territory under Portuguese domination.\n212.\tI come now to the urgent problem of underdevelopment.\n213.\tCan one really speak of international peace when more than two thirds of mankind are groveling in extreme poverty? At the same time, the gulf which separates the economies of the developed countries from those of the developing countries is growing day by day.\n214.\tAll States Members of the United Nations are aware of this agonizing problem. That is why they proclaimed the years 1960-1970 as the first United Nations Development Decade. A glimmer of hope had appeared for suffering humanity, but unfortunately the means devoted to the achievement of the goals of that first Decade were so limited that the results were equally scanty. The failure of the first Development Decade is attributable, first of all, to the behavior of the affluent countries, which in our opinion limited the material and human assistance necessary for the success of the program of that Decade. As a result of that inadequacy of aid, the prospects for healthy and sincere international co-operation have been seriously darkened.\n215.\tNevertheless, there can be no doubt whatsoever that development is an essential condition for peace and social justice. The Democratic Republic of the Congo believes that the gap separating the developed from the developing countries can and must be bridged by means of a system of international co-operation based upon the sincere will of partners to succeed. That will presupposes, first and foremost, a genuine spirit of sacrifice on both sides: the developed countries must be prepared to lose a little of their wealth by placing it at the service of the less developed countries, while the latter must endeavor to spend less, while taking account, within their local context, of the technical requirements of development.\n216.\tThe developing countries are not asking the wealthy countries for alms: the assistance to be given us is only just reparation for the exploitation of our riches, both material and human. It is our right to receive assistance, because the peace and security of the world require that we emerge from our under-development.\n217.\tThe Democratic Republic of the Congo hopes that the Second United Nations Development Decade will open in a climate of better prepared and informed good will towards better international co-operation, designed to achieve this time all of the objectives assigned for 1980. That of course means a substantial increase in the resources destined for the less fortunate countries.\n218.\tIt seems to us, therefore, that the so-called developed world has the urgent duty of contributing to the rehabilitation of the economies of the third world by trying to remove the obstacles encountered by the developing countries, especially by inspiring confidence in them and by granting them the unconditional assistance they require for the improvement of their standards of living. It is only thus that the Second United Nations Development Decade will have any greater chance of success than the first.\n219.\tMore specifically and within the context of multilateral co-operation, the Democratic Republic of the Congo attaches importance to the assistance provided by the United Nations specialized agencies, as well as to that of other international technical organs. We hope that efforts will be made towards the conclusion of economic and trade agreements similar to those already in force-in particular, on coffee, tin and other similar products. We wish to warn against the trend in international gatherings not to go beyond mere idle and theoretical discussions in regard to development.\n220.\tIn order to counteract the deterioration of the terms of trade, we believe it extremely urgent for an agreement to be concluded on the stabilization of the prices of basic commodities and raw materials coming from developing countries. Indeed, how could it be otherwise? How are the economies of those countries to be developed if the national budgets out of which the development programs of those economies are financed are as unstable as the prices of the raw materials and basic goods on which the quasi-totality of those budgets depend? Is it not pure hypocrisy to be willing, on the one hand, to encourage the development of the economies of the developing countries while, on the other hand, turning one's back on the conclusion of agreements on the stabilization of the prices which determine their development?\n221.\tIn the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development all the member countries, especially the industrialized countries, must once and for all attack the problem of the stabilization of prices for raw materials and basic commodities.\n222.\tIt is in that context that my delegation expresses its deep concern vis-d-vis the present monetary crisis. In spite of all the assurances we have been given, the developing countries-and there is no doubt about this-are very likely to be the ones that will have to pay for this crisis.\n223.\tMoreover, the United Nations Development program should be buttressed. Its services are highly appreciated in our countries, but we must stress that its total yield is still insufficient.\n224.\tSome theoreticians have spoken of the restructuring of the United Nations specialized agencies in such a way as to make them more functional as regards the goals of the Second Development Decade. As far as we are concerned, I must point out that any change in the structures should be aimed at converting the specialized agencies into organizations in which it will become increasingly possible to achieve concrete agreements on specific problems concerning development. We believe that that is the only way to avoid having the Second Development Decade, within\nmultilateral relations, follow the same fate as the first Decade.\n225.\tIt has turned out, especially in the industrialized countries, that development brings with it certain inherent evils. I am speaking particularly of the mayhem produced by the physical pollution of the human environment and the dwindling of the vital resources available to man, that is to say, the pollution of the air and water by gases and industrial wastes. Of course, these problems are the subject of great preoccupation on the part of the industrialized countries. The Democratic Republic of the Congo fully associates itself with such preoccupation, because it is a country with a great industrial future.\n226.\tThere is another problem which should engage the attention of countries in the near future, and that is the problem of the sea-bed and ocean floor and their exploitation for peaceful purposes. Our lengthy discussions on this question since the twenty-second session have sufficiently displayed its importance in economic, scientific and other terms. However, there remains the important unresolved problem of the exploitation of these resources, which must be regarded as belonging to the whole world and not to any particular country.\n227.\tFaithful to the spirit of the declaration of principles adopted at the twenty-fifth session [resolution 2749 (XXV)], my delegation will support any draft agreement opposing any idea of militarization of the sea-bed beyond territorial limits, and safeguarding the waters of the sea, which are the heritage of the entire world, against the dangers of pollution from chemical and industrial wastes, or from nuclear or other tests.\n228.\tThe development of the immense resources of the sea and of the sea-bed must lead to international economic equilibrium, avoiding an increase in the gap separating the developed countries from the developing countries.\n229.\tAs I have already pointed out, the United Nations remains the best instrument that the world possesses at this moment for guaranteeing international peace and security. However, if the United Nations does not achieve its goals and does not fulfill its mission fully, if today it is not able to bring peace to Asia and the Middle East, if it is powerless to put an end to colonialism in Africa, if it is incapable of stopping poverty and injustice in the world and thus ensuring progress for all nations, the responsibility for such failure, whether partial or total, rests upon its constituents, that is to say, the Member States.\n230.\tFor its part the Democratic Republic of Congo is aware of this situation. That is why it appeals to the universal conscience for common action to be undertaken to hold back all these scourges afflicting mankind.\n231.\tBefore I conclude, it is my duty, speaking here on behalf of my delegation and on behalf of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to pay a ringing tribute to our Secretary-General, U Thant, for the self-denial with which for 10 years he has devoted himself body and soul to the cause of our Organization. The only way to show him our gratitude is to ask him to continue to be available to the United Nations so that the Second Development Decade which we have now begun may benefit from his experience and may succeed.\n"

        "file_text": "104.\t In addressing the General Assembly today, I am\nespecially happy to tell you how gratified we are to see you presiding over our deliberations this year. In electing you, the world Organization has chosen the eminent Minister for Foreign Affairs of a great Asian country, whose Government advocates, wisely and with circumspection, international entente and understanding, We follow with interest the manner in which the Indonesian people have resolutely embarked on the path of continued economic and social development and progress.\n105.\tAt the same time I should like to convey to the outgoing President the expression of our highest regard and appreciation for the remarkably impartial manner and the firm yet smiling authority with which he conducted the debates of the session that commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations.\n106.\tWhen, on this occasion, I reiterate to Secretary-General U Thant our tribute of gratitude for his persevering efforts in favor of peace over a period of more than 10 years, I do so with all the regrets I feel at his intention not to continue in his duties beyond the end of his present term, in the event that his decision were to be inflexible.\n107.\tIf, at the beginning of an Assembly session, we were to seek to determine the true meaning that should surround our debate, we should, first of all, take into account the recent evolution of the international situation.\n108.\tOur discussions, last year, were largely dominated by the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary. At the time, we took a long look at all that had happened since the entry into force of the Charter signed at San Francisco. While noting the fundamental changes that had taken place throughout the world since that time, which may already appear remote, it was impossible to ignore the enormous difference that still exists between our acts and our aspirations based on the reign of peace and understanding between peoples.\n109.\tThe declarations of principle adopted almost a year ago with an eye to the future, the initiatives taken at the time, were marked with the need for a dialog. The settlement of disputes and there were many who emphasized this point strongly must be the result of constructive negotiations and preserving efforts at conciliation, in keeping with the spirit of the Charter and respect for its principles.\n110.\tWhile the texts approved in 1945 do not spell this out, such an approach requires that our Organization should have a representative character that is as close as possible to universality, in other words; that all countries, and especially those which by reason of their importance, are fc< duty bound to assume the greatest responsibilities, should take part in the settlement of disputes of major importance for the survival of mankind.\n111.\tThe events of this year have unhappily brought a succession of unexpected misfortunes and setbacks to millions of men; the hand of man has added to the cataclysms produced by the forces of nature and has conjured up again the specter of war. On the other hand, we have witnessed the opening up of new horizons, unexplored thus far, in the fruitful rapprochement between\npeoples, even though the chances for a final normalization of relations between them have not always been either rapid or easy.\n112.\tContacts have been established between great Powers which previously ignored each other: in the Middle East guns have been silenced thanks to the cease-fire which, however precarious, is none the less real and which, it is to be hoped, will endure until peace is finally achieved; and in Viet-Nam the possibility of a peaceful settlement is beginning to materialize.\n113.\tIt is the duty of our Organization to make the adaptations required by this changing situation. The need for a dialog requires, firstly as I pointed out almost a year ago from this rostrum [1878th meeting]  that the 750 million inhabitants of continental China be effectively represented here by their governing authorities, it being understood, therefore, that the permanent seat reserved in the Security Council for China should be occupied by the Government of the People's Republic of China. Since it is imperative for that Government to break out of its political isolation, we regard the progress achieved recently in this direction as encouraging.\n114.\tOn the other hand, it is difficult to believe that the progressive application of the principle of universality within the United Nations can only be achieved through the prior expulsion of a Member State which has always scrupulously fulfilled the duties imposed upon it by the Charter.\n115.\tWe are unable to see how the United Nations could, a priori, dislodge by expulsion, a Government which effectively governs a people of 14 million inhabitants, and which, to date, has at all times shown a constructive and loyal attitude. Such an action by the United Nations would be tantamount to denying its principles and encouraging, if not openly at least tacitly, the settlement of a conflict through means other than open and constructive dialog, whereas its role is to serve as an intermediary, to go beyond the passions aroused by events, to build bridges over the abyss of differences which divide the two parties.\n116.\tThe expulsion of a Member could only create a new tension, whereas, on the other hand and without pie-judging possible solutions it should be possible to find a peaceful solution to the entry of the People's Republic of China within the framework of the United Nations.\n117.\tStill-'within the context of the dialog, we have, in these past months, witnessed the progress achieved in the field of co-operation in Europe. The success of talks with a view to enlarging the European communities will undoubtedly make it possible to achieve and expand the understanding between these countries, whose rivalry has already dominated history far too long. By a joint attempt to create forms of solidarity enabling them to settle, on a much broader scale, questions which they cannot solve by remaining in isolation, the European States which take part in the process of integration will not only bring about a stabilizing effect in that area of the world, but will, moreover, exert a beneficial influence on the development of profitable relations between our continent and the rest of the universe.\n118.\tFor the consolidation of Europe's structure has undeniably always facilitated a detente. That detente was made manifest recently on the occasion of the signature of an agreement solving the thorny Berlin problem by the four Powers who have special responsibilities in Germany.4 That agreement brings us considerably closer to the day when it will be possible to explore the possibilities of discussion of the other present-day European problems within a multilateral framework. The result will be improved political relations, accompanied by an expansion in trade exchanges with third world countries, as well as a freer circulation of men, ideas and information.\n119.\tWe sincerely hope that all the countries of the European continent will make a contribution of equal value to the creation of that detente. Our wish is to see the final establishment of co-operation between all States in Europe, based on mutual confidence and respect.\n120.\tThe advantages that have progressively grown out of the regional policy followed thus far illustrate the extent to which it is urgent for all peoples to transcend considerations arising from an excessive and outmoded concept of nationalism or the most traditional kind of sovereignty .\n121.\tThis is true, in particular, of the efforts made by all people without distinction to achieve economic and social progress. It is true, moreover, of actions to be undertaken jointly to maintain peace. It is also true of measures to be taken with a view to ensuring the universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is true, finally, of the settlement of disputes through arbitration or legal institutions.\n122.\tIn all of these fields the implementation of co-ordinated action, even of institutional joint mechanisms, appears to be more essential with each passing day. Progressively, problems of this kind go beyond the narrow framework of national frontiers and impose on the world community a need to act under concerted decisions. States for this reason must give up exercising an ever increasing amount of prerogatives for the benefit of international institutions or organs vested with true competence.\n123.\tIn the course of the Second United Nations Development Decade the implementation of procedures for the examination and assessment of the International Development Strategy is liable in the coming years to make public opinion more aware of the duties deriving therefrom for all countries involved in this global, unprecedented task of solidarity. As the years of the Decade go by, this enterprise, based for the most part on bilateral relations between States, must assume the nature of an essentially multilateral action.\n124.\tThe institution of a system of generalized preferences, established by the European Economic Community for industrial products from all the developing countries without discrimination, has enabled us this year to take an important step towards that objective. That scheme is in keeping with the main concern that was manifested at\nsessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in its desire to arrive at an over-all scheme of preferences, without reciprocity or discrimination, acceptable both to the developed and to the developing countries. Its adoption enabled us optimistically to envisage the next stage-the third session of the Conference, to be held in April 1972 in Santiago, Chile, in the hope that converging measures will derive from the discussion.\n125.\tThe recent international monetary crisis, however, has made us fear that we shall go back to protectionism, to the closing of world trade (the results of which would be felt by the whole of the third world) and a reduction of over-all aid to the developing countries, as well as a serious depreciation of their exports. It is therefore essential to call on the perspicacity of responsible statesmen in order to face up to these serious threats.\n126.\tInternational public opinion follows the work of our Organization with unveiled skepticism, and that same public opinion is losing some of its faith in the political efficacy of the United Nations. This is due in part to the fact that a valid arrangement has not yet beew arrived at concerning the establishment, in time of crisis, of joint operations for the maintenance of peace.\n127.\tWe are aware of the multiple aspects of this problem. We know of its particular importance for the medium-sized and small countries that have been the victims of acts of aggression, expansion or conquest. Only a true participation by all the great Powers along the lines recognized in the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations set up by the Assembly will enable our Organization to become what we expected it to be from the very outset-in other words, an irreplaceable instrument for peace and security.\n128 . In fact, whenever and as often as the United Nations has intervened, even by sending mere observers, in a dispute which had degenerated or ran the risk of degenerating into a military conflict, the worst has been avoided. Moreover, despite its shortcomings, the Organization proved to be effective in situations where we decided to make it play a useful role. The Security Council, in particular, functioned efficiently as soon - as the permanent members were in agreement. Consequently, it would be in the interest of the great Powers to draw inspiration from these experiences, in order to expedite the current talks, to which many member States attach particular importance.\n129.\tA series of Articles in the Charter emphasize the need to safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms, while imposing on Member States the obligations to respect them. The duties of the Organization as such stem directly from these Articles. Here, too, the commitments undertaken limit a sovereignty which may not be exercised at the expense of the legitimate concern of the world community.\n130.\tIn order to fulfill its mission, the United Nations, through a High Commissioner for Human Rights, should make its voice felt impartially and effectively.\n131.\tDespite the improvement we have noted in the international situation recently at different levels, despite the relaxing of tension in certain areas, we cannot still the anguish inspired in an impartial observer by the continuance of old conflicts and the possible appearance on the horizon of new tragedies.\n132.\tWe have eagerly followed the actions of the Secretary-General when, through his Special Representative, he has attempted to bring the opposing parties in the Middle East to an understanding on the basis of a common interpretation and application of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) sketching the broad outlines of a just and lasting settlement.\n133.\tWe have paid special attention to the attempts made in the course of the talks between the four great Powers and the exploratory mission of the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Rogers, who took the initiative in this field. None of these initiatives, even when they sought a simply partial and provisional solution, thus far, has been successful-as we know only too well.\n134.\tIf we want to break out of the deadlock, criticism and mutual accusations will not help us in any way. The escalation of words finally leads to an escalation of violence. And in such conditions the parties involved, whose responsible leaders have confirmed their will to make peace, must realize with objectivity that they are compelled to live together for ever in the same region. Neither the use of military force nor the tracing of frontiers have in the past constituted, nor will they in future constitute, a step forward or a panacea.\n135.\tWe must show a true spirit of understanding, abandon attitudes which are only obstacles to an agreement worthy of the name, and avoid a resumption of hostilities which would serve the true interests of no one.\n136.\tAs for the bodies in which our Organization has put its faith for a rapprochement between the parties concerned, they should not neglect any possible chance of exploring all possible means which may lead to the expected results. Let the permanent members of the Security Council, on whom devolves so important a role in the search for a peaceful solution, spare no effort with a view to ensuring an agreement which must be reached by the parties concerned. But time is of the essence and it does not work in favor of peace.\n137.\tWhile the Middle East conflict has again this year been of great concern to us, we cannot-while not interfering in the affairs within the internal competence of Member States-keep silent before the regrettable events that have taken place on the Asian continent.\n138.\tCan we close our eyes to what the Secretary-General has described in the course of a recent press conference as \\\"one of the most tragic episodes in the history of mankind\\\"?\n139.\tWhen in one region of the world the numbers of refugees leaving their homes and their lands in conditions of misery and extreme suffering reach several million, is the United Nations truly living up to its vocation by confining its action to a timorous undertaking of a humanitarian character?\n140.\tAre considerations of national sovereignty or of security still valid when before our eyes we see the untold suffering of millions of human beings, sacrificed in the name of respect of principles that are valid in themselves, but which in this case are in conflict with elementary rights recognized by all civilized societies to the humblest of their citizens? It becomes each day more obvious that no country represented in this Organization can alone win acceptance for a solution which could be immediately applied to this situation which is fraught with future peril. Far be it from me to question the right of a country to settle its internal affairs independently. Valid solutions at the regional or national level are always infinitely preferable to the need to raise a problem in this Organization, but in the face of the impotence of the countries directly concerned, can we really remain silent?\n141.\tThus, to the extent that our general debate is supposed to reflect our major preoccupations in respect of problems that we see in the international arena now, we must look at the southern part of the Asian continent, where the safety of so many human beings depends on the pacifying action of the United Nations. Let the countries directly concerned understand that the outside world cannot indefinitely conceal its apprehensions in the face of what is going on in that area. Let them show proof of moderation and the kind of wisdom that their great men have taught in the past to the whole of mankind.\n142.\tMore than ever, the events that we are witnessing, the new possibilities that are appearing, remind the world of the need to strive for a better balance. Nothing fundamental has been changed but and the many contacts that have occurred at the highest levels or that are about to occur are proof of this we see here and there a growing desire for strengthened stability in international relations.\n143.\tAlthough wars previously led to victory and sometimes even to peace, it is clear that today they can lead neither to one nor the other. Hence there is a growing need to substitute peaceful dialog for the confrontation of weapons, to recognize a state of mutual interdependence between peoples and to arrive at true co-operation for the benefit of all.\n144.\tThe main objective of our work should be to let this trend gain more ground each day in a climate of confidence and to add other tangible results to those which have already been achieved, especially in our political debates in this Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "143.\t  Mr. President, my delegation congratulates you whole-heartedly on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We see in it a recognition on both of your high personal attributes and of the contribution and positive role which your great country has made in the United Nations and in the non-aligned movement. Your credentials give my delegation complete confidence that you are eminently qualified to guide the proceedings of this session of the General Assembly. You can count on the unstinting support and co-operation of my delegation to make your tenure of office a success.\n144.\tPermit me also to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, who presided over the deliberations of the momentous twenty-fifth anniversary session with firmness and fairness. The success which crowned our last session is attributable in no small measure to his able and wise leadership. Our Secretary General, UThant, as always, deserves our gratitude, support and encouragement. We are indebted to him for his tireless efforts in the cause of peace and justice. His is an immeasurable service to mankind; and we wish him well.\n145.\tWe extend a cordial welcome to the three new Members of the United Nations family-Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar. We are confident that they will contribute positively to the work of the United Nations.\n146.\tOn a sombre note, allow me also to pay a tribute to one of Africa's elder and outstanding statesmen, William Tubman, the late President of Liberia, who spent his last 28 years in the service of humanity, The Government and people of Zambia deeply mourn his loss. His efforts and his contribution towards the cause of peace and justice cannot be erased from the minds of those who knew him and what he stood for. May his soul rest in peace,\n147.\tThe colonial situation in southern Africa continues to be a grave threat to international peace and security. The General Assembly, the Security Council, the Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization of African Unity, and many other international forums have adopted numerous resolutions calling for an unconditional end to the colonial situation which exists in southern Africa and other parts of the world. The Secretary-General of our Organization has recently described the failure of millions of people to exercise their right to self-determination in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the Charter of the United Nations \\\"as a direct challenge to the Charter and an anachronism unacceptable to the membership of this Organization\\\" [A/8401/Add.l, para. 55],\n148.\tI should now like to address myself to the question of Portuguese colonial wars in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). Portugal's refusal to implement General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on the granting of freedom and independence to all people under Portuguese colonial domination cuts across the very spirit of the United Nations Charter. This arrogant attitude on the part of Portugal reduces the United Nations to virtual impotence. Membership of the United Nations calls for more responsibility than has so far been demonstrated by the fascist colonial regime in Lisbon.\n149.\tThe Government and people of Zambia salute the achievement of our brothers and sisters in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) for the heroic struggle they are currently waging. We note with pride and satisfaction that, since the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly they have registered even greater victories. We salute these patriotic sons and daughters of Africa because we are beginning to see a ray of hope-a hope of regaining a personality that has for many years been brutally crushed and destroyed by a colonial Power. It is also a reaffirmation of our knowledge that Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) are an integral part of Africa and not part of the dreamland of the Iberian Peninsula, We in Zambia will be among the first to extend a fraternal hand to Portugal as soon as it has granted the right of self-determination to its colonial peoples in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). We believe that this step will lead to cessation of wars of attrition, massacres and hostilities.\n150.\tColonialism cannot coexist with freedom, and our claim for a free Africa is incomplete if any parts of the African continent are still tormented and exploited. The patience of the African people is not unlimited, and if the colonial authorities in Lisbon cannot come out of their shell of illusion and reconcile themselves to the facts of modern change and development the people of Africa have no alternative but to intensify the struggle by providing moral and material assistance to enable the people under Portuguese oppression to rid themselves of foreign domination.\n151.\tWe know that there are some Western countries within and outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] which have continued to support Portugal in its criminal wars against the people under its domination and also against independent African countries. We have glaring examples of Portuguese aggression against the sister countries of Senegal, the Republic of Guinea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the People's Republic of the Congo, the United Republic of Tanzania and our own country, Zambia,\n152.\tPortugal's position as an ally of NATO in Europe is particularly anomalous. However much the Western Powers may protest that they accept no responsibility for Portuguese actions outside the NATO perimeter we do not believe that alliance politics play no part in the Western attitude towards Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) or that NATO assistance to Portugal does not directly further its war effort in Africa. Despite frequent denials to the contrary, it is common knowledge that the NATO allies have since the 1950s consulted regularly on developments in Africa. We condemn Portuguese colonialism in the strongest terms, and we also condemn its criminal acts of aggression directed against independent African States whose only crime is that they support the just cause of the peoples under Portuguese colonial domination.\n153.\tSince the unilateral declaration of independence by the white minority regime in Salisbury several unrealistic attempts have been made by the United Kingdom Government to find a settlement. The rebel regime has continued to drift at an unabated pace along the path to apartheid and to a certain extent has b *en aided by the administering Power. The Smith regime has consolidated its political, military and economic position. It has embarked on a systematic campaign of extermination directed against the African people and their leaders, who are being held in detention camps without trial. It is important that we reaffirm our condemnation of the illegal declaration of independence by the Smith, regime.\n154.\tIn 1965, after the unilateral declaration of independence by the Smith regime, we called on the United Kingdom Government to use force to crush the rebellion, which they officially acknowledged to be illegal and unconstitutional. We called for the use of force-not because we were blood-thirsty but because we were convinced that force would have averted bloodshed. Today force is the order of the day in Rhodesia, because the United Kingdom Government refused to accept our advice and instead embarked on a gradual policy of sanctions that were applied selectively and enforced half-heartedly. It was incredibly naive for the United Kingdom Government to expect selective sanctions to be effective in converting the white settlers to non-racialism. Nevertheless we supported the implementation of sanctions against the rebel colony because we did not want to give the United Kingdom Government cause for blaming their lamentable failure to crush the Smith regime on us. Although the Security Council has in paragraph 15 of its resolution 253(1968) and in paragraph 16 of its resolution 277 (1970) recognized our unenviable geographical proximity, we have continued to implement Security Council and General Assembly resolutions to the maximum extent possible. Our letter dated 10 July 1970 to the Secretary-General in response to the above-mentioned resolutions clearly stated that between November 1965 and 30 June 1970 we had reduced our imports from the rebel colony by 96 per cent. We shall continue our efforts to implement the decisions of the Security Council despite our geographical position.\n155.\tZambia has been the object of economic blackmail, mounted by its hostile neighbors, in an effort to influence the policies of the Government. We in Zambia never succumb to any kind of intimidation or blackmail, irrespective of its source. We wish to record our appreciation to the various Governments, church organizations and others in various parts of the world who have joined and are intensifying the struggle against apartheid, colonialism and racialism.\n156.\tAlthough sanctions have been of doubtful political value, they should be maintained and tightened, because any abandonment of sanctions against the Smith regime would signal a general collapse of efforts to exert international pressure on it. The morale of the freedom fighters in Zimbabwe is boosted by the awareness that the international community supports their legitimate struggle. We are aware that since June this year there have been sell-out talks between the Smith regime and Lord Goodman, a representative of the United Kingdom Government. We wish to remind the world that at one time the policy of \\\"No Independence Before Majority Rule\\\" (NIBMAR) was accepted by the then United Kingdom Government. However, it would now appear that the Conservative government is willing and ready to accept a so-called settlement that would indefinitely leave the African majority under the ruthless control of the white minority. We wish to warn the Conservative government that that approach will have unacceptable political and economic consequences.\n157.\tMy Head of State, H.E. Kenneth Kaunda, has already called apartheid a threat to international peace and security and an indescribable crime against humanity. Apartheid is a policy based on racial segregation and racial discrimination. It is pursued in a most rigorous and brutal manner by a minority of whites against the large majority of Africans, Euro-Africans and Asians. In order to pursue such a policy a cruel regime has been established, supported by a police State and the most wicked \\\"legal\\\" system imaginable. South Africa is the only country in the world that proclaims the inequality of its citizens and its laws. I repeat that: South Africa is the only country in the world that proclaims the inequality of its citizens and its laws. The fact that South Africa has managed to defy the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the decisions of the Security Council has led us to believe that that defiance is the result of the strong economic ties that exist between South Africa and parts of the Western world, whose citizens and corporations are benefiting by trade and economic transactions.\n158.\tThe inhuman actions of the Government of South Africa have aroused the feelings of nearly every country in the world in a manner unknown to exist towards any other people or any other regime. World \u2022 opposition to the tyranny of apartheid has probably expressed itself most effectively in the field of sport. It is certainly within sport that the international campaign against white supremacy in South Africa has recently met with the most dramatic series of successes. Gradually but relentlessly, South Africa's racialist sports structure has been forced into isolation as one by one its white sports teams have been thrown out of international sports organizations of the world. It is significant that in the process public opinion has been focused not merely on apartheid in sport but on apartheid as a whole. The white South Africans obviously consider it important to see their teams accepted on the sports fields of the world in competition with countries theoretically hostile to apartheid. And that is why international opposition to apartheid in sport has had such a devastating impact on South Africa.\n159.\tWe appeal to the nations of the world to continue pressure against the inclusion of racist South Africa in international sport. That is a particularly sensitive nerve within South Africans. The special role of sport in South Africa makes it particularly vulnerable to world pressure. There is strong evidence that this pressure is having an important effect in opening up some of the cracks beginning to appear in apartheid. Within South Africa unprecedented calls are now coming from white sportsmen and sports bodies for more integrated sport in opposition to the Government's policies. Those calls may not be based on principled grounds, but at least the flame of non-racialism in sport is beginning to flicker on the horizon. It is as yet tenuous, and if we are to see concrete moves towards non-racialism it is important that world pressure be uncompromisingly maintained. It is equally important that white South Africa's few remaining avenues for sports participation be closed.\n160.\tIf the world is genuine in its expression of horror at the systematic denial of human dignity and freedom to non-whites in South Africa, then it must refuse to play with apartheid. And in the process of refusing to play with apartheid we can build an international consciousness capable of genuinely confronting the apartheid system as a whole.\n161.\tSouth Africa has begun to feel the mounting pressures of the liberation movement, which is constantly gaining strength every single day. In a desperate attempt to counter the effects of the liberation movement, it has embarked on a policy promoting what has popularly come to be known as \\\"dialog\\\" with certain independent African States. It is indeed gratifying to record that at the last OAU summit meeting,  the forces of dialog suffered a resounding defeat by the outright rejection by the OAU of dialog with South African racists. They had hoped to divide Africa, but thanks to the political awareness of Africa they failed dismally.\n162.\tOur position is, and has always been, that if the white racists in South Africa are interested in genuinely discussing the question of self-determination for the black majority, they should do it with the people's representatives inside South Africa. The Prime Minister of South Africa has often stated that the purpose of the so-called dialog with African Heads of State is to tell them how good apartheid is. This would, for all practical purposes and intents, be a monologue as opposed to a dialog.\n163.\tThe sale of arms to South Africa by certain Western countries, particularly the United Kingdom and France, Continues to be a source of great concern to us. We deplore the fact that, despite numerous Security Council resolutions concerning the arms embargo against South Africa, the United Kingdom and France continue to be the largest suppliers of deadly weapons to the racist regime of South Africa. We maintain that no distinction can be drawn between weapons supplied for internal repression and those supplied for external defense. If we were to take to its logical conclusion the argument being used by the suppliers of military hardware to South Africa, that these arms are meant for external defense, it would become clear that Zambia, because of its uncompromising opposition to apartheid and racial discrimination, is the nearest external enemy of South Africa. This means that United Kingdom and French weapons will continue to be used to kill Zambian citizens.\n164.\tWe wish to state that we shall hold these countries responsible in the event of such attack. We reiterate our opposition to the sale of arms to South Africa for the following reasons:\n(a)\tThe sale of arms to South Africa, however limited, has the effect of increasing the intransigence of South Africa.\n(b)\tThe sale of arms to South Africa, be they for so-called naval purposes or otherwise, will enable the apartheid regime to release some of its present military resources for aggression against its independent African neighbors.\n(c)\tThe sale of arms to South Africa will act as a great morale-booster to the abominable policy of apartheid.\n(d)\tThe sale of arms to South Africa will enable it to get more and more involved in fighting Portugal's colonial wars in Angola and Mozambique.\n(e) It will make it impossible for the United Nations to establish its authority in Namibia.\n(f)\tIt will automatically drive the final nail into the coffin of majority rule.\n(g)\tIt will put the arms-suppliers in direct confrontation with independent Africa.\n(h)\tAnd above all, the arms will be used to suppress the liberation movements in South Africa.\n165.\tIn a world where the boundaries of race and poverty coincide so directly, the non-white world is increasingly likely to determine its attitude to white Western countries on the basis of their record in matters of race and colour. The greatest long-term threat which southern Africa poses to world stability is the possibility that freedom-fighters will one day be near success only to have the West intervene on the side of the white minority. My President, Dr. Kenneth Kaunda, warned about the real possibility of racial war in southern Africa as far back as 1966. It is not the liberation movement which seeks a racial war; it is the white rulers and their supporters, who are represented here in the United Nations, who will bring about a bitter racial conflict because of their continued denial of even the most elementary political and human rights to the majority of the people in South Africa. The African liberation struggle is not a narrow, racial struggle, but one intended to bring about a democratic South Africa in which all the people of South Africa will be able to live in harmony, free of racial superiority, free of apartheid. It is in our interest as members of the human race to fight for the fulfillment of that goal.\n166.\tNamibia is after Territory requiring the special attention of the United Nations. On 21 June 1971 the International Court of Justice delivered a very important advisory opinion on the status of Namibia.  The Court confirmed in no uncertain terms what we have always believed since 1966, that South Africa has no locus standi to administer Namibia. Namibia has the dubious distinction of being the oldest unresolved colonial problem on the agenda of the United Nations. Following this advisory opinion of the Court, we now expect the Security Council to adopt measures that will compel South Africa to relinquish its illegal occupation of Namibia. The current Chairman of the Assembly of the Organization of African Unity, Moktar Ould Daddah, President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, has already addressed the Security Council at its 1583rd meeting on this all-important question on behalf of the African continent, and we fully support the proposals he outlined.\n167.\tThe restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is still a matter of top priority. We hope that the United Nations will this year restore those rights and pay the debt of injustice which has been inflicted upon the people of China for more than 21 years. There is only one China, and for this reason, we shall oppose most energetically any attempts by the United States and its allies to introduce a two-China policy in the United Nations under the guise of so-called dual representation. We submit that the United States procedural draft resolution seeking to classify the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China as an important question [AjL.632] is a remarkably shameless maneuver designed further to postpone the participation of China in the work of our Organization. We wish to give notice that, should the United States and its allies succeed in classifying the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China as an important question, then we shall move that the other United States draft resolution [A/L.633] which seeks to seat two delegations from one country be classified as an important question because it would create a new precedent of far-reaching proportions. The United States \\\"two-China\\\" draft resolution does not reflect the realities of the situation in the world today.\n168.\tThe Middle East continues to preoccupy our minds. We are . disappointed that, despite the tireless efforts of Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, the Secretary-General's Special Representative, no progress has been made to resolve this long-standing problem. We welcome the initiative of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, aimed at contributing to a resolution of that conflict. May we express the hope that the mission of African heads of State that is due to visit both the Arab Republic of Egypt and Israel will yield positive results? We continue to believe\n6 Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970). Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 16.\nthat the best chances for a settlement of this problem can be found in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Our delegation will have more to say about this when the Middle East comes up for debate in the plenary Assembly.\n169.\tOne of the world's super-Powers, the United States of America, continues to fight one of the smallest nations in South-East Asia, Viet-Nam, in a war of attrition which it cannot win. It is regrettable to note that this war has now extended to Laos and Cambodia. The Viet-Nam peace talks in Paris have been at an impasse for a long time now, but we believe that the latest seven-point plan, presented by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam, provides the best opportunity for a just solution of this cruel war which has cost so many lives. The road to peace in Viet-Nam is the complete withdrawal of United States and other foreign troops to enable the Viet-Namese people to determine their own destiny.\n170.\tThe presence of United States troops in South Korea presents by far the greatest obstacle to the peaceful unification of Korea. We call for the immediate withdrawal of all United States troops in order to allow the Korean people to work out their own peace terms. The United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea has long outlived its usefulness and must be dissolved forthwith.\n171.\tThe problem of millions of refugees in India has presented the world with a humanitarian problem of immense magnitude. That problem is not only a problem for India, which has to shoulder the enormous burden of looking after them, but a problem also for the international community as a whole. In recognition of our own responsibility as members of the human family, we have made a modest financial contribution through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help alleviate this great human tragedy. It is our hope that a solution will be found to this problem.\n172.\tThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains one of the biggest problems of our time. If the arms race is to be arrested, there is need to convene a world disarmament conference at which all nuclear Powers should be invited to participate without any preconditions. We believe that such a conference would contribute significantly to international peace and security. Our goal must remain general and complete disarmament,.not just one-sided measures, like the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXXII), annex], which are intended to maintain the status quo.\n173.\tIt is important that the program for the Second United Nations Development Decade, which was adopted during the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, be implemented. It is therefore necessary that the reservations which were entered by the developed countries  be withdrawn in order to help the developing countries achieve a higher degree of accelerated growth. My delegation therefore welcomes the forthcoming third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], to be held in Santiago, Chile, in 1972. We hope that the General Assembly will provide the third session of UNCTAD with practical guidelines aimed at restructuring the world economic order. We further welcome the forthcoming meeting of the Group of 77, which is due to meet in Lima, Peru, next month. We are confident that it will constitute an important milestone in the evolution of international co-operation for development.\n174.\tThe role of the non-aligned countries in trying to strengthen the United Nations is praiseworthy. The co-operation among non-aligned countries which was amply demonstrated on a variety of world issues during the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly contributed in no small measure to the adoption of many important resolutions. We fire confident that this co-operation will bear more fruit during the current session of the General Assembly.\n175.\tIn conclusion, I should like once again to emphasize our firm conviction in the principles of the United Nations Charter. We reiterate our belief in the equality and the sovereignty of all States, as well as the right of self- determination and equality of all men, regardless of race, color, sex, language or religion. We believe that unless all nations of the world respect those important principles the peace and the security of the world will be permanently threatened. We on our part pledge our fullest co-operation in the pursuit of those noble objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "80.\t I have the honor of setting forth the position of the Government of Uruguay as the work of this session begins, a session of such crucial importance for the future of the Organization.\n81.\tThe idea has emerged that this Assembly will be known as the Assembly of universality. The movement to achieve universality in the United Nations has of late gained considerable momentum. We are eager to give it our support in an effort to ensure lasting peace and active coexistence among all peoples of the world.\n82.\tThe resistance born of rigidly antagonistic positions is giving way to understanding and willingness to engage in dialog.\n83.\tPlans involving disarmament, especially nuclear disarmament, that a year ago appeared impossible are today emerging as positive solutions assuring peace and guaranteeing the future of civilization. Progress in world solidarity and advances made in scientific discovery have turned the entire earth into a single territory for development.\n84.\tMay I, at the beginning of my statement, offer my greetings to the President of the General Assembly, who was chosen by a consensus of the States Members of our Organization. He thus guarantees that there will be fairness and justice, in view of his career as a statesman and his many activities as representative of the Government of Indonesia in the international arena in recent years.\n85.\tMay I also add our greetings to the outgoing President, Mr. Hambro, who conducted the work of the Assembly during its twenty-fifth session with such great ability, giving further proof of his devotion to the cause of the United Nations.\n86.\tThis historic Assembly coincides with the tenth anniversary of the distinguished SecretaryGeneralship of U Thant. We should not spare any effort to dissuade this citizen of the world from his intention to renounce his lofty post in the United Nations; but in any case, the time has come to pay a great tribute to so devout a servant of the international community. His name has already found its place among those of the great figures who have fashioned the new image of the world in which we live, thanks to his tireless efforts for peace and his ideas that have always served as an inspiration to those seeking to bring about a world in which friendship and international cooperation reign supreme.\n87.\tThe report of the SecretaryGeneral to this Assembly OR the work of the Organization [AI8401 and Add.l] contains a comprehensive treatment of the problems before us. It is an expression of his calm and selfless determination to serve the cause of the United Nations. Perhaps the best tribute which, on this occasion, we could pay to our SecretaryCenerai would be to recommend that the Assembly study the text of his message, which summarizes with lucidity and courage the difficulties at present being encountered by our Organization, and which states the courses of action which may be adopted to save our Organization from its own ruin.\n88.\tIt is our desire that these proposals and considerations by the SecretaryGeneral should be considered by a group of experts appointed for the purpose, with a view to producing recommendations or draft resolutions for the General Assembly.\n89.\tEvery year we assess the achievements which we have to our credit and lay down new goals for the international community in a dynamic process which can never come to an end, since to come to an end would mean to stand still. As we achieve the goals and objectives which have inspired us, new prospects loom on our horizon obliging us to redouble our efforts towards still more fruitful and positive achievements in the history of mankind.\n90.\tWe cannot fail to recognize some of the major contributions which our Organization has made and which have led to permanent and concrete benefits for our countries in the economic, social, cultural, scientific and practically all other areas.\n91.\tAt the present time, as nations develop at an accelerating rate, the United Nations has been the dominant force in promoting decolonization. I would make so bold as to say that decolonization is one of its greatest achievements, making it possible for States representing many cultures to attain independence and to participate collectively in our work fbr peace and the well being of mankind.\n92.\tThe task of decolonization cannot now come to an end; a second stage must begin. All peoples now fully share in the benefits of progress which have been brought about by new political, ideological and technological values and by full access to world markets, and we are now all working for the greater well being of all mankind. Nevertheless, we must continue to work harder to eliminate the deficiencies which beset us. Our faith in the international community is not diminished because of the magnitude of the deficiencies which still remain. Our faith should serve to encourage us to abolish the shortcomings which we have noted.\n93.\tWe have always said that the best approach is to act in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations* whose objectives have to a large extent remained unattained.\n94.\tOn many occasions we have declared that even some achievements which seem to be desirable will not have a decisive effect if they are not attained in accordance with the principles of the Charter. We believe that the fate of the Organization depends on our acting in accordance with these principles. Our Organization has at times been reduced to the position of a mere observer of the great problems of our time, and this may have been due to lack of determination or of faith on the part of some of its Members when they have refused to submit the conflicts and problems which have arisen to the procedures provided for peaceful settlement.\n95.\tThe spectacle of the International Court of Justice, which we have endowed with prestigious machinery for solving international problems, remaining immobile is a sorry demonstration of this lack of faith which I have denounced. When we signed the Charter of the Organization in 1945 we said that effective universal order was impossible without a permanent and binding system of justice. We continue to emphasize this point, which this year is particularly relevant because we have an item on our agenda instructing us to consider the possible expansion of the tasks of the International Court of Justice.\n96.\tFrom the very outset Uruguay unreservedly accepted the binding jurisdiction of the Court, and we shall continue to promote the idea of submitting the largest possible number of international disputes and questions to our highest tribunal of justice for settlement. Peace is the fruit of justice, as the Scriptures say. There is a link between justice and peace, on which the destiny of mankind possibly depends. There can be no justice without peace; there can be no peace without justice. This idea ha% been the basis of the thinking of the Holy See in its preparations for the world Day of Peace in 1972. If we desire peace we must work for justice in order to bring about a better distribution of property, and we must adopt an open minded attitude to social justice and eliminate unfair or artificial differences which have been created to divide and subjugate men and communities who suffer from hunger and poverty. If this is not done, if we do not resolve this terrible problem, we shall continue to live in a false peace and also with a false justice.\n97.\tWe are concerned about the difficulties being encountered by the Security Council as it endeavors to discharge its responsibilities. The report of the SecretaryGeneral states that, as we endeavor to establish a system of collective security, we find instead collective impotence.\n98.\tIn the efforts to strengthen the action of the Security Council, a few initiatives meet with our complete approval and could be considered. In order to eliminate the inertia of the Council, changes in its procedures have been proposed which would strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in the area of international peace and security. On 3 April 1970 the Government of Brazil submitted a proposal for the creation of ad hoc committees dependent on the Security Council, for the peaceful settlement of the disputes brought before that body [see A/7922], Although the proposal of Brazil was coolly received by some Powers, nevertheless it did receive the support of others which are in favor of the Security Council's appointing fact-finding groups or groups of inquiry with regard to disputes submitted to the Security Council.\n99.\tThe conflicts which continue in the Middle East and in the Far East, the problems which beset millions of displaced persons in the eastern area of Pakistan and also the distressing events which have occurred in certain parts of the African continent cannot fail to be a source of concern to us, and we would appeal for a solution to these problems within the only propitious framework that exists the United Nations.\n100.\tOur land has been in the past and continues to be a refuge for millions of emigrants who now form a vital part of our society. Together in our country, men from various races have managed to reconcile their differences and overcome them and have been able to bring about a nation with ideological and spiritual unity.\n101.\tArab, Jewish, Armenian and other racial communities have all come together to raise their collective voice in this international body. We have repeatedly reflected their concern in the abiding conviction that we are discharging a moral responsibility which cannot be overlooked, in the confidence that we shall receive a calm and balanced response from the Members of this Organization.\n102.\tThe most important item before the present session of the Assembly in our efforts to achieve universality is unquestionably that concerning the plans to facilitate the admission of the People's Republic of China. Due consideration would thereby be given to a large sector of the population of the world. We trust that political and juridical interests will be reconciled and that there will then be a realistic consideration of the situation, for a concerted solution is required which will bring about the coexistence which only very recently seemed impossible.\n103.\tAs regards the various proposals which have arisen, we would add that we are opposed to the exclusion of the Republic of China, for it is a country which has not violated any of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations requirement of Article 6 of the Charter for justifying expulsion.\n104.\tWe should like to make special reference to the question of human rights, the affirmation of which remains incomplete. Our world is a sorry spectacle of millions of human beings deprived of the most fundamental economic, social and political rights. Just as every nation has the inalienable right to independence and to the choice of its own destiny without any foreign interference, so every individual has the right to dignity and to the fruits of his own labor. In this Organization there has emerged the idea of international protection of human rights. We have created a whole range of instruments of lofty inspiration based on the principles of our Charter and in particular on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These principles have been reaffirmed in various international conventions for the protection of these rights.\n105.\tMere formulation of these principles is not enough to ensure their proper implementation. It is not enough only to have a Declaration and a few conventions establishing norms. It would be preferable to have fewer norms but greater respect for the principles.\n106.\tWe have tried to identify the causes of this crisis. We should like to suggest some remedy. We continue to defend the idea of establishing the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who would be able to work actively with Governments for the implementation of commitments. The High Commissioner would be able to give swift attention to the needs of our time whenever human rights are violated without undue interference,, or hesitation. If we have problems in respect of refugees in Pakistan, perhaps we should have a High Commissioner for Human Rights who could consider the matter and report to the United Nations.\n107.\tWe should also help young people to participate in social and economic development, in the promotion of peace and international cooperation and in the protection of human rights. They must be given the proper ways and means to carry out their obligations in the national and international arenas. These are rights they have demanded. I think we should promote active participation on the part of young people in ail matters and in all bodies where the United Nations lays down development plans. They should be assigned a role in the execution of those plans, especially those which have implications for the social, economic,\nscientific and technological future of our world. *\n108.\tI should like, briefly, to acquaint this Assembly with the great interest that my country has long had in the efforts of the United Nations and its competent bodies to bring about solutions with regard to environmental factors which sustain life, in view of the deterioration that has been brought about in the environment by scientific and technological progress which poses a threat to the future of mankind.\n109.\tIt is my firm conviction that our civilization will successfully pass this crossroad. Hie distressing picture which is before us is the product of development . It is very possible, in accordance with recent scientific findings, that development itself is, through its unforeseeable advances, quite capable of correcting its effects which are adverse to the welfare of mankind.\n110.\tThe subject of the international regime for the exploration and exploitation of the seabed and ocean floor\n' certainly, among the various items before this General Assembly, deserves special consideration. On a number of occasions there have been appeals that our work in this area be expedited in view of the scientific and technological progress which has been made in the exploration and exploitation of the seabed and ocean floor, and in view of the fact that it is quite definite that even greater progress will be made in the future. It is therefore especially urgent that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the SeaBed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction discharge its mission and prepare for the creation of institutions and legal norms to govern the new realities which have arisen from such progress, and that it regulate international relations in keeping with these realities and in accordance with the principles of reason and justice.\n111.\tThe world production of underwater minerals in particular petroleum, gas, coal, sulfur, iron ore and manganese nodules has already reached considerable proportions. Geological data prompt one to believe also that underwater petroleum resources will prove to exist in greater quantity than continental resources, and that the value of world production of petroleum from the seabed will exceed that from other resources of the sea.\n112.\tIt should be encouraging and comforting, in looking after the interests of present and future generations, to know that underwater resources will be available in far greater quantity and that the groundwork has already been laid for a regime to govern and control them in keeping with a new revolutionary spirit in international relations.\n113.\tThe new law which has come into being from these realities and the economic importance for our people of the exploration and exploitation of the seabed has also led certain Latin American States, like Uruguay, to take a very firm position in favor of the authority of the coastal States to establish the extension of their junMction, although it\nshould be limited to a reasonable distance, taking geographical and biological factors into account.\n114.\tThe principles underlying this doctrine and its progressive development are quite in accordance with the principles of modern international law. The objectives are economic and social, for the peoples of these countries would stand to benefit from preserving and developing the resources of the sea. The so-called 200 mile doctrine is already finding universal expression and it may well be recognized in the work of the seabed Committee of this Assembly, which is preparing for the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea. We are confident that the restrained attitude of our countries, which wish to demonstrate their interest harmonizing the legitimate defense of significant factors which seriously affect their economies with the traditional freedoms of the seas, will be appreciated by the countries which still at times hold to rigid positions which are not in keeping with the dynamic spirit of our times.\n115.\tIn the area of economic relations, once again we have seen profound changes in world politics. With some delay, unfortunately, we have for the first time seen recognition being given to the fact that the principle of the most favored-nation clause, applied unequally, leads only to a consolidation of the international status quo, where the less developed countries are dependent on those who have achieved a higher degree of economic, scientific and technological development.\n116.\tThe international community, aware of the new realities in this area, began in 1964, at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to study formulas designed to bring about a fairer international distribution of labor. Finally, last year, after long years of negotiation, approval was given to a generalized scheme of nonreciprocal preferences for the developing countries  and this constituted the first positive step taken by the international community towards the objectives laid down for the Second United Nations Development Decade. Let us not forget that the overwhelming majority of the world lives in the developing countries. We must not take any backward steps now if we wish to act in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.\n117.\tThe international economic situation has been affected by policies which seriously jeopardize commitments recently entered into. The action taken by the Government of the United States to bring about some balance in its economic position with other industrialized countries is only another application of the principle of nondiscrimination among unequals, and we have found that this is an improper means of regulating economic relations among countries of different degrees of development.\n118.\tThe countries of Latin America at Panama recently declared that it is unfair to have to bear the consequences of action to correct the deficit in the balance of payments of the United States, in view of the fact that the developing countries are not responsible for this deficit.\n119.\tWe do not wish to level any criticism or recriminations against sister nations whose undisputed international role we recognize and very much admire. They have made an immense effort to help the world develop, as we have recently seen. But we do wish to say that the logical arguments, accepted by the international community, in favor of putting into effect the generalized scheme of preferences in favor of the developing countries, clearly a departure from the most favored-nation principle, are equally valid when restrictive measures are being applied to their possibilities of economic development.\n120.\tAlthough we understand the difficulties encountered by the Government of the United States at this crucial moment, we are confident that systematic and constant dialog and consultations through multilateral negotiation machinery will make it possible for us to achieve a satisfactory settlement in this situation which, in the present circumstances, so seriously affects the developing countries.\n121.\tWe place our trust in these consultations; we place our trust in this dialog, in consultations and in understanding among men.\n122.\tThe 10 per cent surcharge by the United States on exports from developing countries affects these countries much more than it does the highly-developed industrialized countries and it is, indeed, a real blow to them and has obstructed their economic development and the economic development of certain regions of the world, such as Latin America,\n123.\tIn the monetary area, we are also going through a period of acute crisis. We have noted the upsets and friction produced by a monetary system which is out of step with present-day realities. We can affirm that the decade of the 60s was characterized by a constant search for temporary solutions to problems and shortcomings in an international monetary system which was laid down in Bretton Woods to meet the needs of the postwar period. But this system has for some time sot. been fully relevant.\n124.\tAt the present time we do not wish to delve into th<* technical aspects of a possible solution to the problem; but we would like to stress the fact that any measure for meeting the present inadequacies of the system should be adopted after consultations and the approval of all the members of the International Monetary Fund. In view of the present weaknesses of the developing countries, they should unite their efforts at the regional level and so attempt to strengthen their negotiating power and to have a positive effect on the decision which will eventually be adopted.\n125.\tAnother matter about which something must be done at this time of distressing social problems is the prevention and repression of certain forms of international crime. In a note presented to the Commission for Social Development at its twenty-second session in March 1971, the SecretaryGeneral stated:\n\\\"Crime problems facing the world today indicate clearly the need to intensify national and international action to obtain a more adequate understanding of the forces involved and a more effective set of solutions than are now at hand. In this endeavor, the leadership role of the United Nations is well established and extends back to the earliest days of the Organization.\n\\\"It is quite apparent that, internationally, too little energy and too few resources are as yet being devoted to the elucidation of a problem which is now recognized.as being of major importance to the future of society and to the humanitarian ideals which inspire the United Nations.\\\" \n126.\tThe Fourth United Nations Conference on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, which was held in Japan in August 1970, adopted a declaration calling on all Governments to adopt effective action for the coordination and intensification of their efforts to prevent crime and urged the United Nations and other international organizations to give priority to the strengthening of international cooperation ii> the prevention of crime.\n127.\tWithin these guidelines, the General Assembly, in resolution 2645 (XXV) considered that the hijacking of planes and civil aircraft was a form of international crime. In accordance with this resolution, a conference was held at The Hague in December of last year and adopted a Convention on the subject,  which may constitute an effective instrument for international cooperation in the prevention and repression of this form of crime.\n128.\tIn respect of other forms of crime, action has not been as effective. I am referring to acts of terrorism and crimes committed against diplomatic and consular agents and other international civil servants; there has been a certain reluctance to give Mi recognition to this problem and to take the necessary action at the international level. The Organization of American States, at the third special session of its General Assembly, adopted, on 2 February of this year, a convention calling for international cooperation to prevent and punish acts of terrorism, but unfortunately, we have not detected the same interest or concern in the United Nations. For these reasons, and in view of the particularly reprehensible nature of these forms of international crime, which have in fact occurred with increasing frequency in recent times, our delegation will, later on in this session, submit a report and a draft convention on the subject.\n129.\t\tIn addition to the many different forms of social disturbance which have occurred in various countries and have affected a large number of members of the international community, there has been a widespread increase, in violence, crime, thefts and hijackings. My country is now experiencing a unique period in its history in this respect.\n130.\tUruguay has responded to this challenge by using its free democratic institutions, complying with its constitutional norms, electing its leaders at regular intervals\nestablished by the Constitution itself in accordance with free electoral principles, exercising its parliamentary procedures and by giving absolute authority to its high tribunals of justice, which are ready to hear any case regarding violation of the law. The principles we apply are deeply entrenched in our people and we strive to defend and protect the rights of all human beings whom we wish to see free from pain or suffering.\n.131. We do not accept the idea of a revolution against democracy. The present world revolution must be, as the United Nations would have it be, a scientific revolution leading to greater moral and material conquests in the service cf mankind against violence.\n132.\tAs Pacheco Areco, the President of our country, recently stated, there are men who destroy and men who build. There are revolutions leading to death and revolutions which give life.\n133.\tIn combating crime and terrorism, my country has defended life and has fought to improve its standards of living.\n134.\tThis is the tradition of Uruguay, which is sustained by the life force of its sons .\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "145.\tOn behalf of my Government, may I tender to you, Mr. President, our most heartfelt congratulations upon your election to preside over the deliberations of this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I also wish to extendmy warmest greetings to the new Members of the Organization: Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar.\n146.\tThe Republic of Panama is a country that is fully aware of its role and its place in the contemporary world, and as such, when speaking as its representative from this high rostrum, I shall not presume to dictate norms of behavior nor to give any guidelines for the conduct of world affairs. My country admires and respects the great work done by the United Nations for the preservation of peace, for the rapprochement of peoples and the economic\nand social development of the underprivileged in order to ensure respect for human rights and, finally, for the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination and the remaining vestiges of colonialism throughout the world. We also appreciate the limitations and shortcomings of this world Organization which, being a human endeavor, has its failings, although we believe that some are imposed from outside and are not the product of congenital defects, The important thing is that in the face of this reality, the nations of the world, irrespective of their size, should become clearly aware of their collective personality and strengthen it while becoming increasingly more capable of playing a decisive part in the evolution of the international community.\n147.\tThe third world, which can be identified because of the similarity of its problems while struggling for political and economic independence, brought together in Lusaka the representatives of 65 countries and was able to prevail upon th? General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session to adopt the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security on 17 December 1971 by a vote of 121 members in favor, with l against and 1 abstention [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. The United Nations thus firmly endorsed the idea of collective and universal security, without military alliances, for the establishment of peace throughout the world. This significant reply from the countries that are not involved in the cold war among the great Powers indicated a means of ensuring independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity outside the traditional framework of military pacts and subjugation imposed through the force of arms or by economic pressure.\n148.\tHowever, there are still some remnants of the distribution of the world among the great Powers who act without taking into account the legitimate interests of small Powers. Let us speak candidly and confess that the latter take part in the arena of world problems as mere spectators or as actors playing a minor part. However, we are comforted to some degree by the promising move, both national and regional, of self-assertion that has been at play in Latin America in these past years. A new attitude and a very definite resolve is asserting the purpose of the Latin American peoples to overcome traditional frustrations brought about by international dependency and the lack of capacity of local oligarchies to draw up and execute policies designed to promote the economic growth of the Latin American countries while creating conditions for the social well-being of national majorities.\n149.\tA united Latin America, the dream of Bolivar, can become a decisive force in the international community while preserving its cultural identity and making its presence felt, not in order to divide the world, but rather to unite it through links, each of which retains its own personality. It is for that reason that we view with satisfaction certain positive developments in our region, based on coexistence and co-operation quite outside our ideological and political differences.\n150.\tThe solution of the economic and social problems of the peoples of the third world, and particularly of Latin America, will not be achieved through magic or dogmatic formula, but rather lies in planned development as called for by the reform of the traditional structure to bring it into line with the complex demands of contemporary life.\n151.\tThe Republic of Panama aspires to the achievement of that development and to the strengthening of its position in its relations with larger and more powerful countries. Prompted by this purpose, on 11 October 1968, under the leadership of General Omar Torrijos Herrera, we began three yeairs ago to pave the way for national revolution. A true revolution is all important, positive, and cannot be improvised, less still can it be carried out unless the protagonists are the people.\n152.\tThe October movement in my country has deep roots and its only aim is to achieve true justice and responsible freedom for all the citizens of Panama. On the basis of our particular national conditions, we seek to change Panama's reality through our own endeavors and with the co-operation of peoples which have achieved greater progress than our own, while resolutely rejecting any measure that runs counter to our right to self-determination and to make the best possible use of our natural resources, of which the first and foremost is our geographic position in the world.\n153.\tPanama's revolutionary process has assumed the historic responsibility of tackling one of the vital problems of our Republic, a problem that is raised by the special contractual relations which bind Panama and the United States of America and which stem from the existence and operation of the Canal on Panamanian territory.\n154.\tFollowing instructions from my Government, on 4 October 1971,1 addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations a document giving a detailed account of the background and permanent aspirations of the people of Panama for the current negotiations of a new treaty on the Canal between the Governments of Panama and the United States of America. I have requested the Secretary-General to have that statement made known to all Member States, since it is our belief that the problem of the Panama Canal affects not only the two nations that built it, but, rather, is of concern to all the others by virtue of the international character and function of the Canal. We believe that we are complying with the duty of solidarity and coexistence when we inform the Assembly of Panama's aspirations, in order that we may achieve a just and equitable agreement that will govern the operation of the Canal in the future. This attests to the fact that we are consistent in our adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, to solidarity, co-operation and peaceful coexistence among all States, as stated by the President of Panama. Mr. Demetrio Lakas, a- the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [1875th meeting]. We do so because we trust that, in a spirit of equity and harmony, relations that are more consonant with the new international morality between a small country and a great Power will be concluded, thus enabling my country to free itself of the aforementioned treaty which offends the feelings and dignity of the people of Panama.\n155.\tIn 1903, the treaty that gave rise to the building of the Canal between the two oceans was imposed on Panama, a treaty that is prejudicial to my country in almost all its provisions, a treaty that affects the essence of the Panamanian nation, and which has brought untold and unjustifiable suffering to the people of Panama. That treaty links us for ever to a situation that is now intolerable, since, as a result thereof, one of the parties increased its economic and military power and hegemony a4 a world Power, whereas the other saw its status as a sovereign and independent State diminished. By virtue of that treaty, an extraneous body called the \\\"Canal Zone\\\" was grafted on to the heart of our Republic and it has subsisted as an entity alien to Panamanian sovereignty and jurisdiction, having its own Government, its own laws, dictated from abroad. This was a de facto situation imposed on Panama.\n156.\tMy country hopes that the current negotiations will lead to the conclusion of a new, just and equitable agreement that will eliminate the causes of conflict between the two countries, and which, by abrogating the 1903 Treaty, and consequently the onerous perpetuity clause, will ensure that the Republic of Panama fully recovers its jurisdiction over the present Canal Zone, which is an inalienable part of its territory. Panama, in due time, will inform the Assembly of the outcome of those negotiations.\n157.\tThe United Nations must become truly universal, and to this end all States, regardless of their size or ideological or geographic position, provided they are sovereign, must have permanent representation in this Organization.\n158.\tIn the most dramatic case which the General Assembly must face this year, the possible entry of the People's Republic of China into this Organization, the small countries cannot fail to remember with bitterness the recent past, in which, manipulated by the unjust domino theory, we were moved, like mere pawns, in the game of world politics. We ca. not fail to feel a certain amount of frustration at seeing that, apparently, there are those who still seek to treat us as such. The small countries are still excluded from contributing to the solution of many important questions. We always knew because we were not blind that the People's Republic of China has a population of over 700 million inhabitants whose existence cannot be disregarded by a world Organization. Can we only now say this when it has become commonplace? We are convinced that the presence of the People's Republic of China in this Organization would contribute to the strengthening of world peace.\n159.\tOur relations with the nations of the world, to whose representatives I tender my sincere and heartfelt greetings, is conceived by us in the context of two pluralisms in which the right of each people freely to establish its own internal regime is not an illusion but a fact.\n160.\tWe reiterate our solidarity with all peoples that are struggling against the remnants and vestiges of colonialism, and who, as we have always done, express their repudiation of all forms of racial discrimination.\n161.\tIt is the irrevocable objective of our policy of defense of our natural resources to claim national jurisdiction over the whole of our territory up to 200 miles of territorial sea and continental shelf. In the new international order of the seas which will emerge from the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea to be held by the United Nations, Panama will maintain unchanged these principles of maritime sovereignty, which are not subject to negotiation.\n162.\tWe greatly deplore learning of the decision by the Secretary-General, U Thant, to abandon the high office to which he was elected at a crucial moment for the Organization and a decisive moment for the state of mankind. He has worked in an irreproachable and fruitful manner. The Organization today has a truly universal and positive personality and functions as such. His efforts, his intelligence and his moral conduct provide an example to the Governments and administrations of nations and a reason for pride for the human race. We sincerely thank the Secretary-General for the kindness with which he so courteously received our permanent delegation, and may we express our sincere wishes for his happiness and peace which, no doubt, he must be sure of, because he has done his duty.\n163.\tIf we can help in any way towards the development and progress of the peoples of the world, peaceful coexistence among peoples, we will always be found in the forefront of such enterprises, for the achievement of which, we offer the United Nations guarantees of free transit and the neutrality of our Canal.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "82.\tMr. President, at the outset, I wish to congratulate you whole-heartedly, on your election as President of the General Assembly, the most esteemed and highest international post. Our congratulations do not stem from the usual courtesy extended on such occasions; they emanate from the cordial and friendly relations that have existed and do exist between the people of Afghanistan and the people of Indonesia. But it is not only that. We are convinced that your ability and personal experience in international affairs give us solid ground to hope that this session of the General Assembly, under your guidance, will lead us to the achievement of the great task we have set before us.\n83.\tI should like to extend my delegation's sincere appreciation to Ambassador Edvard Hambro for the excellent manner in which he guided the affairs of the Assembly during his tenure as President.\n84.\tMr. President, with your permission, I should like to join the voices of those who have expressed their appreciation of the services of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, who has undertaken and carried out the tremendous responsibilities of his high office with patience, wisdom and consideration, and above all, with a great sense of impartiality and objectivity.\n85.\tThe Government I represent has recently assumed office. It is therefore necessary for me to state our profound desire and determination to continue, as in the past, to uphold our firm belief in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n86.\tAfghanistan is the oldest non-aligned Member of the United Nations. I should like to state that we shall continue our positive and active policy of non-alignment within and\noutside the United Nations, based on our free judgment of all international situations on the basis of their merits. This has been one of the prime reasons for our fundamental interest and participation in all gatherings of the non- aligned countries. We believe that the policy of non-alignment and the principles adopted by the different Conferences of the non-aligned nations of the world, particularly those principles embodied in the Declaration on Peace, Independence, Development, Co-operation and Democratization of Internal Relations adopted by the last Conference of the non-aligned nations in Lusaka,  have made a significant contribution to the noble cause of world peace and international security.\n87.\tIn the world of today all people are neighbors. Therefore, the greatest need for us all is to adhere to the spirit of neighborliness, goodwill, peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, regardless of differences in ideologies and social, political and economic systems, chosen freely by each one of us.\n88.\tIn the world of today it is no longer thinkable that one system could eliminate another system without the total annihilation of all. To believe that it is possible not to coexist with each other peacefully is an illusion close to madness. We can have only one common goal: the achievement of peace and progress. This one common goal is necessary not only for achieving peace but also for preventing a disturbance of the balances, which can destroy peace,\n89.\tEurope seems to be directing itself towards some kind of understanding. We welcome this trend, if it will open the horizon of peace for all mankind, because it is the interest of mankind in general, rather than the interest of the West or the East, to which all of us attach crucial importance.\n90.\tThe continent of Africa, whose people have always proved to be peaceful inhabitants of the world, and the Latin American continent, whose people, except in defense of their independence, have never waged wars, are faced with diverse problems. It is essential that the United Nations should, to the extent it can, take measures to save those continents from the calamities from which other continents Asia and Europe-have suffered. This calls for only positive steps. Of course, the people of those continents are better aware of their problems and of how to deal with them, and their representatives will speak on the subject during the general debate. I myself coming from the Asian continent, would ask you, Mr. President, to allow me to speak of the situations prevailing in the continent of Asia, situations which are, in fact, world problems.\n91.\tThe question of the Middle East is not a local problem. It is an international problem and, therefore, one of international concern. It is very unfortunate that, despite their full awareness of the gravity of the problem, some nations have paid scant attention not only to the situation in the Middle East itself, but also, although Members of the United Nations, to United Nations resolutions and have exerted little effort to implement their own decisions.\nDespite the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, little effort has been made to make the usurper realize that, in our time, territories cannot remain occupied by right of conquest. We see with great distress that portions of the lands of three Member States of the United Nations Egypt, Syria and Jordan are still kept under occupation, and more than that, that this situation has been tolerated. While we deplore the refusal of Israel to comply with the simplest dictates of international law and justice, I think the deep appreciation of the world Organization is due to the political patience of the Arab States, particularly of the Government of Egypt, which has almost exhausted all possibilities of co-operation for the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations and for the success of the efforts made on its behalf to bring durable peace to the Middle East.\n92.\tAfghanistan's concern is not limited only to the consequences of aggression against the Arabs and the continuation of injustices on the part of the Israelis towards certain Arab States. We are basically concerned with the consequences of aggression itself, by any nation against any other nation in the world.\n93.\tAfghanistan, in the course of its own history, has experienced the oppression of aggressors and has suffered the injury of occupation of its territory by force; it is well aware of what it means to have parts of its land annexed. I think I am not the only representative who can recall such experiences related to his own country.\n94.\tWe call upon all Member States, therefore, to consider the question of aggression and the \\\"right\\\" of any country to occupy another country's territory by conquest. We are not thinking only about the Arabs when we ask the question: how can any country occupied by military force be expected not to resort to war to liberate its people and its territory? I should like to ask this august Assembly whether there is any large or small country among us that would not defend its homeland against occupation?\n95.\tTherefore, any nation that might be unwilling to understand and defend the established rights of the Arabs against the aggressive policy of occupation and annexation is forfeiting its own right of defense against such policies and actions.\n96.\tOn the other hand, however, there is the attitude of certain big Powers that have not succeeded in implementing the measures they have approved. We can, therefore, demand from this august Assembly not only the implementation of what the Security Council has approved in the case of the Middle East, but what is more, the reaffirmation of the principles of international law in accordance with which acquisition by force is inadmissible.\n97.\tMy Government asks the world Organization, and expects from it, urgent and effective measures to find a solution based on justice and the full restoration of the rights of the Arab people.\n98.\tIt is indeed fitting to pause here for a moment to remind ourselves of a nation whose fate and territory were, in the present century, subjected in a most overt manner to ruthless aggression. The peaceful people of Palestine were\ndriven from their homes and land while the world helplessly watched this injustice being done. Until now, all efforts to restore their rights have failed. Even those minimum rights which were recognized by the United Nations resolutions were not restored to them. We ask this great Assembly, which not only represents the peoples of the world but which should also reflect the international conscience, to exercise all the power at its command so that the rights of the people of Palestine will be fully restored and recovered from those who usurped them against the principles of law, justice and humanity.\n99.\tThe problem of Jerusalem is of great concern not only to the Moslems, Christians and Jews of the world, but to all those who genuinely believe in the preservation of the cultures of mankind and the assurance of respect for all holy shrines and historical monuments. We condemn all measures which, in total disregard of international rules of morality and law and United Nations resolutions, are taken with a view to distorting the Arab, Moslem and Christian character of the Holy City. We cannot allow any change in the character of the city of Jerusalem. The city should be kept intact until control of it is restored to its lawful inhabitants.\n100.\tAllow me to turn to another Asian question: the question of Viet-Nam. Though not formally on the agenda of the United Nations, this question is nevertheless on the conscience of all mankind. A hot war has been in progress and the United Nations as an Organization of peace has been given no role but that of a helpless spectator. We are aware of the fact that the consequences of such developments are part of the primary responsibilities of big Powers. Meanwhile, for many different reasons it is not possible for small countries to remain unconcerned. Afghanistan, as an Asian country and a member of the international community, wishes to draw the attention of the world to the urgent need for the cessation of hostilities in Viet-Nam.\n101.\tThe miseries of Asia do not end here. There are certain recent developments which are of concern not only to the Asians, but a' o to the rest of the world. There has been a civil war in Pakistan. Civil war for any country is painfully destructive. Afghanistan is particularly distressed when it sees that this civil war is happening to a nation with which we have brotherly relations and for which we have deep sympathy, a sympathy we retain despite the political differences we have with the Government of Pakistan over the question of Pakistan. if the tense situation between Pakistan and India is not returned to normal, the whole continent of Asia will suffer as a result of existing circumstances.\n102.\tFor averting the dangers of the present situation we have to place our hopes in the wisdom of Pakistan and India, which wisdom should make it possible to resolve the plight of the refugees in a spirit of co-operation between the two countries and with international co-operation based on humanitarian principles. It is our ardent wish that conditions will soon be created to enable the Pakistani refugees to return to their country in full confidence of their safety.\n103.\tAt this session we expect the United Nations to terminate a long-standing and well-known injustice or\nwith respect to the legitimate right of the People's Republic of China to representation in the United Nations and all its organs. The fallacy of that injustice has been proved by the fact that all sectors of world public opinion now appreciate the realities.\n104.\tAfghanistan, as a neighbor of China, was one of the first countries to recognize the patent reality of the representation of the whole China by the Government of the People's Republic of China; it has supported and will always support the restoration of the rights of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate Government of all China in all international organizations.\n105.\tAfghanistan, in the continent of Asia, was the first country to stand up against colonialism, defending ant- safeguarding its own independence. It is quite natural, therefore, that our congratulations to the new Members of the United Nations should be most sincere and heartfelt. We are confident that the representatives of Bhutan, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman will convey the sincere sentiments of the people and Government of Afghanistan to their peoples and Governments.\n106.\tThe experience of Afghanistan in bloody conflicts with colonialists has been extremely bitter. The fact that some countries have achieved their independence without bloodshed is a source of pleasure for us, knowing that all this has taken place through the efforts of the United Nations and realizing that, without the existence of the United Nations, this would not have been possible. We owe our gratitude to the United Nations. But still there remains one painful fact that we cannot ignore: that is that all peoples and nations struggling for independence have not yet achieved their goal. Afghanistan, therefore, would demand more effective efforts by the United Nations in this field.\n107.\tAfghanistan has been a member of the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and both there and in the General Assembly has always defended the rights of the dependent peoples to self-determination and independence. We have always supported the struggle of the majority of the people of Southern Rhodesia, and the peoples of Namibia, Angola, Mozambique and other territories still under Portuguese domination. In the same manner, we have and will support the cause of independence in all other Non-Self-Governing Territories.\n108.\tBecause of-our staunch and continuous support for the right of peoples to self-determination, it is quite natural that we should be concerned about the political aspirations of the people of Pakhtunistan, whether Pakhtunistanis or Baluchis, who, from the historical and ethnical viewpoint were not and can never be a part of the Indian subcontinent and whose territory was severed from their fatherland, Afghanistan, by the naked and brutal military force of a colonial Power. The land now referred to as Pakhtunistan was annexed to the new State of Pakistan in the subcontinent of India without recognition of the right of its people to self-determination, and in spite of the fact that no legal basis existed or exists for such a transfer.\n109.\tThe question of Pakhtunistan is one of special importance to us. The pursuance of this historic cause, the securing of the exercise of the right of those people to self-determination, is a right and an historical obligation of Afghanistan, Since Afghanistan has always hoped that this problem would be peacefully resolved, we have not brought it officially before the United Nations. At this stage I shall therefore go no further into the details of the matter, but I should like to be allowed to emphasize the seriousness of this problem, which is one of the remnants of colonialism.\n110.\tUndoubtedly, the greatest and most important aim of mankind is international peace and security. But real peace and security cannot be attained without securing a relative balance in the field of development. The inequality between the rich and the poor nations, commonly referred to as the \\\"gap\\\", should be filled, as there is no distance between development and peace, which are synonymous in our times.\n111.\tAmong the developing countries there are more unfortunate countries. I therefore deem it necessary to draw the attention of the Assembly to the special case of the land-locked, developing and least developed countries.\n112.\tThe problems of the land-locked and the least developed countries have been the subject of different studies by various organs of the United Nations. The International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)] has recognized the necessity of adopting special measures in their favor. We believe that the time has come to pass from generalities to specifics and to evolve comprehensive and concrete, but separate, action- programs in favor of each of the two above-mentioned groups of countries. These action-programs should be accompanied by a clear expression of the political will necessary for their implementation.\n113.\tAs discussions and deliberations in the recent session of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor Beyond tf i Limits of National Jurisdiction revealed, land-locked developing countries have the right of free access to the sea-bed area, as well as the right of participation in its exploration and exploitation. Their geographical position and degree of economic development entitle them to special treatment. We expect the rights of these countries and their special needs to be taken into full consideration by the Sea-Bed Committee and the future conference on the law of the sea.\n114.\tWhile appreciating the assistance rendered by the developed countries to the developing world, we see that there are bitter facts prevailing in this respect which hamper the pace of progress of those striving for the betterment of their living conditions. This is not the time or place for going into the details of this matter, but it can be predicted, from past economic trends and the implications of the present inflation in Western developed countries, that during the Second United Nations Development Decade the developing countries will be paying out even, more than what they may expect to receive. It is obviously too late to seek any remedy for the past, but it is imperative to keep the past in mind in planning for the future. If this gap is not bridged, the developing countries will be confronted with staggering difficulties. \n115.\tIn the course of history, economic and social inequalities within different societies have led to the disruption of peace within the societies. The present inequalities among nations, if not remedied, will inevitably jeopardize world peace and security. With the development of modem technology and destructive armaments, only one conclusion can be anticipated: namely, that the majority of the people of the world will first become poorer, and then be destroyed. For this reason, a serious consideration of the question of disarmament and of the allocation of the resources so released to the development of the developing countries must be no longer regarded as a dream but recognized as a fundamental purpose of the United Nations.\n116.\tWhat is important to a country like Afghanistan is the fact that a major part of the resources of the developing countries is also spent on armaments. Such expenses are imposed by world circumstances even on non-aligned countries, which do not belong to any military bloc and which have declared their non-alignment solely for the purpose of promoting world peace, international security, and their own development ;.rd progress.\n117.\tHowever, it is clear and also understandable that we cannot expect that disarmament will be achieved outright or that the resources will be released for economic development when most needed. But realism and reason lead us to expect that the developed countries will join in positive and effective efforts in the direction of general and complete disarmament by agreeing not to make more arms. The total expenditure on armaments during one year amounts to $215,000 million. Even the allocation of a portion of that sum to economic development would be a positive and effective contribution to international development,\n118.\tIn speaking of disarmament, may I take this opportunity to welcome the idea of convening a world disarmament conference? We believe that the time is ripe for such an approach to the question of disarmament and security, which undeniably requires a global solution. Needless to say, the participation of the People's Republic of China and other countries whose representatives are not present at the disarmament talks would be extremely important in such a conference.\n119.\tAlthough the pace of progress in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks is very slow, the impression of mutual confidence given by the super-Powers is heartening. It is our hope that that confidence will spread to all countries of the world and give the world a genuine sense of assurance.\n120.\tIt must be known that no understanding or agreement which does not reflect the interests of all nations, even if it is an understanding and agreement between all major Powers, can contribute to the promotion and protection of world peace and international security. It is for this reason that Afghanistan, as a non-aligned and developing country convinced that it can meet the needs of its people only under conditions of peace and security, demands that the rights of the developing countries in the political and economic world of the future be respected and recognized.\n121.\tThe protection and promotion of human rights is a special responsibility of the United Nations. The past years\nhave witnessed serious and more extensive violations of human rights in different parts of the world, as a result of the reluctance on the part of Member States to implement internationally recognized principles, declarations, conventions and covenants. We hope that this session of the Assembly will consider and recommend effective measures in this field.\n122.\tMy delegation, from the very inception of the idea, has supported the creation of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as a first step towards the future development of an international enforcement structure. We believe that the High Commissioner, in carrying out his functions, should give special attention to violations of human rights arising from racial discrimination and from colonial and alien domination.\n123.\tAfghanistan was one of the first two authors of the very first proposal to recognize self-determination as an inalienable right of peoples and nations A This right, and its implementation in the interest of all people under alien domination, remain the corner-stone of all fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [resolution 2200 (XXI), annex].\n124.\tBeing quite aware of the achievement of independence by a great number of countries and the ever- increasing membership of the United Nations, we must not forget that millions of people still live under alien domination. This is a great threat to peace and stability in many areas of the world,\n125.\tNow that the classic form of colonialism is gradually vanishing, it is more important to pay special attention to other, and perhaps more dangerous, forms of domination, including the domination of many Territories and peoples in many parts of the world by alien Powers-especially by those which themselves, not very long ago, were colonies.\n126.\tBoth before and since the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], Afghanistan strongly supported United Nations efforts to put an end to colonialism in all its forms and manifestations an undertaking which we entered into in your own great country, Mr. President.\n127.\tNext comes the intolerable and inhuman question of racial discrimination. Our stand on this is more than well known. We have never failed to condemn apartheid and all forms of racial discrimination as flagrant violations of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Therefore, we once more proclaim our support for the struggle of the peoples of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.\n128.\tAfghanistan welcomes the observance of the year 1971 as the International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. The Government of Afghanistan sincerely hopes that this International Year will prove to be an important step in the realization of its\n4\tSee Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifth Session, Annexes, agenda item 63, document A/C.3/L.88.\npurpose to achieve substantial progress in the elimination of all forms of racism and racial discrimination, including policies of apartheid.\n129.\tMr. President, Afghanistan wishes to see this session go down in history, as you have suggested, as the \\\"Assembly of universality\\\" [1934th meeting]. We further hope that this session will contribute to the suppression of the spirit of divisionism which has so much damaged the United Nations and the world. It is our hope that a united and universal attack will be launched against divisionism inside and outside the United Nations. Only then will mankind be confident enough to look forward hopefully to seeing a world united in order to achieve its common goals of peace and prosperity."

        "file_text": "107.\t Mr. President, I should like to begin by extending to you my heartfelt congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We rest assured that in discharging your difficult task you will bring to us the invaluable contribution of your well-known and exceptional qualities as a highly respected international personality. I am convinced that your rich experience in statesmanship will ensure the success of our deliberations, and my delegation will not fail to give you its full support in this respect.\n108.\tIt is also a pleasant duty for me to pay a tribute to our outgoing President^ Edvard Hambro, who conducted our work with great wisdom and tact during the twenty- fifth session of the General Assembly.\n109.\tOnce again, we are happy to welcome among us several new Members. We look forward to the positive contribution which Bahrain, Bhutan, Qatar and Oman as new Members will, I am sure, bring to the work of our Organization. The increasing membership of the United Nations is indeed encouraging for the attainment of universality.\n110.\tIn this connexion I think it would be appropriate for me to state that we look forward to the participation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations this year and we believe that such participation is bound to strengthen the Organization's goal of achieving better and more effective co-operation among nations.\n111.\tI should like now to express our views on some of the problems that arise on the international scene.\n112.\tWe are happy to find it possible once more to speak of an atmosphere of detente in Europe. Developments which are talking place on the continent strengthen our hopes concerning the solution of its problems, The Moscow and Warsaw Treaties concluded last year by the Federal Republic of Germany with the Soviet Union  and Poland,  respectively, had already brought about a significant improvement in the political climate of Europe. The results obtained recently in the four-Power talks on Berlin are a new and important step which increases the prospects for the achievement of reliable European security and co-operation. We hope that they will lead to a final agreement.\n113.\tIt is obvious that political agreements alone cannot meet all the requirements of security in Europe. They need to be complemented with a lowering of the level of the military forces which confront each other. It is this necessity that has bred the concept of mutual and balanced force reductions.\n114.\tIf the present positive tendencies can be maintained and strengthened, we might witness in the near future new developments which would enable us to advance toward the convening of a European security conference. Such a conference, which would be of historic importance and have a bearing on the vital issues of security and co-operation in Europe, requires extensive and thorough preparation since not only would failure halt progress towards further detente, but it might also bring back conditions reminiscent of the past.\n115.\tTurning to the Middle East, I regret to say that it is not possible to express the same optimistic views as those I have stated about the situation in Europe. More than a year has elapsed since the cease-fire agreement, but we are still waiting for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n116.\tThe cessation of hostilities gave the conflicting parties a priceless opportunity to seek a durable solution. Although expectations from the cease-fire have not been fulfilled, its continuation must be considered a welcome achievement which should bear the seeds of a future over-all settlement. If the present opportunities are missed, a much more serious situation is bound to develop, a situation from which neither of the conflicting parties would benefit.\n117.\tI should like to express the appreciation of my Government for the sincere and dedicated efforts made by the United Nations and various Governments in the search for peace. I must also express our thanks to \\\"Ambassador Jarring, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his perseverance and equanimity in his difficult\n  \n118.\tWe continue to believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains all the necessary elements for the promotion of a comprehensive, peaceful settlement, provided that it is interpreted and implemented in good faith.\n119.\tMy Government has repeatedly stated that it is firmly opposed to the concept of securing political advantage or territorial gains through the use of force and through military occupation. We deplore and reject faits accomplis and unilateral measures aimed at altering the status of Jerusalem.\n120.\tThe people and the Government of Turkey share the deep feeling cf sorrow at present felt in Pakistan following the tragic civil strife. It is my Government's earnest hope that friendly Pakistan, in its wisdom, will succeed in its endeavors to solve this internal problem.\n121.\tThe plight of the large number of refugees who have crossed over to India complicates the humanitarian aspect of the problem and therefore warrants the continued interest of our Organization,\n122.\tWhile the relief work conducted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the immediate response of the international community has been significant, it still remains far from being adequate in view of the proportions and the urgency of the need. Our joint efforts should continue as the Government of Pakistan gears itself to solve the problem.\n123.\tI must also mention the protracted war in Viet-Nam, where perhaps we may have reason to believe that a positive outcome is in the offing. If this feeling proves to be true, as we hope it will, I am sure that the whole world-and above all the peoples directly interested- ill greet such an outcome with a sigh of relief.\n124.\tI regret to report to the General Assembly that the Cyprus problem, in which Turkey is so directly involved, still remains unsolved. After more than three years of talks, the two communities in the island have not been able to achieve any meaningful progress on constitutional issues. It is not my intention here, however, to go into the reasons for this regrettable and serious situation, as I am most reluctant to engage in an unproductive exchange of arguments. I wish only to assure the Assembly, that, while upholding firmly its obligations flowing from treaties, as well as its moral and contractual commitments to the Turkish community, Turkey will continue to do its best to keep the door open to peaceful negotiation and agreement among the interested parties. I should like also to repeat once again our appreciation for the services rendered for the purpose of maintaining peace and tranquility on Cyprus by the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus [UNFICYP]. Nevertheless we understand the difficulties encountered in the field of financing the continuous presence of UNFICYP and feel that it will become more and more strenuous for all contributing countries to carry this burden indefinitely if there is no prospect of settlement.\n125. We proclaimed the 1970s as the Disarmament\nmission. We do hope that the co-ordinated efforts of all Decade. One cannot underestimate the importance of this parties and the realistic attitude of the Arab Republic of\tissue. It concerns not only progress towards a better world, Egypt will pave the way to a just settlement\tbut also the very survival of mankind. \n126.\tWhen we speak of the disarmament question, we often have the feeling of being faced with an overwhelming challenge. In view of the difficulties and complexities of the problem, this feeling may seem justified. But we have to admit also that, especially during the last few years, considerable efforts have been made to stop the arms race and we should not minimize the results already obtained. These results have strengthened our will to pursue our objectives, to achieve general and complete disarmament under effective international control. So far, the Moscow partial test-ban treaty,  the outer space treaty,  the non-proliferation treaty,  and the sea-bed treaty  have all been important steps in the right direction. I am happy to state that Turkey is a party to all these treaties.\n127.\tFor a long period now the United States and the Soviet Union have been engaged in negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms. The importance of these negotiations for the strengthening of the peace and security of all countries hardly needs to be stressed. The two nuclear control agreements recently signed between the United States and the Soviet Union constitute a welcome development for the prevention of the accidental outbreak of nuclear wars.\n128.\tThe draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction [A/8457-DC/234, annex A], proposed by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, should win the support of this Assembly. We should not be afraid to modify it, should it become evident that such a modification would make it a more effective instrument of peace. In fact this convention constitutes a significant achievement which should pave the way for further agreements aimed at reducing already existing armaments.\n129.\tI think that I need not repeat my country's readiness to assist in all initiatives in the field of disarmament, provided that such initiatives achieve concrete and positive results.\n130.\tAs one of the co-sponsors of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in resolution 1514 (XV), Turkey is happy to note the positive results so far achieved in this field through the constant efforts of the United Nations. Nevertheless, it is a cause for great concern that many Territories are still non-self-governing. The process of decolonization has slowed down noticeably . The most difficult and complicated problems remain unsolved. The political fate of more than 28 million people in 44 Territories who live under colonial rule or a semi-colonial administration constitutes a direct challenge to the Charter of our Organization.\n131.\tThe Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples should pursue its valuable mission with the same determination of purpose, and it is also imperative that the remaining colonial Powers should attune themselves to the imposing realities of our times. The last manifestations of colonialism must be eradicated sooner rather than later. The Special Committee should lead the activities of decolonization with pragmatic and feasible proposals and suggestions.\n132.\tWhile a closer rapport between the administering Powers and the Special Committee is necessary, it will also be useful to give greater publicity to these activities, in order to rally wider support by world public opinion.\n133.\tAlthough apartheid has been totally and unanimously condemned, it continues to exist and, what is worse, it tends to expand, in spite of continuous and vigorous action on the part of the United Nations.\n134.\tOn the question of Namibia, the recent advisory opinion handed down by the International Court of Justice  is a significant development. The advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice is a highly meaningful reaffirmation of the 1966 resolution of the General Assembly [resolution 2145 (XXI)], of which my country was one of the sponsors. This development in the right direction should inspire further the related organs of our Organization, namely, the Security Council and the United Nations Council for Namibia, of which Turkey has been a member since its establishment.\n135.\tThe illegal administration created in Southern Rhodesia in 1965 by the unilateral declaration of independence has so far survived despite the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council. I am happy to say that my Government strictly observed from the beginning the provisions of Security Council resolution 217 (1965), instituting these sanctions.\n136.\tWe should only be pleased if the current unofficial contacts between the United Kingdom as the administering Power and the de facto regime in Salisbury pave the way for a settlement satisfying the legitimate aspirations of the African people on the basis of observance of the principle of one jman, one vote.\n137.\tAs usual, an important part of the work of the General Assembly consists of economic and financial questions. I should like to dwell briefly on certain aspects of this work. Two important conferences are due to take place in the course of the coming year. The third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] will meet in April 1972 in Santiago, Chile. The General Assembly, at its present session, will review the work of UNCTAD during the past year [item 41], and set the tone for its third session. I am convinced that our review of UNCTAD's activities is bound to note that, unfortunately, recent developments within UNCTAD's scope of competence have not been very positive.\n138.\tMost of the decisions and recommendations of the second session of UNCTAD have failed to be implemented thus far. The share of developing countries in world trade continues to shrink. No significant developments have occurred in the field of commodity-price stabilization. The over-all picture in development assistance, both as to volume and terms, remains clouded. The one bright exception has been in the field of the implementation of the scheme of generalized, non-discriminatory, non- reciprocal preferences. However, even in this area the situation is not completely satisfactory. Some of the preference-giving countries have restricted their lists of beneficiaries to include only those developing countries which are members of the Group of 77, thus excluding a number of developing countries from the scheme. This has had the effect of damaging the \\\"generalized\\\" and \\\"nondiscriminatory\\\" character of the arrangement .\n139.\tIn addition, we hope that recent international monetary upheavals and their negative repercussions on trade policies will not have undesirable effects on early implementation of the preferential arrangements. It is to be hoped that, whatever measures are adopted in the field of trade policy by the developed nations, special care will be taken to safeguard the trade interests of the developing countries.\n140.\tI believe that no statement regarding the Second United Nations Development Decade would be complete without reference to the resources of the sea-bed, which is \\\"the common heritage of mankind\\\". The connexion be-tween the two cannot be considered as a mere coincidence. In 1968, the General Assembly, in resolution 2467 C (XXIII), declared that the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction should be carried out \\\"... for the benefit of mankind as a whole ... irrespective of the geographical location of States, and taking into special consideration the interests and needs of the developing countries\\\". I wish to underline the urgency and the importance of delimiting the sea-bed area beyond national jurisdiction and establishing the necessary machinery for harnessing the resources of this area as soon as possible.\n141.\tAs a member of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, Turkey will be guided by these considerations in extending its support to the common effort aimed at convening the conference on the law of the sea in 1973. While the conference reviews the questions of navigational rights, utilization of the fishing resources, pollution and scientific research in the seas and oceans, it would be prudent to avoid the creation of unnecessary new burdens and restrictions.\n142.\tI believe that a flexible approach to, and consideration of, situations peculiar to various regions of the seas and oceans will provide the initial means of co-operation in this field.\n143.\tThe second important meeting for 1972 is the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to be held in Stockholm in June, 1972. The need for co-ordinated international action to deal effectively with the problems created by rapid population growth, by urbanization, by industrialization and by the heedless use of natural resources, is now universally recognized. We note with satisfaction the valuable work of the Preparatory Committee and of the Secretariat in this respect.\n144.\tThe problems of the deteriorating environment are going to affect all of us, whether we live in a developed or a developing country. But it is in the developing countries where the difficulties of coping with the problem are greatest. We welcome the fact that the General Assembly has, from the very beginning, taken into account the special needs of the developing countries, and we are confident that this recognition will be reaffirmed at the Conference so that the problems of the environment can be effectively resolved on a world-wide scale.\n145.\tLast year, the Turkish delegation had the honor to draw the attention of the Third Committee to the need for a world-wide effort to assist countries struck by natural disasters. Our delegation subsequently prepared a draft resolution which was presented by a large number of delegations and became resolution 2717 (XXV). I am happy to note that satisfactory progress has been made in the implementation of that resolution. Acting upon the report of the Secretary-General, the Economic and Social Council recommended in its resolution 1612 (LI), inter alia, the appointment of a disaster relief co-ordination and the consideration of the establishment of stockpiles to be used for emergency assistance in cases of natural disasters.\n146.\tI hardly need to say more about the importance of this problem, from which so many countries have suffered, except to express the hope that the Assembly will establish the necessary set-up, and my delegation intends, in cooperation with other delegations, to introduce a draft resolution on this issue some time during the current session.\n147.\tIn concluding my remarks, I wish to state that in our review of the international situation and the problems which confront us today, we have been able to speak this year of some positive developments. Despite the tragedies that beset the scene, a more optimistic picture is gradually emerging. If this thinking is justified, then it is all the more imperative that the United Nations should continue to strive for, and spare no effort to attain, the objectives of peace and co-operation among all nations.\n148.\tNothing would be more appropriate here than to quote the words of wisdom of our eminent Secretary- General, whose decision to relinquish his post has been received with much regret in my country. In his introduction to the annual report this year, U Thant said:\n\\\"Much of the usefulness of the United Nations is unknown and indeed intangible. But, however faulty, it represents an aspiration and a method of trying to realize a great ideal\\\" [Al8401lAdcU, para. 139].\n"

        "file_text": "\n1.\t  Mr. President, may I first extend to you the sincere congratulations of the delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic on your election to the presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are certain that your guidance will lend immeasurably to the success of this session.\n2.\tMay I also pay a tribute to your predecessor, Ambassador Hambro of Norway, on the manner in which he conducted our deliberations during his term of office.\n3.\tI should like to take this opportunity to express to our Secretary-General our admiration and high esteem for his selfless devotion to the cause of peace and justice. His record of great integrity and his exceptional capabilities will always remain an honor to this high office.\n4.\tMy delegation welcomes to membership in this Organization the States of Bhutan, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman. We are convinced that they will contribute immensely to our common efforts.\n5.\tWe believe that increasing and more effective participation of countries in the membership and work of the Organization is the best guarantee for its evolution in the direction of reflecting and embodying the aspirations of mankind.\n6.\tWe associate ourselves with the sincere attempts being made to solve the grave problems that face humanity, whether they be the immediate questions involved in solving monetary crises or the long-term problems of disarmament, preserving the environment and stimulating economic and social development in different regions of the world. It is our belief that the deprivation of several peoples of their right to self-determination, the imposition of racism and other forms of social discrimination upon countries under colonial rule and the persisting dominance\n \nof certain developed countries over the. resources of the developing countries constitute the most pervasive cause of insecurity and conflict in the world today. We urge accelerating efforts to bring to a final end the colonial age as well as to eliminate the dark consequences it has left in the developing regions. Support for the liberation struggles being waged against colonialism and neo-colonialism in all forms must be intensified. Condemnation of and opposition to those Governments suppressing these struggles must advance into the realm of practical and effective measures.\n7.\tThe Libyan Arab Republic, having succeeded in eliminating a foreign military presence from our country, is now proceeding to consolidate its co-operation with all sister States seeking to advance the cause of co-operation, peace and justice. This is especially true of the larger Arab homeland, with which we share not only a common language and culture, but also the other innumerable bonds which history has forged between us. The yearning of the Arab nation towards unity has long been the central focus of its attention. It is in this spirit that we came together with the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Syrian Arab Republic to form the Federation of Arab Republics. This Federation constitutes a positive force capable of strengthening our co-operation and friendship with peaceful nations and of sustaining our defense capacities against aggression and its proponents.\n8.\tOur region today has been forced to endure tragic events whose ramifications extend far beyond its boundaries. These events have become a major focus of world attention. The United Nations has been involved in this matter since the very beginning when, in 1947, it recommended the partition of Palestine [resolution 181 (II)] arbitrarily and against the avowed will of the majority of its population and in violation of the principle of self- determination embodied in its Charter. Since then, the gravity of the problem has escalated to dimensions whose monstrous ramifications threaten the very existence of the Arab inhabitants of our region and, consequently, the security of the whole world. The Middle East problem, or more specifically the Zionist problem which sustains it, remains, as it has always been, the single most crucial test of the ability of the international community to respond to, and cope with, the responsibilities resting on its shoulders by virtue of its allegiance to the Charter and the, principles of the United Nations.\n9.\tThe task of eliminating the consequences of the 1967 Israeli aggression against the Arab States is inextricably bound to the task of restoring the rights of the Palestinian people. Both are a direct outcome of the implantation of the Zionist expansionist settler entity in the Arab land of Palestine. Zionism had demonstrated its expansionism and racist exclusivism in the words and statements of its leaders long before it achieved statehood in 1948. \n10.\tInvoking illusory and mythological interpretations of the history of ancient times, Zionism, as an alien European colonial movement, has sought to impose its domination on Palestine and the countries neighboring it. It has called for, and continues to call for, the in-gathering of all Jews into the land of Palestine and other parts of the Arab homeland. With every wave of immigration it has effected, it has sown the seeds for another aggression and another expansion. The violation of the rights of the indigenous population, their exclusion and expulsion have been the outcome of the racist ideology of this movement. The State of Israel today, in all its practices, is the embodiment of this movement. Since lb-48, it has achieved through military conquest a scheme of expansion by stages, of which the 1967 aggression was only the most recent. And still there is by no means any assurance that this was the last along the dangerous road of aggression and expansion.\n11.\tNumerous resolutions have been adopted by both the General Assembly and the Security Council during the four years since the 1967 aggression. Yet Israel persists in its occupation of Arab lands in complete disregard of the United Nations, its resolutions and its principles. Moreover, in complete defiance of all declarations calling for its withdrawal, Israel has proceeded to enforce, through measures brutally disrespectful of human rights, its policy of imposing its designs for the actual annexation of occupied territories, notably in the city of Jerusalem.\n12.\tSecurity Council resolution 242(1967), which calls for the withdrawal of Israel's occupying forces from the occupied Arab territories, remains for Israel a matter of eloquent but evasive academic declarations. All efforts expended to reach a peaceful settlement on the basis of implementing this resolution have been in vain, since Israel persists in its arrogance, which United States sponsorship enables it to maintain. Indeed, since 1967, and throughout the years during which Israel has been in occupation of the territories of three States Members of the United Nations, the United States Government has actually stepped up its military and financial aid to Israel. The extensive offensive weaponry, including Phantom and Sky Hawk jets, coming to Israel from the United States leads us to the inevitable conclusion that the United States Government is collaborating in the occupation and sharing the guilt of the oppression it entails.\n13.\tIsrael has been defiant of the collective will of the international community. It holds this Organization in utter contempt. The most recent illustration of this attitude took place on 25 September, when the Security Council, at its 1582nd meeting, adopted its resolution 298 (1971), which urgently called on Israel to rescind all me asm and actions designed to change the status of Jerusalem. The Israeli representative immediately rejected the resolution; he alleged, in effect, that the views expressed in it were deserving of no esteem, and he proclaimed that his Government's view would prevail. At the same time, the Israeli Government issued a statement which rejected the resolution and made clear its opposition to any United Nations representative or mission on the matter, and reiterated its intention to annex the occupied city of Jerusalem. Disregard for the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by military conquest is paramount in the thinking of Israel\u2019s rulers; for every single\n \ninch of Palestine was forcibly occupied. This is evident also from the statement of Mr. Abba Eban addressed on 30 September to this august body [1946th meeting]. In it he completely disregarded this principle to justify Israel's expansionist designs.\n14.\tIn his statement, moreover, he completely negated whatever role the United Nations might have when he mocked what he described as its \\\"parliamentary role\\\" [ibid., para. 65], claiming that the triumph of the majority has no moral value. Indeed, when he called on the United Nations organs to disregard its resolutions in favor of seeking a \\\"consensus which would include the interested parties\\\" [ibid.], he was essentially limiting the capacities of the United Nations to those policies and decisions that Israel would consent to. If the United Nations is to restrict itself to decisions reached on the basis of consensus, then a State facing aggression would have little guarantee that its rights would be upheld against the will of the aggressor. If the United Nations is to restrict itself to decisions reached on the basis of a consensus, then there would be no role left for the United Nations in such matters as the Portuguese domination imposed on African Territories as long as Portugal did not consent to this role. In a sense, Mr. Eban was demanding veto power for Israel, not only in the Security Council, whose role and functions during the past years he rejected, but also in the General Assembly and all other United Nations organs. When he called for abandonment of the old documents, formulas and texts, it was only those documents and resolutions, like the recent resolution on Jerusalem, which are incompatible with Israel's aims that he wished to see abandoned. Likewise, when he spoke of the need for building new arrangements and conditions after wars, it was the conditions imposed by ihe victor that he wished to see enforced. Fortunately, very few Member States share Mr. Eban\u2019s conception of this role of the United Nations.\n15.\tAmidst all this, we are still confronted with deceptive assertions from Israel and its sponsors as to its peace-loving nature and its willingness to carry out the obligations stipulated by the Charter. But whatever credibility this double-talk might have gained in the past is all but vanishing. The reality of Israel's practices can no longer be obscured by rhetoric.\n16.\tThe conditions imposed by Israel on the occupied territories should be apparent from the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories [A/8389 and Corr.l and 2 and Add.l and Add.l/Corr.l and 2], The refusal of Israel to facilitate the task of that Committee is testimony to its abrogation of its obligations under the Geneva Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is also betrays the double-faced policy that Israel pursues here as a cover-up for its brutal practices over there. Accounts of Israel's practices of mass punishment, repression of civilians, torture of prisoners, deportation and expulsion of the inhabitants, destruction and demolition of residential homes, confiscation of property, violation of religious monuments and beliefs are too well documented to need elaboration.\n17.\tMost atrocious and inhumane is Israel's behavior in the Gaza Strip, where its brutalities are singularly symptomatic of its contempt for human rights, Under the pretext of taking security measures, Israel has currently been implementing its military policy of breaking up and dispersing the population of the Gaza Strip even when that deprives that population of the minimum relief and welfare facilities afforded them by the United Nations. The special report by Sir John Rennie, Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, has attested to the recent demolition operation which has resulted in the forcible displacement of about 15,000 Palestinian refugees and the demolition of their homes by the Israeli military authorities [A/8413]. The Secretary-General has expressed concern over the effect of this operation on the Palestinian refugees, and on 18 August he urgently requested Israel to \\\"ensure the immediate cessation of the destruction of refugee homes in the Gaza Strip and halt the removal of the refugee occupants\\\" [A/L'401/Add.l, para. 226]. Once more, Israel has ignored this request. According to a report which appeared on 31 August in the Israeli newspaper Maariv, the displacement of these 15,000 refugees is only the first phase of an over-all scheme, the second phase of which aims at the removal of 60,000 to 70,000 refugees from their homes in the Gaza Strip. This calculated policy of mass displacement, coupled with the practice of imposing mass terror on the inhabitants is designed as a prelude to annexation.\n18.\tThe Israeli Government has handed over the life and destiny of the inhabitants of the Strip to the Border Police, a special force also referred to as the \\\"Green Berets\\\", whose brutalities against the Arabs under occupation are not incomparable to the atrocities committed by the United States Green Berets in Viet-Nam. The reputation of this special force has been well known since the massacre of Kafr Kassem in 1956, when 49 Arab subjects of Israel were murdered in cold blood in one day. This special force was ordered to shoot on sight, to shoot into crowds, to commit deliberate killings and to beat and brutalize the inhabitants. Its actions during the past year have elicited indignant cries from people all over the world. The refusal of the inhabitants to submit to Israel, despite these brutalities, has commanded world-wide support, sympathy and admiration.\n19.\tIn the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, Israel has virtually evacuated the area of its Arab inhabitants, replacing them with immigrant settlers to serve Israel in its future aggressions. This behavior of Israel throughout the occupied territories during these past years is only an extension of the old Zionist scheme of excluding the native Arab population and expelling it to make way for the immigrant settler-population. This scheme remains, to this day, the ideology on the basis of which all of Israel's existence, its laws-like the so-called \\\"law of return\\\"  and its essence feed and perpetuate themselves. Expansionism is an organic part of Zionism, contingent on its self-glorification as the instrument for the in-gathering of all the Jews of the world in Palestine and in the other Arab countries on which it has designs.\n20.\tThe Arab people of Palestine, who were leading a normal life tilling their land and seeking their livelihood in peace, were looking to a better future when their country fell under British colonialism which was committed to the establishment of a Jewish settler State in their ancestral\nhomeland. In 30 years of British rule in Palestine, Zionist colonial machinations had transformed a myth into reality through force and violence. As a result of this, more than a million and a half Palestinian Arabs have been uprooted from their homeland, dispossessed and displaced. Another million and a half are suffering under the worst military occupation known in modem history. For two decades the international community failed to undo the injustice that had been inflicted upon the people of Palestine, It is in defense of their usurped rights and for the restoration of their usurped homeland that they consequently opted for the only alternative left open to them, namely, that of armed struggle. The recent emergence of the Palestinian revolution has demonstrated to the world the determination of the Palestinian people to regain their rights. Their struggle has gained support from all the freedom-loving peoples.\n21.\tThe United Nations, during recent years, has responded in part to its responsibilities in this connexion. Though modest, the resolutions passed during the last two sessions can constitute a springboard for the efforts of the United Nations to deal with a matter that it has long failed to meet. Resolution 2535 B (XXIV) of 10 December 1969 reaffirmed \\\"the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine\\\". This was followed at the twenty-fifth session by other resolutions which went further in putting the problem in its proper context.\n22.\tResolution 2672 C (XXV) of the past session, which was adopted on 8 December 1970, \\\"Recognizes that the people of Palestine are entitled to equal rights and self-determination, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations\\\". In principle, a resolution recognizing a people's right to self-determination may not be a novelty.\nAll peoples are entitled to the right of self-determination.\nBut in view of the past disregard for the rights of the people of Palestine in the United Nations itself, this resolution constitutes a step forward. This is all the more true since it reiterated that \\\"full respect for the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine is an indispensable element in the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East\\\".\n23.\tResolution 2649 (XXV), adopted during the last session on 30 November 1970, which \\\"Condemns those Governments that deny the right to self-determination of peoples recognized as being entitled to it, especially of the peoples of southern Africa and Palestine\\\", is equally important. In viewing the Palestinians simply as refugees, the United Nations had been evading the central fact of the problem. The Palestinians have become refugees by virtue\nof the denial of their right to self-determination. Like the peoples of southern Africa, they are victims of the colonial age, which deprived them of their country under British imperialism and which reduced them to an inferior status under the racist Zionism of the State of Israel.\n24.\tIsraeli Zionism, like South Africa's apartheid, perpetuates itself through the imposition of a system of racial discrimination against the indigenous population. The outcome of the Zionist scheme during the past half-century has been the creation in the land of Palestine of a social system which, like apartheid in South Africa, is based on racial discrimination and hatred and which is designed to reduce the Arab inhabitants to third-rate status and the Oriental Jews to second-rate status, with the European settler minority occupying the dominant positions. The atrocities which the Zionists have committed during the last half-century in order to impose this shameful system have always borne close resemblance to the methods employed by the Nazis.\n25.\tSince 1960, when the United Nations adopted the policy of combating racism and apartheid by sanctions against the South African Government, the commercial exchanges and the military links between Israel and South Africa have increased incredibly. Judging by available figures, Israel's exports to South Africa have multiplied tenfold since that time. South Africa is Israel's chief trading partner in Africa. The extensive contributions which the South African regime has allowed Zionist groups to channel to Israel, like the sum of $18 million reported soon after the Israeli aggression in June 1967, are testimony to the close links existing between these two racist States.\n26.\tIf the United Nations has committed itself to the task of combating racism, it is imperative that it deal with racism wherever it exists. The system of religious-racial intolerance imposed by Zionism and the State of Israel on the people of Palestine must be exposed and opposed. The role that Israel plays in Africa, in collaboration with the South African regime and its other racist' and colonialist allies, must be condemned.\n27.\tThe African continent is witnessing today the combined aggressions of the South African Government, the Portuguese colonialists and the Rhodesian minority regime. These vicious entities are unifying their forces to enslave the African populations under their combined control. In this endeavor, they would achieve little if it were not for the covert co-operation they receive from several other States.\n28.\tThe South African racist rulers seem to have lost all their humanity when they proceeded to impose their systematic violence on millions of people in South Africa. The repression, the mass murders, the imprisonments and torture carried out by the Government of South Africa constitute a crime against all of humanity. The behavior of that State makes clear its unwillingness to accommodate the rights of the majority of the country's inhabitants. Accordingly, it must be expelled from all international functions and its legitimacy must be denied. The South African Government has refused to comply with the Assembly's decision to terminate the mandate over Namibia [resolution 2145 (XXI)]. Furthermore, it has defied all pleas from the international community and proceeded to introduce into that country the evil racist system of apartheid that it had imposed on the populations under its own rule. The ruling of the International Court of Justice on the illegality of South Africa's occupation of the Namibian territory  offers no alternative but to enforce sanctions against South Africa. Having already called upon Member States to terminate all relations with this racist\n \nGovernment, the United Nations must now take those measures necessary to ensure the strict implementation of this call on the part of all States. We cannot entertain any illusions as to South Africa's willingness to comply with the least requirements of human decency.\n29.\tWe condemn the oppression and inhumanity practiced against the peoples of the Portuguese colonies of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). The Portuguese colonialists have also extended their aggression to the sovereign States of Guinea, Senegal and Zambia. Portugal's wars of repression and extermination in the colonies, as well as its aggression against neighboring States, could not have been sustained by a poor country such as Portugal if it were not for the support of its NATO allies. My Government declares its complete support for the struggle of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) to recover their inalienable rights to freedom and independence.\n30.\tThe same is true of the peoples of Zimbabwe, who are being subjected to the inhumane repression of the illegal white settler minority regime of Ian Smith. This oligarchy of hatred has been imposing a system of racial discrimination designed to deny the majority of the inhabitants their human rights and their rights, to self-determination and independence. The international community has to bear its responsibilities and to ensure that the rights of the majority in that country are supported and upheld.\n31.\tMy Government is deeply concerned at the continued United States military intervention in Indo-China. The war is still raging at a great cost of destruction and suffering to the people of that region. We support the heroic struggle of the Viet-Namese people and demand the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops so that those people can freely exercise their right of self-determination. We feel that the seven-point Program submitted by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam constitutes a sound basis for peace and for the achievement of the national aspirations of the Viet-Namese people.\n32.\tThe painful events which overtook Pakistan last spring are a cause of humanitarian concern to all of us. The Libyan Government has, along with other Governments, contributed to the cause of alleviating the suffering of the millions of refugees. The Government of India has born a large share of the effort of the international community. It is our hope that the vital needs of the refugees are being met and that all efforts will be combined to facilitate their return to their homes.\n33.\tThe question of the representation of China should have been solved in 1949, when the Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China informed the United Nations of the establishment of the new regime and repudiated the legal status of the delegation representing the overthrown Government.\n34.\tFor more than two decades, various measures have deliberately and consistently been taken to deny nearly one fourth of the world's population its lawful rights in this Organization, which aspires to be universal. This has been unwise and contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter. These measures have from the very outset had an adverse effect upon the role and the work of the Organization. The United Nations has suffered in effectiveness, authority and reputation. My delegation will not support any measure which has the effect of depriving the People's Republic of China of its lawful rights in the United Nations. The presence of the People's Republic of China in this Organization will greatly contribute to the effectiveness of the United Nations, enhance its role and prestige and have a salutary effect on international peace and co-operation.\n35.\tFinally, I wish to assert that the attitude of the Libyan Arab Republic is based on its commitment to the high principles of the Charter of the United Nations. These principles must of necessity lead us to condemn foreign domination, discrimination and aggression, whether they are practiced in southern Africa, Indo-China or the Middle East. They also require us to support the right of all peoples struggling for self-determination and freedom.\n36.\tIn the Middle East, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied Arab territories is a prerequisite for reducing the explosive situation in the region. The return of the people of Palestine to their homeland and the restoration of their legitimate right to self-determination constitute an inevitable necessity if a just and lasting peace is to be achieved.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "3.\t Mr. President, let my first words be of congratulation to you on behalf of the Brazilian Government and in my own name, on your unanimous election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your personal and professional\nqualification, fully recognized by all of us who are acquainted with you, assure us that the guidance of our debates will be in the hands of a skillful and internationally respected diplomat. May I also express the appreciation of the Brazilian Government for the efficiency, tact and assurance with which your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro, carried out these functions.\n4.\tWe are saddened by U Thant\u2019s irrevocable decision to leave his post as Secretary-General at the end of his second term. The Brazilian Government had previously expressed its hope that U Thant would still be in a position to reconsider his decision and would agree to place his valuable services at the disposal of the international community for another period. Now that he has reaffirmed that his wish is irreversible, I should like to reiterate the gratitude of my Government to the Secretary-General for the dedication with which he has worked to serve the United Nations. The need to replace him leads us more than ever to ponder the delicate nature and the importance of that position as well as the political responsibility the Secretary-General holds within the system of our Organization, U Thant has given us ample evidence of this kind of understanding in the course of the 10 years during which we have become accustomed to seeing him work for the cause of international peace and harmony.\n5.\tIn the course of the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization, we unanimously asserted the belief that the United Nations continued to provide the most valid alternative for the theories of power and balance of power which nourish hegemonic ambitions. Despite the unanimity with which this belief was expressed, we concurrently pointed out the limitations which were reducing our Organization's capacity for action because of the resurgence of political concepts and diplomatic practices that run counter to the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n\n6. The purposes and principles which the 51 founding Members of the United Nations incorporated into the institutional Charter of the Organization have made it possible for 79 nations, in the course of the quarter century of the existence of the United Nations, to accede to membership with the same sovereign status. When in July of 1945 we faced the misery, suffering and destruction brought about by the Second World War, we also assumed collective responsibility for eliminating the unjustifiable poverty plaguing two thirds of mankind. We were not aware then that a few weeks later the destructive force of the atom would appear on the scene as the major threat to peace and international security. It is indisputable that that event has conditioned the evolution of international relations since San Francisco, and its negative impact will persist as long as the knowledge that breeds power is not\nplaced definitely and unconditionally at the service of the international community.\n7.\tThe contemporary crisis and the danger that the United Nations will be left to play but a marginal role in it will grow more and more acute so long as wealth and power continue to be concentrated in a few States, so long as scientific and technological knowledge remain \\\"oligopolized\\\" so long as, in the last analysis, the practice of power politics downgrades the United Nations and progressively lessens the importance of its position as an organizing, valid and active forum for international relations. Therefore, the alternative to the United Nations, both for the poor States and for the rich ones, for the powerless and the powerful, is chaos, which is the inevitable consequence of theories that set up force, the naked force of economic, scientific and military power as a pattern for international behavior.\n8.\tThe Brazilian Government thus maintains, and will continue to stress, that peace and collective security, as well as the social and economic progress of developing countries, are the crucial problems of our time and that on their solution depend harmonious relationships among States.\n9.\tFor the same reasons, during the General Assembly's twenty-fifth anniversary session Brazil strove for the adoption of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], through which we reiterated the purposes and principles of our Organization and its competence to examine, debate and settle major world issues.\n10.\tThat reiteration doubtless implies a rebuttal of the so-called political realism used as a means of imposing and justifying new modes of the freezing of power, as well as the implicit or explicit establishment of spheres of influence.\n11.\tAt the present session of the General Assembly we are invited to consider, in the light of this pseudo-realism, the accession of another great Power to our Organization. This realistic spirit seems to be a modem version of Realpolitik, a term which brings to mind less than happy memories. As a matter of fact, I would prefer to have that so-called realistic spirit applied to the recognition by the United Nations of a process that can no longer be delayed: the translation into concrete deeds of the moral duty and political obligation of wealthy nations to make an effective contribution to the progress of the less-developed countries, or, at the very least, not to raise obstacles to their development. There is no lack of studies on the subject. Quite reasonable proposals have been put forth and even adopted. Yet when we take stock of the outcome of their implementation we are made aware that all we have succeeded in achieving is the splitting up of our deliberations into comfortable time-packages. That is how we came to the Second Development Decade.\n12.\tNow, unfortunately this is not Realpolitik we are dealing with-not the Realpolitik that would lead us to lasting and fruitful peace. Quite the contrary, the Realpolitik we are invited to apply on this occasion is the admission of the fact that a nation counting its population in the hundreds of millions and possessing its own nuclear\n \n\n\nweapons-even though, incidentally, the proliferation of these weapons is supposed to be proscribed-could not fail to be given a position among us compatible with its strength. What we are facing here is another instance of power politics, which can hardly set proper criteria for organizing an international society based on peace, justice and the equality of States.\n13.\tIn relation to this issue, which is being given top- priority attention in all the chancelleries of the world, I should also like to remark that the new fact before us is not the discovery of a new star in the constellation of the great Powers. This star has long been shining. It has been there ever since it mastered the technology and means to jeopardize the survival of mankind -- in other words, ever since it proved it possessed atomic weapons. The very novelty of the situation now in the offing that fundamentally changes the prospects of the membership of the United Nations is that a super-Power has decided the time has come to acknowledge the existence of another great Power. This fact seems to be irrefutable. Consequently the candidate for membership comes into existence from the moment the directorate of the club of power so decides.\n14.\tThe participation of this new partner is taken for granted, whether it be today or tomorrow. Timing appears to be irrelevant. The important point, the relevant innovation, would be for this display of Realpolitik to result in the United Nations henceforth discussing and deciding upon major issues of international peace and security which, strangely enough, have not been discussed in the General Assembly.\n15.\tCertainly, while I am attempting to picture the freezing of power as a trend that has become a major obstacle to the achievement of the objectives of peace, security and development, I do not postulate, either directly or indirectly, a symmetrical evaluation of the super-Powers, their world interests or political behavior.\n16.\tEven if, hypothetically, the international community were willing to accept a \\\"nuclear peace\\\" and therefore the resulting principle that absolute power engenders absolute rights, historical experience disavows any permanent differentiation of States into a small, group endowed with, on the one hand, unparalleled power and, on the other, a second category of countries condemned to the role of spectators or prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of power.\n17.\tOn the contrary, the political philosophy of our Organization rests on quite a different basis: the equality of rights, duties and opportunities of all Member States, respect for the sovereignty and independence of States, the non-use of force in the settlement of international disputes, and the fulfillment in good faith of the obligations contracted under the Charter, It therefore becomes obvious that the doctrines of power threaten the existence of the United Nations as the normative organ of international society, downgrading it politically as the international forum competent to impose discipline on the fact of power itself--discipline that should benefit the international community as a whole rather than the oligopoly of force that acts to the community's detriment.\n18.\tThe most evident, and in the long run most dangerous, attempt to sanction immobility is the systematic refusal \neven to entertain the possibility of reviewing the Charter. The Brazilian Government does not think the political philosophy of the United Nations, as expressed in its purposes and principles, is in need of revision. That was the sense of the appeal I made during the twenty-fifth anniversary session: \\\"let us use our Organization and let us apply the Chatter\\\" [1841st meeting, para. 35].\n19.\tBut since times change, the machinery established for the implementation of these purposes and principles must now be submitted to review and revision. The scenarios that have evolved and disappeared in the changeable international reality, the experiences we have accumulated during our 25 years of work to put a stop to or contain crises and causes of conflict, and, even more basically, the entrance into these scenarios of so many new, sovereign States, have rendered many of the mechanisms created a quarter of a century ago archaic, inadequate and insufficient. Revision is a prerequisite for making available to the United Nations instruments which will make them more active, more normative and more agile.\n20.\tAs an illustration of the need for revision, I could point to the limited representativeness of such organs as the Economic and Social Council, the current membership of which renders it incapable of reflecting and interpreting the whole and complex gamut of the economic and social interests of Member States of the United Nations.\n21.\tAlong this line of thought I wish to reiterate that the Brazilian Government cannot agree that the principle of sovereign equality of Member States should be questioned in any way or restricted in its consequences. This principle is not subject to any qualification other than those prerogatives explicitly set forth in Article 27 of the Charter. An exceptional rule is involved here. Its effects cannot be extended to any other forum or activity of the Organization, thus endowing the permanent members of the Security Council with special prerogatives. Nor should this privilege, which is restricted to the forum of that same Council, serve to assure its permanent members any advantage or priority of membership in the subsidiary organs of the Assembly, to the detriment of the principle of equitable geographic representation.\n22.\tIt seems necessary here to stress the obvious since the obvious frequently becomes distorted under the impact of powerful conflicting interests. The establishment of peace is the fundamental task of the United Nations: a peace which is not to be confused with the balance of power or its nuclear counterpart, the balance of terror; a peace which should not be the mere perpetuation of an unjust international situation, or the mere absence of conflict with a whole range of sinister nuclear overtones; a peace, in short, which should not be reduced to sheer hope for the survival of mankind on the morrow and a hope, consistently renewed on a short-term basis, that the nuclear arsenals will not be used. On the contrary it should be a peace resting on the stable structure of collective security and providing conditions for progress, a peace which is identified with the eradication of under-development and which guarantees to all Member States territorial integrity, national identity, the right to develop their human potentialities, their political and social capabilities and the unimpeded possession and disposition of their factors of progress.\n23.\tThe basic requirement for the permanent establishment of peace and political and economic security lies essentially in general and complete disarmament, which cannot be reduced to the inadequate dimension of partial measures of arms control or non-armament. Although necessary and praiseworthy, these measures have not gone beyond the maintenance of the present distribution of nuclear power under the deceptive cloak of the co- chairmanship. The existence of nuclear arsenals and the sums expended annually to strengthen them quantitatively and improve them qualitatively are the result of antagonisms which the practice of the balance of power does not allow to be resolved. No one disputes any longer the irrationality of \\\"over-kill\\\", or that unrestrained spending on nuclear arms constitutes the greatest impediment to any integrated plan for global economic development.\n24.\tWe meet here once again entrusted with the responsibility of seeking a solution which, viewed rationally, seems about to materialize. Yet this solution stubbornly eludes us, prodded beyond our grasp by a diabolical illusion that power, which only apparently renders a few immune, will through its own dynamics guarantee the survival of all.\n25.\tHence our eyes and ears are fixed on the doors behind which, in Helsinki and in Vienna, the secret talks on the limitation of strategic arms are proceeding with the slowness to which we have, unhappily, become accustomed. Around those tables, where we have no seats, the negotiators of the super-Powers play with the destiny of us all.\n26.\t In a few months the third session of the United Nations\tConference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] will be convened, the third opportunity afforded the developed world in less than 10 years to co-operate concretely with the developing countries to improve their living standards, and to close within the shortest possible time the economic, scientific and technological gap separating the nations of the world.\n27.\tDisappointed at the poor results of the first and second sessions of UNCTAD, and aware of the reluctance of developed countries, of the intransigence of some and the even less excusable indifference of others, Brazil believes that the fate of the third session of UNCTAD will depend on the growing acceptance by the international community of the concept of collective economic security through the adoption of decisions of broad range and significance at the institutional level, and through the creation of new and more ambitious mechanisms.\n28.\tThe concept of collective economic security will complement the system of collective political security. In practice, this concept, which Brazil has consistently defended since 1953, upholds in the first place the right of all nations to economic and social development. It also postulates the ditty of the more developed countries to contribute to the elimination of the external barriers which they have created and which hinder the acceleration of the growth of developing countries. This should be achieved in accordance with the negotiated time-tables and, in any event, before the end of the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n29.\tTo the extent of its capabilities, Brazil is prepared to take up its responsibilities towards the least developed\namong developing countries, bilaterally as well as multilaterally. And we are naturally moved to do so by reason of the solidarity that links us to these countries, and also because we consider it to be an ethical imperative. We want to see this issue frontally tackled in Lima, at the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77, so that the third session of UNCTAD may bring about concrete and global solutions to this problem. We are convinced that other countries in stages of development similar to Brazil's will join us in seeking such solutions; concurrently, it is essential, in accordance with the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, that developed countries be prepared to contribute additional resources to eliminate more rapidly the disparities in growth among those in process of development. In the Latin American context, we are already acting increasingly in accordance with this political decision.\n30.\tCollective economic security further presupposes the protection of all Member States against economic aggression, threats or pressures, especially in relation to international trade and financing; it also presupposes respect for the sovereignty of all States over their natural resources and the political and economic consequences thereof, namely, the right freely to protect those resources and exploit them for the benefit of their own peoples and in accordance with their own priorities.\n31.\tBrazil reiterates the right and duty of riparian States to avail themselves of the resources of tire seas, the sea-bed and the subsoil thereof adjacent to their coastlines in order to ensure the economic and social well-being of their peoples. To this effect we maintain that such States are entitled to exercise the right to determine the extent of their sovereignty or jurisdiction over those areas, in accordance with their geographical, geological and biological peculiarities, and their requirements in the fields of security, scientific investigation and with respect to the preservation of the marine environment. The Brazilian Government wishes to express its gratification at the wide-spread understanding and support these principles are increasingly receiving from States of all continents and levels of economic development in the context of the preparatory work on a comprehensive conference on the law of the sea.\n32.\tI have no intention of bringing into this debate matters that are already being discussed in other international forums in a more adequate technical manner. But I cannot refrain from pointing out that Brazil is following with deep concern the new trends and developments that now characterize the international monetary and trade scene as a consequence of the decisions taken by the Government of the United States of America to offset the deficit in its balance of payments. It is undeniable that the fundamental interests of developing countries have in this case once again been neglected. It should be stressed that developing countries have in no way contributed to bringing about this abnormal situation on the international financial and trade scene. Therefore, it is imperative that their interests be duly safeguarded in the search for corrective solutions in order to avoid any further set-backs to their economic and social development process, However, I very much fear that if Governments and specialized organs adopt measures to reshape the international monetary\n \n system without previously consulting the developing countries in the appropriate international organs-I very much fear, I repeat-that the action program for development embodied in the International Development Strategy adopted last year by this Assembly [resolution 2626 (XXV)] will be gravely impaired in the very first year of its existence.\n33.\tThe Latin American countries have already taken a common political stand on those problems. We firmly trust that the United States of America, as well as the developed countries currently engaged in mutual consultations for the purpose of maintaining their stability, will not abandon their prior commitments towards the developing world.\n34.\tBrazil, with an already accelerated rate of economic growth and social progress which heralds the breaking of the barriers of under-development; will continue to the best of its ability to strive for the strengthening of an international order based on the concepts I have just outlined.\n35.\tSince historical events are rendering obsolete the bi-polarization which dominated international relations, its alternative cannot be a new power system also to be based on a small number of nations claiming a de facto hegemony over the rest of the world; rather it must be an international community organized in conformity with the broader and more equitable provisions of the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n36.\tThe consistent tenor of our foreign policy is summed up in. the following words of President Emilio Garrastazii Mddici\n\u201cBrazil is opposed to the division of the world into spheres of influence; it believes that peace is essential to the achievement of progress, and it adheres faithfully to the principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes as its guide-line in the conduct of its diplomacy.\n37.\tThat is the understanding of the contemporary reality that Brazil wishes to share with other Member States at the opening of this general debate. Nothing can undermine our determination to go on working toward our common ideals and aspirations, which will draw us ever closer in progress and in peace. Nothing shall alter our certainty that, despite so many set-backs, we still retain in our hands, in the hands of the peoples of the United Nations, the power to repudiate, once and for all, the tragic legacy of violence and folly which drenched in Mood and tears the road we had to travel in order finally to create this Organization. Nothing shall weaken our efforts to improve the United Nations by expanding its responsibilities and increasing its effectiveness in disciplining international relations among States for the benefit of world peace and security,\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, it is my very pleasant duty to express to you the particular satisfaction of the Ethiopian Government on your election to preside over this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Because we are fully confident in your high competence for your present task and are mindful of the constructive role which Indonesia continues to play in the international community, you may rest assured that my delegation will spare no effort to place at your disposal its modest contribution towards the efficient discharge of the heavy duties of your high office.\n2.\tThe twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly was no less blessed than the present session in that it had your learned predecessor, Ambassador Hambro of Norway, to guide it competently through that particularly busy anniversary session. To Ambassador Hambro, I should like to extend the heartfelt gratitude of the Ethiopian delegation in the simplest terms and in all humility: thank you for a job well done.\n3.\tP* we all know, this year marks U Thant's tenth year of selfless and devoted service as Secretary-General of the United Nations. The manifold achievements of UThant in strengthening the United Nations, especially in strengthening the role of the Secretary-General as the roving ambassador of peace during the last decade, must obviously be left to the historians of the period to record in detail. But I am none the less impelled to express the profound gratitude of my Government for the dedicated service he\n has rendered to the United Nations and, through it, to the larger family of mankind.\n4.\tMy Government welcomes the admission of Bahrain, Bhutan, Oman and Qatar to membership in the United Nations. In congratulating the representatives of these nations on the achievements of their respective countries in reaching their present status of full membership in this ever-growing family of nations, we wish to express the confident hope that their contribution of nev ideas and different approaches to solving common problems will further strengthen this Organization.\n5.\tSpeaking of membership in the United Nations, 1 must state that my Government continues to be concerned about the exclusion of the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China from our counsels. We firmly believe that none' of the outstanding and most fundamental world problems such as disarmament and international security can be resolved without the* active participation of the representatives of the People's Republic of China. On the basis of this belief, representatives of my Government have, for a d>'jade, persistently appealed from this rostrum for a sense of realism and true statesmanship to rectify what we still think of as a wrong perpetuated for far too long. As a consequence of this conviction, we have heretofore voted in favor of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Yet, the same item appears on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly [item 93J --we hope for the last time.\n6.\tI express this optimistic hope on the basis of the fact that, at long last, realism and statesmanship have emerged from some quarters during the last few months. Such being the case, I must limit myself to reiterating our consistent appeal in modified terms.\n7.\tThus, in the first place there should be no further procrastination in redressing the past injustice.\n8.\tSecondly, no further obstacle should be put in the way of the restoration of the lawful rights of the Government of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations as the sole representative of the entire people of China.\n9.\tWith some tragic exceptions, the interval between the past and present sessions of the General Assembly has been a reasonably calm and fruitful period for the world community.\n10.\tOn the credit side, the continuing detente between power groupings; the preliminary agreement on Berlin;  the pragmatic reorientation of national policies vis-a-vis existing realities; and the agreement on the text of a treaty for the prohibition of biological weapons, are but a few of the positive developments which my Government heartily welcomes. We are encouraged also by the further commitments towards the amelioration of the general world situation which have been voiced by representatives of both super-Powers and small nations alike throughout the present general debate.\n11.\tOn the other hand,' the unaltered situation in SouthEast Asia; the seemingly inactive volcano jn the Middle East; the spreading malignancy of racist oppression in southern Africa; the last-ditch entrenchment of colonialism in Africa; the lack of appreciable progress in disarmament negotiations in Geneva; and the recent human tragedy in the Indian subcontinent are, surely, some aspects of our common and urgent problems which must remain matters of anxious concern to the international community and, as such, must command a redoubled effort on the part of all of us towards facilitating their containment and final solution.\n12.\tIt is a fact that none of the problems I have just mentioned, or the rest of the world's manifold problems, can be said to have any magic formula for their ready and prompt solution. Yet, we are not starting from a void in all instances.\n13.\tTo be more specific, let me, for example, single out the urgent problem of the Middle East.\n14.\tFirst, we have Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which laid down the broad basis for achieving genuine and durable peace in that long-troubled area of the world.\n15.\tSecondly, an attempt to implement that resolution was promptly initiated by the Secretary-General and the arduous effort towards its actual implementation continues to be pursued by his personal representative, Ambassador Jerring.\n16.\tThirdly, a temporary cease-fire was achieved, which, mercifully, is still observed de facto by the parties concerned.\n17.\tFourthly, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity which convened in Addis Ababa last June, has formed a committee composed of 10 Heads of State-including His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, my august Sovereign-to seek ways and means of bringing about lasting peace to that cross-road of civilizations. That committee has, since its formation, held intensive consultations, as a result of which a sub-committee was formed and will soon visit the capitals of the countries concerned.\n18.\tMeanwhile, since the initial cease-fire, there has been considerable restraint by the parties concerned in not aggravating the already tense situation. From what we gather, the guns are more often silent. As a result, incalculable life and property have been spared the ravages of war. We appreciate the advantages of these positive developments and we ardently hope that they will eventually lead to the establishment of lasting peace in the region.\n19.\tIn spite of the achievement of some progress towards solving some of the problems confronting the international community in general, the problems that prevail in southern Africa continue to deteriorate. The colonial-racist minority regimes in that part of the world continue their impudent defiance of world opinion by escalating the repressions and oppressions that they mete out to the millions of people they hold in bondage.\n20.\tIn the furtherance of their pernicious objectives of preserving the hegemony of the social and political anachronisms to which they cling, the colonial, racial minority regimes in southern Africa are fostering ever closer collaboration among themselves in the vain hope of obstructing the inevitable march to freedom of peoples long subjugated and long denied the right to self-determination and independence, I need hardly deal with the numerous decisions of the United Nations that continue to be flouted by the Lisbon-Salisbury-Pretoria axis, for these are too well known and painstakingly documented elsewhere. I would only wish to underline at this point my Government's deep and serious concern at the explosive danger inherent in the failure by the United Nations, and particularly by those Member States that have close political and economic ties with the recalcitrant regimes that dominate southern Africa, to act against an injustice that is being perpetrated in the name of apartheid and colonialism.\n21.\tIt has been generally accepted that, among the areas of notable achievements credited to the efforts of the United Nations, decolonization ranks as the most significant. Nevertheless, the import of this phenomenon continues to elude the subjugated peoples of southern Africa. That is the case because the international community has abandoned them in their plight and misery, or, perhaps, has not yet shown sufficient willingness and resolve to act with speed and determination to enable them to realize their legitimate aspirations to live and die as free men and women. For the colonial peoples of southern Africa the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and other declarations remain unfulfilled promises as a result of the illogical and intransigent policies being ruthlessly pursued by the colonial-racial regimes dominating that region!\n22.\tA significant development this year regarding the southern African tragedy has been the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on Namibia.  The role that my country, in co-operation with others, has played in the legal battle concerning the Namibian case is a matter of record and I do not wish to labor it. 1 merely wish to state the satisfaction of my Government with the opinion rendered by the Court in response to the request made by the Security Council in its resolution 284 (1970).\n23.\tThe advisory opinion of the Court on the illegality of the presence of South Africa in Namibia being so clear and categoric, how much longer must implementation of the decisions of the competent organs of the United Nations be withheld or procrastinated?\n24.\tNow is the moment of truth. Will the Security Council take the proper measures under the Charter to implement its own decisions, or is the cause of the oppressed Namibians to go by default?\n25.\tHow much longer also will the international community and, in particular, the permanent members of the Security Council, regard, with a somewhat resigned acquiescence, the conspiracy of colonialists and racialists to try to keep the subjugated peoples of Africa in their death grip?\n26.\tThe choice between peace or an interracial bloodbath in southern Africa, with all its serious implications, may well depend on the answers given to the simple questions I have posed.\n27.\tIn yet another sphere, one of the most disquieting problems facing humanity today is the ever-widening gap between the developing and the developed countries. As the eminent President of Mexico succinctly put it in his address to this Assembly on 5 October:\n\\\"There will be no peace in the world until there has been a basic reorganization of the economic relations among nations. Today, the threat of atomic wars is as serious as that of the growing inequality between the rich countries and the poor.\\\" [1952nd meeting, para. 27.]\n28.\tThe International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session [resolution 2626 (XXV)] is, perhaps, the best instrument at our disposal to cope with this problem. What remains now is its implementation. In this respect the developed countries have a unique and important role to play. And unless these affluent and industrialized countries encourage and assist the poor nations to accelerate their economic development, the latter will no doubt continue to be confronted with serious difficulties in meeting the developmental needs of their peoples.\n29.\tIt might be said that the First Development Decade was not, after all, a complete failure, if only because its shortcomings have, to a certain extent, enabled us to be more pragmatic in our approach to the Second Development Decade. It is, therefore, our earnest hope that, with this realization, the forthcoming meetings of the Group of 77 and of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ will come up with concrete and viable proposals aimed at facilitating the implementation of the International Development Strategy.\n30.\tMay I now turn to a subject which gives rise to a legitimate hope on the part of the international community as a result of the adoption, a year ago, by the General Assembly of a declaration of principles governing the exploitation and the exploration of the resources of the sea-bed. \n31.\tFor certain basic needs, man is becoming increasingly dependent on the biological resources of the sea. Following the tremendous advance of science and technology during this century, the exploitation and exploration of the rich resources of the seas and the oceans has become a means of combating the serious shortage of the products that the surface of the earth used to offer.\n32.\tMoreover, the explosive growth of the world's population has emerged as an important factor requiring the maximum utilization of all the resources nature offers in order to give humanity a better standard of living. In this respect, the General Assembly laid down, during its last session, a fundamental principle by which the sea-bed is declared the common heritage of mankind and, hence, no State may exercise sovereign rights over any part of that area.\n33.\tThus, my country looks forward, with justified hope, to Hie attainment of the following results by the conference on the law of the sea scheduled to take place in 1973.\n34.\tFirst, we expect the conference to do away with the sad practice of operating on a \\\"first-come-first-served\\\" basis, by establishing a strong international machinery which would assure equitable and fair distribution of the benefits to be derived from the exploitation of the sea and by taking into account the interests and the needs of the developing countries as well as the special situation of land-locked and shelf-locked countries. Second, the conference should find a solution to the urgent problem of the pollution of the sea environment. And lastly, the conference should put an end to the questions related to the law of the sea, which several diplomatic conferences have heretofore failed to resolve.\n35.\tI have stated in my remarks therefore some of the principal preoccupations of my Government and its delegation to the present session of the General Assembly.\n36.\tWe also appreciate the enormity of some of the problems facing humanity at large today. But given the political will and the determination of the entire membership of the United Nations, we are convinced that none of these problems is insoluble. In the name of justice, international harmony and the abundant life for all mankind, our plea is, therefore, to rise courageously to meet the lesser challenges to the authority of this Organization even as we endeavor to overcome the more complex ones. To begin is already to take action, and to begin again to take the arduous path leading to a resolution of our chronic problems is what we must do.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "189.\t  Mr. President, in the name of brother-hood, for which the Dominican Republic is striving, and on behalf of the Government of my country, which is honored to be one of the founding Members of the United Nations, allow me to express to you our congratulations on your being elected to the presidency of the General Assembly, which we trust you will direct with your well-known wisdom, which has earned you a reputation as a statesman and as one who is respectful of the principles of our Organization, which provides protection for all men and peoples under the provisions of our Charter. We are confident that, guided by your knowledge and by the prestige which you will impart to our debates and deliberations, the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly will have special historic significance, because here we will achieve the progress which has long been anxiously awaited and we feel sure that we will take one more step towards the rule of law for which we are all, as Member States, equally responsible.\n190.\tOn this happy occasion, allow me also to express our best wishes for the success of this important session, and at the same time I should like to extend a hearty welcome to the new States of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar, which have come to swell the membership of this universal Organization.\n191.\tFinally, my country wishes to pay a well-earned tribute to Secretary-General U Thant for his outstanding work in the lofty post which he now holds.\n192.\tWe, the representatives who have gathered together here at the twenty-sixth session, are filled with concern over those matters which were not resolved at the past sessions. Now we are equipped with the means and instruments provided by the United Nations system, which should make it possible for us to meet the needs of the international community.\n193.\tUnderstandably enough, many of the issues which have been held over without any progress having been made are such as to require that we overcome considerable difficulties, though these matters deserve priority and they are problems which require judicious compromise and the reconciliation of divergent ideas and the passing of time, although we must not act at variance with principles or in violation of the rules of law to which we owe our respect.\n194.\tIt is impossible really to disregard present-day realities, because no rule of law can on its own first lay the groundwork and then achieve the victory which we so ardently desire; for human justice is imperfect, like all the works of man, but it is capable of bringing about confidence and assurance among men and nations.\n195.\tTowards the middle of our century, scarcely five years after the Organization was founded in San Francisco, an invisible divisive factor emerged which was sufficiently powerful to impede progress towards the objectives of the Charter. I am referring to the international tension which at that time began to increase to such an extent that we can now say that we are all men and peoples caught in its web. So it was that we entered what has come to be called the cold war, of which the Members of this world Organization have not been able to rid themselves. It is neither difficult to recognize this phenomenon nor easy to control it, for it has so frequently come to hold sway and has even at times caused us to question the utility of our Organization, which is in fact a forum where all the nations of the world may come together to resolve their difficulties. At least, that is what our Organization should be, but the truth is that we wish to achieve perfection, when the human mind cannot fully comprehend what perfection is. We wish to create a perfect society, whereas human perfection does not exist; and, because it does not exist, we rebel and inevitably we yield to the tensions which now beset us. The end result is really only those negative factors which we wished to avoid by creating our Organization and by fulfilling the commitments which we entered into when we became Members of our Organization. This is the agony of our time.\n196.\tIt is for this reason that on the limited horizons of men and nations has arisen the specter of war and of revolutions which seem capable of creating a new world; but we seem to have forgotten that we are living in the \\\"best of all possible worlds\\\" and that the real crisis is that we must reshape our world and bring it into hue with the needs of communities and other changes which have affected most of the things in which we placed our trust when we were as yet uninfluenced by the new forces and pressures which have been the inevitable result of progress and the advancement of civilization.\n197.\tWith the unbridled development of technology, whose visage may yet appear hideous, man has conquered space, and he has also simply been able to survive, to progress and change things but he has at the same time created voids which, it seems, he may not be able to fill.\n198.\tIn the midst o' the agony and confusion which surrounds us we are tempted at times to blame the world for the ills of mankind. But we should not forget that mankind is man; and man goes on, for without man, with all his virtues and all his shortcomings, there can exist no communities or peoples,\n199.\tThe States Members of this Organization which came into existence as a result of the complex event of victory were confident that it would be able to resolve all the problems of the family of nations, all the crises, all the demands, all the quarrels. However, this shift in responsibility has given rise to disillusionment, whereas in reality only an insignificant period of time has elapsed. We have entered a period of crisis in law, which is constantly being forged so as to keep pace with events which occur at the same speed that classical ideas which we clung to for many centuries have evolved.\n200.\tNew ways out of this crisis must be found and new changes in law and international politics must be made, so that the United Nations may be given the necessary instruments, after 26 years of existence, to discharge more effectively its mandate to maintain peace and preserve mankind from the scourge of war.\n201.\tBut nothing can be achieved in this direction if we in this Organization stand in the way of change, which is so urgently needed. At times it would even appear that the requirements of change are at variance with efforts being made in this world forum, and this has given rise to the terrible paradox that whereas on the one hand we wish to maintain confidence in our resolutions and recommendations, on the other hand we are reluctant to bow to our Organization's dictates or to follow the guidelines laid down for emerging from the period of stagnation which, it seems, we have been in for many years.\n202.\tI would venture to hope that, as a result of this session of the General Assembly, our Organization will emerge strengthened. It is to be hoped that it will find, and perhaps also take, the necessary steps to eliminate those obstacles which stand in the way of the smooth functioning of our Organization and its dependent bodies, and we must take a more pragmatic and universal approach to events which give rise to disputes, lack of confidence, suspicion and, to put it quite bluntly, conflicts.\n203.\tIt is for this reason that we wished, first of all, to refer to the idea of a system of international security, for which the Government of the Dominican Republic, at the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly, expressed support. It is also for this reason that we gave favorable consideration to the report of the Secretary-General on the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [A/8431 and Add, 1-5].\n204.\tIf we could add new achievements to our record, it is likely that faith in the United Nations might increase, that distrust among nations would disappear as well as inter-national tension, which is what has disrupted so far the kind of co-operation which must exist among nations if there is to be solidarity and interdependence. And these are the ideals which have not yet found practical expression in spite of efforts to preserve peace in all quarters of the world and to ensure that all peoples will have a right to the common heritage of security, without which we might all return to a period which existed before our present civilization, perhaps even to a time of barbarity. If we could only make progress on these lines, that would surely go a long way towards the settlement of many items on our agenda.\n205.\tUnquestionably, putting an end to the armaments race and using those astronomical sums for social and economic improvements in nations would be one of the most effective ways of ensuring security.\n206.\tThe arms race and military expenditures are also dealt with in the report of the Secretary-General, and these matters deserve the consideration of Member States of this Organization. We realize, however, that this is one of the thorniest and most controversial problems. It concerns most the major Powers, although the considerable sums being expended everywhere in the world to maintain military forces and modern weapons constitute one of the greatest obstacles to economic and social progress, which is so sorely needed because of the changes to which I have referred. But these needs have been ignored so frequently whenever we have reached a standstill on the question of disarmament or considered an end to the arms race, or even a truce in atomic tests and many other related matters which we can scarcely overlook.\n207.\tThe Latin American countries, through their respective heads of State, set forth their positions in Punta del Este in April 1967 with regard to the need to reduce these military budgets, for the same reasons. And the same kind of recommendations were put forward with firm conviction and determination at the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in San Jose, Costa Rica, from 14 to 24 April of this year.\n208.\tOn this subject we cannot fail to endorse the words of a Latin American statesman in San Francisco during the tenth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, when he said:\n\\\"We have faith and confidence in the United Nations because we hope that its labors will give the world a better future and will create an atmosphere of security and tranquility for the fruitful work and the utilization of scientific achievements, which will permit spiritual and physical well-being, progress and general welfare, That faith is unshakable and my country will therefore do its utmost v as it has done in the past, to co-operate in completing the vast task still before us.\n\\\"We realize that not everything depends upon the United Nations alone.\n\\\"The world is now divided into such divergent camps that the United Nations has very often not been in a position to apply its full strength to the completion of Hie task it had begun, a task which would redound to the benefit of mankind.\n\\\"That being th? situation, we must face the problem squarely and speak frankly.\\\" \n209.\tAll this has special relevance to the problems on our agenda, to which I now wish to refer.\n210.\tOn more than one occasion we have felt it appropriate to refer to the views of our Government on the policy of apartheid, especially during tills International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination.\n211.\tEver since the debate in San Francisco that gave rise to our Organization my country has advocated the elimination of discrimination, and we voted in favor of the principles on this subject contained in the Charter.\n212.\tThat occurred more than a quarter-century ago, and what was stated then, in our view, is not restrictive, but we should now spell out what we meant at the time if we are to create the same kind of awareness today as impelled nations at the time to subscribe to these human principles. We shall thus be able to deal with new forms of discrimination which have ccn>e about in the course of the changing lives of men and peoples, and which we trust we have reflected in this statement.\n213.\tGovernments are the concrete manifestation of the State, and peoples are an essential element of nations, and very frequently they must suffer from the consequences of discrimination, which violate one's natural sense of justice and are at odds with the principle of solidarity , for without a desire for justice and solidarity it is difficult to understand why nations would have been willing to become Members of this Organization and work together for progress and peace. That is why we are bound here to speak about a general pattern of discrimination among countries great and small that are Members of the United Nations  between small countries that are Members of the Organization and others that are not yet members and between small Member States and others that have only recently taken on an independent juridical existence after having been dependent Territories and that have become independent in accordance with the processes and procedures laid down by the Charter. A few from this latter category of mmII States, which became independent in accordance with generally accepted principles, have now come to be known disrespectfully as mini-States.\n214.\tThis is not only a discriminatory attitude; it offends the very peoples we wish to support, but what is even more unacceptable is that It seems to suggest that some States can be both independent and not independent at one and the same time.\n215.\tWe are opposed to that kind of discrimination. We do not support it and it should not exist at a time when, thanks to certain ideas which have emerged after many centuries of preparation, the advocates of many religions who were previously at loggerheads can now sit down together at the same table.\n216.\tOecumenical congresses have shown that divergent views can live together, that \\\"isms\\\" can be reconciled, and that ultimately everyone's will favors the commonweal and recognizes our historic destiny.\n217.\tWe see no reason, then, to allow any infringement of the principle of universality in the United Nations, which is the community of communities, more earthly than divine.\n218.\tMy delegation believes that it is quite realistic, then, to maintain our policy on apartheid.\n219.\tWe think that firm policy applies to other matters also-for example, economic, social and technological discrimination; and any monopoly on science, which is also a way of holding up human progress. We would go still further, though we may be accused of going too far and advocating ideals that are impracticable, like many of the structures of Plato's Republic.\n220.\tBut today's world teaches us that ideals are made a reality as a result of momentum provided by progress, which cannot be stopped. And we must realize that ideals are the greatest good man is heir to. So it is that today we may proudly say that man has set foot on the moon, and he may indeed go still further if he pursues his intention to conquer outer space-as one may readily anticipate from recent events.\n221.\tWe trust we are not in error inasmuch as one of the items on our agenda concerns precisely international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space, which produced General Assembly resolution 2733 (XXV).\n222.\tThis matter has a relation, direct or indirect, to the formal note we submitted to the Secretary-General when celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization. In that document we recommended a study of ways and means for depoliticizing outer space, which is another way of setting aside special areas or reserves for peaceful purposes.\n223.\tWe therefore cannot fail to welcome the inclusion of item 33 on our agenda which corresponds to that resolution.\n224.\tIn line with our request to the Secretary-General, which followed the highest. channels, we are pleased that in this Assembly there has emerged the idea of international co-operation in the peaceful use of outer space.\n225.\tMy delegation supports item 31 of the agenda. The Dominican Republic is a party to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (the Treaty of Tlatelolco). We sincerely believe that it is possible to denuclearize the area constituted by the countries of Latin America. We have no reason to assume that an instrument calling for the creation of a nuclear-free zone to ensure that mankind will not disappear from the face of the earth can produce any undesirable effects, for such a zone would come to be a kind of enormous sanctuary against what is mankind's most frightening invention, frightening unless used for peaceful purposes, unless used to safeguard and not to destroy th-* human race.\n226.\tMy delegation supports the idea of using, with discrimination against no one, the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor without infringing on the jurisdictional limits of States, for the benefit of mankind in the future, although we do believe that, until certain matter* that might be termed preliminary questions are resolved, and until genuinely exhaustive studies are carried out on the proposed planning, and until a positive awareness has been created among all States Members of the United Nations as regards the importance of bringing all parties into the agreement, whether Members of the United Nations or not, it will not be possible to reach agreement; and without goodwill, the instruments necessary for those objectives would remain without the necessary ratifications, as has occurred in the case of so many other conventions the ratification of which has for so many years been urged by the Secretary-General.\n227.\tIt is our hope that all difficulties and obstacles standing in the way of such grand and laudable objectives will gradually give way and disappear, and that we shall succeed in getting off to a fresh start in a task which cannot be achieved in a single effort but may require several further attempts, as we know from experience.\n228.\tThose nations that have achieved incredible levels of technology, the Powers that have been able to say that they have the earth's satellite within their reach, thought only of reaching the nearest stage, but none was so pointlessly bold as to try to go beyond that. This is precisely what we should do in so exciting a task as the reservation for exclusively peaceful purposes of the sea-bed and ocean floor, and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\n229.\tBut this should not be taken to imply that at the present time we occupy a negative position and that we do not recognize that possibilities exist for us,\\\" as we have always done, to co-operate in anything that may redound to the benefit of the progress and welfare of mankind.\n230.\tWe do not wish to take a hard and fast position when considering practices that affect human development and the protection of all rights that are or should be juridically protected.\n231.\tWhenever we have had occasion to consider the matter of human rights, we have been overtaken by the thought that someone may take upon himself the privilege of casting the first stone. Our hesitancy in the matter, which seems to us reasonable when dealing with questions iii the Assembly that affect States Members of our Organization or other States, stems from our conviction that certain kinds of violations are a common sin committed by a great number of nations in various geographical areas of the world, and not in one area only.\n232.\tFor this reason, we would be more pleased to see the item concerning the violation of human rights considered as a matter that concerns us all, indivisibly. Accordingly, we should like to see the studies carried out on subject of massive violations considered in tern.\n233.\tWe do not believe that these important questions should concern only certain presumed violators, while not even remotely concerning others. The facts of this matter have she ^'n that frequently the very ones who are at fault are eager to point an accusing finger at their neighbor, and even beyond their neighbor.\n234.\tQuite frequently, in both small and large States, there have been violations of th* right of free transit from the homeland to another land where the people involved believe that they will have greater opportunities or a better life for themselves and for their children.\n235.\tWe have willingly, or almost willingly, remained inactive in the face of actions that could be termed improper in connexion with prisoners of war; and even more inexplicably, in the face of the lack or near lack of provision for the exchange of prisoners or for the praiseworthy activities of the International Red Cross.\n236.\tIn some of these situations events have shown that there has been disregard for conventions and international rules which are based unquestionably on the rule of la w and human rights.\n237.\tThese then are multilateral obligations which are contained in instruments, or regional or international declarations.\n2V. On this occasion we cannot fail to put forward a few views on the existence of the Republic of China in the world Organization. For more than two decades we have given our support on this matter, which has become especially controversial in the General Assembly in the past three years. We are aware of the changes which have occurred in international politics recently,\n239.\tWhen we signed the Charter we were aware that in spite of the fact that the United Nations had been created by the victorious States, even well before the end of the last world war, the major Powers were thinking in terms of the need to concert their efforts before agreeing on a peace treaty or a system which would ban or at least remove the causes and chances of a new all-out war, which might pose a threat to present civilization.\n240.\tThe victorious Powers* as long ago as that, glimpsed the possibility of establishing, with peoples opposing war and cherishing peace peoples who either witnessed or were involved in the greatest catastrophe which, the world had ever seen, and by man's own doing a systematic organization where as a result of the rule of law a remedy might be found to the ills which led to the scourge of war.\n241.\tIn view of these undeniable realities there was an awareness of collective needs which led to the creation of our Organization, open to all and within a spirit of justice.\n242.\tThere was discrimination, to be sure, against the conquered at that time. But with the passage of time the dark clouds which then existed have since disappeared.\n243.\tThere has emerged in our Organization the concept of universality; the right of participation in our Organization by all peoples attached to peace-a just peace-and not to war banned by law, has come to be recognized. Our Organization has a tremendous responsibility to ensure the smooth functioning of the international community at all times. That is why we have always questioned the admission of any Member or the rehabilitation of a Member when it has not met the essential requirements of membership of this Organization. That is the basic provision of Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Charter.\n244.\tIn the circumstances we have always come out in favor of certain principles and accordingly we have never failed Co repudiate all forms of aggression, as required also by the Charter, which it is our duty to support.\n245.\tWe are saying this on behalf of a Member State whose pages of political history reflect the wounds and scars that were caused by failure to respect in  principles proclaimed in San Francisco and generally held to this day.\n246.\tWe know from our own experience just how great the price of peace can be, We are also aware of our great duty to support international solidarity and other values which are equally deserving of respect by all States, It is the duty of all of us to review our positions and to open the door to conciliation and the uncertainties of the future so that we may, with or without skepticism but at least courageously, abandon old traditional patterns to which we have become committed.\n247.\tWith these comments by way of an introduction, we are now prepared to turn to fr subject we have mentioned. We hold the view that the Republic of China should continue as a Member of this Organization. But in order for that to be so, the Dominican Republic at this cross-roads is prepared to compromise when necessary.\n248.\tWe should also like to comment now on the subject of action to be taken against nazism and other totalitarian ideologies and practices.\n249.\tOur country is one which had a dictatorship for more than 30 years. Our people back in the nineteenth century were considered to be one of the most bellicose in the world. We were a courageous and vigorous people who achieved independence with frequent displays of heroism thanks to the sole efforts of its sons. We have been able to survive as a free and sovereign State in spite of the many trials which we have been subjected to.\n250. Only six years have passed since one of the most terrible revolutions ended, which disrupted the entire social and legal structure of the Dominican Republic.\n251.\tWe are quite confident that at all times we have discharged the mandate which was conferred on us when we solemnly declared here that not only the Government which is represented here but also all the people of our nation reject not only nazism and other totalitarian ideologies and practices, but all forms of totalitarianism, open or covert. Our country will vote in all circumstances in keeping with these convictions. We also believe that we are in this way acting strictly in accordance with one of the most important principles of the Constitution of our Republic.\n252.\tAnother matter which we cannot fail to refer to is the situation in the Middle East.\n253.\tWe have briefly considered the question of the necessary reconciliation of all peoples and the need to give momentum to the means at the disposal of our Organization to remove anomalous situations which stand in the way of harmony in the world.\n254.\tWe have always believed that direct negotiations can point the way to goals which at times have seemed unattainable. This method is probably as old as man himself, and it can be effective whenever there has been a willingness to use instruments which reflect the mandates which have been given to the General Assembly and the Security Council.\n255.\tAs Members of the Organization, we have given our moral support to Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and to the Jarring mission. We believe that the door to a settlement satisfactory to all parties is still open. But we believe that in all conflicts or disputes peaceful action is always possible if the unassailable truth that negotiating means persuading, dissuading and compromising is recognized. Similarly, mutual sacrifices are necessary.\n256.\tThe United Nations Conference for Trade and Development is also a matter of keen interest to our country and this is only natural for this is required if we are to do away with under-development, a matter which we have so frequently discussed.\n257.\tWe can say confidently that in recent years we have done a good deal to get out of this impasse, for at the present time a great number of productive forces have been brought together at home and abroad for the common good. This is a contribution made by one and all and not by just a few, and all parties involved have been active. We must all pursue our efforts nationally in trade and development as advocated to some extent by the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development.\n258.\tDespite our hopes, we have been disappointed to see that a number of international agreements essential for the settlement of the serious problem of under-development have been obstructed because of the reluctance of some and because of other negative factors which have emerged in recent international meetings over the past few years.\n259. We optimistically hope that this standstill will be done away with as a result of the momentum provided by the United Nations. \n\n260, May I be allowed to conclude my statement by saying that I hope that this General Assembly session will live up to our expectations. At the same time I would invoke the words of the chairman of the delegation of China at the conclusion of the San Francisco Conference;\n\\\"The United Nations Conference on International Organization has concluded its vitally important mission of writing a Charter. This instrument will, I believe, prove itself to be an epoch-making document and will rank in its contribution to international justice and peace with the Magna Carta and the Constitution of the United States in their contribution to political liberty and representative government.\n"

        "file_text": "36.\t  Mr. President, may I, on behalf of the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic, congratulate you on your election to the high post of President of the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly and wish you every success in the performance of your important duties. I also take great pleasure in congratulating, on behalf of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic, the delegations of Bahrain, Bhutan, Qatar and Oman on the admission of their countries to membership of the United Nations\n37.\tSince I have the honor to address this great forum for the first time and moreover as the representative of a nation which in July this year celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the achievement of its national independence and of its successful development along the path of progress and revolutionary change, I should like to begin my short statement with a few words about my country-the Mongolian People's Republic.\n38.\tThe quintessence of the historical transformation that has taken place in Mongolia over the last 50 years has been the transition of our country from a medieval feudal society to a socialist society, completely bypassing a whole stage in social development, that of capitalism.\n39.\tMongolia, where formerly nomadic cattle-breeding was almost the only branch of the national economy, has now become an agrarian-industrial State with a rapidly growing economy, a country of universal literacy with a modern culture and a constantly increasing standard of living for the people.\n40.\tToday our nation, relying on close co-operation with fraternal socialist countries, is working towards a solution of th<5 vast and sometimes complex problems of building a developed socialist society.\n41.\tSince its foundation, the Mongolian People's Republic has consistently followed a policy of peace and peaceful co-operation among States. It has constantly sided with peace-loving peoples against the forces of international reaction and war and supported the struggle of oppressed and enslaved peoples. That policy stems from the very essence of socialist society and is determined by the constructive tasks of building a new life.\n42.\tIt is therefore quite natural that the Mongolian People's Republic, like the overwhelming majority of the Members of the United Nations, should believe that the cardinal issue of international life today is to maintain and strengthen universal peace and security and stave off the threat of another war. Our Government therefore welcomed the consideration by the General Assembly of the item on the strengthening of international security and the adoption of a Declaration on that question [resolution 2734 (XXV)], which has commanded wide support among the Members of the United Nations and the world community. The Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security contains a whole series of measures which are necessary for the maintenance of peace on the basis of the strict implementation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The aim now is to work out specific measures and recommendations designed to ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration and to find a positive solution to the urgent problems of international life today, the first task being to eliminate existing hotbeds of military conflict and prevent any acts of aggression or any arbitrary conduct in international affairs.\n43.\tThis clearly means that the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security should be the major subject for consideration at this session of the General Assembly, too. In this connexion, we are glad to see that the communique of the consultative meeting of non-aligned countries agreed that the General Assembly should discuss the status of the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security on an annual basis.\n44.\tWe feel that the task of preserving universal peace and eliminating the threat of a world-wide thermonuclear war'S becoming more and more practicable and realizable at that an increasing number of favorable preconditions exist which can guide the United Nations.\n45.\tThe activation of the struggle of peoples in all countries for international security and the growth of the forces of peace and social progress are determining factors. Recognition of this genuine reality paves the way for '.he normalization of international relations and the stabilization of peace. Of special importance in this connexion is the active struggle of the socialist countries against the forces of war and reaction, a struggle which they are waging in alliance with and with the co-operation of peace-loving States and the anti-imperialist democratic forces.\n46.\tThe consistency and purposefulness of the policy of the socialist countries is reflected, for example, in the comprehensive peace program announced at the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. That program contains constructive proposals aimed at the relaxation of international tension, the achievement of new agreements on disarmament and the development of international co-operation in various spheres. The Soviet peace program is commanding increasingly wide support and recognition throughout the world community.\n47.\tA great responsibility rests on our Organization, which can, and must, make a real contribution to the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security. This is even more important in the present circumstances when the world situation is becoming increasingly tense and precarious, although positive elements can be discerned in some areas.\n48.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic is vitally concerned with maintaining peace and security in Asia where acts of aggressions and flagrant interference in the affairs of the peoples of the region still persist.\n49.\tThe continuing war of aggression waged by the United States against the peoples of Indo-China is causing great concern to the peoples of the world. The United States, under the cover of the \\\"Viet-Namization\\\" of the war, is intensifying its punitive activities against the population of South Viet-Nam, escalating its aggression against the peoples of Laos and Cambodia, and resuming the bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam. At the same time the United States of America is sabotaging the quadripartite Paris talks in every possible way and avoiding giving a positive reply to the constructive proposals advanced again and again by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam, in particular the famous seven-point proposal which provides a practical basis for a peaceful settlement of the Viet-Nam problem.\n50.\tThe successes achieved in their heroic struggle by the Viet-Namese and other peoples of Indo-China receiving increasing support from peaco-Ioving forces convincingly demonstrate that any imperialist intrigues against the cause of national liberation and social progress are doomed to total failure.\n51.\tThe Indo-Chinese problem can be settled only on the basis of an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of American troops from the region. People throughout the world are demanding that there should be a speedy end to the neo-colonialist war against the peoples of Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia and that these peoples should be given the opportunity to decide their own fate independently and without outside interference.\n52.\tThe situation in the Middle East is fraught with danger to universal peace; that that situation is still an explosive one on account of the continuing consequences of Israeli aggression against the Arab Republic of Egypt, Syria and Jordan.\n53.\tIt is a well-known fact that at the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly the majority of States Members of the United Nations voted in favor of. resolution 2628 (XXV), calling once again for a speedy settlement of the Middle East crisis in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967. Yet Israel not only continues to hold the occupied Arab territories, but is also taking criminal measures with a view to the complete annexation of a large part of those lands. Tel Aviv is challenging the United Nations and world public opinion in this manner, because it has secured the political, military and financial support of the United States of America and of Zionist circles in some Western countries.\n54.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic and other peace- loving States strongly support the implementation of the provisions of the Security Council resolution, which calls for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories as a first precondition for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East.\n55.\tWe think that the United Nations should make more energetic efforts to eliminate the consequences of Israeli aggression and restore a just and lasting peace in this region in full accordance with the legitimate interests and rights of the Arab peoples, including the Palestinian Arabs.\n56.\tThere are other hotbeds of tension too. In particular, the situation in the Korean peninsula is becoming increasingly tense owing to the continuing military occupation of South Korea by the United States, the rapid rearmament of its puppet army and the fact that South Korea is being made into one of the links in the plot against the peace and tranquility of the peoples of Asia. The United Nations must find an immediate solution to the problem of the withdrawal of American and other foreign troops from South Korea, and dissolve the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. It has a duty to do so because its flag is still being used illegally as a cover for the United States military presence in South Korea and for interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people.\n57.\tThe presence of occupation forces in South Korea and the existence of the so-called United Nations Commission are the major obstacles to the peaceful unification of Korea on a democratic basis. The urgent need for a positive solution to these problems is self-evident. Consequently, our delegation deeply regrets that the United Nations has postponed consideration of these problems, because that postponement is contrary to the interests of the Korean people and the aim of strengthening peace and security in that region.\n58.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic firmly supports the well-known proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a peaceful settlement of the Korean problem proposals which were set forth once again in the eight points of the appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n59,\tAnother cause for concern is the development of events in the Indian subcontinent. We think that the abnormal situation which has arisen in East Pakistan should be settled through political channels in accordance with the interests of its population and on the basis of guaranteeing the safety of refugees returning home.\n60,\tA further aggravation of the situation could not only seriously worsen relations between India and Pakistan but could also adversely affect the international climate. We hope that the leaders of those countries will display statesmanship and a spirit of mutual understanding in the interests of peace and tranquility in the subcontinent and in Asia.\n61,\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic proceeds from the pretense that the expansion of contacts between States in Asia and the development of fruitful co-operation on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's internal affairs would undoubtedly help to establish a stable peace in that part of the world.\n62,\tIn this connexion, our delegation welcomes the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union this year with the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Republic of India. We regard these instruments as an important factor which serves to strengthen peace and the spirit of co-operation in Asia and the Middle East,\n63,\tAs I have already said, the Mongolian People's Republic supports the development of normal relations between States in the general interests of strengthening peace and international co-operation.\n64,\tIn this context, dialog between China and the United States on the normalization of relations between them does not surprise us in any way. But time will show how this \\\"normalization\\\" will meet the long-term interests of peace, national independence and the social progress of peoples in Asia and elsewhere.\n65,\tDevelopments in Europe show that positive improvements are taking place there which could lead to a thaw and improve the climate of relations between European States, These changes have been made possible mainly through the purposeful policy and tireless efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in Europe. The treaties with the Federal Republic of Germany concluded by the Soviet Union  and the Polish People's Republic  are of great importance and reflect the reality of the political and territorial changes that have taken place in central Europe as a result of the Second World War. We believe that a rapid ratification of these treaties would enhance their constructive role in reducing tension and creating an atmosphere of trust between States in Europe and throughout the world.\n66.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic shares the view that the agreement on West Berlin  recently reached by the USSR, the United States, France and the United Kingdom will be a real contribution to the relaxation of tension in Europe and the improvement of the prospects for peace and security in that region. Yet another step in this direction would be the normalization of relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany based on the recognition of the non-validity of the Munich Agreement from the very outset.\n67.\tAnother constructive development is that the idea of convening an all-European conference on matters relating to security and co-operation is becoming more and more feasible. If such a conference were convened and if it were successful, it would help to reduce international tension and would establish a solid basis for a system of collective security in Europe.\n68.\tAmong the most serious causes of increased inter-national tension are the last vestiges of colonialism, the intensified intrigues of colonialist and racist forces aimed at impeding the exercise of the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination and independence,\n69.\tThe situation which has developed in southern Africa is a cause of concern to the world community.\n70.\tThe United Nations must seek more effective means to ensure the full implementation of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 15 ^ (XV)].\n71.\tOur delegation welcomes the steps taken this year to co-ordinate and combine the work of three United Nations bodies the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the Special Committee on Apartheid and the United Nations Council for Namibia. It is to be hoped that concerted and effective measures to eliminate colonialism and racism, which derive from an inhuman ideology, will follow.\n72.\tThe strengthening of universal peace and security depends essentially on finding a solution to the problems of limiting and halting the arms race and on reaching agreement on general and complete disarmament under strict international control. In present circumstances, when the arms race and, in particular, the nuclear arms race is continuing unrestrained and consuming vast human and material resources, the problem of disarmament has become more urgent than ever before.\n73.\tAn important act of the last anniversary session of the General Assembly was the approval of the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof [resolution 2660 (XXV)]. Our delegation welcomes the first results of the jSoviet-American talks on the Limitation of strategic arms. We feel that agreement on more substantive measures in this field would be a real contribution to disarmament.\n74.\tThe problems of halting the nuclear arms race and averting the threat of a nuclear missile war should have a special place in the system of disarmament measures. In this context, the proposal of the Government of the USSR to convene a conference of the five nuclear Powers to consider problems of nuclear disarmament [A/8491] is most timely. Merely to convene such a conference would be an important event in that the talks would, for the first time, involve all the nuclear Powers. It would be hard to find any real justification for refusing to participate in such a conference, particularly in view of the responsibility of the nuclear Powers towards humanity.\n75.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic attaches particular importance to the Soviet proposal to convene a world disarmament conference [A/L,631]. We hope that this peaceful initiative will receive unanimous support from all States. The Mongolian delegation welcomes the position taken by the non-aligned countries which have also called for such a conference at the proper time, and with the participation of all States.\n76.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic, like other socialist countries and peace-loving States, attaches great importance to the problem of eliminating other types of weapons of mass destruction, namely, chemical and bacteriological means of warfare. We hope that at this session the General Assembly will approve the draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons [A/8457- DC/234, annex A], submitted by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. The real importance of this convention is that when it enters into effect it will for the first time remove from the arsenal of weapons one type of weapon of mass destruction. Once again our delegation stresses the need for an early agreement on the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons.\n77.\tOur delegation agrees with the view that an important factor in the strengthening of international security is the normalization of international economic relations, the development of co-operation between States on a basis of equality, mutual benefit, justice and due regard for the legitimate interests and requirements of develops countries.\n78.\tThe United Nations cannot remain indifferent to the fact that on the whole the position of developing countries in the capitalist economy has been noticeably deteriorating in recent years. The intensification of the monetary and financial crisis of capitalism is seriously affecting the economies of developing countries and aggravating this already difficult situation.\n79.\tThe United Nations can and must play an effective role in introducing new and just democratic principles into international economic relations and in removing artificial discriminatory barriers to the development of trade and economic co-operation between States.\n80.\tIn present conditions it is particularly important to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations. Our delegation believes that its effectiveness should be ensured above all through the strict observance of the Charter. As experience has shown, the slightest deviation from the principles and purposes of the Charter has always dealt a blow to the prestige of our Organization and prejudiced the cause of peace and international security .\n81.\tAnother important matter is the observance of the principle of the universality of the United Nations. That principle derives from the very essence of the aims and tasks of our Organization.\n82.\tProceeding from this premise, we have supported and continue to support the admission to the United Nations of all independent peace-loving States which recognize the high purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and wish to participate in its activities. This could only redound to the benefit of international co-operation and result in the strengthening of the peace and security of peoples.\n83.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic continues to support the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and the expulsion of the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from all United Nations bodies.\n84.\tWe support the simultaneous admission to the United Nations of the two German States, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The crux of the matter is that the United Nations and, in particular, some of its organs, continue to discriminate against the German Democratic Republic, a socialist State on German soil. That country is making a constructive contribution to the normalization of the situation in Europe, and the strengthening of peace in that continent and throughout the world. The German Democratic Republic, as one of the highly developed countries of the world., maintains extensive political and economic ties with other countries and advocates the strict observance of the Charter of the United Nations in relations between States. Our delegation is firmly convinced that the time has come to put an end to discrimination against the German Democratic Republic.\n85.\tMay I express the hope that this twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly will contribute to the solution of the urgent problems of international life for the sake of strengthening mutual understanding and cooperation among States, and consolidating the peace and security of peoples. Any positive move by the United Nations in this direction will have the full support of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic, the constant aim of whose foreign policy remains the promotion of peace and friendly co-operation among peoples.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\tMr. President, this great Assembly made a very wise choice when it placed the reins of its deliberations in the hands of a man of such great experience and political wisdom as yourself. The outstanding role played by your country in creating the group of non-aligned nations and in strengthening the third world already stands as a symbol. Bandung, in fact, was the spearhead of the diplomatic, political and economic campaign launched by the new States. All those factors assure and promise the successful conclusion of our discussions. The delegation of Burundi endorses the congratulations and best wishes that have been extended to you.\n2.\tThe commemorative session was presided over by a man whose competence, devotion, tact and of international affairs have earned him our resist. I refer to Mr. Edvard Hambro. His invaluable contribution and wise assistance not only to the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, which benefited from his direction, but to the United Nations in general have earned our admiration and esteem. We repeat our gratification at the way in which he presided.\n3.\tIn the view of the Republic of Burundi, which lives in the very core of the realities and economic awareness of the disinherited world, economic development must be the main concern of the international community.\n4.\tFurthermore, to us under-development is totally incompatible with security, which is the primary concern of this Organization.\n5.\tOne of the fundamental objectives written into the Charter 25 years ago was the imperative need to create conditions of stability and well-being and to assure a minimum standard of living compatible with human dignity, through progress and economic and social development. While part of mankind lives in comfort, if not luxury, another-and greater-part vegetates in discomfort and need, and the gap separating them becomes ever wider. The developing countries are excluded from the process of integration and the evolution of modern technology, which have spread so rapidly in the developed regions of the world.\n6.\tThat material need contributes to increasing tensions in the world and, were it to be allowed to continue or grow, it must inevitably constitute a grave threat to world peace. We can never sufficiently stress that the road to peace and justice passes through development. Obviously, as the Charter of Algiers stresses, the main responsibility is incumbent upon the developing countries to assume the burden of their own development. But they cannot rapidly achieve the desired goals unless the developed countries place greater financial resources at their disposal and adopt more favorable economic and trade policies towards them. International co-operation for development must measure up to the needs of the problem itself; partial, sporadic and half-hearted gestures cannot suffice. United Nations assistance is of particular significance to these countries since it is in keeping with their own interests and in accord with the principles of national sovereignty, But the capacity of the United Nations to grant such assistance should be increased, as provided for in the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)], so that the Organization will be able to fulfill the great responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter.\n7.\tIn the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development fUNCTADJ, arrangements for the setting up of preferential treatment to be given the exports from the needy countries in the markets of the developed nations were adopted by the Trade and Development Board at its fourth special session  and now form part of the International Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n8.\tBefore the third session of UNCTAD, to be held in Santiago, Chile, next spring, the prices of raw materials will have to be stabilized, along with the prices of the basic commodities from which our countries derive the greater part of their currency and income.\n9.\tContributions to the United Nations Development program [UNDP] should be increased. That assistance, \nwhile deeply appreciated by my country, is still inadequate. We would suggest to the UNDP authorities that they adapt the minimal counterpart contributions to the economic possibilities of the recipient countries in order to speed up the launching of programs that have been worked out, It would indeed be paradoxical if the less developed countries, for whom the programs have been planned, were not able to take advantage of them because of the high counterpart contributions expected of them.\n10.\tGenerally speaking, the decade from 1960 to 1970 was discouraging. That failure can be attributed to the behavior of the developed countries, which held back on the material and human resources required for the success of the program. But the discouragements and disappointments of yesterday must not prevent us from working to achieve the objectives of a really ambitious development program. This new decade should be a step forward towards the welfare and happiness not only of the present generation but of generations yet to come. The developed countries must, within the framework of bilateral and multilateral programs alike, give more, to bolster the resources of the developing countries.\n11.\tSpecific attention must be paid to the needs of the least economically advanced countries of the third world by encouraging the taking of more intensive action to solve clearly defined problems and by laying down policies of aid and technical assistance which are easily applicable, in volume and in quality, to those countries in order to enable them to set about catching up without delay. We must also call for geological research to be carried out in a much more systematic way and more in keeping with local conditions.\n12.\tOnce again I would draw the attention of the international community to the case of the land-locked countries. Adequate financial and technical assistance, both bilateral and multilateral, should be made available to them in order to ensure the expansion, improvement and maintenance of their transport and communications services.\n13.\tPeace and security are the constant and universal aspirations of man, but the will of States to fulfill them seems paradoxical. The inability or unwillingness of governments to achieve an objective so vital and so ardently desired by humanity was pointed out by Jean Jaures, who said in an article in L 'Humanite of 27 October 1907:\n\\\"The only combination that the peaceful imagination of peoples can think of is to assure the permanent existence of the most overwhelming military apparatus. An alien from outside the planet, on hearing the clash of arms, the sound of great cannons as they are dragged over the cobblestones of towns and bursts of shots on the firing ranges, would doubtless be convinced that the peoples of the earth were dreaming of only one thing: to fly at one another's throats. But if at the same time that alien could hear the declarations of the heads of State and the words of peace repeated by all he would be forced to say, 'What hypocrisy! ' or 'What madness! ' It is we who must choose.\\\"\n14.\tInsecurity today is due to the paradox caused by States which, despite their apparent desire for peace, refuse to cease arming but instead multiply their stockpiles. The peace and security of the world will be in danger unless the nuclear-weapon States decide to do away with the contradiction in which they have sealed themselves-aspiring to peace without shedding the burdensome arms race.\n15.\tIt is true that the nuclear competition is caused by the mutual suspicion of those who possess the fatal weapons, but fate wills it that those countries possessing such nuclear arsenals also possess the greatest resources. If the worst should happen and the apocalyptic event occur, those nuclear Powers would suffer disproportionate losses. To understand even imperfectly the extent of the material and human damage a thermo-nuclear war could cause, we should imagine that suddenly the millions of human beings of each continent were destroyed and the fabulous economic resources wiped out; spectacular technological progress, and all prodigious installations of all types, would be pulverized.\n16.\tIt is true that the great Powers endeavor to limit the risk of the possible outbreak of nuclear war, but despite the signature in the last 10 years of five treaties to prevent such a catastrophe the danger has not been entirely eliminated.\n17.\tThere is only one way of avoiding that catastrophe, and that is the radical if not total elimination of weapons and missiles to preserve our planet and ensure the survival of mankind. However costly they might be, undertakings to remove from mankind the nuclear scourge must be speed up. It is in the interests of all mankind that the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT/ in Helsinki between the two giants continue and lead to results that will exorcise the great dangers hanging over mankind.\n18.\tThe Powers that redouble their endeavors to establish a general discussion of disarmament are taking a long-range and global view of the matter, and in that respect the Government of Burundi wishes to welcome the courageous proposal to hoH a world disarmament conference.\n19.\tSome months ago it was suggested that there be a conference between the five great nuclear Powers. Because of the extreme importance and great significance of such a conference, we believe it is imperative that it be held; and, in order to achieve fully whatever objectives are set for it, it should be a summit conference-that is, it should be at the level of the heads of State of those Governments possessing nuclear secrets.\n20.\tThe scandalous squandering of financial resources on military expenditures is one of the burdensome consequences of the nuclear arms race. The possible outbreak of nuclear war has fortunately not yet materialized, but the massive sapping of material wealth caused by the stockpiling of nuclear weapons is already affecting the world economy.\n21.\tThe United Nations, which is considered the highest body and the one most capable of safeguarding peace, ekes out a bare living. But the nuclear Powers still do not hasten to replenish the treasury of a foundering Organization,\n22.\tThe enormous burden of massive armaments is an open assault on economic and social development. If only half the astronomical budgets spent in the military fields were to be freed for economic and social objectives, not only would man's standard of living be significantly improved but the general conditions of mankind would be infinitely improved.\n23.\tMy Government sincerely hopes that the envisaged successive summit conferences in Peking and Moscow will concentrate on specific and definitive ways of achieving general and complete disarmament.\n24.\tThe evolution of the colonized peoples has in the last few years led to a spate of decolonization and the geographical modification of the world. This phenomenon of profound change has been particularly felt in Africa in the course of the last 10 years.\n25.\tAs far as Africa is concerned, security is closely linked to decolonization, the process of which has been hampered by a Portugal at bay that does all in its power to oppose the irreversible and powerful course of history. While the world unites against outmoded colonial domination, the Portuguese authorities defy all principles of justice and morality and use all their military might in a battle doomed in advance by history.\n26.\tThe specter of the war? unleashed in Africa by Lisbon in the last 10 years has caused great concern. The duration of those wars, the lack of information on the enormous losses in human life and in material possessions may at times divert the attention of some and the vigilance of others. And thus certain circles are tempted to attach only secondary importance to this acute problem.\n27.\tColonial domination, with all its consequences, must inevitably vitiate human relations and threaten the security and sovereignty of innocent States. In this case, peace in that splendid continent of Africa is gravely jeopardized -and not only in Angola, Mozambique, Rhodesia, Guinea (Bissau) and Namibia; the threat also extends to sovereign States as attested to by the recurrent attacks of Portugal against the Republics of Zambia, Senegal and Guinea.\n28.\tThe self-destructive nature of the colonialism and racism that the Lisbon-Salisbury-Pretoria axis is trying to perpetuate in Africa has led to many yearly condemnations by States Members of the United Nations. Therefore I shall not speak at great length on the aberrant immorality of apartheid and of the colonial wars which have been stigmatized by alL\n29.\tI should like to show the weakness and the short-sightedness of the racist and colonialist policies. In the course of the last 10 years a number of Powers with forces and resources obviously greater than those possessed by Portugal itself and by a South Africa confronted by the mass uprisings of 17 million of its inhabitants have given up colonial Territories and established with them new relations as partners.\n30.\tIf trade and economic interests have led European and American countries to follow these racial and colonial disturbances at times complacently, such an attitude will be profoundly altered when the monopoly over the natural resources is no longer possessed exclusively by Pretoria in Africa.\n31.\tPortuguese and white South Africans lull themselves with the idea that they are the proteges of certain foreign States. The earlier economic forces that allowed the racists to impose their trade dictatorship and to exchange political support for gold or diamonds now have to seek other horizons.\n32.\tIt is true that the colonial and racial wars that afflict Africa seem very distant to European ana American spectators and do not seem directly to affect the interests of the latter. However, lately the intensification of these wars and their continuation might very seriously jeopardize co-operation between the two partners, Africa and Europe.\n33.\tFurthermore, the stubborn resistance for decades of the movements of liberation in southern Africa, despite 150,000 Portuguese troops, and despite the ultra-modern South African arsenals, proves how far the dominated people are ready to go to overcome all obstacles and to confront all dangers.\n34.\tIf these movements of liberation did not give up when they were left to themselves, how can it be thought likely that they will disarm at a time when the military and material resources of an entire continent are increasingly being used to complete decolonization?\n35.\tPerhaps I should say that the assistance given by the African States to the movements of liberation is not assistance given out of military dilettantism. The openness and generosity of our Governments, the Manifesto on Southern Africa,  and the mission last year of President Kaunda-whose mandate was then transferred to President Moktar Ould Daddah- attest to the fact that Africa prefers a peaceful settlement to colonial and racial problems.\n36.\tIn the eyes of the warlike dominating group in southern Africa, the mission entrusted to the pilgrims of peace Africa may seem to be proof of weakness. But, it is thank to the ability, to the political far-sightedness and the moral strength of the African leaders that the Organization of African Unity placed its feet on the path of agreement among all States in order to overcome the arrogant intransigence of those regimes, bogged down as they are in racism and colonialism.\n37.\tA mediating role by the Western Powers would succeed in safeguarding European and African co-operation and ensuring peaceful coexistence of African States too. But that co-operation, obeying as it does historical imperatives and the mutual needs of all, must be established first between the former metropolitan countries-including Portugal and South Africa-and the new States. On the other hand, the intimate ties that should link the two partners would be threatened if independence is to be conquered by force against the will of the colonial or racial Power.\n38.\tThe cult of colonialism and racism in southern Africa deprives man of both his dignity and his nobility. The damage caused by these Siamese twins is not limited to its direct victims in Africa. They threaten and seriously hamper the final reconciliation between Africa and Europe and create a barrier to that understanding. If the European leaders are determined to wipe out from our continent the machinery of apartheid and colonialism, they would contribute to restoring harmonious relations between the two great partners, Africa and Europe. Apart, of course, from the moral and political obligation incumbent upon them, the Europeans themselves because of mere far-sightedness, if not egoism, would profit greatly from revising and changing their alliances with Portugal and South Africa. To safeguard future relations between Europeans and Africans they ought to assist Africa to achieve total independence.\n39.\tA totally freed and independent Africa, far from closing itself against the world, would open itself up to universal solidarity and co-operation. Such co-operation and solidarity would be extended both to socialist Europe and to capitalist Europe, both to the Soviet Union and the United States of America, both to Latin America and to Asia.\n40.\tThis Africa campaign of co-operation and solidarity would not be intended to bar or exclude Portugal or South Africa. If the Portuguese and the white South Africans instead of barring the road to political and racial emancipation were to decide to assist us, the vocation of co-operation and solidarity felt by Africa would give immediate attention to the establishment between the new nations to be created and the former metropolitan country of the closest of relations: with South Africa, because of its geographical proximity, and with Portugal, because of a historic affinity.\n41.\tThe African continent is on the threshold of a great economic boom, which it is ready to share with the rest of the world. That is why we call for the eradication of racism and colonialism in southern Africa; part of the strengthening of international security and the ensuring of economic independence.\n42.\t\\\"Western Humanism must be preserved even if through fanatical racism and colonialism\\\": the advocates of such a theory and the missionaries of such a holy doctrine, have for centuries kept bottled up that very humanism in whose name they spoke and which they considered themselves destined to teach to a tiny elite of racists and colonialists. The fact of the matter is that the civilizing crusade is today an extremely jealously guarded private domain. The spreading of that humanism is entrusted to the white circles and is only doled out in dribbles to other races.\n43.\tI shall refrain from illustrating this aberration with South Africa, Namibia and Rhodesia, where racial supremacy needs no proof.\n44.\tThe irrefutable evidence coming from Portuguese colonies refutes the myth that thus far had been believed in certain circles and according to which racial discrimination was non-existent in the countries under Portuguese domination. The Portuguese with duplicity in vain tried to disseminate the story that repression of innocents did not take place.\n45.\tThe Reverend Jean-Pierre Pickard, a man of God who is not a partisan nor obedient to any political organization, described the human and physical degradations to which the Africans were subjected by the colonialists of Lisbon -and I quote from Jeune Afrique of 22 June 1971:\n\\\"The Portuguese political police arrest men without the shadow of a mandate; they punish them, they whip them, they torture them cruelly in order to have them admit whatever they are told. In the light of these tortures we are impotent.\\\"\n\\\"You can count on the fingers of one hand the blacks registered at the university.\\\"\n\\\"We note tremendous discriminations because equal work does not receive equal pay. In the great firms there are black, mulatto and European welders. For the same work the black is paid 1,800 escudos, the mulatto between 3,800 and 4,000 escudos and the European between 7,000 and 10,000 escudos. This is flagrant injustice, and these are specialized workers. The salary of ordinary workers is kept very low, because it is about 500 escudos per month.\\\"\n46.\tWe have seen efforts made to subject the church to the Portuguese state. A series of events that have taken place in clerical circles that oppose colonial and racial policies show that the Vatican is not going to give Portugal the title of \\\"the oldest child of the Church\\\". The efforts of Pretoria and Lisbon to treat the Church as a power to be made subject to the state have failed miserably.\n47.\tThe denunciation of racist and colonialist doctrines by the Church itself has increased in tempo. In June 1970 His Holiness Paul VI, profoundly concerned over the inhuman fate imposed on the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), granted to the nationalist leaders of these three States an audience that has since become historic and that has been a great comfort to the liberators of those countries. By that most magnanimous gesture, the head of the Catholic Church strengthened and reiterated the stern opposition of Christianity to any subjection of peoples- whether under the title of colonialism or under that of racism.\n48.\tThe return of the missionary fathers from Mozambique in May was also a significant stage in the decolonizing role of the Church. Under the enlightened aegis of the Very Reverend Father-General Theo Van Aster and his immediate assistant, Reverend Father Wally Neven, the Society of Missionaries of Africa decided unanimously to be expelled from their second country rather than bow to the will of the oppressor Government. This was a shattering decision since it meant that they would have to give up a flourishing ministry, vA it was a sad departure since it meant the separation of the sheep from their shepherd, depriving them of the devotion of which they had been the object.\n49.\tHowever mortifying this choice may have been for both the people of Mozambique and for the White Fathers, it nevertheless reflects the true message of the Church since it is in keeping with its mission of Salvation. The echo of the Church as carried by the missionaries of Africa will be considered much more helpful and healthy than the voice of other congregations that have yielded to the Portuguese dictatorship and become as clay in their hands.\n50.\tThe arrival of the People's Republic of China in this Assembly will presage a new world balance. For 20 years the absence of this giant has been part of each year's debates in the General Assembly. The gap caused by that absence has been deeply felt. The stage of arguments for or against the presence of 'He People's Republic of China in the United Nations has now been irrevocably left behind.\n51.\tThe Government of Burundi is truly gratified by the evolution of the Chinese question both during the twenty- fifth session, and bilaterally in the course of last summer. Among those events that best celebrated the silver jubilee of the United Nations we should mention the fact that the majority of the Members of the United Nations were in favorF of the restoration of the People's Republic of China to its true place and this has opened up a new era. Moreover, the decision of the Government of the United States to go along with those who were in favor of that return, and the projected visit of the American Head of State to Peking is also an important milestone in the search for peace.\n52.\tThe crucial step has been taken, and the bringing together of positions that were at one time diametrical between those who opposed and those who advocated the return of the Government of Peking have led to an important step and will be a trump in the hands of the United Nations. We do not need to go into the reasons for advocating the entry of this vast country into the United Nations, since all participants in these meetings have recognized the absolute need and the obvious inevitability of it.\n53.\tIt is of great importance to world peace that the movement towards that date be speed up and that the entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations take place as soon as possible. The weight of industrious Chinese, a nation whose population constitutes more than a quarter of the population of the world, the third in surface with its 9,780,000 square kilometers after the USSR and Canada, will re-establish a new balance in the world community.\n54.\tConsistent with its policy of effective and positive neutrality, the Republic of Burundi takes a stand devoid of hostility or partiality for or against any country. This position, which has been a feature of the foreign policy of the Government of Burundi, still prevails when we discuss the People's Republic of China. The Burundian decision on the Chinese question is in no way intended to prejudge the views expressed by other delegations. Our position has been dictated by the great value that we, as a non-aligned nation, attach to peace and to the objectives and ideals of the Charter. It is therefore in obedience to Article 2 of the Charter that my delegation feels it cannot turn from its imperative duty, namely, to recognize the indivisible entity, the inalienable sovereignty, and the territorial integrity, of the People's Republic of China.\n55.\tAlexander the Great said that the earth could not tolerate two suns and the same applies to the United Nations, whose helpful role should now be deployed in order to encourage, if not to assure, a true reintegration within the great Chinese society of that part that was separated from it through historical events.\n56.\tThe entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations will be the first step towards a final settlement of a national problem that has lasted 22 years. If we approach the question from that standpoint, the restoration of lawful rights of the People's Republic of China will not cause the ostracism of one part of China, nor pit the citizens of the same country against one another. It is the magnanimity of the mother country and the members of the Formosa diaspora that will have to achieve the fraternal reconciliation without retaliation but in accordance with the ancient Chinese wisdom which says that water does not remain on the mountain side nor vengeance in a great heart.\n57.\tTo those who have been separated from their homeland, let us guarantee, perhaps through the United Nations mediation, a recovery of their right of citizenship and the realization of how desirable it will be to go back to the gigantic newly reunited China, possessing a weight and a destiny of planetary proportions.\n58.\tUnder the impulse of the movement of history our Organization is now on the threshold of working with a new international chess-board. The United Nations has not succeeded completely in doing away with the flouting of human rights in much of Africa and other parts of the world. The First United Nations Development Decade was discouraging and has resulted only in bitter disappointment for the third world. The efforts undertaken in the field of disarmament, although progressively converging towards a single goal, have achieved only meager results. All those failures tend to annoy some and to make others more skeptical.\n59.\tAt the present stage, without wiping out everything that this Organization has done, it would be sterile merely to repeat and to make an inventory of its previous failures, if we dwell too much on the failures that time itself is blurring we may wind up merely discouraged. As the architects of an international society, all Members must help to guarantee a shining future for the Organization. We should now work to devise a plan for future action. To guarantee success in our renewal and to achieve the dedication, I hardly think one needs to stress that we have to arm ourselves against a three-fold danger: the wait-and-see attitude of the resigned, the pessimism of the discouraged and the quietism of the complacent.\n60.\tIn the course of previous years the States of the third world in general, and the non-aligned nations in particular, linked as they were by their community of needs and identity of destiny, were successful in many ways that should be stressed.\n61.\tAmong large-scale achievements, those nations were able to derive legitimate satisfaction from what they had done and to gain new strength to fight war, achieve peace and eliminate racism, colonialism and economic underdevelopment. Thanks to their converging and joint efforts, the world of today has become much more aware of this triple nightmare that still obsesses our Organization. The circle of non-aligned nations is becoming wider. With the People's Republic of China returning to our Organization, the United Nations will be endowed with new virtues and new abilities. That is why we should consider the future from a standpoint of growing optimism. We must galvanize ourselves to take the next step, with the certainty of triumphing over earlier vicissitudes.\n62.\tTo be healthy, the dynamism which must be impressed on the future action of the United Nations must be a reflection if not of unanimity at least of universality. To give the international community the proposed new impetus is a join t and gigantic task, since it will govern the universal destiny of mankind, and for that purpose we must guarantee survival through peace and material growth through economic development.\n63.\tThe characteristics of the United Nations in the future will obviously be different from the present ones: the political constancy which the United Nations and its organs have shown thus far will no longer be confronted by new dangers.\n64.\tThe very variety of the components of this institution precludes its becoming a monolithic Organization or a faithful self-portrait of a club of colossi. Through its universal vocation it is called inevitably to become the true echo of universality reflected in both its acts and its decisions.\n65.\tIt is true that it is on the giants that the future of mankind and the primacy of peace rest. I must say that my apologia for the preponderance of the part played by the great Powers in safeguarding peace is not intended to catalog them or, naturally, to set them up as titanic States, ready to eclipse all others. I draw a conclusion based on realism and the fact that we must admit the undeniable hegemony of the five great Powers: the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, France, the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a supremacy which they exercise by virtue of the very nuclear panoply that they possess and their immensity-as I have said on other occasions-in all fields, political, economic and military. There can be no doubt that it is they who are best placed to achieve the salvation of mankind through their effective determination to turn the United Nations into a powerful guardian of peace. Endowed as they are, with immense powers, agreement among them will allow them to act as sure and supreme guarantors of peace and of the authority of the United Nations.\n66.\tPeace and security, however, do not fall solely and exclusively within the competence of the five great Powers, since according to Article 2 of the Charter it is to the collective efforts of all Members of the Organization that the world has entrusted its future. Every State, regardless of its resources, contributes its part as a member of the single human family.\n67.\tIt is by virtue of this principle-of the community of responsibility if not necessarily the equality of power, that the Organization of African UyJty is now assuming its own rights and also fulfilling its duties in a conflict in the Middle East through the committee of 10 wise men of our continent.\n68.\tDespite the impatience felt at the lack of progress in the settlement of the Middle East conflict, my delegation will abstain from speaking or. the matter until we have heard the results of the mission that the Organization of African Unity has sent to the region. However, we must make a heart-felt appeal that no obstacles may be placed in the path of this new pilgrimage of peace, and we would repeat the obligation of all parties concerned to comply fully with the request of the OAU and with the terms of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) that has been only partially echoed thus far.\n69.\tIn that part of the world more than elsewhere, the formulas, the procedures and the principles employed at the time of the Treaties of Westphalia and Vienna are still fashionable. The same wars break out on the same frontiers, following the same grandiose and tedious processes of history. In the age of the atomic bomb, our imperturbable international law still deals with armed conflicts as though they were the normal activities of States, whereas the concept of sovereignty is considered the right to unleash hostilities.\n70.\tIn the nuclear age how can antagonists still be unable to conceive of other solutions than those of war to resolve their traditional rivalries? As in the Middle Ages each Government feels that it is justified and consoled by contending that its weapons are used to defend peace. To make matters worse, each considers its weapons to be defensive, those of the other side offensive, and that its war is therefore \\\"a just war\\\".\n71.\tIn the course of a decade beset by difficult and complex tribulations, UThant has shown a proverbial devotion to the United Nations. Apart from this cult of international peace, this beacon of Asian civilizations refined over the centuries, he has been a model of the inherent virtues and qualities in an overwhelming intricate and complex position through his integrity, his serenity, his indefatigable struggle for peace, his overwhelming magnanimity and his edifying levelheadedness.\n72.\tFine flower of the sublime values of Asia, U Thant. has impressed his character on the destiny of our Organization. The last fruits of his role are the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice which dismissed Pretoria, and the imminent arrival of the People's Republic of China. In one word, he has lived up to the vision and the vocation of universality which must be the main feature of a Secretary- General.\n73.\tThe renovating genius that he showed in convening and holding the first World Youth Assembly  is far from being a mere passive heritage that he is leaving for future generations: its continuation and renewal are indispensable. The youth of today confronts the world. In the light of these facts, this Organization cannot judge it without concern. The contribution and assistance of youth today are very necessary at a time when the international community is starting out on a new road. The community must not only talk to youth: the community will survive only as long and as far as it benefits from the vitality of youth. The wisdom and maturity of age can improve the yield of all levels if these trumps are based on the ardor, the enthusiasm and the science of the new generations and the devotion of the youth of today. \n74.\tI conclude by saying that to avoid a recurrence of its past infirmities, this Organization should undertake a global and simultaneous strategy to wipe from our planet racism, colonialism, under-development and the ever present nightmare and threat of a nuclear apocalypse.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "32.\t Permit me first of all, Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of Niger, to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the highly responsible post of President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly, The unanimous choice of your person testifies to the confidence placed in your eminence as a statesman and an experienced diplomat, but it is also a deliberate and carefully reflected choice of your great country, which is a symbol of liberty, the historic site of the awakening of the third world, which was \\\"rushed under the yoke of colonialism and under development. Bandung 1955 still echoes in our hearts as the rallying cry of all the oppressed peoples of the earth for their determined march towards liberty and dignity. We are particularly pleased because your visit of friendship to our country two years ago strengthened even further the bonds of solidarity and fraternity between our two peoples,\n33.\tMay I also, Sir, take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Hambro, who served so admirably as President of the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session.\n34.\tI should like now to address myself to U Thant, the distinguished Secretary-General of our Organization, to convey to him the feelings of confidence and high esteem of the President of the Republic of Niger and his Government towards him personally. Indeed, for 10 years he has carried out an overwhelming task and defended the ideal of the United Nations with vigor and perseverance. I should like to express to him once again our gratitude, and to repeat to him here, publicly, the profound hope of my Government that he will find it possible to renew his tenure of office.\n35.\tI should like also to express our feelings of friendship with, and to bid welcome to our great universal family, to the new States of Bahrain, Bhutan, Qatar and Oman and to assure them of our total and sincere co-operation.\n36.\tSpeaking after so many distinguished representatives who have preceded me, I shall not dwell at any great length on the great international problems which still await solution and which sometimes arise again in more pressing form to threaten world peace. I should like, in passing, to express regret at what might be considered a gradual weakening of the powers originally conferred on the Assembly by the United Nations Charter. A mere glance at the list of items on the agenda of this session shows clearly that most of the urgent questions upon which world peace and security depend have been circumvented -and, what is even worse, the Security Council itself has practically been denied the opportunity to deal with the most thorny problems, That is a situation which we believe to be most disturbing.\n37.\tHaving said that, we can nevertheless express satisfaction regarding some matters.\n38.\tIn the Middle East, although a final solution is not yet in sight, it must be noted that the cease-fire has been respected for a year and there are certain grounds for hoping for at least the beginning of a detente and a partial solution.\n39.\tI should like to repeat here the unreserved support of my Government for Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which should be implemented without further delay. We are in favor of the right of peoples to self-determination, and it is on that basis that the problem of Palestine, including the status of Jerusalem, must be resolved. Recently we considered it a good sign that the two sides, the United Arab Republic and Israel, had accepted the principles of a visit from the Committee of African Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity, entrusted with seeking new approaches for attaining a just and lasting solution. -\n40.\tIn Europe, we note with satisfaction the signing, on 3 September 1971, after long and arduous negotiations, of an agreement among the four occupying Powers on the status of Berlin. Although that Agreement does not bring any final solution to the distressing problem of the division of Germany, it none the less represents a step forward and gives us reason to hope for new measures which will lighten the burden of armaments and further relax tensions between East and We*''\n41.\tIn the same context we impatiently await tangible results from the SALT negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of anti-ballistic rocket systems and offensive strategic weapons. We also hope that the efforts of the great Powers in that area will not cease there but will lead to progressive disarmament measures, which will free for other, more humane tasks the enormous sums of money squandered each year on the arms race.\n42.\tIn the Far East we glimpse 'a\\\" real hope in the Indo-China peninsula, which has not known true peace for more than 25 years. The decisions of President Nixon gradually to withdraw American troops from Viet-Nam and to begin a dialog between the United States and the People's Republic of China have opened up new and promising prospects.\n43.\tThe Government of Niger will support any action in favor of the dual representation of China. If the law of numbers is a factor which is to influence our judgment, it is none the less true that the moral quality and sense of responsibility exhibited by the Republic of China for more than a quarter of a century must command the respect and admiration of this Assembly.\n44.\tA supporter of peace, freedom and justice, my country will spare no effort to see to it that the Republic of China, a founding Member of our Organization which has always respected the Charter, continues to enjoy an honorable place within the United Nations. In this regard, I must state that the Republic of Niger will reject any proposal to expel the Republic of China, to which my country is , inked by bonds of friendship and co-operation and which has always consistently upheld the ideals of freedom and democracy.\n45.\tOn this understanding, the Republic of Niger will not oppose the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations.\n46.\tWithin this disturbing international context, Niger, in so far as it is able, has never ceased to strive for peace and understanding both within the framework of the Organization of African Unity, the African, Malagasy and Mauritian\nCommon Organization, as well as in the more limited context of the Council of the Entente, whose cohesiveness has been strengthened from year to year.\n47.\tWe also take pleasure in the harmonious development of bonds of friendship and co-operation with all our neighbors.\n48.\tThe eminently peace-loving disposition of our people and Government does not blind us to the still open wounds in the flesh of our continent. We solemnly condemn the obduracy of Portugal in remaining the only colonial Power in Africa which refuses self-determination to the peoples of the Territories under its domination. We have duly condemned the barbarous act of aggression perpetrated against the sister Republic of Guinea on 22 November 1970, and the repeated violations of the territories of Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Zambia.\n49.\tIn the face of the inhumane practice of apartheid in South Africa and the occupation by that country of Namibia in spite of the relevant decisions and resolutions of the United Nations, we can only note and deplore once again the indifference to these problems on the part of the great Powers, whose concerted and energetic action could alone sway the policies of these racists.\n50.\tWith regard to the illegal regime instituted in Rhodesia by a white minority, we reiterate our appeal to the United Kingdom rapidly to restore legality in that country, a country which is the responsibility of the British Crown.\n51.\tWhile we are deeply concerned about these problems, we in Niger do not lose sight of the vital problem of economic development which, in the final analysis, influences all the others because it is on the strength of their material superiority that the industrialized countries deny us the right of raising our voice in favor of our brothers.\n52.\tIf I have not dwelt at any great length on certain political problems, it is to highlight their real importance because, in the final analysis, these problems are only the reflection of another more important problem as we see it; this is the economic and social development of the third world, especially on the African continent.\n53.\tThe unequal development of the world where the rich countries continue to grow richer and the poor countries grow poorer is at the root of what is so seriously wrong with our world. If the wisdom and the will of the great Powers cannot prevail over their desire for domination, we are all running the risk of a conflagration one day whose consequences are immeasurable. The great financial and economic crisis of 1929 has given the first evidence of this. The recent monetary crisis is likely to give us further proof if the international community does not take the necessary urgent measures.\n54.\tThe developing countries remain powerless spectators of the interplay of the great Powers. Their development suffers constantly from the often irrational nature of the assistance which is contractual and specific and does not make it possible to carry out long-term planning. This situation is made even worse by the effects of unequal trade, In this regard the President of the Republic, His Excellency, Elhadji Diori Hamani, said four years ago:\n\\\"Until we can find together a solution to a phenomenon which appears to be the simple result of the working of the law of supply and demand, whose effects must be remedied, a phenomenon which has the effect of causing the price of the major primary products to remain stagnant and often decline, while the price of industrial products constantly increases in relative value, there will be no tangible progress for the developing countries.\\\"\n55.\tThe industrialized countries have certainly made considerable efforts to help the under-developed countries but they give more and more the impression of trying to fill a bucket in the bottom of which they themselves have punched a hole.\n56.\tIncreased efforts must be made by our Organization with the participation of the rich countries, to inform the people of the rich countries and to make them more aware of the ever-deepening tragedy which is afflicting the developing countries.\n57.\tThe rich countries should not rest on their laurels but should realize that their fate is necessarily linked to that of the \\\"proletarian nations\\\". One cannot talk from this rostrum of peace, freedom and justice, while millions and millions of people are suffering from hunger and disease,\n58.\tThe International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, adopted unanimously [resolution 2626 {XXV}] by rich and poor alike, should give us grounds to hope that beyond resolutions and expressions of sympathy, there does exist a will to act, to forge this great alliance mentioned by the President of the Economic and Social Council, this great alliance against poverty, injustice and misery.\n59.\tThis requires a great deal of goodwill and courage both from the rich and from the poor. It also requires a restructuring of certain United Nations agencies and this is certainly what the Secretary-General felt after the adoption of Economic and Social Council resolution 1553 (XLIX) of 30 September 1970 with regard to regional structures and arrangements of the United Nations and its subsidiary organs and specialized agencies.\n60.\tIn addition to its unambiguous response to the Secretary-General's questionnaire, my Government reiterates its unreserved support for the proposal to expand the membership of the Economic and Social Council. We feel that the present composition of the Council no longer reflects with sufficient accuracy the present state of the community of independent nations, and that, as has been done elsewhere in most international bodies, there should be a readjustment of quotas which are now more than a quarter-century old.\n61.\tThese, then, in a few words are the comments which the Government of Niger has instructed me to make to this august Assembly. My Government, which lives in peace with all of its neighbors and desires to maintain relations of friendship with all nations, will give its support here to any action which, within the framework of mutual tolerance and understanding, will better assure world peace and interdependence of nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "134.\t Mr. President, first of all, speaking on behalf of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the Prime Minister of Mauritius, I should like to join with the other delegations to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election to this lofty post, Sir, is a tribute to your statesmanlike qualities and a fitting recognition of the useful contribution your country has made to the promotion of international peace and understanding. I am confident that your wide experience in the field of international affairs will immensely benefit the work of the present session. I should also like to associate myself with the tribute paid in this Assembly to my distinguished colleague and friend, Edvard Hambro of Norway, who very ably presided over the historic twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n135.\tNow, continuing to speak on behalf of my head of Government and also in my own name, 1 wish to express my very sincere felicitations to the Secretary-General, U Thant, who is completing his second term of office this year. The dedicated service of the Secretary-General during the past 10 years for the fulfillment of the lofty ideals embodied in the United Nations Charter has won him not only the deep appreciation but also the admiration of all those who are concerned with the preservation of international peace and the betterment of the conditions of life around us. That is why the decision of the Secretary- General not to accept a third term of office is very much regretted by us. However, it is beyond any doubt that U Thant will be remembered by future generations as one of thcM outstanding personalities of our times who have left a lasting mark on our endeavours to promote a better world in the true spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.\n136.\tOne of the primary objectives of the founders of the United Nations was that this world Organization should serve as a center for harmonizing the actions of the Member States in the pursuit of common goals-peace, prosperity and social development. The goodwill and co-operation of many of the Member States represented here have enabled the United Nations to take some positive steps towards the attainment of the objectives the Organization set itself to achieve 26 years ago.\n137.\tThe Organization can pride itself on having averted serious crises threatening international peace on several occasions and also on having been instrumental in restoring freedom to millions of people who had been condemned to colonial exploitation for years. But the hopes and aspirations of millions of our brethren have yet to be fulfilled.\n138.\tIn various areas of the world, freedom and peace have been bi; a mirage to generations of people born in our century. In Viet-Nam hundreds of precious lives are being lost daily. The Middle East, for so many years now, has continued to be the theater of armed struggle or tension. In the African Territories still under colonial domination, freedom is denied to the large bulk of local population. Then there is the question of millions of refugees across the world whose fate words are inadequate +o describe. These are so many human tragedies that endanger international security, mar the prospects of world peace, and are a blot on the conscience of mankind.\n139.\tWe in Mauritius have welcomed the move by the United States to normalize its relations with the People's Republic of China, which we would like to see occupying its rightful place in this Assembly without, for that matter, depriving Taiwan of a seat among us.\n140.\tOn the Middle East problem my country continues to believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) continues to provide an adequate basis for negotiations leading to an honorable settlement between the Arab Republic of Egypt and Israel. We have also appreciated the diplomatic efforts undertaken by soma States and recently also by the Organization of African Unity to explore new grounds for a settlement of the problem. I hope that those initiatives will lead to at least a partial solution to be followed by a just and lasting solution in the spirit of the Security Council resolution 242(1967). The United Nations, through its High. Commissioner for Refugees, should, in the short run, redouble its efforts to assist countries having to harbor refugees and, ultimately and urgently, to find peaceful political solutions to the problems of this disinherited portion of humanity.\n141.\tThis year is ';sing observed throughout the world as the International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. It is inconceivable that, in an age of so much scientific and technological progress, the human mind should still tolerate such old prejudices as racial superiority. But the worst is the institutionalized forms of racism, like the apartheid policy of South Africa. Mauritius is a multiracial country where people of different ethnic origins from Asia, Europe and Africa have long coexisted in harmony. We therefore unequivocally condemn apartheid and all other forms of racial and religious intolerance wherever these are being practiced in flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n142.\tMy Government has supported the various United Nations resolutions relating to the Territory of Namibia. We welcome the recent verdict of the International Court of Justice  and we shall support all recommendations that the General Assembly may make towards the implementation of the verdict of the Court.\n143.\tThe maintenance of international peace and security constitutes one of the major responsibilities of the United Nations. Mauritius considers the adoption last year by the General Assembly of the Declaration on Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] an important step towards the fulfillment of one of the main objectives of the United Nations Charter. We will continue to support all positive action by the United Nations in the field of international security.\n144.\tMy Government strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations to provide for the progressive development of the international law of the sea. We welcome the establishment of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction to elaborate the legal principles and norms which would promote international co-operation in the exploration and use of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and to ensure the exploitation of their resources for the benefit of mankind. Those areas of the seas are the common heritage of mankind and their resources should not benefit only the technologically advanced countries.\n145.\tAccording to Article 55 of the United Nations Charter, conditions of stability and well-being are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations, In the developing countries, the problems of stability and well- being are in fact our major preoccupations. Faced with unfavorable trade patterns, growing populations and a lack of financial resources, we often find it extremely difficult to offset the odds of economic under-development at a rate to correspond with the demands of a more and more articulate population for better employment opportunities and improved standards of living. This is perhaps especially true of a small and highly over-populated country like Mauritius.\n146.\tWith your permission I would like to stop a while and refer briefly to the efforts my Go^ srnment is presently making to promote economic development and describe a few of the problems we have to face. We are confronted at present with a very serious problem of unemployment which has been the logical consequence of an essentially monocrop agricultural economy in a country with limited land resources. Various economic surveys of Mauritius have recently been carried out and it has been the general consensus that industrialization should occupy a priority\nplace in our plans for all future development.\n147.\tWe have, therefore, embarked on a plan to set up a number of industries starting with import-replacement industries. Under our export processing zones scheme, a number of export-oriented industries are being set up. Several of the industries being labor-intensive, we feel that we may be on the right track towards satisfying our urgent need to create massive employment. We have adopted various export-promotion measures with the collaboration of foreign entrepreneurs and suppliers to whom we have provided a number of incentives.\n148.\tThe success of this conscious effort to solve the serious unemployment problem depends on a number of external factors over which Mauritius has unfortunately little or no control. I am referring, in particular, to the trade policies which are adopted by developed countries to protect their economic interests. Such measures seriously impede the economic progress of the developing countries, some of which, like ourselves, have only recently embarked on export-promotion programs, the success of which may indeed be vital to their economic survival. The adoption of those measures detracts from the concessions previously offered under the generalized system of preferences and nullifies the professed support of the principles of assisting the trade of developing countries as embodied in the activities of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD].\n149.\tI think I am voicing the unanimous feelings of the whole developing world in stating that we are pinning our hopes on the success of the Second United Nations Development Decade, which is to be implemented as from this year. We trust that the developed countries will consider the vital interests of the developing world in any future adoption of trade policies. In short, we must provide instruments for the promotion of trade between the developing and the developed countries and this, not simply to the advantage of the latter.\n150.\tIt is against this background that I view the probable enlargement, in the not-too-distant future, of the European Economic Community and the accession of more African and Caribbean States to associate membership. It is my hope and prayer that, when that historic moment comes, Europe will rise above narrow parochial considerations and use its united strength to succor the developing countries with which it has been associated, in one way or another, for centuries.\n151.\tTo alleviate further the problem of over-population and unemployment in Mauritius, my Government has embarked upon a program of assistance to Mauritians who wish to settle in countries which lack manpower and which would welcome them. We therefore believe that countries which do not have over-population problems and where employment opportunities exist should open their doors to immigrants from over-populated areas of the world.\n152.\tMy Government is convinced that the welfare of the peoples of this world can only be achieved through co-operation in all fields of activities between all the States of this world irrespective of their size, geographical situation, racial appurtenance and ideological aspirations cooperation based on mutual respect of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Those ideals Mauritius tries to pursue by maintaining friendly relations with the other nations of the world and through its membership in various international and regional organizations.\n153.\tMillions and millions of people throughout the world, and we in the developing countries especially, have placed their faith in the United Nations and we are confident that this Organization can fulfill the mandate conferred upon it if each of the present Member States gives its full and unconditional support to the principle of the Charter.\n\n\n\n\n"

The Assembly has chosen a President who knows how to bear wisdom lightly and, in electing you to this high honor, has paid tribute to you as a distinguished leader and statesman of your great country, a country of rich cultural \\\"diversity in unity\\\" and one which has such an important role in the affairs of your region and among all the nations.\n117.\tI am happy to join in the universal tribute that has also been paid to. Mr. Hambro, the distinguished representative of Norway, whose patience, skill and dynamism were so brilliantly displayed as President of the twenty-fifth session of the Assembly.\n113. It is my pleasant duty to join in welcoming three new Member States, Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar, Together they are further encouraging evidence of the spirit of freedom which has animated this Assembly from its beginnings. My delegation looks forward to happy and fruitful co-operation with them. We shall be most happy to vote this afternoon for the admission of Oman,\n119.\tThe United Nations has striven to establish the right of all nations to political freedom and a voice in the council of nations. In this it has achieved great success, the number of newly independent States which are Members of the Organization being now greater than the number of States which signed the Charter. We must remain unshaken in our resolve that those which have not yet achieved independence, or have had it snatched from them, must be given this right, this essential condition-as freedom is an essential condition-for progress. Political freedom is not everything-though perhaps only those who have ever lost it know fully how precious it is. The great tragedies of poverty, of economic exploitation, of the threat of war, of the rivalry of nations, of a polluted environment remain. Political freedom will not of itself solve these problems. But at least no nation should have to remain a helpless prisoner, unable to do anything to try to solve them, or to join with others in trying to solve them, and resign itself to seeing its future decided by outsiders.\n120.\tIt is our very great loss that we must fear we shall soon no longer have the personal guidance of 'U Thant in these efforts of ours. I say personal guidance, for even when he will lay down his office-despite, I am sure, the unanimous wish of this Assembly that he should stay-his courage, his words, the attitudes he has taught us and his tolerance will remain to guide and inspire us. His most recent achievement, in the comprehensive, thoughtful, objective and challenging introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Al84QllAdd.l], has given a picture of 10 full years, of failures and accomplishments- and of the frightening problems facing humanity. If we can follow his advice, if we do not squander the years before us, we will be able to produce a better balance sheet at the end of the next decade.\n121.\tU Thant has been a man of peace. It is a very difficult thing to be, for it demands the exercise of that most difficult of virtues, tolerance. We all have strongly held beliefs and we are quite sure we are in the right, it has been said that there are neutral countries but no neutral men. U Thant is too imbued with philosophy and religion to be neutral in human issues. But he has striven to see both sides of the various problems which affect us and he has, despite the experience and ^o doubt the frustrations of a decade in office, affirmed his faith in humanity.\n122.\tI have been moved especially by two sentences of his report:\n\\\"I feel more strongly than ever that the worth of the individual human being is the most unique and precious of all our assets and must be the beginning and the end of all our efforts. Governments, systems, ideologies and institutions come and go, but humanity remains,\\\" [Ibid., para. 146.]\nIt must give us pause when we realize that that last sentence could be proved false. Humanity remains, but easy means now exist to wipe humanity off the face of the earth. There have been, and there are, disarmament talks. There has been progress. There have been six major treaties. These include the partial test-ban Treaty,  the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] and the agreement to prohibit nuclear and mass- destruction weapons on the sea-bed,  and the great Powers have agreed not to place weapons of mass destruction in outer space. And then there are the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. These last may lead to some reduction in future production, This is perhaps poor consolation when we realize that the two super-Powers have enough nuclear weaponry to destroy each other and all the rest of us and enough automatic systems to continue the salvos over the corpse of humanity. Was there ever such a waste \\\"f human effort?\n123.\tFor poverty and the diseases of poverty continue to threaten two thirds of mankind in this Development Decade. And yet the scientific and technological basis exists for an abundant world food supply. The Secretary-General has told us that by promoting the uses in less developed areas of new types of cereals and legumes was can help 300 million children grow up healthy in mind and body [A/8401/AddJ,, para. 74/. One of mankind's victories has been the war against malaria, so that 1,000 million people now live in areas from which it has been eradicated.\n124.\tHow much more could not be done if the $200,000 million spent each year on armaments could be put to useful purposes. We may well ask, when we realize that only 3 per cent of that amount is spent on aid to developing countries. Whatever the problems that face us, however deep our passions may be, they cannot justify a threat of nuclear war. When Pope Paul came here at the twentieth session at the invitation of U Thant he bade us listen to the call of humanity: \\\"Never again war, war never again! \\\"[1347th meeting, para. 33.]\n125.\tWe Europeans have for many centuries known the evil results of war. In this century Europe has twice seen unparalleled devastation. From that misery a new Europe has arisen. Great rivalries have been resolved in friendship and co-operation, and the anxieties they provoked stilled,\n126.\tOne of the most imaginative initiatives taken in Western Europe, after economic stability had been restored largely due to the generosity of the United States, was the creation of the European Economic Community.\n127.\tThere is now every reason to believe that the Community will shortly be enlarged by the accession of four more countries, including my own. This is a prospect which my Government warmly welcomes, for, while the economic aspects of the Community are of course of the very highest importance, its objectives go much further in calling for co-operation in many other fields. But at the same time, as the Foreign Minister of France said here on 28 September, the very structure of the Community keeps it from becoming inward-looking [1942nd meeting, para. 46]. Indeed, we see in the Community and its evolution an important instrument for the promotion of detente between all European countries, east and west. And this detente is bound to lead to a co-operation in several areas which, we are convinced, will promote the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n8 Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and O-her Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof [resolution 2660 (XXV), annex].\n128.\tIn this connexion, my Government continues to follow closely all developments calculated to create a favorable climate for convening the conference on security and co-operation in Europe, which, if successful, will greatly assist in furthering world peace and security in conformity with the provisions of the Charter and the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], adopted with virtual unanimity at the twenty-fifth session of the Assembly. We have in the past made known our active interest in the conference, while pointing out that careful preparation beforehand is essential to ensure positive results and obviate the risk of failure of a far-reaching initiative which is bound to attract world-wide attention.\n129.\tSeveral previous speakers have called attention to the progress which has been made within the last 12 months on issues which have been the cause of division in Europe. Like them, we welcome the treaties concluded between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union,  on the one hand, and between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland  on the other. We also welcome the recent Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin between the four big Powers which will, we hope, shortly be completed. These developments have much enhanced the prospects of convening, with an assurance of success, the conference on security and co-operation in Europe.\n130.\tWe are preparing for another conference which affects all of us, the Stockholm United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to tackle pollution and environmental problems. And, while it seems clear that the national effort in the conservation of resources and the environment must be primary at this stage, global effort will certainly also be necessary. International co-operation is still in its infancy. My Government sincerely hopes that the Stockholm Conference will provide helpful guidelines for action on a global scale and will likewise stimulate action by each of us in a national context.\n131.\tNone of these noble efforts can succeed while we devote so much energy to war and preparations for war. But, however devoted we are to the need of peace, the shadow of war will be there if we do not seek to end the causes of war. We all know that injustice breeds violence. It is our duty to prevent and eliminate injustice and tyranny. It is our business in the United Nations to seek out and strive to end tyranny, whatever form it takes whether the form of colonialism or racialism, of apartheid or master- race theories, or of economic exploitation-which has plagued the earth for too long.\n132.\tTo do this duty of ours, we must represent all countries, great and small. The President has expressed the hope that this Assembly might be remembered as an Assembly of universality [1934th meeting]. That is obviously not possible while the representatives of China, with one quarter of the world's population, remain outside this Organization. This is a great problem. Twenty years ago China was divided in civil war. Two Governments remain which claim to be the Government of China. One of them, the Government of the People's Republic of China, controls all mainland China. The other controls the island of Taiwan. It does not claim to be the Government of an independent Taiwan, indeed it refuses to sanction any formal partition of China into a so-called mainland China and a State of Taiwan. It also claims to be the Government of all China, including Taiwan.\n133.\tOn the rights and wrongs of that great civil war it would be inappropriate for me to speak. The fact remains that the People's Republic of China emerged from that war and its Government rules over mainland China and more than 700 million people. They must be heard. Moreover, the People's Republic of China has also a special importance as a nuclear Power, and, as my Prime Minister said here last year,\n.. we must ensure that the United Nations is representative of all the Powers which have a special role in this respect and we should not enshrine in our practice policies which lack realism.\\\" [1879th meeting, para. 40.]\nIt seems clear that this great Power will not come to this Organization while a rival Government claiming the same jurisdiction continues to be represented here.\n134.\tChina, as a great Power, was properly given one of the permanent seats on the Security Council, the organ of this Organization with the right to make decisions binding on all Member States, and where the realities of power were recognized by permanent membership and the right of veto. That the People's Republic of China should sit there is now recognii. ii by all the other great Powers without exception. The representatives of the Republic of China, deprived of real power in China, have continued to exercise the rights of a permanent member and have done so with a moderation and balance that have been exemplary. But this is an unreal situation. We should regret the departure of those who have loyally tried to serve China and the Charter, but it is a question of deciding who is in reality representing the people of China. The future relations between Taiwan and mainland China are, and obviously must be, a matter for peaceful negotiation.\n135.\tConflicts also rage or threaten within the framework of the Organization, between or within Member States. The Secretary-General's introduction devotes a section to events in East Pakistan and the consequences of those events [A/8401/AddJ, paras. 177-191], What he says conforms, I believe, to the views generally held throughout the world. They closely reflect the opinions expressed in the Irish Parliament when the matter was debated there some months ago. In particular my Government, and the Irish Parliament, agree with his statement that a solution depends on a political solution based on reconciliation and that this is an indispensable prerequisite for the return of the refugees now in India [ibid., para. 184].\n136.\tI am only too conscious that we have here a problem which, as U Thant said in his letter to the President of the Security Council on 20 July, and again in his introduction, highlights the conflict between the principles of the territorial integrity of States and self-determination, a conflict which, in his opinion \\\"has often before in history given rise to fratricidal strife\\\" [ibid., para. 185]. The formal conflict on these Charter principles seems to us a matter to which the Organization could well and usefully devote attention. And here may I say that my delegation was impressed by the observations on this topic by the Secretary of State for External Affairs of Canada last week [1944th meeting], and those of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium on 4 October [1950th meeting], who hoped that peace-keeping institutions are conscious of the need for imaginative studies on the development of pacification procedures in domestic disputes.\n137.\tThis is indeed a problem, to which the Secretary- General has elsewhere called attention, when he speaks of the \\\"violation of human rights within the frontiers of a State\\\" [A/8401/Add.l, para. 147], a problem which he says has been almost daily in his mind during his time as Secretary-General. As the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands has said:\n\\\"The machinery available to the international community at present cannot essentially facilitate or promote the universal observance of human rights\\\" [1948th meeting, para. 94].\nMy delegation joins with the Netherlands delegation in hoping that this Assembly will, as a step in the right direction, decide to create the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as recommended by the Commission on Human Rights.\n138.\tIt is the ardent hope of my Government that the political solution, based on reconciliation, in Pakistan, of which the Secretary-General speaks, can be realized; and also that the refugees in India'-and we are dealing here with a number of refugees which much exceeds the population of my country and of very many Members of the United Nations-that these refugees who place such an enormous burden on India can return without fear to their homes in East Pakistan. The Irish delegation will be happy to be associated with any action to that end by the Assembly.\n139.\tThe Middle East continues to hold terrible dangers, but at least fragile peace has been established for some time though no peaceful and agreed solution is yet in sight. The Security Council's oease-fire resolutions of June 1967, resolutions 233, 234 and 235 (1967) and its resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 provide the essential framework.\n140.\tThe break-down of peace talks under Ambassador Jarring acting as the Secretary-General's Special Representative is a set-back; but we must hope that the search for peace between the parties can be intensified, bearing in mind that the Secretary-General has said-and this is all too apparent that time is of the essence. I do not wish to minimize the difficulty of this task; I realize the almost superhuman efforts of tolerance, of forgiveness, of justice and of compromise which wili be needed to reach even the beginnings of such a settlement, but we know, too, that failure might mean the widening of the conflict to a point that none of us dares contemplate.\n141.\tThe United Nations has had limited successes in bringing about the end of conflicts, but even its powsr for limited action has been eroded steadily by a simple lack of\nmoney. No wonder a spirit of cynicism has spread when all the nations of the world cannot agree on providing the sums of money it needs, sums which are insignificant in comparison with our expenditure on war and defense arrangements. Putting the financial system right is primarily the duty of the permanent members of the Security Council, for it is with them that power resides. The problem derives from differences of principle.\n142.\tBut there is surely an element of paradox in the fact that, when the Security Council set up one peace-keeping mission-the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus-it decided that its costs should be met from voluntary contributions. If the Council thought right to set up the Force and to extend the mandate every three or six months over the past seven years, it should have decided on means to pay for it or should now remedy that defect -which only it can do.\n143.\tLast year the Assembly adopted the historic Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] aimed at the strengthening of peace and security of all peoples and increasing the effectiveness of the United Nations in this most important part of its work. That Declaration will be nullified if the financial aspects of peace-keeping are not put right very soon. Whatever the problems of principle are, it is now time to find a compromise solution, if we are serious about international security. Sterile arguments about the past are of no service to humanity; and they certainly do nothing to solve the very grave over-all financial position of the Organization which, as the Secretary-General has warned [A/8401j Add J, para, 121], and you, Mr, President, recalled on 21 September [1934th meeting], now faces the prospect of imminent bankruptcy.\n144.\tIreland has been proud to provide soldiers for United Nations peace-keeping and observer missions. Irish soldiers have died under the United Nations flag. It is with regret, then, that I must refer to the fact that the Irish Government and the Irish people themselves have had, in the last two years, to face the reality of escalating violence and bloodshed in Ireland itself, though in that part of Ireland over which the United Kingdom retains control.\n145.\tThe problem of my country may seem small compared with those of other Member countries, but perhaps they may have a moral for the more terrible problems. We have tried to be a loyal Member of the United Nations; we have tried to work in harmony with others for peace. The violence and bloodshed in Ireland are not of our seeking or our making, and we hope that the conscience of mankind as here represented will help to end it. For human misery, wherever it exists, affects us all.\n146.\tThe occupation of Ireland in recent centuries was dictated by what were felt to be the strategic needs of a powerful neighbor which was constantly embroiled in war wife oilier neighbors. In such quarrels the rights of small nations have never been much regarded.\n147.\tlike many others here, we Irish are no strangers to defeat. We know that there is no humiliation in defeat itself but, rather, in the acceptance of defeat. But we equally know that too often -in the words of Simone Weil  \\\"Justice is a fugitive from the camp of victory\\\". When Ireland was divided in 1920-and that division was reinforced by an unequal treaty in 1921-those who had struggled for national independence, for justice and for peace with justice were, in a sense, defeated. But those who succeeded in dividing Ireland, and into whose hands Britain delivered the six Counties of the North, thereby assumed a grave responsibility.\n148.\tThe establishment of the Northern Ireland Administration was a victory for those who were opposed to Irish independence and who wished to remain part of the British Empire-then still a vigorous and powerful figure on the international scene. The Northern Unionists, paradoxically, had threatened to fight Great Britain in order to remain within the British Empire and outside an independent Ireland. \\\"Ulster will fight and Ulster will be right\\\" was their motto. But were they right? Has the society which evolved in Northern Ireland vindicated the forceful resistance of the Northern Unionists to the democratic wishes of the masses of the Irish people?\n149.\tWe must measure the value of a society, not by the mottoes and slogans inscribed on the walls of its temples or proclaimed in its constitution and laws; these are usually impeccable. The true measure of a society or a political system is the actual relations in that society between man and man and between community and community. And by this standard of measurement Northern Ireland has been a tragic failure. It is a society which has oppressed the economically and politically deprived and, worse, which has sought to justify that oppression. For 50 years, every attempt by the minority to assert its human dignity and to obtain elementary civil rights was characterized by the Northern regime as an attempt to overthrow the Northern State. Justice, indeed, was a fugitive from the camp of that victory.\n150.\tBut even a regime whose origins are dishonorable may validate itself in time and may secure a measure of consent or reluctant assent to its authority. A de facto regime which does not legitimate itself is doomed. There is ample evidence-from the dispassionate investigations of the political scientist, from the passionate testimony of the petrol bomb, mass civil disobedience by the minority, and the threat of violent reaction from Orange extremists and armed militia-that the Northern regime has not achieved that consent to its democratic legitimacy which is the hallmark of a just and stable society.\n151.\tThe non-Unionists repudiate a regime which oppresses them and denies their national aspirations. The reactionary elements in the Unionist community and the Orange Order regard themselves, for their part, as the final source of the regime's authority. If the Northern Administration should appear to falter in what the reactionaries consider is the duty of the Administration to maintain Northern Ireland as a sectarian State, they threaten in turn to withdraw their consent from the regime and thereby bring it either to heel or to defeat.\n152.\tThe contradictions and divisions in Northern society which reflected the divisions in Irish society as a whole when our country was divided in 1920 were not resolved by partition; they were compressed, exacerbated and\nintensified. Because of the political and demographic structure of Northern Ireland, discrimination against and oppression of the minority became not merely a choice for those who held power but, in their eyes, an absolute necessity.\n153.\tTo maintain its grip on the Northern masses, the Unionist regime made its supporters into a caste. The Northern Protestant worker was reminded, whenever there seemed a danger that he would pursue the real interests of his class or social group, that any deviation of that kind would result in the dissolution of the Northern Administration and the consequent loss of his caste privileges and the material advantages which he enjoyed over his Catholic neighbor.\n154.\tThus, the political life of the North was distorted, the norms of British democracy, which the regime pretended to uphold, were flouted, and the British parliamentary structure, which the Stormont system was supposed to emulate, was perverted into a caricature and farce. The world has witnessed the tragic cycle of events in Northern Ireland over the past three years. Demands for elementary civil rights were met with official repression, which led in turn to an increasing resort to violent means and finally to the suspension of habeas corpus, the withdrawal of the opposition from Parliament, mass arrests and detention without trial and the virtual collapse of civil order in the North.\n155 . It is natural that my delegation should bring to the attention of the international community the plight of the minority in Northern Ireland. We have done so with restraint, both in this Assembly and in the Security Council. It is not our purpose to try to coerce the Unionist community in the North of Ireland into a united Ireland. We do not believe that power, political or, above all, moral, grows out of the barrel of a gun. On the contrary, we are convinced that political power, and the moral power of a community its ability to transform values into facts-lies in the capacity of people to act together in concert. We trust that in time the people of Ireland, of all Ireland, will join together in the exercise of a collective political will to translate into living and permanent realities our aspirations for peace, justice and progress, principles which the twenty-fifth session of this Assembly adopted as its motto, since they are the essential and interdependent elements of a decent international order.\n156.\tOur conviction that the achievement of justice and stability lies essentially in national unity has secure growing recognition not only in Ireland. Mr. Michael Stewart, the former Foreign-Secretary of the United Kingdom, whose task it was to deal with this matter in 1969 when it came before the United Nations, said two weeks ago in the United Kingdom Parliament that if the situation was to be sorted out, the proposition had to be accepted that \\\"the whole island of Ireland has to be a single Republic\\\"; and he said that internment, the impossible position of British troops and the employment of terrorist methods, all arise from the fact that \\\"we are trying to maintain a connexion which cannot be maintained\\\".\n157.\tIn our commitment to national reunification we are sustained by the recollection of those men and women, from north and south, who over the centuries suffered and died in the cause of justice for Ireland. And if we must keep faith with the dead, how much more are we obliged to keep faith with the living, and ensure that justice is accorded to the minority in the North of Ireland now? But the means by which justice for the minority in the North is secured must not render the achievement nugatory. The tragic history of past and present conflict, both national and international, has taught us that the means used to achieve political goals are often of greater relevance to the end result than the intended goals themselves, however just they may be. It is thus vital to eschew those means which would bring even greater tragedy to Ireland.\n158.\tThe Charter prescribes recourse exclusively to peaceful means for the settlement of any dispute between Member States, and those are, we believe, the means by which justice in Northern Ireland must be sought. But justice there is the essential condition for the social and economic progress of the area as, indeed, for the social and economic progress of Europe and of the international community as a whole.\n159.\tMy Government is firmly committed to a policy of peace and justice in Ireland, which we regard as the indispensable foundation for progress and the promotion of a national society informed by the purposes and principles of the Charter. We are determined to build this society peacefully, both because we would otherwise negate our achievements since independence and because we thereby conform strictly to the letter and spirit of the Charter which enjoins us \\\"to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors\\\".\n160.\tThe establishment of justice and the consolidation of peace in the North of Ireland fall now within the power and responsibility of another Member State: the United Kingdom. We do not doubt its consent to these aspirations. But consent to values demands commitment, and promise demands performance. Practical political steps are necessary so as to guarantee to the minority in the North of Ireland an effective exercise of their political will and an effective role in the collective life, both of Northern Ireland and of Ireland as a whole.\n161.\tSeveral speakers have referred to the usefulness of a dialog in resolving political problems. The United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, in his statement on 29 September [1944th meeting] concerning the risk of confrontation, laid stress on dialog as a principal means of preventing the deterioration of dangerous situations. My delegation shares this view and, as the representatives are aware, we are actively engaged on dialog on this issue. However, dialog, if it is to be worthwhile, must not solely create an impression that something is being done to improve matters but must give positive results. The resolution of political problems by dialog demands a dispassionate diagnosis of the roots of the problem. And a reiteration of received ideas is a poor substitute for objective analysis.\n162.\tIn this connexion I must say that my delegation would find difficulty in accepting the Foreign Secretary's opening remarks on the situation in the North of Ireland. He is, of course, quite right in speaking of the existence of a highly dangerous situation there, but it would not be correct to suggest that this arises solely or mainly from a confrontation stemming from religious differences. Rather would I invert the order of Sir Alec Douglas-Home's observation that in Northern Ireland:\n\\\"... a terrifying manifestation of the old danger of religious confrontation has reappeared, complicated in this case by other political and social problems\\\" [ibid., para, 82].\nIn my view, what we have there is a confrontation because of political and social problems, complicated by the exploitation of a religious factor. Confrontation, particularly within national societies, is not simply a manifestation of anarchic forces at work, still less the result of doctrinal differences. It is much more likely to arise when the existing political or administrative structure fails to provide the means of effective democratic participation by a large section of the community or frustrates their demands for justice and equality of treatment. And the Belfast regime's failures in this regard are there for all to see.\n163.\tMy Government deplores the use of violence as a means of solving political problems and more specifically we deplore the use of violence as a means of solving the problem in the North of Ireland. We in no way whatever condone the use of violence there by either side.\n164.\tBut in order to end the present violence we must try to understand and eliminate its causes. It seems obvious to us that the current campaign of violence has as its cause the growing frustration of the minority in the North at the failure of the reform program to afford them substantial redress. The promise of redress was set out in the declaration on human rights and absolute equality of treatment issued jointly by Mr. Harold Wilson and Mr. Chichester-Clark from 10 Downing Street on 19 August 1969. Lord Caradon read the terms of that declaration into the record of the Security Council on the following day, at its 1503rd meeting, and he spoke of the determination of his Government to pursue relentlessly the program outlined in the declaration. He also said that the British troops which had been sent to the North were a peace* keeping force, and that no better peace-keeping force could be there. I ventured the opinion, on the same occasion, that the use of British troops alone was unacceptable and that in the long run they would prove to be more a hindrance than a help. Events have vindicated my opinion. British troops have been used in one-sided arms searches and in carrying out a policy of mass arrests and internment. From a peace-keeping force they have become, in the eyes of the minority, a coercive instrument to prop up the Northern regime. It is in these events that we can find the causes of the present violence and through understanding them endeavor to bring about the changes which will bring the peace and stability we all long for to the suffering people of Ireland.\n165.\tThe Foreign Secretary o; the United Kingdom has rightly said:\n\\\"Each of us has the means to redress legitimate grievances within our own community; that is whaA gives us the right to insist that violence within the borders of our State shall not be used\\\" [ibid., para. 85].\nI would say that it is when we fail to use that means to redress legitimate grievances that violence will appear, to demand redress. The history of almost every country has only too many examples of violence doing what statesmanship had neglected to do. A French writer has said that we all have sufficient fortitude to bear the misfortune of others. Complacency, too, can be the enemy of justice.\n166.\tGreat Britain is rightly proud of its people's profound regard for democracy and fair play. And indeed, even when we were engaged in our bitterest struggles with British Governments, there was never lack of voices raised in Britain on our side. Many British statesmen have pleaded eloquently for Ireland. And the voice of the plain-working English men and women has always been raised against policies of their Governments which, whatever their specious justification, were wrong and unjust.\n167.\tIt is essential that through dialog a structure will be created in the North of Ireland which will permit the minority there to play an effective role in the community and permit them likewise to realize their passionate aspiration for national unity. If stability and peace are to return to Northern Ireland, they will only return when an administrative structure which establishes justice is created there. Such a structure is the indispensable foundation on which to build the national consensus which will reunify Ireland and finally guarantee to Irishmen, and to all the children of the nation, full political and civil freedom so that together we can face the future enriched by, and cherishing, car several traditions.\n"

We believe-as everyone here knows-that refusing to accept any kind of hegemony is the best contribution a country can make to the birth of a truly international community. We must, however, to justify this conviction, assume the consequences and the risks it entails.\n38.\tLet me take as the first example monetary relations between nations. We are, in fact, here to increase the chances for peace. Now, no one questions the fact that one of the best ways to achieve this is to bring about, for all world economies, the set of conditions needed for truly balanced growth. In the face of this immense task-and the poorest peoples feel this urgency most deeply the major countries have a special responsibility. How can they and how should they undertake it? Recent history gives us the beginnings of an answer.\n39.\tThe Bretton Woods Agreement, the Marshall Plan, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: one would be pushing forgetfulness or ingratitude very far indeed in failing to mention the benefits and farsightedness of the initiatives which substituted equality of rights, stability, freely endorsed rules of truly international codes for the evils of compartmentalization, that is, shortsighted egocentricity and unchecked competition, which is anarchy. Once and for all, history has given a large part of the credit to the United States. But two cracks have successively threatened the order of this magnificent structure.\n40.\tFirst, it has always been obvious that world equilibrium presupposed -even demanded- the participation of the countries of Eastern Europe, and foremost that of the Soviet Union, in the main currents of exchange. This is one of the goals and this is already, to a certain degree, one of the results of the detente whose political advantages it is superfluous to stress. A great Power or group of Powers could no more be kept .on the sidelines by an outside agency than they themselves could remain aloof from circuits of communication, whether technical or scientific, economic or cultural.\n41.\tHowever, the other crack is moire disturbing, because it is threatening the structure from within: respect for the international rules which were accepted by Common agreement by all countries, large and small, led the West to make. an unprecedented leap forward. These rules are called free trade and fixed exchange rates. They are irreplaceable. No one has the power, however strong he may be, to substitute other rules for them. To violate them is therefore to replace them by the absence of rules.\n42.\tSo, if the industrialized States reached a point of preferring anarchy or-and this amounts to the same-the unstable law of the strongest to a set of agreed conditions for harmonious development, who, in the long run, would benefit? The betting-dangerous, like all betting-is open. But, while it is difficult to be a winner in this game, it is easy to pick out the first loser. It would undoubtedly be all the victims of under-development. Let us reread the text relating to the International Development Strategy which was solemnly adopted on 24 October 1970 by the General Assembly [resolution 2626 (XXV)] and which should in principle determine-let us not forget-the relations between industrialized and developing countries throughout the present decade. It rests entirely on the idea that the drive against under-development must be a concerted action, undertaken jointly and in close co-operation by the two groups of nations. What will remain of this fine plan if one of the two groups on which the major responsibilities fall begins by dividing against itself and in some way denying or destroying itself?\n43.\tIn those conditions one can imagine the anxiety in the third world caused by the recent announcement of certain trade restrictions. Because they strike indiscriminately at all States, it is in fact the weakest among them which may be hurt the most.\n44.\tMy country, guided by the experience it has been able to acquire in its relations with the African countries to which it is attached by ever-closer ties of friendship, has made itself and will continue to make itself the untiring advocate of a real organization of markets for basic commodities, where the essential goal is to seek stable, just and remunerative prices. As I have once said:\n\\\"The problem is not to throw a few provisions into the abyss of hunger, but to throw a lifeline to enable millions of human beings to climb out through their own effort.\\\"\nWe are here-why not say so? -on the level of principles. We put ourselves on this level as early as 1964, when we suggested that a system of preferences such as the one which had been set up between the associated African States and the European Economic Community should become generalized. We are striving to stay on that level when we insert into our own plan the goal proposed by the United Nations, in other words, when we set our rate of participation in development at 1 per cent of the gross national product.\n45.\tWhat are we trying to say? Simply that the responsibility of the industrialized States is committed and cannot be denied.\n46.\tOn several occasions during this analysis we have mentioned the European Economic Community. We have observed that its very structure keeps it from becoming inward-looking. That will be even more true the day it brings together 250 million men and women to whom several million others will be joined through more or less close ties.\n47.\tLatin America can bear witness to this. I had the honor of presiding over the Council of Ministers of the Community when a colloquium-which should not be the last-both reminded us of our affinities, to which France attaches such importance, and encouraged us to continue increasing our exchanges on all levels.\n48.\tNevertheless, how can one talk today of Europe before the nations which comprise it, and also before those which observe it, without being struck by the parallel progression of two phenomena which is its present day characteristic?\n49.\tOn the one hand, the European Economic Community is being enlarged, which means that it has an ever-stronger attraction, that it will henceforth be considered irreversible and that its internal difficulties are the manifestation of growing pains. On the other hand, the progress and consolidation of detente justify this reference to \\\"the whole of Europe\\\" that the six countries meeting in The Hague nearly two years ago took care-on France's initiative to include in the final communique of their summit conference. This I repeat, is parallelism, not coincidence.\n50.\t'\tWestern Europe was for a long time a community of suffering and anxiety. Through economic integration and political co-operation it is becoming a community of hope. By setting the example, it has shown first that the decisions and rivalries which seemed so persistent could be overcome, then that the refusal to accept any kind of hegemony was, for peoples too long torn by divisions, the best justification and the most effective stimulus for a necessary rapprochement. In learning that Berlin had become the place and the symbol of agreement, everyone said to himself that the time had come for \\\"the whole of Europe\\\" to keep its appointment with destiny.\n51.\tWhat name will history give this conference for which preparation must now enter the decisive stage? \\\"East-West Conference\\\"? Certainly not that. Our plan is certainly not to endorse or even to organize a confrontation of the two camps, but on the contrary to reduce it enough to make it fall into disuse. \\\"European Conference\\\"? That title would be incorrect; everyone agrees-and has agreed for some time now thai the two great North American countries should have a place in it. I hope, then, that we would try to live up to the title which summarizes a great design: \\\"Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe\\\". \\\"Security\\\", \\\"co-operation\\\" it is important that those two words remain linked together, because the concepts they encompass are complementary and indivisible.\n52.\tTo reinforce existing ties between all the countries of Europe on the level of economy, culture, science or technology; to open new paths for their co-operation; to lower the barriers which here and there still prevent or hinder the movement of people, the exchange of information, the movement of ideas; to bring about a genuine mutual interpretation, without impairing State Sovereignty, which would by drawing the peoples closer together, enable them to improve their intellectual and material living standards: is not all this contributing at the same time to increasing the security of the continents, and we think that mistrust, lack of understanding, and even glaring inequalities in development, are also factors of instability;\nwe note that these still exist in Europe, and not only between what is still called the East and the West. We consider that the multiple development of co-operation extended to everyone in order to reduce those factors is imperative if one intends to deal with the problem of European security in depth.\n53.\tBut this problem is also, of course, political and military. France, in so far as disarmament is concerned, neither can nor will be content with words or appearances. Disarmament must be the elimination of existing arms under effective international control, and the prohibition of any new manufacture of them. And yet, the result of all the efforts made in New York, Geneva and elsewhere since the end of the Second World War is that no arms have in fact been destroyed. On the contrary, we are witnessing the most fantastic arms race the world has ever known. Several bans, whose effectiveness remains to be demonstrated, have been declared on the proliferation of nuclear arms or on their deployment in areas which were up to now inaccessible to man.\n54.\tThose bans, whatever their individual merits, are unfortunately misleading and can give rise to the belief that disarmament has begun, while the existing arsenals and their power to destroy never stop growing. A \\\"disarmament\\\" carried out in this way can only promote the development of hegemonies and would tend to divide the world by installing an order in which only the super-Powers would retain the ability to exercise their sovereignty.\n55.\tFrance has obviously not acquiesced in such a prospect. That is why it has insisted on keeping the possibility of providing itself with the necessary means to secure its defense and maintain its independence. But it remains nonetheless highly in favor of any undertaking for true disarmament, which in an age of nuclear armaments demands, first of all, settlement of the problem of those armaments. How can that be achieved, if not by consensus between the States which possess them? That is why France just recently again recalled that it favored a conference of the five nuclear Powers. It hopes that the requirements for such a conference will one day be met.\n56.\tIs this to say that for the moment nothing can be done to reduce the threats which weigh on humanity? The United States and the USSR have, for their part, begun talks to lessen the risk of nuclear confrontation between them. To that end, in Vienna and in Helsinki, they are planning to set mutual limits on the development of their strategic arms. But the balance they hope to reach that way is not the only thing which could be called upon to avert the risk of nuclear war. In the absence of a true disarmament agreement between the five, but in the hope of opening ways towards it, would it not be possible as of now also to plan nuclear-Power co-operation to prevent accidental, mistaken or surprise release of the terrible weapons at their disposal? Establishing such a security system will surely provide a practical means of moving toward a world where the risks accompanying the existence of nuclear arms, while not yet eliminated, could at least be reduced. France, for its part-and I confirm and announce this formally-is ready to contribute to that.\n57.\tFor it is only to avoid submission to any system of blocs and I deliberately repeat myself of hegemony that we have had to provide ourselves with the means of deterrence, after having asked in vain for an internationally controlled ban on nuclear arms. In this field as in others, the desire for independence is a contribution to world equilibrium and, consequently, to peace. However, our experiments -I voluntarily refrain from mentioning experiments for which other countries are responsible- would, in our view, cease to be legitimate if they were to endanger life-first of all, of course, the life of man, but also the life of the flora or fauna on land and in the sea.\n58.\tHave we set ourselves up as the sole judges of the adequacy of the precautions taken, and first of all the remoteness of the test sites? Not at all. We have not been satisfied with the installation of a system, now five years old, to survey the development of radio-activity at various points of the globe on our own.\n59.\tWe have invited scientists and researchers from the countries concerned to take part in our observation and surveillance work. This is a unique and unprecedented effort of international scientific cooperation. Each year we report the results of these observations to all the Members of the Organization, without concealment or hindrance.\n60.\tWe have duly reported to the United Nations committee qualified, as its name indicates,  to evaluate the harmfulness or harmlessness of atomic radiation. Consequently, those who would charge us, not only without proof but against all proof, with risking pollution which our experiments, and ours alone, might entail would be taking to task not us, but the indisputable and indeed undisputed authority and the conscience of a scientific committee of the United Nations.\n61.\tLet me add that those explosions-by the very fact that they take place in the atmosphere-are not registered by even the most sensitive seismographs on the American continent, which respond to all variations, however weak, in the earth's crust; consequently, they cannot have any , relation to any seismic shock. You will then understand that we trust good faith and common sense to do justice to the simple truth.\n62.\tBut the accumulation of forces in the European theater is the consequence, not the cause, of political tensions there. What chance is there of dealing with the effects without troubling to go to the roots?\n63.\tIt is not too early to look beyond the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin,' which is sure to be supplemented soon by the necessary arrangements between the German authorities-a must for its entry into force. A larger settlement will then appear, since the Treaties of Moscow and Warsaw,  Which convey an equal desire to surmount the obstacles built up in the path of reconciliation between peoples by the horrors of war, are going to take effect in their turn. May we not hope that those three elements of a true political reconstruction in the very center of Europe -the Berlin accord, the necessary arrangements between the German authorities, and the entry into force of the Treaties of Moscow and Warsaw-will culminate in a lasting agreement between the two German States? Nothing would contribute more effectively to guaranteeing the stability of the continent as a whole.France, which bears a part of the responsibility regarding this problem, and which as I said right here last year [1842nd meeting], is anxious to see the Organization become universal, will not spare its encouragement and support for the efforts the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany intends to make in order to -come to such an agreement soon, with all the consequences that this would, I believe, entail for the United Nations.\n64.\tFrom then it will only be a matter of organizing the relations between European States in such a way that the alliances, as long as they are held necessary, do not take the form of blocs turned in upon themselves, that for each country the right to belong to one alliance or to belong to none will be respected, as well as the right to territorial integrity, the right to sovereignty with all the accompanying prerogatives, the right to be exempt from all forms of pressure, from wherever it comes, from all interference or external attempt at interference. One of the tasks of the conference on security and co-operation in Europe will be to define these rules with the greatest precision and to ensure that their binding force is clearly understood. At stake is the confirmation of a detente which-I purposely repeat myself-is based on respect for and development of national independence, through free co-operation, a detente which, in a continent so rich in possibilities-for the best and for the worst-means both progress and peace.\n65.\tIn bringing up the universality of our Organization a moment ago, I was thinking of Asia, for I see there something which causes great hope, great fear and great impatience.\n66.\tThe hope springs from the awareness that, as France has always hoped, the People's Republic of China and the Unites States of America have entered into a necessary and difficult undertaking whose effects, we strongly feel, will have repercussions on international relations in their entirety. Doubtless the process will be long. But if, as I am convinced, it is not directed against anyone, it will not fail to serve the cause of detente and peace in that area as well as beyond. Will we then finally see the completion, this year, of the debate on the question of China which our Assembly has continued for too long? Logic and realism would point this way, for although it is said that all roads lead to Rome, there is only one, as far as I have been informed, that leads from Peking to New York. No stratagem can change this, any more than it is possible to make our Charter say something it does not say.\n67.\tGreat fear also. How can one not feel it in the face of the horrible drama 'which has already caused one of the most tragic exoduses in modern times and which anyone feels is perhaps only the prelude to more terrible sufferings still to come? Of course, the response the international community gave to the appeal launched by the Secretary-\nGeneral for those unfortunate people of East Pakistan shows that the voice of U Thant was not sounded in vain. But if the wrong is not righted at the root, will the flow of people stop? And will it be possible to reverse the flow? We must hope that the wisdom and generosity of some people will respond to the moderation of others and that a political and constitutional solution based on the consent of the Pakistani people will make it possible to come out of the crisis; for, if the tension is not relieved soon, we shall have to expect tragic consequences for peace in Pakistan and in the subcontinent as a whole.\n68.\tLastly, great impatience. Impatience caused by the absence of any progress in settling the Indo-Chinese conflict. However, new proposals have recently been advanced. Could they not be discussed? This question, as the Assembly has surely understood, is actually a wish. I have three reasons for making it: my Government is the host for the Paris Conference; it has, for the people of Indo-China, a friendship which it is always ready to express: it believes, lastly, as we all do, that the only lasting solution to this long-drawn-out tragedy is one which will ensure the independence of each State in South-East Asia, a zone which, after so much suffering is yearning at last for peace and neutrality, sheltered from the competition of all the major Powers.\n69.\tThe same moral -if not the same formula- is applicable to the Middle East, with one basic difference however. Here the responsibility of the United Nations is directly committed. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) will be four years old in a few weeks. Will we spend this anniversary in silence? Will it be for us a time to draw up a report of our lack of success? We are not about to be limited to this alternative! Once again, faithful to our maxim, we will not confuse the means with the end. There is, on the one hand, the cease-fire, for which we can never be thankful enough, if only out of horror for the bloodshed though we see how inevitably precarious it is. There is, on the other hand, .the object of the cease-fire, which can and must be only the mutually accepted implementation of the resolution, that is, evacuation of the occupied territories in exchange for guarantees of real peace. Also, we must be grateful to the United Kingdom and its Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, for having warned us against a certain thinking pattern from which we may soon be painfully awakened. We have two good reasons for fearing and refusing to let time run out: elementary prudence and, above all, the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Observing our impasse, Africa responded. I wish here to pay tribute to its decision. To the four Heads of State who will make contact with the parties concerned  Presidents Senghor, Ahidjo, Mobutu and Gowan France offers its warmest wishes.\n70.\tHowever, the fears and the hopes of the international community as well as the latter's determination for a peaceful settlement must all be expressed, and this can only be done here. Our appeal last year was heeded. Mr. Jarring was able to resume his mission within the desired time- limit. Our hopes, alas, were quickly dashed. Without the required answer, dialog could not begin. Without unanimous determination, the permanent members of the Security Council has so far not been able to formulate their recommendations for a settlement or make known as agreement whose persuasive effect could be decisive. So here we are again faced with the same alternative: either the Assembly speaks out or the international community is doomed to silence. We should lose our raison d'etre if we did not opt for the first choice. The voice of the General Assembly is thus to be heard: with moderation, equity and firmness. May its appeal inspire in all those who carry more direct responsibilities in this sad affair, the desire to act together so that peace can be established-a peace whose durability is guaranteed by respect for justice.\n71.\tIs it futile to hope that 12 months after having celebrated the foundation of the United Nations we might, on the occasion of this session of the General Assembly, make a new start in some way? Actually, everything prompts us to do this, above all this striking but necessary observation: we have entered a new era. When we compare the world of 1971 with the post-war world or with what was called the \\\"cold-war\\\" era, we see clearly that the dissimilarities far outweigh the similarities: no continent is invulnerable any more; no ideology is sufficient any more to guarantee the monolithism of all the countries which adhere to it; no nation can be subjected to dependence any more.\n72.\tThese changes point to simple and fruitful guidelines: on the one hand, the world community lives and prospers only through national entities-that is, organized, sovereign and ultimately equal nations. On the other hand, national independence is meaningful and final only through its contributions to the community task. The conference of the non-aligned countries in Lusaka  was correct in taking this principle as its motto: \\\"Unity in diversity.\\\" General de Gaulle was no less far-sighted almost 30 years ago when he said to us in a voice we shall never hear again:\n\\\"Henceforth there cannot be even the slightest connexion between independence and isolation; no State can maintain itself or, still less, develop without support and help.\\\"\n73.\tGiven those two rules, is it possible to construct a world where there would be more solidarity and more security? Europe torn asunder for so long has now the best chance of proving the reverse. As we have seen, the union of Western Europe and detente in international relations in Europe as a whole have gone hand in hand. The year 1972 should see both the summit conference, which was proposed by Georges Pompidou on behalf of France and which will strengthen the solidarity of 250 million Europeans, and also the first conference on the security and co-operation of all Europeans.\n74.\tYet co-operation, the guarantee of security, -can. neither stop at the frontiers of Europe, nor do without justice. Recently, before the Conference of the InterParliamentary Union, the President of the French Republic termed racism-of which apartheid is only one manifestation-the \\\"scourge of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the most distressing form of.man's scorn for man\\\". But the threats and the violence which cause millions of human beings to flee their homes, extreme poverty and\nhunger, are no less incompatible with the dignity, and indeed the very mission, of man.\n75.\tMay I add that those men whose magnificent life's work is to keep the collective conscience alerted by the pen or by the word have never been more necessary; never, consequently, has the protection of journalists on dangerous missions been more pressing or more urgent. Of course, there are countries where industrial civilization has developed in such a way that the public wonders about the effects and about the very goals of this civilization, awed as it is by the scope of the resulting difficulties and disorders: destruction of the natural environment, pollution, moral and social crises chiefly affecting the young. In these countries the idea of economic growth is sometimes called into question.\n76.\tThis obviously does not apply to the majority. The countries of the world, for the most part, strive to ensure that their populations have the basic requirements and that the opportunities for what is too often difficult and precarious progress are preserved.\n77.\tBefore concluding it would be well to re-emphasize the obligations of the industrialized nations for in our hearts we know that the success of our efforts does not depend on any arrangement or mechanical adjustment of our institutions-even though improvements in means and procedures are welcome. We must above all imbue our undertakings with more soul and more action.\n78.\tToday, new and inspiring horizons are being spread before our weary, burdened nations and the impatient youth of the world, who are astonished at our quarrels and are already tempted to break rank. Away with hegemonies, therefore and the thirst for power and super-power.\n79.\tThe world has grown. It offers our ambitions immense, still little-explored and under-exploited fields, such as space, the sea, and the sea-bed, which science technology are continually opening up.\n80.\tMay these new prospects help us liquidate the sequels of past conflicts and overcome the crises which some day will seem quite petty.\n81.\tMay this \\\"shock of the future\\\" urge us to move on towards tomorrow together-all together.\n\n"

        "file_text": "58.\tMr. President, the Pakistan delegation is exceedingly happy to see you in the Chair. Your election to that high office is the General Assembly's tribute alike to Indonesia and to you personally for your remarkable statesmanship and dedication. Our gratification at it, of course, also derives from the fraternal relations which Pakistan enjoys with Indonesia, a great nation that shares our spiritual culture and heroically faces problems some of which are similar to our own. It is fitting that a distinguished Asian should preside over this session. As is well known, some of the overriding political issues confronting the world community at present impinge primarily on Asia, our long-suffering continent.\n59.\tI should like also to mention here how much my delegation admired Mr. Hambro's presidency last year. Not only his juristic understanding but his rare combination of geniality and firmness lent luster to that office during the commemorative session.\n60.\tTen years ago U Thant accepted the office of Secretary-General in an hour of crisis for the United Nations. A controversy raged over the powers and responsibilities of that office and the manner in which these were being discharged. Today, if the doubts and fears that had assailed us about the future of the Organization at that time have been dispelled, it is in no small measure due to the scrupulous integrity, the serene wisdom, the moral courage and the mature judgment with which U Thant has steered his difficult course in turbulent times. We unhesitatingly pay him this tribute, even though we have disagreed at times with his assessment of particular situations. Pakistan hopes that the problem posed by U Thant's announcement of his intention to retire will be solved in the best interests of the Organization.\n61.\tIt is customary for delegations during' the general debate to make statements of policy on the major issues affecting their countries. My delegation will express its views in detail on the various issues before this Assembly during the debates that will later be held in the Committees and in the plenary meetings. I shall therefore use this\noccasion only to explain what are the great issues-some global, some regional, others local-which affect the common man in Pakistan and show how his outlook is shaped by them.\n62.\tMy country acceded to independence in 1947 when the United Nations was still nascent and none of the goals of the United Nations Charter yet appeared to be an impossible dream. The Charter, therefore, was an essential part of our mental environment. There was a fusion between our own independence and the pursuit of the aims and purposes of the United Nations. We saw ourselves as part of that family of nations, comprising Asia, Africa and Latin America, which had been ravaged by imperialism in or. way or another and whose prime concern was to banish poverty and so attain freedom not only in political form but also in social and economic substance. More than anything else, we wished, as we wish now, that those nations should not be afflicted with disunity. Any dispute between any two of them was to us a tragic waste which would sap the energy and diminish the freedom of both. Little did we imagine that with our own neighbor, India, we should have disputes which we could not persuade the rulers of India to solve in accordance with the principles of the Charter.\n63.\tWhy did affairs take a turn that was unimaginable to us when we attained independence? The answer lies only partly in the failures and infirmities of the United Nations. There is also the fact that there is something in the nature of imperialism that, even when it relinquishes its hold over an area, presents as its parting gift to the successor States problems so designed as to shackle the independent career of those States* That has been witnessed in several areas. Where, as in the Arab Middle East or Indo-China, the problems are due to the injection of an external element, no solutions can be devised except in a great-Power framework. Where, however, the problems are between the newly independent States, it is nothing h .t a neo-colonialist attitude, a desire to dominate, a dream of hegemony, that prevents the larger of them from equitably settling its disputes with the smaller.\n64.\tAt the time of the partition of the subcontinent, we in Pakistan inherited barely one fifth of the area and were placed at a disadvantage in many other respects. Nevertheless, we accepted an award delimiting the boundaries of Pakistan and India, even though it was unjust to us. We envisaged the closest co-operation with our neighbor, India. Our independence was not more than two months old when India completely violated the basis of partition  the independence settlement of 19473 and sent its army to occupy a Muslim-majority area, Jammu and Kashmir, and to crush a popular liberation movement against the despotic ruler of that state. India had been enabled to do so by the departing Imperial Government. It had been provided with its only, and previously unused, passage to Kashmir when some Muslim-majority areas of the district of Gurdaspur in the Punjab were unjustly awarded to it. We protested India's entry into Kashmir, which was so colonialist in its nature and so repugnant to the spirit and basis of India's independence and our own. We were assured by India that the occupation was temporary, that the accession\n3 Indian.Independence Act, 1947.\nto India of the ruler of Kashmir, who had been denounced by his people, was provisional, and that the people of Kashmir would be allowed to determine their own future through an impartial plebiscite. Later, when the dispute was brought to the United Nations, this solemn pledge given by India was translated into an international agreement. Both India and Pakistan accepted United Nations resolutions providing for the self-determination of Jammu and Kashmir through a free plebiscite. To this day, that agreement remains unimplemented. To this day, India has not terminated its occupation of the bulk of Jammu and Kashmir. The dispute has twice led to hostilities between India and Pakistan. It has caused a strain and a friction in our relations, which harm us both. In spite of the heavy toll taken by the dispute, India does not even now agree to resolve it in accordance with the wishes of the people of Kashmir.\n65.\tIn the part of Jammu and Kashmir which it occupies, India maintains a puppet regime and penalizes anyone who demands that the resolutions of the United Nations regarding Jammu and Kashmir be implemented. The renowned leader of the Kashmiri people, Sheikh Abdullah, was imprisoned for nearly 15 years and is now barred from entering his homeland. A ban has been imposed on popular parties, including the Kashmiri Plebiscite Front, whose aim is self-determination for Jammu and Kashmir. The torture of political workers, the repeated firing on public assemblies, the constant harassment and victimization of patriotic citizens, are gruesome features of life in Indian-occupied Kashmir. A million refugees have fled the terror and oppression there. India refuses to establish conditions which would enable them to return.\n66.\tAnother very clear example of this mentality has been furnished by the way India has handled the dispute about the equitable sharing of the waters of the Ganges, which flows through both India and Pakistan, with Pakistan the lower riparian country. It has completed the construction of a barrage near a place called Farakka, in the state of West Bengal in India. That project is designed to divert the waters of the mainstream of the river, the Ganges, through a feeder-canal to another river flowing entirely through India. The result will be that in the long dry season every year the barrage will leave little or no water below Farakka for use in East Pakistan, thereby causing grave and permanent damage to the economy of that region. According to the assessment of our own and international experts, this Indian project will adversely affect the ecology and agriculture of seven districts in East Pakistan involving a total of 3.6 million acres of land. It will seriously affect navigation in the Ganges and its many spill-channels and distributives. It threatens an inflow of sea-water, thereby reducing agricultural production, municipal supplies and industrial use of water, and depleting fisheries and forest resources, especially iii the Sundarbans. Moreover, reduced flow in the Ganges in Pakistan, downstream from Farakka, will silt up the river-bed and increase the hazards of flood in the rainy season. All these factors together are expected to affect the livelihood and vital and legitimate interests of as many as 25 million people, or roughly one third of the population of the eastern wing of Pakistan.\n67.\tIt is ironical, but not surprising, that at the same time that India professes grave concern for the people of East\nPakistan, it plans and executes projects aimed at causing their economic ruin. India does offer to negotiate on this issue with Pakistan, as indeed it offers to negotiate on many other issues; but when such negotiations take place, as in this case, India prevaricates and uses various devices to avoid facing the real issue.\n68. I have mentioned these two major causes of the friction between India and Pakistan. Without this friction and without the pervasive background of India's constant attempts to weaken and isolate Pakistan, the present India-Pakistan ambition involving a threat to the peace would be totally incomprehensible. Had Indian rulers not been hostile to Pakistan, would they not find it unnatural and repugnant to try to take advantage of their neighbor's internal difficulties? Would they not scrupulously refrain from interfering in our affairs? What is happening today on the borders of my country and our neighbor India is not mere border skirmishes; it is armed intervention by one country, a Member of the United Nations, India, in the territory of another Member of the United Nations, Pakistan.\nof supply for transportation of food grains into Pakistan. As a result of operations against saboteurs who damaged the United States food-ship Lightning at Chalna anchorage recently, Pakistan authorities have apprehended frogmen trained in India and launched near Chalna and Chittagong ports for sinking ships bringing food-grains to East Pakistan. The frogmen were given limpet mines by India and trained in their use, By indulging in the sabotage of food-ships, India is trying to create conditions of famine for 75 million people of East Pakistan to fulfill its own political objectives. If the international community is genuinely concerned about a possible food shortage in East Pakistan, it has an obligation to prevent India from indulging in activities which, if unchecked, cannot but endanger the sustenance of the people of East Pakistan.\n73.\tIt is now for the world community, and for the United Nations in particular, to prevent another conflagration which would be catastrophic for South Asia.\n74.\tSecretary-General U Thant, on 20 July last, sent a memorandum to the President of the Security Council drawing his attention to the threat to the peace which has arisen in the subcontinent. The Secretary-General, inter alia, emphasized that he had become increasingly apprehensive at the steady deterioration of the situation in the region in almost all its aspects. The Secretary-General said:\n\\\"In the present case there is an additional element of danger, for the crisis is unfolding in the context of the long-standing, and unresolved, differences between India and Pakistan differences which gave rise to open warfare only six years ago.\\\"\nAbout the actual situation on the border he said:\n\\\"The situation on the borders of East Pakistan is. particularly disturbing. Border clashes, clandestine raids and acts of sabotage appear to be becoming more frequent\\\"\nAnd he recognized the threat to peace, indeed to world peace, by stating that:\n\\\"Nor many of us here in the United Nations afford to forget that a major conflict in the Sub-Continent could all too easily expand.\\\"\nIn short, U Thant has clearly defined the situation as a threat to the peace and urged the Security Council to consider with the utmost attention and concern the present situation and to reach some agreed conclusions as to measures which might be taken.\n75.\tAs I mentioned in my statement in exercise of the right of reply on 29 September [1945th meeting], my Government has expressed its readiness to co-operate with the Security Council and has welcomed the proposal for a good offices committee of the Council to help reduce the tension between our two countries. I reiterate that readiness here.\n69.\tIndia has been engaged for the past few months, and is engaged now, in a clandestine war on Pakistan. At a time when, regardless of the nature of the military action taken by the Pakistan Government in its own territory, India could have no conceivable fear of invasion, it has concentrated a large number of its forces, some 200,000, and its machines of destruction on the borders of East and West Pakistan. It has been engaging in incessant shelling and mortar-fire against East Pakistan. It regularly sends its own armed personnel into my country to cause death and destruction. It harbours, trains, finances, equips and encourages sometimes even forces the dissidents to undertake acts of sabotage and to cripple the economy of East Pakistan. In short, India is at the moment carrying out acts of war against my country, and the only reason why the situation has not been escalated is that the Government of Pakistan has exercised the utmost restraint.\n70.\tThe resort to shelling, mortar-firing and other warlike - actions against Pakistan have become a regular feature of *\nthe tension built up by Indian armed forces along our borders. Let me cite two concrete instances o\\\" recent occurrence to give the Assembly an idea of what we are confronted with at present.\n71.\tIndian artillery fired nearly 1,000 shells on five closely-located border villages in Sylhet district on the night of 29 September. The villages battered by Indian shelling were Mantala, Kamalpur, Jaipur, Armnager, and Harashpur; 28 villagers, including 12 women and 8 children, were killed, while 13 others were wounded. Among the casualties was a party of Telephone Department employees who were repairing a telecommunication line. Communication lines, it must be mentioned, are particular targets of Indian attacks. After shelling, Indian armed personnel attempted to infiltrate into these areas. The Pakistan Army combed the area and recovered 3 light machine-guns, 145 boxes of small-arms ammunition, 100 steel helmets, 40 mines, some wireless sets and 387 grenades.\n72.\tIndia is also trying to create famine conditions in East Pakistan by aiding and encouraging the destruction of lines\n76. India, of course, takes an opposite view. Its Government contends that it is not an India-Pakistan problem. It would have the world believe that everything that has\nhappened has been due to Pakistan's actions only and that India has been merely a passive victim, burdened with a huge influx of refugees.But what are the facts? The facts about Indian intervention are patent and I have already mentioned them.\n77.\tThe world has heard a lot about East Pakistan in recent months. Much of what has been said has come from outsiders. Not all of them have to test their statements against realities. Many among them moralize and assume lofty postures. But, if I may strike a personal tone, I come from East Pakistan. Unlike the distinguished Foreign Minister of India, I cannot afford the luxury of misstatements and propaganda. From this Assembly, I will go back to East Pakistan. I have to live and suffer and strive and build among my people there. I do appreciate whatever humane concern, unmixed with sordid political motives, exists anywhere for the people of East Pakistan. At the same time, I deplore the fact that the situation in our homeland has been so distorted in the world's eyes, its causes so misrepresented, the sequence of events so disfigured, that it has been made to appear as if there is a war between East Pakistan and West Pakistan. Let an East Pakistani voice rise from this rostrum to remind the world that the people of East Pakistan and West Pakistan are brethren, joined in an imperishable union and that when the two undertook together the enterprise of building a federal State, it was an unfettered act of self-determination on the part of each. The people of East Pakistan have not regretted, and do not regret, that choice. True, we have problems relating to regional autonomy, to a distribution of national resources based on justice, to the removal of disparities between the different regions. Which State, which large or multi-linguistic or multiracial State, is free from such problems? Let not one such State gloat over the problems of another. We, in Pakistan, have undergone a most traumatic experience. We have endured a situation of extremity. We have gone through an ordeal. But through it all, we have realized that the fragmentation and fission of our statehood and the break-up of our unity are, and can be, no more a solution for us than for others.\n78.\tIt has been a great misfortune that, in our case, these problems led to a violent upheaval. Why this happened cannot be understood without some basic facts about Pakistan's national existence and its relations with India being kept in mind. But it is fantastic to suppose that the conflict was due to the suppression of East Pakistan's demand for autonomy. Are the people of East Pakistan less than independent in a united Pakistan where they are in a majority and can dominate the central Government? A majority has, or can acquire, the power to right wrongs and to correct imbalances. It is unthinkable for a majority to want to secede. By definition, a demand for secession is a minority's demand. Since, I repeat, the people of East Pakistan are not a minority or a small ethnic group within Pakistan, it follows that the secessionists among them do not represent the people at large. Being secessionists, they are a self-confessed minority. Their own position proclaims their isolation from the people. Such isolation can be due either to a total failure of statesmanship or to a collusion with a foreign Power which wishes the disintegration of the State. In the case of the secessionists in East Pakistan, it was due to both.\n79.\tThe relationship between the upheaval in East Pakistan and India's actions is immediate. For months, Indian war material had been steadily passing into East Pakistan from across a border which, traversing rivers, hills, forests and swamps, could not be fully guarded by the limited number of Pakistan troops. When the crisis approached, India sundered the air communications between East and West Pakistan by banning the overflights of Pakistani aircraft across Indian territory. It did so in reprisal against the hijacking of an Indian plane to Pakistan. But, as has been judicially established, this hijacking was engineered by Indian intelligence itself, wanting to create a pretext for India to ban the overflights. The ban is illegal and contrary to India's international obligations. Yet even now, despite international efforts at conciliation, India refuses to lift it. When the crisis mounted, and Pakistan was passing through its severest test, India massed its troops along our borders, both in East and West Pakistan.\n80.\tFaced with this threat from outside, combined with an insurgency in the country, the Government of Pakistan had no choice but to use all means to save the country from anarchy, dismemberment and inevitable Indian domination. I ask the distinguished representatives assembled in this hall: Faced with similar circumstances, what would any other legal Government do?\n81.\tConflicts of the kind which we have suffered in East Pakistan are a supreme tragedy. But world opinion is not yet fully aware of how this tragedy has been caused and intensified by foreign interference. Had India's concern with the plight of the displaced persons been purely humanitarian, it would have followed a different line of policy. It would have done its utmost to convey the appeal of the Government of Pakistan to the displaced persons to return to their homes. It would have co-operated with us and with the United Nations in a common effort to accomplish this objective. It would have entered into a neighborly dialog with Pakistan. Here was a situation where, if no power politics were involved, the interests of both India and Pakistan demanded that the displaced persons should be enabled to return to their homes.\n82.\tIt therefore causes us the most profound regret that, both by its incessant propaganda and its actions, India is inhibiting the return of the refugees. By engineering border conflicts, mortar-fire and shelling, India makes it impossible for our nationals to cross the border. It uses their presence within its borders for recruiting from among them the so-called volunteers for secessionist forces.\n83.\tIt is this policy of the Government of India which has so far defeated our efforts to bring back the refugees. The declaration of a general amnesty, the repeated appeals of the President of Pakistan, the acceptance of the assistance of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and of the presence of his representatives in East Pakistan, the establishment of reception centers and the provision of facilities for the resettlement of the returning refugees-by every feasible means, we have demonstrated that we are anxious for our nationals to return. On 19 July, Secretary-General U Thant proposed to both India and Pakistan that a limited number of the representatives of the High Commissioner's Office be posted on both sides of the border to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of the\nrefugees. We unhesitatingly accepted this proposal. India, however, rejected it.\n84.\tThe ostensible reason which India cites for its refusal to allow the return of the displaced persons is that conditions are not secure for their return. In the first place, India itself makes the conditions insecure. Secondly, what India means by \\\"secure conditions\\\", as the distinguished Foreign Minister of India made amply clear before this Assembly,, is a political solution which would be in accordance with its dictates. The Prime minister and other leaders of India have publicly declared that t! y will agree to the return of the displaced persons only when the so-called \\\"Bangladesh\\\" emerges; in other words, when East Pakistan secedes and passes under Indian tutelage.\n85.\tCould there be a more blatant interference in the internal affairs of one State by another? Only last year India joined all of us in voting for the Declaration on the\n\\\" Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] which solemnly affirmed the universal and unconditional validity of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including the principles of non-interference, as the basis of relations among States, irrespective of their size, geographical location, level of development or political, economic and social systems and declared that the breach of these principles cannot be justified in any circumstances whatsoever.\n86.\tThe issue that is posed by India's interference is not of concern to Pakistan alone; it concerns all nations that wish to preserve their sovereign status and territorial integrity. If the principle of non-intervention is set aside or compromised, every nation smaller or weaker than its neighbor will be open to the latter's inroads. I therefore appeal to this Assembly to exercise its powers of persuasion on India to desist from its interventionist course. For our part, we are determined to resist India's encroachments and to achieve the political solution which we sorely need for our own survival.\n87.\tLet not India pretend that it has not also created some other problems in the subcontinent. India is engaged in efforts to subjugate the Nagas-a proud, non-Indian people -who have borne untold hardship during their long resistance to Indian rule. In India's own territory, there are situations which are the direct result of the exploitation and suppression of the smaller linguistic and ethnic groups in India, notably the Dravidians, the Sikhs and the Bengalis, but we do not make them a cause for interfering in India's affairs. We only wish that India realized, as we do, that anarchy and fragmentation are a danger as much to itself as to us.\n88.\tIf I may sum up the India-Pakistan situation, it is a situation of a patent threat to peace which needs to be removed if the peoples of the two countries are to resume their struggle to achieve higher standards of life in larger freedom. We do not consider the Indian people as our enemy. Indeed, we feel that, by its unrelenting hostility towards Pakistan, by perpetuating a climate of tension in our region, the Indian Government t is committing treason against its own people. We wish that the Indian Government realized that a strong Pakistan is a guarantee of peace in South Asia. Similarly, we wish all the great Powers to\nrecognize that attempts to weaken Pakistan and to isolate it will undermine the balance of power and stability in the region and will promote a hegemony that will be inimical to peace.\n89.\tI said earlier that I would attempt on this occasion only to explain what are the major issues which affect us in Pakistan. Our relations with India, of course, are most pressing upon our attention. But situations elsewhere also cause us concern, particularly when they involve issues relating to the self-determination and equality of peoples.\n90.\tWe grieve that the agony of Viet-Nam continues. There is nothing that the peoples of the world desire more than that it should be speedily ended. We are convinced that no solution can be viable which involves an injustice for the people of Viet-Nam. There will be no lasting peace in Viet-Nam unless a settlement is sought which respects the wishes of its inhabitants. That Viet-Nam is not on our agenda is no reason why all of us should not make our maximum effort, collectively and individually, to end the immense suffering of a gifted people whose endurance in the face of heavy odds is unexampled.\n91.\tIt causes us the most profound sorrow that the Arab peoples continue to be victims of aggression. While we appreciate all efforts, including those of Ambassador Jarring and others, aimed at breaking the deadlock inhibiting progress towards peace in the area, we deplore the fact that no pressure is being brought on Israel to withdraw from the territories which it occupied by invading Arab lands in 1967. Without pressure, the cease-fire will remain fragile. Without such pressure, the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory of force will remain a mere platitude.\n92.\tThere are two other aspects of the Middle East situation which, in our view, are of the utmost importance.\n93.\tThe first is the personality and the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine. The Palestinians have as much a national identity as any other people. They have as much a right to live in their homeland as any other people. No settlement of the Middle East situation will be viable if it does not show due recognition of this fact.\n94.\tThe second is the question of the Holy City of Jerusalem, which affects the most cherished sensibilities of the people of Pakistan and, indeed, of people in all continents. Let me make it plain that no settlement of the Middle East problem will be worth the paper it is written on if it leaves the Holy City under Israel's sovereignty. Both the General Assembly and the Security Council have called upon Israel to rescind all measures designed to change the status of Arab Jerusalem. Israel has defied this call. Steps need to be taken to overcome this defiance.\n95.\tIn regard to these issues of great urgency, Pakistan takes the standpoint of justice. Its policy is determined by no other consideration than that there should be no exploitation of Asian, African and Latin American peoples by power blocs. We do not want to play one great Power against another. We have no animosity against any great Power and no vested interest in the differences between them. We were very happy when President Nixon announced Ills plan to visit Peking. The normalization of relations between the United States and China may well turn out to be the beginning of a new era in international affairs, free from the dangers of great Power confrontations.\n96.\tIt is from this viewpoint, as well as from the viewpoint of removing a disability from this Organization, that Pakistan considers it essential that the lawful rights of the Government of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored during this session. It would be a set-back to many great hopes for peace if a decisive moment in international life were to be lost through a refusal to break completely from the sterile policies pursued in the past. Pakistan cannot but oppose any attempt to promote a dual representation of China. It would be setting a most dangerous precedent to permit two opposing delegations to represent one and the same Member State in the United Nations. Since Taiwan is a recognized part of China historically, and also in international agreements, we do not believe that the departure of the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek regime means the expulsion of any Government lawfully represented here. It follows that a question requiring a two-thirds majority for decision is not involved.\n97.\tA host of considerations-the universality of the Organization, a detente among the great Powers, the strengthening of international security, the liquidation of the remnants of colonialism and imperialism, and progress towards nuclear and conventional disarmament, to mention but a few demands the immediate presence of the People's Republic of China in our midst. Any approach to this question, such as the proposal for dual representation of China, which is certain to be rejected by Peking, will militate against this consummation and run counter to the efforts of the world community to attain these high purposes.\n98.\tIs it not becoming clearer with every passing day that real disarmament, as distinct from non-armament, will continue to elude us, unless the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China are restored in the United Nations? We all know that specific agreements in the field of arms control and limitation-including those ripe for conclusion are merely peripheral measures. We by no means belittle the promise of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the Soviet Union and the United States to limit both defensive and some offensive strategic weapons. Nor do we refrain from applauding the efforts made by them in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to reach agreement on the complete prohibition and destruction of biological weapons. But the stark fact is that the hard core of real disarmament has still not been touched despite a quarter of a century of negotiations. We have a proposal before us for a world disarmament conference [A/L.631] to induce a greater momentum in the efforts to come to grips with the central questions. While we welcome the Soviet proposal, we cannot but emphasize that the seating of the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole lawful representative of China is a sine qua non for its participation in any world conference under the auspices of the United Nations. Without China's participation, we do not believe that such a conference will be more productive than the existing forums for disarmament negotiations. If it is envisaged that the conference should be outside the United Nations framework, complex questions concerning preparatory work, organization, venue and financing will arise which are not susceptible to easy solutions.\n99.\tA comprehensive test-ban treaty, which would also prohibit underground nuclear weapons tests, remains as elusive as ever, despite the fact that sophisticated techniques of seismic detection and identification of such explosions without on-site inspection, have been sufficiently developed to render the consequences of any undetected clandestine events insignificant for all practical purposes.\n100.\tLinked to a comprehensive test-ban treaty is the question of using nuclear explosive devices for peaceful purposes. The explosion of such devices is of great importance to the economic development of all countries, and, in particular, the developing countries. Consequently, an underground test-ban has to include a permissive clause for conducting nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. As there is no difference between nuclear weapons and the so-called peaceful nuclear explosive devices, any ambiguity as to who is permitted, within the context of an underground test-ban, to conduct the so-called peaceful nuclear explosions, could open the door to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Therefore, we regard it as essential that any underground test-ban treaty which exempts the explosion of nuclear devices for peaceful purposes from the ban must provide in the most explicit, unambiguous and effective manner possible against the dissemination of the related technology in order that the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] are not defeated.\n101.\tTo our mind, lack of progress towards disarmament has been one of the greatest disappointments of the contemporary age. The arms race, getting ever deadlier, depletes the resources which the human family needs for its own welfare, perhaps for its very survival. How can the poverty of masses in large areas of the world be removed if there is an agglomeration of arms, a constant increase in military expenditures? How can the developing countries escape from the poverty which grinds them down if they are also condemned to competition in the arms race? And how can the richer nations fulfill their promise to transfer the savings resulting from disarmament for the development of the third world, or even for the uplift of their own underprivileged classes if there is no reduction of armed fore and armaments?\n102.\tWe are happy that we have been joined by some more States which have recently attained independence. Bhutan, a neighbor of ours, was under the virtual servitude of the same colonialism which departed in 1947 from the Indian subcontinent. It has taken Bhutan 24 years to obtain recognition of its legitimate rights and to occupy its rightful place in the comity of nations as an independent State, enjoying a sovereignty inferior to no other State's, The people and the Government of Pakistan warmly welcome Bhutan as an equal Member of the United Nations and assure it of their goodwill and close co-operation.\n103.\tWe are equally glad to see here the representatives of Qatar and Bahrain, with whose countries our ties continue\nto grow. We look forward to a close and mutually beneficial association with them. We are happy that we will soon be joined by Oman.\n104.\tApart from these few gratifying gains, the process of decolonization has unfortunately slowed down. It has come to a virtual standstill in southern Africa where the Pretoria-Salisbury-Lisbon alliance continues to defy the verdict of the world community expressed through the General Assembly, the Security Council and recently, the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice .4 Portugal continues to impose its rule over Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). The Pretoria regime continues to practice the abhorrent policies of apartheid in South Africa and Namibia. The racist minority regime of Ian Smith remains in control of Rhodesia despite mandatory sanctions.\n105.\tThe world community can ignore the explosive situation arising out of the twin evils of colonialism and racialism only at its own peril. A racial conflagration in South Africa could arouse intense feelings the world over and could cause a global race conflict. It is therefore the responsibility of the Members of the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular to defuse the situation in southern Africa by bringing about the emancipation of peoples under colonial or racist rule in that part of the world. The Security Council must take more effective steps to tighten the sanctions against Salisbury and to stop the sales of arms to Pretoria. It must no longer shrink from decisive measures to wrest Namibia from the illegal occupation of South Africa, and to halt the aggressive acts of Portugal against the African States.\n106.\tThese are objectives which directly flow from the Charter of the United Nations, Like many other political objectives, most of which involve the fulfillment of justice in international relations, what they require is not a reiteration of former resolutions; what they require is political will on the part of all Member States, especially the great Powers. This will has been so far lacking. But if it is summoned and replenished by a detente between the great Powers, there is little doubt that a brighter horizon of peace will open before us. Then alone will the dream of human solidarity come nearer realization. Then alone will the United Nations reflect the oneness of the world. Without the radical reorientation of political attitudes that this requires, the world will remain as it is-a world full of grievances born of inequalities and injustices, a world in which the majority of the human race is deprived of its inheritance.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "135. Mr. President, may I first of all extend the warmest congratulations of the delegation of the Republic of Mali on your brilliant election to the presidency of the twenty- sixth session of the General Assembly. In so doing, I would not wish to forget Mr. Hambro whose task it was last year to conduct the difficult proceedings which marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations.\n136.\tThe ideal of peace, which for almost 30 years has sufficed to maintain mankind in a state of relative security, today deserves our devoting to it all the resources of our intelligence and all the determination that we as political leaders can muster.\n137.\tIn this regard, the birthday wishes extended last year to the United Nations in the form of the slogan \\\"Peace, Justice and Progress\\\" should henceforth pass from words to deeds.\n138.\tThere is no doubt that since the end of the last session, human intelligence and courage have achieved surprising things. The artificial frontiers born of ideological antagonisms which we pointed out have been somewhat blurred. The political will of States or groups of States to open their doors to one another for the sake of better understanding has unquestionably led to a better grasp of the forces at issue, thanks to a more realistic analysis of the international facts which govern our existence. This realism, illustrated by the progressive lifting of the absurd quarantine which until now had confined one of the biggest States of the world, is one of the most encouraging signs of our\n' times. The motives behind these political phenomena would not deserve attention if they did not also concern the welfare of men. To be sure, science has opened to our hopes vast horizons whose extent and depth no longer turn our head, but outer space linkups, walks on the moon, and other scientific exploits can have no real meaning unless,\nthanks to the concerted efforts of all, sickness, ignorance and malnutrition give way to a better economic future for mankind.\n139.\tHow fine this hymn to victory would have been if the courage which enabled man to conquer nature had been directed more towards the search for a new economic order and if, above all, it had been put at the service of justice, equality and freedom!\n140.\tThe provisions of the Charter of the United Nations are complementary. Peace, which it is our duty to seek with patience and intelligence, concerns mankind as a whole. If its approaches differ according to the interests at stake, the objective is always the same. Peace must be just and honorable. The image of troubled peace reflects that of our own incapacity to rise to the political responsibilities which, by delegation, are entrusted to us by the community of peoples. Our efforts should be to adorn that image and at last to give the nations once again that strength of faith which they tried to place in our Organization at the time of its creation.\n141.\tTo restore harmony wherever stubbornness or the lust for power create explosive situations, to refuse to condone policies of humiliation or of abdication, to combat racial hatred and the strictures of dogma, to offer occasions of balanced development are all objectives for which acceptable solutions would be possible if we put our heads together.\n142.\tHere, the exercise to which we must immediately devote ourselves undoubtedly concerns the Middle East where misleading ashes cover a vast arsenal of war which can lead us at any time into a third world catastrophe.\n143.\tMy Government, of course with certain reservations, greeted the various moves which led to the cease fire in the Middle East . It had hoped that the cessation of hostilities would speed the search for a solution if not global, at least partial of the crisis. However, this hope was to fade before the utter stubbornness of the Israeli Government, which has disdainfully rejected all attempts to settle the crisis, particularly the Jarring proposals and the Rogers plan.\n144.\tThis negative attitude does great harm to the prestige and authority of our Organization. It should therefore use the Charter to induce this Member State to respect the principles to which it freely acceded.\n145.\tFor its part, my Government is ready to cooperate in the quest for any solution based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967). But before all else, the international community must require Israel unconditionally to withdraw from the Arab territories occupied by force.\n146.\tThere is a real chance of peace in the Middle East. But if it should unhappily go unheeded in the flush of transient military victories or the refusal to bow to the legitimate national demands of all the communities in the area, then a situation would arise for whose dramatic consequences we would bear full responsibility.\n147.\tOur Organization would do useful work in that part of the world if its present efforts should result in the restoration to the peoples of the Middle East of their inalienable rights. Here, we are thinking above all of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians reduced by the political blindness of Israel to the status of stateless persons. However, these involuntary exiles, dependent on the uncertain generosity of States to satisfy their most elementary needs, have not given up. They are the vanguard of a fight which is our fight. And we would be failing in our duty if we refused them what they have never ceased to demand of us that they be permitted to return to their homeland and live there in peace.\n148.\tMy Government is following with the same deep concern the developments which, for nearly 30 years, have brought grief to the peaceful populations of the Far East. The heroic struggle of the People's Army of VietNam, supported by the whole of its people, led to the Geneva Agreements of 1954 whose proper implementation would have permitted the peaceful reunification of that artificially divided country. The provisions of those Agreements are binding on all States and no attempt to thwart their implementation can be justified in terms of international obligations.\n149.\tIn 1969 and this was said last year we had the hope that specific acts in favor of peace would follow the statement made in this Assembly by President Nixon [1755th meeting]. The tragic reality with which we find ourselves faced today is that after more than a year, the war, going beyond the frontiers of VietNam, has spread into Cambodia and been stepped up in Laos. Thinly-veiled interference in the domestic affairs of States has engulfed the Indo-Chinese peninsula in flames, where guns and napalm are the only elements on which it is believed possible to build the greatness of a civilization.\n150.\tFaith in democracy and in the sovereign exercise of rights which imply freedom cannot be destroyed by force of arms. That faith and that sovereignty of rights are not subject to negotiation. I hope that this fundamental reality will be understood by the Government of the United States of America and its allies, and that they will accede to the impatience of their own peoples and of the whole world by unconditionally withdrawing their troops from the Far East.\n151.\tThe latest seven-point proposal of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam constitutes, we believe, a reasonable basis for negotiation. To allow the IndoChinese the freedom to work out their own political, economic and social order seems to us to be the only way of ensuring a just peace in the region.\n152.\tThis consideration, valid for Indo-China, is equally so for Korea. The contacts recently instituted by the Korean Red Cross services are the latest signs in the process of peaceful unification. My delegation believes that the international Organization can attain this objective only by correcting its errors of 1955. It is our hope that the postponement of the Korean question to the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly does not mark the beginning of a new strategy on the part of those whose interests are opposed to its consideration.\n153. The United Nations must, in the interests of objectivity, dissolve the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea and withdraw the troops which, under the cover of the United Nations, are occupying the southern part of the country, where their presence is contrary to the ideals of peace of the Charter.\n154.\tThere are so many problems before us for reflection, the time is so short and the demand of the peoples so urgent that only if we tackle them with courage have we any chance of at last attaining one of the fundamental objectives of the Charter to save future generations from the scourge of war and from destruction.\n155.\tIt has already been stated that political courage consists in seeking the truth and telling it. Is it not to belie the truth to believe that the United Nations can advance towards its objective of universality while denying one of the greatest States in the world the rights which it enjoys as a founderMember of our Organization? Similarly, how can we be expected to believe political fictions at a time when their authors themselves are proceeding to correct mistakes made, at a time when tensions born of ideological confrontation stood in the way of a proper appreciation of political reality?\n156.\tIt would be inexcusable to make good one mistake by another and it would be even more inexcusable to deny the oneness of the Chinese State.\n157.\tI need not emphasize the legitimacy of the representation of the People's Republic of China in terms of the size of its population or by making references to its domestic and foreign policy. It is paradoxical indeed that those who refer to such policies are the very same who support with their full material and financial weight regimes whose avowed objective is to destroy the moral and human principles that govern our Organization. The question that concerns us is to measure the gravity of the wrongs done to that country which, despite hostility from all sides, is undertaking, in conditions of order and peace, one of the greatest revolutions in human history.\n158.\tFor over 20 years an injustice has been perpetuated against the People's Republic of China, and yet this has not prevented it from making its effective contribution to the welfare of millions of people in new countries facing the harsh exigencies of economic and social development. The People's Republic of China has responded to this injustice with the dynamism and cordiality of its relations with all peace-loving and freedom-lovingStates.\n159.\tWe were extremely gratified at the beginnings of a rapprochement between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. We were also gratified by the argument developed by the Nixon administration to the effect that it was for the Chinese and the Chinese alone to settle their domestic problems. It is, indeed, neither for our respective States nor for our Organization to do these things. But it is our responsibility and our duty, since we are speaking of peace, not to create other factors of tension which might make peace impossible.\n160.\tThe most important question that can face us is whether, in the logic which should guide us, it is not time to put an end to myths and empty intellectual exercises, and to recognize that the rights of the People's Republic of\nChina should not be impaired by voting procedures. We hope that the General Assembly will take this view since it is for the Peking Government to find solutions to its problems commensurate with the greatness of its genius.\n161.\tIn not disappointing this hope, we shall be doing the work of peace, just as we shall be doing by reconsidering our positions on questions which directly concern the freedom and dignity of millions arbitrarily subjected to the rigors of regimes whose arrogance, more than a challenge, is an insult to our Organization.\n162.\tFor some time now international relations have benefited from the informed analysis of reciprocal positions and have been enriched by the opportunity for better mutual knowledge and appreciation. This irreversible current is, nevertheless, beset by serious obstacles condoned if not abetted by passivity and indifference.\n163.\tThe despicable colonial system practiced by the Portuguese Government, which is unique in the annals of history, is aimed not only at stripping the peoples of Guinea (Bissau), Mozambique and Angola of their identity, but also at perpetuating foreign domination in Africa.\n164.\tPortugal claims to be defending Western and Christian civilization in Africa. No graver insult could be offered to the proponents of that civilization, for after more than four centuries in our continent, all Portugal does is brazenly exploit the resources and barbarously administer the population. Incapable by itself of achieving the level of economic and social development enjoyed by the rest of postwar Europe, incapable by itself of stemming the revolt of the African populations under its administration, Portugal appeals for assistance to South Africa, Rhodesia and all the Governments and associations for which a pound of copper or cobalt is worth more than the life of an African.\n165.\tThe world is now in an era of detente. Portugal, for its part, has learned nothing from the past quarter of a century but violence, to which the populations of Guinea (Bissau), Angola and Mozambique have found a fitting response.\n166.\tIn support of this truth I shall merely quote the following statement by an African freedom fighter reproduced in The Observer:\n\\\"We are not violent for the sake of violence. But Portugal has been ruled by violence for more than fifty years and so a certain amount of force seems the only effective rejoinder.\\\"\n167.\tIs there any truth more contrary to the pertinent provisions of the Charter, and should our efforts not be directed towards making this political philosophy inapplicable because it is prejudicial to peace? Colonialism in its death throes always tends to kill more, to destroy more. Portugal gives us an example of this by the war it is imposing on the populations of the African Territories under its occupation and by its repeated acts of aggression repeated because they always go unpunished against the independent States of Senegal, Guinea , Zambia and the People's Republic of the Congo, all Members of our Organization.\n168.\tYou cannot claim to be for peace and defend or support Portuguese action in Africa. The support and complicity enjoyed by Portugal, particularly on the part of its NATO allies, help to strengthen the colonialist and neo-colonialist camp in its desperate resistance to the political emancipation of the Territories still under domination, and illustrate without the least possible ambiguity the attempts of international imperialism to confiscate, for the benefit of foreign capital, the immense economic resources of colonized countries and those that have just become independent.\n169.\tThe international Organization, as I said, has the right and the duty to come to the aid of peace at any time and in any place. The provisions of the Charter make any such action by the United Nations legitimate. The provisions cf Chapter VII of that same Charter, in my Government's view, should be the sole source of inspiration for decisive action against Portugal, forced to ally itself with the racist and retrograde regimes in southern Africa.\n170.\tThere can be no further doubt that Portugal, Rhodesia and South Africa are combining their military efforts.\n171.\tThis fact prompts certain reflections the most characteristic of which is that we cannot respond to this outrage to our Organization with ineffective measures. The economic sanctions ordered against Rhodesia have turned out to be ineffective if \\\"not absurd. We must be logically consistent and we must place the responsibility where it belongs. The British Government continues to claim sovereignty over Rhodesia. We know the nature and scope of the measures it is capable of taking when it feels that its interests are at stake. It has no right, by reason of its specific undertakings under the Charter, to abandon the people of Zimbabwe to repression and poverty. The just struggle of the Zimbabwe people, the victims of an out and out conspiracy, involves the responsibility of the international community. To stand aside from it would be to capitulate to the forces of evil and hatred.\n172.\tThe enormous resources used by certain Powers to create tensions under cover of the quest for so-called peace should rather be made available to the international community to serve in the restoration of peace wherever the principles of the Charter are imperiled. Namibia offers the best example in this regard. The Security Council, in its resolution 284 (1970) requested the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on the legality of South Africa's presence in the Territory . That opinion has been given and it is magnificently clear. Paragraph 118 of the opinion states:\n\\\"118. South Africa, being responsible for having created and maintained a situation which the Court has found to have been validly declared illegal, has the obligation to put an end to it. It is therefore under obligation to withdraw its administration from the Territory of Namibia.\\\"\nIn paragraph 119 the Court continues:\n\\\"119. The member States of the United Nations are, for the reasons given in paragraph 115 above, under obligation to recognize the illegality and invalidity of South Africa's continued presence in Namibia .. .\\\".\n173.\tDespite the voting reservations of certain members of the Security Council reservations which, as a matter of fact, contradict their public statements against the colonial Administration of South Africa the United Nations is now quite clear as to its responsibilities towards the people of Namibia.\n174.\tSuffice it to recall in this regard paragraph 1 * 6 o/ the Court's opinion, which states:\n\\\"Thus when the Security Council adopts a decision under Article 25 in accordance with the Charter, it is for member States to comply with that decision, including these members of the Security Council which voted against it.... To hold otherwise would be to deprive this principal organ of its essential functions and powers under the Charter.\\\"8\n175.\tThe present session should therefore go beyond formal resolutions and Byzantine legal quibbling to seek, in accordance with the logic of the facts, practical means of enabling the United Nations Council on Namibia fully to assume its responsibilities with regard to the peoples whom, legally and morally, it is our duty to lead to independence. We must save Namibia from the cancer of apartheid with all haste.\n176.\tStatements on the immorality of apartheid become exercises in empty oratory when they lead to no concrete action to isolate and bring down the regimes that practice it.\n177.\tThe provision of arms to the racist minority of South Africa can be justified neither from the standpoint of defending an alleged civilization nor from the standpoint of any search for peace. Does not human civilization rest on a complex of values, one of the most important of which is respect for human dignity?\n178.\tSouth Africa is one of the few States that regard injustice and the use of force as the only rules that should govern the administration of a State and its international relations. The Pretoria regime, in open rebellion against the United Nations, is arming itself not only against the black peoples of South Africa, but against the other African States as well. If the United Nations wishes to survive, it must act out of a sense of high conscience to frustrate all such attempts. The permanent members of the Security Council which, through their various initiatives, encourage and promote them, are all the more culpable in that they bear special responsibilities within that principal organ of the United Nations.\n179.\tThe policy of dialog with the racist regime of Pretoria that has been proposed to us is, in fact, part of the diversionary strategy to which the supporters of apartheid and their henchmen are having recourse in order to start an argument that will give them a certain respite. Before proposing any dialog with the outside world, the racist\nregime of Pretoria is in duty bound to start such a dialog first with the citizens of South Africa, who are its primary interlocutors. This, at any rate, is the view of the Government of the Republic of Mali on this problem of dialog.\n180.\tThe Government of the Republic of Mali, profoundly devoted to peace, will support any initiative aimed at restoring and safeguarding peace and security in the world. Thus, we have followed with lively interest the negotiations resulting in the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, and the progress achieved in the talks on the limitation of strategic, conventional, biological and chemical weapons.\n181.\tDisarmament following upon a reduction of international tensions can, without doubt, free enormous resources that  could be placed at the service of development. But un-concerted  action that would scatter our efforts would but create unbalanced situations that would themselves give rise to tensions. Hie monetary crisis which is now shaking the world and which affects us all is one of the best illustrations of this.\n182.\tThe problem of the revaluation of the resources of developing countries, that of the transformation and expansion of their units of production, and that of their increased participation in trade, make necessary, for the stability of international economies, solutions at once bold and appropriate.\n183.\tThe World Bank has launched a medium-term program of assistance on behalf of the developing countries satisfactorily embracing the most important sectors of their economies. We hope that other credit acuities will follow this example.\n184.\tThe proposals made by the Economic and Social Council in the framework of the Second United Nations Development Decade will be valid to the extent that they are studied with a willingness to apply them in a sort of planned economy of the third world.\n185.\t!r. President, in the statement which you made on 21 September [1934th meeting], you expressed the wish that our Organization might achieve greater universality. It will attain universality by avoiding dangerous compromises and refusing to shirk its responsibilities. You will assist us in doing this by the way in which you guide our discussions and by your knowledge of international problems.\n"

        "file_text": "169.\t Mr. President, in welcoming you as President of our Assembly, I merely wish to say one thing. Studying the introductory statement you made on 21 September [1934th meeting], we were happy to find a vision of the world which was both truthful and prophetic. It is the statement of a statesman, a wise and courageous statesman. We are also happy to see in you the initiator of the project of regional co-operation in five countries of south-east Asia. My country, Belgium, thanks you for having accepted to preside over our work.\n170.\tMay I also address to your eminent predecessor, Mr. Hambro, the expression of our deep appreciation for the effective manner in which he guided the work of the historic twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n171.\tNow, the choice of questions that my country wishes briefly to deal with is predicated upon our awareness of the specific duties befalling the non-permanent members of the Security Council during their two-year tenure of office. This is why I shall speak first of the crisis of the Middle East and the problem between Pakistan and India.\n172.\tThe choice of these problems, of course, is not exclusive of the interest shown by my country in other important problems that we shall deal with when they come up either in the plenary meetings of the Assembly or in the various committees, such as economic development and African problems. We shall at that time remind our colleagues that we believe in resolutions which must give life to the Second United Nations Development Decade  and may I say in passing that our contribution to the United Nations Development Program in 1972 will go beyond the average requested increase.\n173.\tAlmost four years ago the Security Council took a decision on the crisis of the Middle East. Over a year has elapsed since, happily, on 9 August 1970 a cease-fire was established. We felt it our duty to take part in the efforts for pacification which have constantly intensified since then. We were encouraged to do so by Belgium's traditional bonds of trust with the Arab States of the area and the State of Israel. Finally, I would like to say that the countries of the European community are trying to harmonize their views in order to resolve a conflict affecting peace in the Mediterranean.\n174.\tAll these reasons have led us to ascertain as precisely as possible the views of the leaders of the main States concerned. We should like to tell them publicly of our gratitude for the confidence they have shown in us and we wish to express in turn the conviction we have reached that it is not only necessary but also possible to establish a reign of peace in the Middle East, to deal with all the controversial problems. It is necessary and possible to build up a situation radically different from that prevailing before 1967, which was so precarious, as we clearly saw, that the slightest accident could place peace in jeopardy.\n175.\tThis peace, in our view, must be built on three inseparable pillars: the conclusion of a peace treaty, guarantees offered by the community of nations and the establishment of stable and recognized frontiers.\n176.\tThe conclusion of a peace agreement would constitute a fundamental change in the relations that existed prior to 1967 between Israel and its neighbors, because it would include explicit recognition of the State of Israel, of its independence, a mutual refusal to interfere in domestic affairs, the commitment to oppose all acts of violence initiated from each country's territory, the acceptance of freedom of movement in the Straits of Tiran and the Suez Canal: thus an entirely new body of rules on coexistence would be established which we would wish to see gradually developing into regional co-operation.\n177.\tWe are also convinced that the mere existence of a treaty, after 25 years of confrontation, would not be enough unless it was accompanied by guarantees offered by the community of nations as an international pledge to uphold the provisions and commitments of the peace treaty concluded between the- parties and to ensure its observance.\n178.\tIn our opinion, there would be double guarantees. When the peace treaty is signed, the Security Council would guarantee its provisions and set up a task force, under its jurisdiction, to ensure compliance with the treaty. The force s terms of reference, based on Security Council resolution 242(1967) and providing inter alia for demilitarized zones and probably zones where United Nations forces would be stationed, would be defined by the Security Council and could be changed, adjusted or terminated only by a new decision of the Council. Under its terms of reference, the task force's operations would be, in some way, autonomous and automatic.\n179.\tAt the same time the international community would undertake to carry out a vast Program for facilitating the return to normal economic and social life of the population which have suffered so grievously from the war and its consequences. The European Economic Community will make a substantial contribution to such a Program.\n180.\tThe conclusion of such a treaty and the provision of such guarantees would dispose of several problems deriving from the necessary establishment of secure and recognized boundaries, if there were no doubts about its conclusion, because, in this new context, the security of States would not depend either exclusively or principally on a strategic device based solely on a particular carving of boundaries.\n181.\tWe, for our part, have realized that Israel could not agree to the exclusion of the specific problems pertaining to the establishment of secure and recognized boundaries from the negotiations, but we also realized that the Arab States will be unable to enter into any peace commitments unless Israel forthwith confirms its acceptance of one of the essential elements of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), namely, the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force. After thinking about it at length, we believe that these two positions are not irreconcilable.\n182.\tWhat we saw and heard this summer, during a visit to the States of the Middle East, convinced us that on the threefold bases just described namely, those underlying resolution 242 (1967)-negotiation was not only a matter of urgency but also possible at this very moment. No time up to the present has been more favorable, but everything points to the fact that the time available for concluding an agreement is short. We therefore believe that Ambassador Janing's mission as his proposals of 8 February [A/8541, annex I] bear witness-is more necessary than ever. The public support given to him by \\\"the Big Four\\\" must be a further encouragement to the Secretary-General's Special Representative.\n183.\tThe speedy conclusion of the diplomatic procedure initiated through Mr, Rogers's efforts of over a year ago would be useful in this context. The impact of a preliminary agreement under which the Suez Canal would be reopened would demonstrate that yesterday's adversaries can conclude meaningful agreements. It would give us ground to hope, in an atmosphere of restored calm, for the early conclusion of the general agreement which we most sincerely desire. One initial specific step forward would be the preface to over-all negotiation; it would demonstrate its possibility and strengthen the will of all those who cannot admit a deadlock when peace is at stake.\n184.\tIt is our feeling that, in such a context, the other problems existing in the Middle East that of Jerusalem and that of the refugees would become easier to solve.\n185.\tWhether it be by the mission of Ambassador Jarring, or the initiatives of Secretary of State Rogers, or the conciliatory measures taken by four Heads of State, Mr. Senghor, Mr. Ahidjo, Mr. Mobutu and Mr. Gowon, as ^quested by the Organization of African Unity-all of them should lead to a negotiation among the parties. Sir Alec Douglas-Home said the other day [1944th meeting] -and I am also convinced of this that parties to this dialog must meet.\n186.\tOur membership in the Security Council has compelled us to reflect on another drama-that affecting East Pakistan.\n187.\tIt is difficult to summarize in a few words the horrible sequence of afflictions that accompany the exodus of seven million people; the dispersal of their belongings, exile, hunger and death have compounded in this region the ravages inflicted by a natural disaster of exceptional magnitude which struck it last November.\n188.\tOur first duty is to respond to the appeals of our Secretary-General and the Governments of Pakistan and India. My country responded immediately and has just recently announced further contributions. We therefore fully endorse the humanitarian action taken by the Secretary-General. We also approve of the steps he has undertaken to draw the attention of the members of the Security Council to all aspects of the situation in East Pakistan. We have noted the conclusion in his communication to the effect that no fundamental solution to this problem can be found unless there is a political reconciliation and unless humanitarian principles are respected.\n189.\tWe are fully aware that the diplomatic actions of the community of nations are impeded, in cases of this kind, by obstacles of a legal nature. Full compliance must be ensured with Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter signed at San Francisco, which does not authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State. But neither can our Organization remain inactive when the fundamental principles of the Charter concerning human rights are challenged or likely to be so. Several of our colleagues have asked relevant questions during this debate-among them, the Secretary of State for External Affairs of Canada [1944th meeting], when he wondered at what time an internal conflict involves too many countries for it still to be considered an internal conflict.\n190.\tThat is why we welcomed with interest the suggestion made by the Government of Pakistan on 11 August 1971 to send to that region a committee consisting of members of the Security Council to establish contact. By taking this decision, the Government of Pakistan demonstrated its understanding of the fact that, when a domestic political dispute leads to such a sequence of distress and spills over into the territory of other States, it is necessary to involve the international community in the action to be taken to end it. Obviously, our world Organization would forfeit much of its credibility if it remained indifferent to the magnitude of the human tragedy which these displaced populations are experiencing. We must seek and find political and constitutional solutions based as Mr. Schumann said a few days ago [1942nd meeting]-on the consent of the Pakistani people and enabling the populations to return home after their confidence in the future has been restored and they have been assured that human rights will be respected.\n191.\tSuch a result cannot come about without concerted measures: first, those of the Government of Pakistan, as it is that Government which is affected by a domestic dispute; then the co-operation of the Government of India because of the presence on its territory of the many millions of refugees; and, lastly, the assistance of the international community. Without taking sides, without amending the text of the Charter, how can we here encourage the parties involved to seek a peaceful solution? Can we not make committees of inquiry, liaison and good offices available to them? Cannot our Organization invite the parties to accept conciliation or arbitration? Must this pacification procedure be conceived at the regional level at which the community of peoples of the same part of the world may have a better understanding of the nature of events affecting it more directly, or must we, on the contrary, involve* States which would obviously have no personal interests in that part of the world?\n192.\tThese different questions are before us, and the world expects from us specific replies which will make it possible not only to assuage the pain and human misery, but also, and above all, to solve the problems which gave rise to these disasters.\n193.\tThe Belgian people and Government are anxiously following the deteriorating situation and hope they can participate in any pacification measures that may be adopted.\n194.\tWe are confident that the Governments of Pakistan and India, which are directly affected by these problems, will display the requisite moderation and understanding and that the necessary action will be initiated without delay, The United Nations, and especially our Secretary-General, must help them in this. That is the specific hope which I express today on behalf of my country. We hope that all the questions thus raised, and especially those concerning the contribution of the United Nations to the improvement of relations among States, will be pursued.\n195.\tAll eyes are focused on the tragic martyrdom of so many Pakistanis, and we hope that the peace-seeking institutions too are conscious of the need for imaginative studies on the development of pacification procedures in domestic disputes.\n196.\tAnd this leads me to recall that every year for the past six years, in support of the proposals made by the Secretary-General in 1966, we have drawn the attention of the Assembly to the need to seek a strategy for peace. A new science has arisen in the meantime, called \\\"polemology\\\". Over a hundred institutions throughout the world are dealing with it and each year present a considerable number of reports which should be studied by the United Nations.\n197.\tMany times we have proposed that the Secretary- General should be requested every two years to submit to the General Assembly a review of the studies produced by these international research centers. We should, of course, choose those that are of particular relevance to our peace-keeping obligations. The purpose should not be to analyse these studies because that might betray their spirit; nor should there be, notwithstanding what some people have thought, any co-ordination and systematization of these studies, the initiative for which must continue to lie entirely with each institution dealing with peace research. The review, which we should like to be of an informative nature, would be a concise one and therefore necessarily inexpensive. The mere fact of having it submitted to the Assembly would, however, enable each of our states and the competent United Nations services to refer to it if they so wished. And if a short debate were to follow the submission of that report it might provide an opportunity for bringing up subjects not yet cover , which might be requested by our Organization or any one of our States.\n198.\tAccordingly, we are submitting this year a draft resolution  setting forth the proposal I have just described to the Assembly, The question is on the agenda [item 39], and we should be grateful to all States that have already shown interest in this project if they would support and vote for it.\n199.\tAnd now I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to a series of recent and crucial facts that are very impressive and demonstrate that all around the world political behaviour is becoming increasingly realistic, I would mention the following: the prospect of the imminent participation of the People's Republic of China in the life of the United Nations; the announcement by the President of the United States of a readjustment of United States positions in some key sectors; the admission of the United Kingdom and the three other friendly States to the European communities in the very near future; the long- awaited agreement concluded between the four major States, which improves the situation in Berlin; the confirmation given by Mr. Brezhnev and Mr. Brandt that one of the most important steps towards the general normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic will be the admission of those two States to membership in the United Nations in the context of the detente in Europe.\n200.\tThose facts are important not only because they reflect some fundamental changes that have occurred since the end of the Second World War but also because they herald and call for new balanced situations. Mr. President, in your introductory statement you yourself stressed \\\"the gradual transformation of the international order from the rigid, bipolar constellation of contending forces ... to the new, multi-centered power configuration\\\" [1934th meeting, para. 30]. On the new bases, a policy better adjusted to realities and needs can be developed, and the effectiveness of our Organization should be enhanced thereby.\n201.\tBelgium draws some of its own conclusions from this.\n202.\tFirst, the universality of the United Nations, a fundamental aim of our Organization, prompts us to recommend strongly that the People's Republic of China should occupy the seat reserved for China under our Charter. In the name of the same universality we think that logic and policy require us to seek to bring about the conditions whereby the divided States that are not yet Members could be admitted without ousting those that are already Members provided they abide by the Charter.\n203.\tA second conclusion comes to mind. One year ago we already had occasion to point out from this rostrum [1856th meeting] that the aims of the Charter can be achieved concurrently with the action of the central institutions of the United Nations through agreements and regional organizations created on the spontaneous initiative of countries grouped in a given zone. Each year that movement becomes more evident in the world, and today the significance of this vast regrouping and restructuring trend seems to be increasingly decisive in establishing a new world balance based no longer on hegemony but on co-operation.\n204.\tThe linkage of various and better-structured regional groups can remove some of the difficulties deriving from the disproportion in terms of area and power between the different protagonists in the international debate. The regrouping can, of course, imply the waiver of national sovereignty only to the extent that Governments and peoples expressly agree to do so, but they must permit the various regions of the world to reach the level of political effectiveness that will enable them to shape their own future.\n205.\tLastly, the third conclusion which we draw for our country from these facts, as we have mentioned, both within and outside the European continent, confirms the need for Europe's political and economic unification, which\nBelgium is pursuing with increasingly stronger conviction and determination.\n206.\tMore than ever, three major goals useful to Western Europe but also to the world at large must be reached.\n207.\tFirst, the Europe of the six, and soon of the 10, united countries must become itself, that is, it must acquire a power commensurate with its responsibilities. It is the ambition of the constituent States to organize among themselves a new and original form of co-operation as regards both institutional structures and the aims pursued.\n208.\tEurope, of course, already appears as a major economic and commercial power. But consideration of world realities leads it to intensify and expedite the process of its political unification. The United States, which has done so much to help Europe to find its way, is readjusting its position. China, as we have said, is anxious to put forward its position. All this obliges Europe to determine and to play its role on the world stage. What role? Mr. Schumann put it very well the other day: \\\"... refusing to accept any kind of hegemony is the best contribution a country can make to the birth of a truly international community\\\" [1942nd meeting, para. 37].\n209.\tThat is true of Europe. Its role will not be one of hegemony. Europe has renounced that temptation. It will, of course, have sufficient dignity to contribute its share of security in its own area, but without engaging in external adventures. It is not spending its resources on intercontinental weaponry. The Europe of realities will therefore be a Europe that is active at the world level but a moderate and non-belligerent Europe whose sole ambition will be to be a moderating, conciliatory, or, to put it in a nutshell, pacifying authority.\n210.\tAt the European-continent level, Western Europe is not just seeking to consolidate its internal peace. It has already resolutely opted for a policy of detente and co-operation between all European States, both committed and non-committed. Over the past six years a long road has been traveled despite painful accidents. What we expressed then as a hope is taking shape and becoming a reality today.\n211.\tNow that the obstacle of Berlin is more than half overcome by the agreement of the four guarantor States, active preparations must be made for the two-fold step of the balanced reduction of the forces in Europe and a conference on European co-operation and security. Those two aims derive from the same spirit. We aspire to both, and we hope very particularly that the Berlin agreement will soon enter into force and allow us to meet again soon at Helsinki.\n212.\tBut that is not yet enough. Western Europe, based on common convictions and traditions, well realizes that the prosperity it has achieved and the privileges it enjoys cannot always be only to its own advantage. It is an exceptional achievement to have doubled Europe's national income in 14 years. But the redoubling of that effort would be ridiculous were Europe to limit its action to that goal. It must find its deep-lying meaning, a further legitimacy, by taking on another original mission: that of contributing decisively towards solving, in co-operation, the problems \ncreated by the inequality of wealth among the different regions of the world.\n213.\tEurope must contribute imagination, a sense of justice and generosity in a specific dialog with the States of the southern hemisphere. Europe must persuade those States that its regional regrouping is not selfish. Europe knows it can deserve the friendship of peoples only to the extent that it shares with them a concern for their economic, social and human future. In order to meet that expectation it will, of course, be necessary gradually to reformulate the rules of trade and industry. We, for our part, are ready to do that.\n214.\tWestern Europe is confronted in these years with crucial problems. Now is the time for its new face to appear. It must find, and it will find, both internally and in its outward-directed action, the structures and attitudes which will give it its own stature and enable it to play a renewed role. To that extent only will it become an effective tool for pursuing the fundamental aims of our world Organization: the maintenance of security, development and co-operation.\n215.\tAnd now, Mr. President, J. should like to ask you to transmit to the Secretary-General these final comments which I shall now make.\n216.\tOn other occasions when our Secretary-General announced his wish to retire from the eminent post he occupies, we were among those who asked him to stay. Today we are afraid that he will no longer yield to our urging, after having fully devoted, for 10 years, all the resources of his personality to peace and co-operation among peoples.\n217.\tOur Sovereign, King Baudouin, his Government and all the Belgians have always placed their trust in the person and the actions of the Secretary-General, held them in high esteem and given them their support. We are gratified that his visits to Belgium and our actions in the United Nations have borne ample witness to this fact.\n218.\tAmong the immense services he will have rendered us, I would like to mention one in particular: the admirable report in which he has just, presented to us his views on the political responsibilities of the Secretary-General [see Aj 8401/Add. 1, paras. 124-137]. We, for our part, fully support this conception, and we would like the choice of his successor to be made with serious consideration given to the political responsibility, unique in the world, of the Secretary-General.\n219.\tWe know that a world Organization conceived in very different circumstances a quarter of a century ago cannot continue to be enlivened and regenerated without the talents of his successor. We intend to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, during the vote for his successor, by trying to bear in mind the noble conception of the Secretary-General's function that U Thant has so well incarnated and described."

        "file_text": "86.\tIt is with deep regret that we have this morning learned of the death of Ambassador Morales, Permanent Representative of Honduras. I should like to extend to his family and to the delegation of Honduras our profound sympathy on their tragic loss.\n87.\tSir, your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly gives me the opportunity to recall the happy record of cordial relations between our two countries since we attained independence. Your election does honor not only to the dynamic people of Indonesia but also to the peoples of the third worlds of which Africa forms an inseparable part. The spirit of the\nAfrican-Asian Conference, held at Bandung in 1955, continues to animate our policies and forms an important part of the tenets on which our foreign policy is constructed. It is in the light of these sober reflections that I wish you to accept the sincerest congratulations of the Government and people of Ghana on your election to this high office. We are confident that your long and devoted service to your country will enable you to undertake your new and arduous task with the highest sense of statesmanship, competence and distinction.\n88.\tWhile congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to this office, I wish to extend our deepest gratitude and congratulations to your distinguished predecessor, Ambassador Hambro of Norway, who brought considerable experience, statesmanship and dedication to the many problems that faced the historic twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n89.\tOur warmest congratulations and best wishes also go to the four States Bhutan, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman-that have been admitted to membership in the United Nations within the last few days. We welcome them wholeheartedly. Ghana voted for their admission in the confident expectation that, with their rich cultural heritages and their known attributes as freedom-loving peoples, they have a valuable contribution to make to the furtherance of the objectives of this Organization.\n90.\tThe United Nations has just completed 25 years of existence. At the commemorative twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the record and achievements of this Organization were reviewed. Some of the basic questions uppermost in our minds at the commemorative session concerned the way in which the United Nations could play an increasing role in the decade ahead. We were also concerned with how that role could be made more effective in the settlement of disputes and the narrowing of the ever-growing gap between the rich and the poor nations.\n91.\tAt the last session the Assembly made a considerable effort to tackle some of the major problems of the world when it adopted important documents on the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], the anniversary itself [resolution 2627(XXV)], decolonization [resolution 2621 (XXV)], international security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] and the principles of international law governing friendly relations among States [resolution 2625 (XXV)]. Despite that achievement we must continue our self-criticism and our re-examination of the role the United Nations must continue to play in the future. Consequently, at this session of the General Assembly, the Organization must establish its priorities and begin to define precisely its strategy for the solution of the many problems that confront the Organization in the political, economic, social and humanitarian fields as well as in the area of science and technology.\n92.\tMany speakers who preceded me addressed themselves sufficiently to the problems confronting the world. Prominent among them is the maintenance of world peace. The Ghana delegation would wish to emphasize what has been generally regarded as a vital contribution to the solution of this problem namely, the need for a comprehensive world disarmament agreement.\n93.\tThe momentum of the armaments race and the alarmingly high expenditure it involves still remain a great burden for all mankind. It is a sad reflection on our sense of priorities-indeed it is a crime against humanity for States to be spending more than $200,000 million a year on the manufacture and perfection of weapons of destruction when they are unable to spend 1 per cent of their gross national product on the elimination of poverty, disease and squalor in the world. My delegation was pleased to note that the United Nations recognized the implications of that fact when, in the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], the Assembly for the first time established a link between progress in disarmament and economic development and security.\n94.\tThat is why we must condemn the increase in the arms race and the lack of progress in disarmament. We appreciate the fact that in the field of arms control some agreements have been reached over the last few years, but we cannot conceal our disappointment at the lack of progress by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva on general and complete disarmament including the simultaneous elimination of chemical and biological weapons. In this regard we regret the inability of the nuclear Powers to reach agreement on the banning of underground nuclear tests.\n95.\tWe welcome the changed circumstances that are now making it possible for the People's Republic of China to play a useful role in disarmament affairs. We also support in principle the Soviet draft resolution proposing a world disarmament conference [AIL.631], which is generally in line with suggestions made by my delegation in the First Committee at the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth sessions.\n96.\tThe Ghana delegation is aware of the fact that there can be no disarmament without trust among the nations. Nor can there be peace without an effective machinery for resolving the conflicts which divide the nations. We are also aware that the United Nations, as a machinery for peace, cannot achieve the objectives for which it was established unless Member States constituting it develop confidence in its ability to do so. Consequently, the Ghana delegation supports all efforts aimed at increasing the effectiveness of this Organization and engendering mutual trust among the nations.\n97.\tIn this connexion, the Ghana delegation has followed with keen interest the efforts being made to reach settlements in the Middle East, Europe and Asia on outstanding political problems in these regions.\n98.\tIn the Middle East, Ghana is happy that the cease-fire continues. The lack of progress, however, in moving forward toward some tangible settlement of the basic issues still continues to cause my country considerable disquiet.\n99.\tMy delegation is of the view that there is danger of the Middle East issue reaching a stalemate and becoming a volcano, so to speak, which could erupt and engulf not only countries in the Middle East, but the rest of the world as well.\n100.\tThe Government of Ghana cannot subscribe to permanent occupation by force of the territory of any\nState. Neither can Ghana support doctrines and policies aimed at the annihilation of any people or nation. The challenge of the Middle East crisis resides, in the view of my delegation, in the search for a just, fair and permanent solution to the refugee problem and other related problems in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We believe that there can be no permanent peace in the Middle East unless a secure existence for all the States in the region is guaranteed.\n101.\tIn Europe, the delegation of Ghana r cognizes the gains so far made m the search for a political solution to the German problem. We can only wish the Berlin talks now going on between the two German authorities great success.\n102.\tPeace in Europe and the Near East is inextricably bound up with peace in the Far East. That is why the Government and people of Ghana welcome recent developments in bilateral United States-Chinese relations and consider them worthy of note and commendation. My Government hopes that this new trend will be considered by all concerned in a spirit of understanding and international co-operation. It is our hope that the normalization of the bilateral relations between China and the United States will contribute to political stability and peace in Asia and in the world at large.\n103.\tWhile the new United States initiatives on its bilateral relations with China are important, it is the related problem of the representation of China in the United Nations which creates the greatest challenge for the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In this regard, it is urgent and important to underscore the relevance of the universality of membership to the effectiveness of the United Nations in facing up to its responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and security. In an age of unprecedented and rapid changes in the political, economic, scientific and cultural spheres, it is imperative that the United Nations, which has more than doubled its membership, would be able to adjust to changed conditions and respond decisively to new challenges.\n104.\tI am aware that some of the problems posed by the universality of membership in the United Nations do not lend themselves to easy solution. However, if we mean to strengthen this Organization, if we are determined to do right and justice, then it is incumbent upon us to open the doors of this Organization to all States regardless of their political systems.\n105.\tIt is against this background that the Government of Ghana once again asserts that the Government of the People's Republic of China must be seated in the United Nations General Assembly now. It is the inherent right of the People's Republic of China to be a Member of this world body. It is our view that the People's Republic of China should take its seat not only in the Assembly but also in the Security Council, as well as in all other United Nations bodies. Ghana's position with regard to the related issue of the Republic of China has been reiterated from this rostrum on a number of occasion' and I have no intention of repeating arguments which are ^y now well known. Now I would merely wish to express the firm hope of the Ghana delegation that the realism that is inspiring the international community on this and other questions will lead to a solution that will generate greater confidence in the effectiveness of this Organization.\n106.\tThe whole world is saddened by the plight of the refugees from East Pakistan who have fled into India. This is without doubt the most dangerous and the most serious refugee problem that has confronted the United Nations in recent decades. Humanitarian considerations compel the international community to provide all necessary means to alleviate this great suffering and to help in establishing conditions for the early voluntary return of these refugees to their homeland. This great crisis calls for the highest form of statesmanship., courage and wisdom if a lasting settlement of the problem is to be achieved.\n107.\tThe spirit of realism which now seems to inform present international relations can provide a favorable atmosphere for the solution not only of the question of the representation of China, but also of the question of the divided countries. In this regard, the Ghana delegation accepts the view often advocated by our distinguished Secretary-General that the divided States must be enabled to participate in the deliberations and work of the United Nations and its subsidiary organs on an equal basis.\n108.\tIn working towards this, my delegation believes that the United Nations should refrain from doing anything that would have the effect of prejudicing serious efforts being made by the two sides of any divided country to resolve their own differences.\n109.\tI shall now deal with iecent developments in southern Africa. A few moments ago, I welcomed the new spirit of realism in international relations, a spirit which generates some optimism in this Organization's ability to resolve outstanding international problems. I regret that I cannot say the same about the African scene, particularly regarding racialism and self-determination in southern Africa.\n110.\tA careful study of the reports of the Special Committee on Apartheid, the United Nations Council for Namibia, the Committee of Twenty-Four, and the Trusteeship Council leaves us with the depressing conclusion that no major progress has been achieved in recent years in the area of decolonization in southern Africa. On the contrary, apartheid continues to be strengthened in South Africa, and is spreading to Southern Rhodesia under the illegal regime of Ian Smith. South Africa's control over Namibia shows no sign of weakening. In the Territories under Portuguese administration in Africa, the liberation struggle continues unabated. This situation is not only a challenge to the credibility and capability of the United Nations in the eyes of Africa's millions; it is also an invitation, unfortunately, to the oppressed peoples of Africa to pursue violent means of achieving their political rights, freedom and human dignity.\n111.\tAlthough South Africa has rejected the recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on Namibia,  it is the hope of my delegation that deliberations in the Assembly will produce concrete proposals that will lead to the early implementation of that advisory opinion. The Ghana Government will support any realistic proposals to this end.\n112.\tAfter the unilateral declaration of independence five years ago, and after the imposition of sanctions against the resultant illegal and unconstitutional regime, that regime continues to deny the Africans, who form the majority of the population in Southern Rhodesia, their basic human rights and freedom.\n113.\tIn spite of the evasions which have contributed to making sanctions less effective than they could have been, it is the hope of my delegation that sanctions will continue to be enforced against that regime till justice based on the five principles laid down by the United Kingdom Government has been firmly established. My delegation would urge the United Kingdom Government not to abdicate this position in any talks or \\\"talks on talks\\\" with the Smith regime; for any settlement which sacrifices any or all of those principles wil1 be considered by the Government of Ghana and other Governments within the Organization of African Unity and, we hope, by the rest of the world as a complete sell-out.\n114.\tThe problem posed by apartheid and the expansionist policies of South Africa constitutes one of the greatest obstacles to a just and peaceful solution to southern African problems. As long as South Africa continues to practice a policy of apartheid, its hopes of reaching out to the rest of Africa are doomed lo failure. As far as Portuguese colonialism is concerned, the Ghana delegation calls on Portugal to comply with the numerous United Nations resolutions calling for self-determination for the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). My delegation calls on the big Powers to use their political and economic influence to assist in ensuring that the decisions of this Organization on these vital issues are respected and universally enforced.\n115.\tAny solution to these problems should be guided by or based on the Manifesto on Southern Africa (the Lusaka Manifesto),  which has been endorsed by both the Organization of African Unity and this Assembly [resolution 2505 (XXIV)]. If the racialist and colonialist Governments of South Africa and Portugal demonstrate that they accept the principles of the Lusaka Manifesto and adopt concrete measures aimed at eradicating racial discrimination and applying the principle of self-determination, Africa will be ready to explore new bases for better relations with them.\n116.\tAt the commemorative meetings of its twenty-fifth session last year, in a unique act of international co-operation and in accordance with one of the cardinal aims of its Charter, this Organization launched the Second United Nations Development Decade and adopted the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)] -a set of positive policies which aim at accelerating, within the Decade, the growth of material production and its equitable distribution among the peoples of each country.\n117.\tThe uniqueness of this act of international co-operation for development, as contrasted with the effort of the first United Nations Development Decade, lies in the fact that the international community has, this time, set itself a comprehensive and consistent set of objectives and outlined measures for realizing them. In a most encouraging act of international partnership, the developed and the developing countries have agreed to co-operate in adopting and implementing policies aimed at complementing and supple-menting each other's efforts in the task of eradicating hunger, poverty, ignorance and disease in the third world.\n118.\tIt is well to remind ourselves that the problems which we set ourselves to solve in the post-war period are still with us. They have, in fact, worsened in many respects. For most developing countries, the targets and policy measures adopted under the first Development Decade have not engendered any perceptible improvements in living conditions. The peoples of the developing world continue to be plagued by a lack of basic necessities of life, and the gap between the developed and the developing countries continues to widen each day. Unless the international community, therefore, applies itself resolutely to the commitments which have been solemnly undertaken, the Second United Nations Development Decade, like it^ predecessor, will be for most of us another decade of frustration and unfulfilled promises.\n119.\tThe peoples of the third world, of course, must accept, and have in fact accepted, the primary responsibility for their own economic development. The experience of international development in the 1960s, however, has amply demonstrated that the poor results which often attend the efforts of developing countries are to a large extent determined by forces beyond their control. The present upheavals in the international monetary system provide convincing proof of this. The policies enunciated in the Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade constitute a recognition of the essential and indeed crucial complementary and supporting role that developed countries must play if the efforts of the developing countries are to result in raising living conditions in the third world. The Ghana delegation, therefore, fervently hopes that a spirit of international co-operation will imbue all proposals which aim at solving the present international monetary crisis.\nThe constraints frustrating the efforts of developing countries to achieve a rate of economic growth which will ensure decent living conditions are well known and do not need elaboration here. They include balance-of-payments problems, aggravated by widely fluctuating prices of the primary products on which the economies of developing countries depend, as well as pricing policies of developed countries and uncontrolled inflationary tendencies. The result of all this is the creation of a situation where the developing countries sell cheaply to the developed countries and pay dearly for consumer and industrial goods purchased from developed countries. These problems have been further worsened by excessive indebtedness, which is fast becoming characteristic of the economies of developing countries. These debts have been incurred principally as a result of developing countries being compelled, by their anxiety to generate economic development, to raise financial assistance on very hard terms and conditions. These hard terms in most cases have had no relationship to the ability of the projects for which assistance was given to amortize themselves within the agreed period of repayment.\n121.\tIt is for these and other reasons that my delegation looks forward to seeing the result of the study on the problem of the growing indebtedness of developing countries which the President of the World Bank has undertaken with a view to formulating general principles for its solution. I should like to observe, however, that, if developing countries are to derive maximum benefit from any form of financial assistance, then a greater part of it should be given to them on a Government-to-Government basis rather than as financial transfers from the private sector of developed countries.\n122.\tIt is also for these reasons that Ghana, along with other developing countries, has advocated and pressed for the conclusion of international commodity agreements which would stabilize commodity prices and ensure steady foreign exchange earnings on which meaningful development planning could be based. It is the view of my delegation that the principle of international price stabilization agreements supported by realistic buffer-stock policies is one of the most effective ways by which developing countries can help themselves in their efforts to build viable economies.\n123.\tWith that consideration in mind, my delegation would like to urge the developed countries to co-operate in reaching agreement on cocoa and other commodities. As will be readily recalled, the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade set the target date of 31 December 1972 for the conclusion of international commodity agreements or arrangements on commodities defined by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ at its second session as being suitable for management through such commodity arrangements. It is our fervent hope that, long before this target date, there will have been concluded an agreement on cocoa.\n124.\tIn the face of an unfair international economic system, developing countries have in most cases had to resort to a number of measures to correct the constraint's on their development created by balance-of-payment difficulties. These have included import restrictions which have invariably led to severe cuts in development and worsened their circumstances even further. Even when they have embarked on programs of export promotion, their products have had to face high tariffs and other trade barriers in the markets of the developed countries.\n125.\tMy delegation had entertained great hopes when, at the first session of UNCTAD seven years ago, proposals for giving non-reciprocal, non-discriminatory tariff preferences to the exports of developing countries were launched. We had particularly welcomed the principle, which the proposals tried to establish, of treating unequal partners differently in international economic relations. The present system which has been adopted by UNCTAD and which various important developed countries are beginning to implement, however, does little to further this principle and does not help the developing countries in their attempts to gain access for their products to the markets of the developed countries, an imperative so essential to their orderly development.\n126.\tThe generalized, non-reciprocal system of preferences adopted by the Trade and Development Board  is unrealistic in its products coverage, for its seeks, in effect, to give generous tariff preferences to products which most developing countries do not at present produce and gives little or no tariff concessions in respect of those goods that developing countries actually do produce. To illustrate, the tariff barriers which cocoa products face in the European Economic Community, even after the introduction of this new scheme, range from 52 per cent to 16 per cent. For a country like Ghana, whose main product is cocoa, industrialization based on cocoa is the most natural path for the development of the economy, but the protective effect of the tariff structure of developed countries seriously impedes our efforts at exporting cocoa in any processed form. These examples can be multiplied with reference to the products of most developing countries.\n127.\tWe have welcomed the principle underlying the move for a generalized scheme of non-reciprocal tariffs as a hopeful movement towards more equitable relations between developing and developed countries in international trade. My delegation therefore hopes that, even as the present imperfect proposals are being implemented, this Organization would take another look at the arrangements in order to make them more relevant and more responsive to the conditions of the developing countries.\n128.\tAt this session the General Assembly will be performing a most important function. It will be taking some important decisions with regard to the review and appraisal of the objectives and policies of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. The aim of the deliberate formulation of international development targets that was involved in the Development Strategy is to induce progress at a faster rate than would have occurred in the absence of such concerted action. Whether or not those targets are achieved will depend not only on the political will and sense of commitment with which they are implemented, but also on the machinery for appraising and evaluating implementation efforts. It is the view of my delegation that any machinery devised by this Organization a for appraising and evaluating progress in the implementation of the undertakings which Member States made when they adopted the International Development Strategy must be simple and effective. It must make the maximum use of existing institutions. It must have mechanisms for adjusting objectives and policy measures in the light of inevitably changing circumstances. Above all, it must command the confidence of all Member States.\n129.\tI think it is appropriate for me at this stage to pay a special tribute to our distinguished Secretary-General, UThant. For 10 years UThant has served the United Nations and the world community with unselfish devotion and great vision, courage and integrity.\n130.\tThe United Nations and the world community owe him a great debt of gratitude, and I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express the sincere and warm thanks of the Government and people of Ghana to U Thant, and to extend to him our heartfelt good wishes for his future,\n131.\tThis session, the first after last year's session marking the twenty-fifth birthday of this Organization and closing a decade, is an important one. Its deliberations should set the perspectives and objectives of the new decade it initiates; they should, above all, 'ensure that in the decades to come mankind shall live in a world free from the threat of war, free from annihilation by nuclear weapons, free from the conflicts that divide us and free from poverty, hunger, ignorance and disease. On the vision and courage with which this session accepts the challenge of the new decade will depend the success of our experiment in international co-operation for peace and progress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "114.\t Both the course and the content of the general debate at the twenty-sixth session of the Unit d Nations General Assembly have provided new evidence and new proof that the fighting alliance of the basic revcMionary forces of today-the world socialist system, and the international workers and national liberation movements -is gaining strength in the joint struggle against imperialism, while the forces of war, aggression, and the exploitation and oppression of other peoples have been compelled to retreat, using every possible means to camouflage policies which are contrary to the interests of peace and co-operation.\n115.\tDuring the past year, as a result of the efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist States, which consistently and openly pursue a peace-loving foreign policy, and with the support of all progressive forces, positive results have been achieved in the improvement of the international situation.\n116.\tWe have all witnessed a further decrease in tension in Europe, a detente which has been assisted by the treaties concluded between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany  and between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany,    both of which we hope will soon enter into force, by the four-Power agreement on West Berlin, and by increasing support for the proposal put forward by the member States of the Warsaw Pact for a conference on problems of European security and co-operation.\n117.\tThe process of developing and strengthening relations between the Soviet Union and other countries throughout the world is actively continuing. The Treaty on Friendship and Co-operation between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Arab Republic of Egypt, signed at Cairo on 27 May 1971; the Treaty on Peace, Friendship and Co-operation between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Republic of India, signed at New Delhi on 9 August 1971; protocols on consultation between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and France and between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Canada, and numerous treaties and agreements on the development of economic, commercial, scientific and technical co-operation between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other countries which have been concluded are having a positive effect on mutual relations between States. It would be difficult to overestimate the positive impact upon the development of international relations and the general improvement of the international situation resulting from the meetings held by Comrades L. I. Brezhnev, N. V. Podgomy and A. N. Kosygin with the leaders of a number of countries, from the reciprocal visits to and from the Soviet Union of party. Government and parliamentary delegations, and from meetings and contacts at other levels.\n118.\tAll the activities of the Soviet Union in the sphere of foreign policy are based on the principle of proletarian internationalism in relationships with the socialist States and peaceful coexistence in relations with all other countries bequeathed by V. I. Lenin.\n119.\tThe aims of Soviet foreign policy are to work with the other socialist countries to create favorable international conditions for the building of socialism and communism; to strengthen unity, solidarity, friendship and fraternity between the socialist countries; to support the national liberation movement and co-operate in every way with the young, developing countries; to uphold consistently the principle of peaceful coexistence between Slates with different social systems; and to offer a decisive rebuff to the aggressive forces of imperialism, and save humanity from a new world war.\n120.\tThe Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union confirmed the consistency of the Soviet Union's peace-loving Leninist foreign policy and adopted a specific Program for the struggle for peace and international co-operation.\n121.\tThat well-known peace Program, for which the Belorussian SSR expressed full support in its reply to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the subject of the strengthening of international security [A/8431], has been widely acclaimed and supported by those to whom the ideals of peace, social justice and progress are dear.\n122.\tUnfortunately, however, not all countries have maintained a peace-loving course in their foreign policy activities, a course aimed at ensuring a decrease in international tension and the solution of controversial problems by peaceful means without the threat or use of force and in the interests of furthering good-neighborly relations between all countries.\n123.\tThe United States of America is continuing its aggressive war against the peoples of Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia. With its assistance and protection, Israel is continuing its aggression against the Arab States and is frustrating a settlement in the Middle East. The colonialists and racists, relying on assistance from the major NATO Powers, are waging a war against the national liberation\nfighters in southern Africa and other parts of the world and continue to hold millions of people under the yoke of colonial and racist domination. The United States of America, caught in a monetary and financial crisis, is trying to extricate itself at the expense of the interests of other States, and primarily of the developing countries.\n124.\tEveryone understands that such policies and actions perpetrated by the forces of imperialism and their accomplices are contrary to the interests of peace and cooperation between nations and are a gross violation of the United Nations Charter and of the most important decisions adopted by the United Nations, including the progressive decisions adopted last year during the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly. We refer in particular to the failure of a number of States Members of the United Nations to observe the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], the Declaration on the Occasion of the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations [resolution 2627 (XXV)], the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2622 (XXV)], the special Program of action for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples /resolution 2621 (XXV)], decisions on questions relating to the Middle East and to economic co-operation, and a number of other decisions whose implementation by all States, without any exception, would contribute to the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and, above all, of the main task of the United Nations-the maintenance of international peace and security.\n125.\tFaced with diametrically opposed approaches by States to the basic international problems under discussion at the United Nations, the many Foreign Ministers and heads of delegations who have already spoken have tried to elucidate the reasons why certain problems remain unresolved. We note with satisfaction that the majority of speakers have pointed clearly and unequivocally to the guilt of the forces of imperialism for acts of aggression, colonial wars, racial discrimination, and the economic exploitation of other peoples. In those statements concrete suggestions for settling outstanding problems have been made, suggestions which are completely in line with, or coincide with, the position of the socialist countries. The ranks of those fighting for peace and co-operation have swelled, inspiring the hope that the joint efforts of all the anti-imperialist forces will lead to the adoption of effective decisions within the United Nations.\n126.\tOur attitude to the statements in which emphasis has been placed on the particular role and responsibility of the great Powers as defined by the Charter of the United Nations is one of understanding. Strangely enough, however, certain speakers albeit not many-in referring to the great Powers and their responsibility, have directed their criticism at all the great Powers, without differentiating between their positions. As a result, demands to end the aggression in South-East Asia and the Middle East, to put an end to colonial wars, to eradicate racial discrimination from human society and to abandon the economic enslavement of the developing countries have been addressed, not\nto the real culprits, but to all the great Powers. Such an approach does not help matters; it distorts the true picture and can easily make it easier for the aggressor and the oppressor to find new subterfuges to evade the fulfillment of their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. What is needed here is a definite and precise position and absolute clarity as to who supports what and who is guilty of what. Lumping the great Powers together serves as a convenient cover for the forces of imperialism and for their acts of aggression in Indo-China, the Middle East and other parts of the world.\n127.\tThe delegation of the Belorussian SSR has followed attentively the general debate in the Assembly and cannot let pass those individual statements which postulate the totally unfounded idea that there are \\\"two super-Powers\\\", that their positions are identical, and that conflict with them is inevitable. Those speakers are obviously prisoners of a concept invented by imperialist ideologists, who have devised the term \\\"super-Powers\\\" to defend the basic principles of capitalism, to justify the aggressive nature of the course of United States foreign policy and to destroy the unity of effort of all the anti-imperialist forces in their struggle for peace, democracy, national independence and social justice. Those who use the \\\"super-Powers\\\" concept a id either promoting their own selfish interests or are attempting, on someone else's orders, to conceal the conflict that exists between the two world systems of socialism and capitalism. They are thus undermining the true struggle against imperialism and fail to understand the elementary truth that the foreign policy of any State is determined, not by the size of the State or by its economic or military potential, but by the class which is in power in that country and by whether the Government pursues policies which are in line with the interests of the working people or whether it defends the interests of the exploiters and oppressors, and by whether that State is a stronghold of peace and a bulwark in the struggle of all progressive and revolutionary forces against imperialism or whether it is acting as policeman to the world and by its policies and actions is bringing destruction, death and suffering to other peoples.\n128.\tThis is the heart of the matter, as I intend to show by analyzing the approach of various States or groups of States to the solution of a number of unsolved and pressing problems which are being discussed within the United Nations, including some which are being discussed in the general debate today.\n129.\tFirstly, however, we should like to state categorically that the Belorussian SSR, like the other socialist States, upholds the principle that every country and all States should, in the words of the Charter of the United Nations, be determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors, to unite their strength to maintain international peace and security, to settle their international disputes by peaceful means, to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force, to assist in the complete elimination of colonialism and its evil consequences and to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples.\n130.\tConsequently, we welcome any bilateral or multilateral agreement between States on any subject provided \nsuch agreement is consistent with the objectives of the United Nations. This cannot be said for those who use the \\\"super-Powers\\\" concept. In this connexion, we have only to recall that almost any agreement on disarmament matters has been rejected precisely by those who like to talk about \\\"super-Powers\\\". Such was the case when the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373(XXII), annex], the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and the Subsoil Thereof [resolution 2660 (XXV). annex] were being prepared, and in many other instances.\n131.\tBut let us return to matters raised by delegations at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n13?, For over 10 years an aggressive war has been waged in South-East Asia, where the United States and its accomplices have killed more than a million Viet-Namese, Laotians and Cambodians, mutilated millions of human beings, destroyed thousands of towns and village* in the Indo-Chinese peninsula, and, by their use of toxic chemical substances, have transformed vast areas into deserts. To the chain of crimes committed by the Hitlerites during the Second World War, an ample reminder of which are such villages as Katyn in Byelorussia, Lidice in Czechoslovakia or Gradour in France, which were destroyed with all their inhabitants, a new and terrible link has been added  Song-My in Viet-Nam. It is not only the United States that is waging this aggressive war, but also a number of countries which call themselves developing States. Instead of occupying themselves with matters related to their own development, however, they expend enormous sums for military purposes or sell their soldiers to a rich great Power and send them to fight in defense of foreign interests, causing untold suffering to the peoples of other developing countries. How do the propagandists of the \\\"super-Powers\\\" concept reply to this? They know very well that the Soviet Union is working indefatigably towards the elimination of the military hotbed in South-East Asia. The Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted a special address on freedom and peace to the peoples of Indo-China. The Soviet Union and other socialist and peace-loving States actively support the just demands of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam, and of the National United Front of Cambodia and the Patriotic Front of Laos. The overwhelming majority of States see in the recent seven-point proposals put forward by tile Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam a constructive Program for a political settlement of the war in South-East Asia. The other side avoids even discussing these proposals. Here in the Assembly there are certain people who are trying to put us off our guard by their talk of decreasing the conflict in South-East Asia, despite the fact that the beginning of this session of the United Nations General Assembly was marked by a resumption of the bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and by a renewal of military operations by United States forces in Cambodia and Laos.\n133.\tThe Byelorussian SSR, like many other countries, decisively condemns the aggression in South-East Asia and demands the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of United States troops and of the troops of their allies from that area, and the abandonment of the policy of forcing Asians to fight against Asians, We affirm our support of the struggle of the peoples of Indo-China for independence and freedom, and demand that they should be given the right to be the masters on their own soil and to decide their own future without foreign interference.\n134.\tLet us now turn to the situation in the Middle East which has resulted from the Israeli aggression against the Arab States which was prepared, encouraged and directed by the forces of imperialism. After more than four years the consequences of that criminal aggression have still not been eliminated. What is the reason? Can anyone here see any collusion between the great Powers, or any identity in their positions? One would have to be quite bereft of reason to assert this. The whole world knows that the Soviet Union, the other socialist States and the overwhelming majority of other peace-loving States decisively and unconditional condemn Israeli aggression and are doing everything possible to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The socialist States and many Afro-Asian countries support the struggle of the Arab peoples, who are the victims of aggression, for the restoration of their violated rights, for a just political settlement in the Middle East and for the protection of the lawful rights of the people of Palestine. This was. also stressed in the statement of the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union calling for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n135.\tOne great Power, France, has adopted a constructive position on the Middle East question. At one time, the United Kingdom was a sponsor of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), although now it has almost entirely adopted the position of another great Power. The Arab countries are ready to implement fully that decision of the Security Council with reference to both the withdrawal of Israeli troops and to the establishment of a lasting peace in that area. In the summer of this year, the Arab Republic of Egypt responded immediately and positively to the proposal of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ambassador Jarring. It stated that It was ready to conclude a peace treaty with Israel on condition that Israeli troops would be withdrawn from the occupied Arab territories. Its patience and sincere desire for peace have guaranteed the lengthy cease-fire in order to achieve the objectives contained in the Security Council resolution. Everyone is aware of the initiative of the Arab Republic of Egypt which proposed measures for the resumption of navigation in the Suez Canal in the near future on condition that the Israeli forces were withdrawn from the Canal Zone, and subsequently from all the occupied territories. Mr. Riad, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Arab Republic of Egypt, has mentioned this point again here [1954th meeting]. In point of fact every argument advanced in the past by Israel in support of its claim that it is only trying to ensure its own security, has received a positive and constructive response- from the Arab States, Nevertheless, Israel is stubbornly evading a solution to the question of the withdrawal of its forces from the Arab territories it has seized. And in pursuing these villainous policies it relies on the support of the United States and certain of its allies. With their assistance, \nmoreover, Israel is building up its military potential and sabotaging a settlement; it has submitted new claims one after another with one sole end in view, namely to retain possession of the Arab territories It has seized. We recently witnessed how, with this same end in view, proposals whose hidden purpose was simply to reward Israel for its aggression were put forward from this lofty rostrum as \\\"new ideas\\\". Quite naturally, those sugared proposals were rejected by the Arab States because they do not and cannot ensure a final political settlement in the Middle East based on the implementation of the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of foreign territory by force, a principle which has been approved by the United Nations. And from this specific historical example everyone can see how diametrically opposed are the policies and positions of the two great Powers or, as some people call them, the two \\\"super-Powers\\\".\n136.\tMr. Khaddam, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, who spoke here [1952nd meeting], was right when he stated that the attempt of Zionist-Israeli propaganda to present Israeli aggression against the Arab countries as a conflict between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the Middle East was intended to establish an absolute link between United States interests and Israeli aggression; this attempt reflects the- desire of the expansionist Israeli Stat 'i to continue its occupation of the Arab territories. We can only regret that some of those who have spoken from this have been taken in by this deceitful trick of tire Israeli aggressors.\n137.\tI have already referred to certain positive trends in the development of the situation in Europe, which are the result of the foreign policy initiatives taken by the Soviet Union and other socialist States. But there, too, there are many pressing problems which require urgent solution. The treaties and agreements which have been concluded have not as yet been implemented, no final decision has yet been taken on the convening of a conference on questions of security and co-operation, and practical work on arms limitation in Europe has not yet begun.\n138.\tIt is a well-known fact that all the proposals to transform Europe into a continent of peace and cooperation have been introduced by the Soviet Union in close co-operation with other socialist States. Such proposals are actively supported by the majority of Western European countries.\n139.\tWhat, then, is impeding their rapid and effective implementation? Once again, it is the relevance, not of all, but of certain of the great Powers and some of their more zealous allies inside NATO to move rapidly and unconditionally towards a total detente in Europe.\n140.\tEveryone knows who it is that has set, and continues to set, every kind of obstacle and more and more prior conditions to the convening of an all-European conference and who it is that asks questions that can only be answered by the conference itself and by negotiations on the limitation of armaments. The question most frequently raised is what will happen if an all-European conference takes place or if negotiations begin on the limitation of armaments. The answer to that question depends on the\n \nposition adopted by the participants in such meetings. But it is clear that if everyone is as resolute and as consistent as the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries in seeking ways of reaching agreement, Europe will no longer be a focal point for world-wide conflict. This will be to the advantage of all nations of the world, large and small, both in Europe and in other countries. The States of the socialist community will make resolute and consistent efforts to attain this end, in full awareness of their great duty and responsibility to all humanity.\n141.\tAll representatives are familiar with the agenda of the General Assembly. But permit me to draw attention to a small but important detail. There are 98 items on the agenda. Among them are quite a few items of an organizational nature that stem from the Charter of the United Nations or relate to elections and the accountability of organs working between sessions. Let us try to select the most important items and remember on whose initiative they were included in the agenda. It will then become clear that the Soviet Union and the other socialist States, including the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, have had placed on the agenda items on the strengthening of international security, the convening of a world disarmament conference and a number of other disarmament questions, including a proposal for the elimination of chemical and bacteriological weapons, nuclear disarmament, and so on. These countries have also had placed on the agenda items connected with the peaceful uses of outer space, the preparation of an international treaty concerning the moon, the question of the universality of the United Nations, decolonization, and economic co-operation. The socialist States have raised matters concerning the struggle against nazism and racism, the punishment of war criminals, the definition of aggression and many other important items on the agenda of the General Assembly, which determine the political character of our Organization.\n142.\tThis year, the United States, with the support of certain other Western countries, even went so far as to make it impossible for the United Nations to erase a shameful blot on its escutcheon, by preventing discussions of questions raised by a large group of socialist and Afro-Asian States on the withdrawal of United States and all other foreign forces occupying South Korea under the flag of the United Nations and the dissolution of the illegally created Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea.\n143.\tIn connexion with this unjustified decision which was forced upon the General Assembly, the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR, as a sponsor of the aforementioned proposals [A/8443 and Add.l, A/8444 and Add.l] states that it will continue to strive actively to secure the departure of the occupying forces from Korean soil, so that the flag of the United Nations will not be used as a cover for imperialist adventures, and the Korean people will be given the opportunity to decide their own destiny.\n144.\tThe position of certain. Western countries regarding even such an important political matter as the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security also deserves attention. A study of the Secretary-General's report on this question [A]8431 and Add. 1-5] shows that the United States did not reply to the\u2003\nUnited Nations questionnaire on the subject, while the United Kingdom contented itself with a formal reply referring to its previous year's report. How are we to understand the position of these two great Powers which, together with the other permanent members of the Security Council, bear the main responsibility for the peace and security of all nations.\n145.\tCertain Western countries have remained silent on the question of convening a world disarmament conference, and the United States has clearly said that it views this proposal with skepticism. We support the proposal for the convening of a world disarmament conference [AlL.631] and note with satisfaction that many States approve the initiative of the USSR, support it and have decided to discuss the problem directly at plenary meetings, thereby stressing its extreme importance in the present situation of an unrestrained arms race encouraged by the military and industrial complex of the imperialist Powers.\n146.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR intends to speak on another occasion on the questions of the strengthening of international security and disarmament. At this point we merely wish to appeal to all States, large and small, to pay the most serious attention, in discussing these questions, to the fact that certain Powers are not adhering to the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, are not assisting the peaceful settlement of military conflicts and are slowing down the process of disarmament. Joint efforts are needed on the part of all Members of the United Nations to eliminate the hotbeds of war and to strengthen the peace and security of all nations.\n147.\tOur policy with regard to the struggle against colonialism is well known. One of the points in the ^Program of peace approved by the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union states that the decisions of the United Nations concerning the elimination of the remaining colonial regimes must be fully implemented, and any manifestations of racism and apartheid must be universally condemned and boycotted. The resolution of the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the report of the Central Committee of the CPSU states that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union \\\"is invariably true to the Leninist principle of solidarity with the peoples fighting for national liberation and social emancipation. As in the past, the fighters against the remaining colonial regimes can count on our full support\\\". \n148.\tSuch is the position of the Soviet Union, and such is the position of the other socialist States. This policy, as is well known, is backed by practical deeds. It was on the initiative of the Soviet Union in 1960 that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was adopted and important decisions, proposed and supported by the socialist States, have been taken with the aim of eliminating colonialism and its consequences. Those decisions have played an important role in the achievement of independence by many countries that have since become Members of the United Nations.\n \n149.\tThe position taken by the present and former colonial Powers is quite the opposite. They continue to support colonial regimes; they grant military and economic assistance to the South African and Southern Rhodesian racists and to the Portuguese colonialists; they commit acts of aggression against sovereign States Members of tin United Nations, impose the dangerous idea of a so-called dialog with the South African racists on the African States, and refuse to co-operate within the United Nations in order to complete the process of decolonization. With that purpose in view, some of them have even gone so far as to use the veto in the Security Council and to withdraw from United Nations organs dealing with decolonization.\n150.\tDuring the course of the general debate, Ministers for Foreign Affairs and heads of delegations of African and many other countries have justly rebuked the colonialists and the racists for their actions. We proclaim our full solidarity with them and will do everything possible to speed the complete elimination of the remaining colonial regimes.\n151.\tIt is not enough to eliminate the colonialists political domination. That must be followed by a process of independent economic development in the interests of the peoples of the young sovereign States. As a result of the efforts of the Soviet Union and the other socialist States and with the support of the developing countries, it has been possible, despite resistance from the forces of oppression and exploitation, to secure the adoption of a number of decisions which have promoted the economic and social advancement of nations. It is sufficient to recall in this connexion the decisions of the United Nations which establish the inadmissibility of setting political conditions when granting economic assistance and recognize the inalienable sovereignty of every nation over its natural resources and riches, decisions which call for measures to be worked out within the United Nations to reduce considerably the export of capital in various forms from the developing countries and to increase their share of the profits of foreign monopolies, decisions which recognize the need for State control on the part of developing countries over the activities of foreign capital and call for the regulation and improvement of tax systems in the developing countries with respect to both local and foreign capital, in order to achieve greater equity in the distribution of income and the utilization of national resources for development purposes. We have demanded and continue to demand that the former colonial Powers, .and also the capitalist countries which still continue their predatory exploitation of the resources of others, compensate the developing countries for the material losses that they have suffered.\n152.\tIt would be possible to continue this list and give specific examples, but it is already clear that in matters of economic co-operation, too, our position is radically different from the policies and practices of the United States and its associates in the exploitation of the riches of the developing countries, and in attempts to solve their own economic problems to the detriment of, or at the expense of, the legitimate interests of other States, a matter on which many representatives of the developing countries and even of certain Western countries have spoken convincingly. Almost all Members of the United Nations recognize the\nneed to implement the principle of the universality of the organization. Thanks to our consistent position on the question of universality,, the membership of the United Nations has been increased by 80 States in the 26 years of its existence. We now advocate the admission of the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations and the simultaneous admission of the Federal Republic of Germany) the restoration of the lawful rights of the Chinese People's Republic in the United Nations and the expulsion from all organs of the United Nations of the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek who illegally occupy its place.\n153,\tWe do not intend to go into details concerning those who are impeding implementation of the principle of the universality of the United Nations, However, we cannot let pass the references which have been made to the membership of the Byelorussian SSR in the United Nations by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers, [1950th meeting] references which are unworthy of the representative of a great Power.\n154.\tThe Byelorussian SSR is a founding Member of the United Nations, and made a considerable contribution to the preparation of the Charter of the United Nations and to the adoption of decisions aimed at ensuring its implementation. We earned the right to become a founding Member of the United Nations in the cruel and deadly struggle against the grim forces of fascism during the Second World War. More than 1,100,000 citizens of the Byelorussian SSR fought at the front during the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet people against the Hitlerite invaders, and on the temporarily occupied territory of Byelorussia more than 440,000 partisans and underground fighters carried on a heroic struggle in the ranks of the fearless avengers of the people and were supported in that struggle by the entire Byelorussian people.\n155,\tPerhaps Mr, Rogers is not aware of the fact that up to the time when the fascist occupiers were driven from Byelorussian soil, the Byelorussian partisans and underground fighters alone had killed or put out of action over half a million of Hitler\u2019s soldiers and officers, that is to say considerably mom than the British and American armies put together had done by the middle of 1944.- These facts are known to many Americans. The heroic role of the Byelorussian people in achieving the aims of the United Nations and the right of the Byelorussian SSR to be a founding Member of the United Nations were recognized by one of Mr. Rogers predecessors, the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Stettinius, in a statement at a press conference in Washington on 3 April 1945.\n156.\tWe would remind Mr. Rogers of this and tell him not to use such impermissible methods in his efforts to defend the unjust cause of keeping the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek in the United Nations.\n \n157.\tDuring the discussion of items on the agenda in plenary meetings and in the Committees, the Byelorussian delegation will state in greater detail its position both on questions raised this morning and on questions that we have not been able to refer to because of lack of time. We have deemed it desirable to go into more detail in revealing the false concept of the so-called \\\"super-Powers\\\", not in order to defend our own position or to conceal the strength and capability of socialist co-operation in actively influencing the course of international events, but simply in order to unmask those who proclaim this anti-scientific concept in an attempt to prevent any consolidation of the forces of peace, progress and democracy and to cover up aggression and the seizure of foreign lands.\n158.\tWe should like once again to remind distinguished representatives that the Soviet Union and the other socialist States are guided in their foreign policies by the interests of international security, the principle of the equality of all nations, respect for the sovereignty of each country, and the inadmissibility of interference in the internal affairs of States. The socialist States have never developed relations with any countries at the expense of, or to the detriment of, the interests of others and have done everything possible to ensure that multilateral co-operation between States was built and developed on the basis of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.\n159.\tIn our century of struggle between two opposing trends in foreign-policy matters, that is to say between the policies of the forces of socialism and of the forces of imperialism, no country which is truly interested in peace and co-operation between nations can remain on the sidelines; it must join the anti-imperialist front and wage an active struggle against policies of aggression and war. Only in this way is it possible to ensure truly independent political and economic development. This is the political course of the future and the affairs of those nations that pursue it will undoubtedly flourish.\n160.\tOur foreign policy is one of peace and international security, the strengthening of fraternal relations between socialist countries and of their alliance with the anti-imperialist forces fighting for freedom throughout the world. It can already be said that the Program for the struggle for peace, freedom and national independence, put forward by the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has evoked a wide response in every continent of the world.\n161.\tThe general political debate at the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly now drawing to a close confirms this absolutely.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "115.\t Mr, President, may I join with all those who at this early stage in the general debate have already extended to you and to Indonesia congratulations on your appointment to the presidency of this Assembly. As representatives of a country of the third world, my delegation cannot but identify with the aspirations of your people and share in their elation at your appointment. I pledge to you our unswerving support as you discharge the high responsibilities of your office with that skill and that integrity for which you are so renowned.\n116.\tLet me join also with those who have paid tribute to your distinguished predecessor for his having presided so successfully over the twenty-fifth session. That session, including as it did our special anniversary proceedings, imposed unusual burdens on the presidency; we are all indebted to Mr. Hambro for his having borne them with such urbanity and with such fortitude.\n117.\tThis happens to be the fifth successive year in which I have had the honor to address the Assembly in general debate. In terms of the statistics of tenure of Foreign Ministers, I daresay that this makes me a veteran. But the concomitant of service is experience; and the experience of five sessions of the General Assembly including, as they do, the procedures of reappraisal and self examination with which we commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations imposes an inevitable reflectiveness upon a 'present contribution. It is out of this personal experience, therefore, no less than out of the experience of my country during these same early years of our national existence, that I speak. And it is on this experience and about the lessons it has taught us in the area of international relations that I venture to address this Assembly. I hope that there may be added justification for doing so if, as I believe to be the case, those lessons have relevance for all States and for all peoples, but, more especially, for our work here on the bank of the East River.\n118.\tThe first lesson is how essential it is to secure universality of membership in the United Nations. It is a lesson that should have needed no urging upon us; for was it not explicit in that act of commitment made on 26 June 1945, in San Francisco, that, through the unity of all the peoples of the world, symbolized in and made effective through this Organization, we would save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and bring justice and progress to a world of equal men and women? Today, 26 years later, this Organization still does not represent all the peoples of the world. It represents in fact less than two thirds of all mankind. Is it surprising, therefore, that that unity to which the Charter looked remains elusive, and that the global objectives of the Charter remain beyond our reach? Is there a delegation here that has not learned out of its own experience, here in New York and indeed elsewhere on the international circuit, that if we are to have a realistic chance of achieving the objectives of the Charter in our time, we must have among us in the United Nations all those who truly represent the people of all States?\n119.\tWhen the first session of this Assembly was held, in 1946, its membership numbered a mere 51 States. Today, due in no small measure to the work of the United Nations in the field of decolonization, that membership stands at 130 with the admission at this session of the new Member States of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar, whom we welcome to this Organization. Many of these, although by no means all, are, like our newest Members, small States new to freedom and, therefore, new to the international scene. But both separately and as a group they are among the Members most mindful of the value of this Organization and most committed to its effectiveness. Speaking, as I do, for one such Member State, it is reassuring to have the confirming testimony of the SecretaryGeneral himself when he places on record, in the introduction to his report to this session on the work of the Organization, his strong belief that those new nations \\\"have made an important contribution to a more representative and balanced view of the world in the United Nations\\\" [A/8401/Add.l, para. 53]. Yet more remains to be done if we are to make that view fully representative and truly balanced.\n120.\tAs this twenty-sixth session of the Assembly begins, the world's most populous State, the People's Republic of\\\" China, whose Government speaks for one third of mankind, is not represented in this Organization. Let us resolve that it shall be ere this session ends. And let us ensure as my delegation shall strive to ensure it that by eschewing sterile debate and by rejecting procedural devices which either seek or, indeed, without seeking it have as their result the frustration of that purpose. It is time, in the view of my delegation, that the People's Republic of China should occupy its seat in the General Assembly and take its place among the permanent members of the Security Council. We believe it to be in the interest of this Organization that that be done at this session if necessary leaving to the future, and by such procedures as be most appropriate, settlement of such other issues as may arise from that result, but which must not impede its achievement.\n121.\tBut the seating of the People's Republic, while advancing greatly the universality of the membership of the United Nations, will not in itself achieve it. It is, therefore, not too early for the Assembly to issue a call at this session for arrangements that will ensure that those peoples of the divided nations not now represented in this Assembly will no longer suffer this disability and that their Governments may make their contributions to the international community within this Organization, whether or not a solution to the problem of division is immediately attainable. If we thus ensure that the only impediments to our realization of the goal of universality of membership of the United Nations are the last halting steps in the process of decolonization, we shall have provided new incentives for quickening that process and for making this Organization the forum of the world it was designed to be. When that goal is reached, when a resolution carried in this Assembly truly speaks in the name of mankind, we shall have come closer to fulfilling those ennobling purposes of the Charter to which we all stand committed,\n122.\tUniversality of membership will indeed bring us closer to the fulfillment of the purposes of the Charter, but it will not, of course, in itself secure that fulfillment. What is needed, what all our experience all too painfully underlines as the primary need of our time, is a will on the part of all Member States to live by the precepts and the principles of the Charter. An enlarged membership of the United Nations may do little more than enlarge the area of semantic confrontation and widen the scope of inconclusive dialog unless it is accompanied by what a past President of this Assembly described as \\\"a return to the spirit of the Charter a return, that is, to the collective commitments enshrined in the Charter as the basic obligations of every Member State.\n123.\tIt is a sad commentary on the failure of Member States to live up to those commitments and to those obligations that the SecretaryGeneral, in surveying the work of the Organization over the last 10 years, should feel constrained to report to this Assembly:\n\\\"... I cannot help reaching the conclusion that during that period the most powerful nations have all too seldom shown themselves able to rise above the suspicions, fears and mistrust that spring from their different ideologies, different objectives and different conceptions of the best interest of the world. By and large, the rivalry of nations continued to be the dominant factor in international life\\\" [ibid., pm. 6],\nThat is a severe indictment of the major Powers and of the superPowers in particular. Yet it is an indictment that is unanswerable, for the chronicles of this Assembly and the events of each passing year are testimony to its truth, and in no respect more so than the primary commitment under the Charter the maintenance of international peace and security.\n124.\tPledged under the Charter to \\\"practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors\\\", Member States, and others now outside the membership of the Organization, have continued the race to outstrip each other in stockpiling the hardware of war and in developing their capability for destruction in ever more sophisticated ways and to ever spiraling levels of annihilation. Some progress has, of course, been made in the dialog of disarmament, but almost non a in disarmament itself. Indeed, it is a sobering commentary on this record of failure that the growth rate of the world's weaponry of destruction is now higher than it ever has been, and that the volume of arms, including nuclear arms, held in armories the world is now greater than ever before in the history r /the human race. Driven forward by fear and suspicion but also, not infrequently, by ambitions of dominion the world's annual expenditure on military equipment has now reached the staggering figure of $200 billion. Compare that figure with the approximately $7 billion which the developed countries state as their annual contribution by way of official development assistance. The world spends more on arms in every single fortnight than flows in an entire year as official assistance from developed to developing countries. And each year, as we discuss disarmament and place on record our asseverations of peace, that annual withdrawal from the budget of peace grows ever larger.\n125.\tPledged, similarly, under the Charter \\\"to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security\\\", we fail to advance beyond the piety of declarations and, in particular, fail dismally to come to grips with the essentials of international peacekeeping. Even on so limited a subject as United Nations military observers, the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations has failed to make any significant progress, largely as a result of continuing disagreements between the major Powers. And yet international peacekeeping in all its aspects must be the very cornerstone of any system for the maintenance of international security.\n126.\tMy delegation has raised its voice repeatedly in this Assembly, as we do again, in calling for a bold and imaginative approach to the question of peacekeeping for arrangements that at the very least can be relied upon to preserve the peace in advance of conflict. Preventive peacekeeping operations do not raise issues of the same complexity as do peace enforcement measures undertaken after the peace has been transgressed; but they can deter transgression. The right so to guarantee the peace of the world by preventing its violation can no longer be denied this Organization if international security is to be preserved.\n127.\tIf it continues to be so denied at the instance of the major Powers, is it not time that a system of collective security be agreed upon by those Member States not inhibited by considerations of power based upon a system of preventive peacekeeping administered on their behalf, and without the involvement of nonparticipating States, through this Organization?\n128.\tMy delegation, however, shares the view expressed in the SecretaryGeneral's report that it is surely\n\\\"... not beyond the capabilities of the Members of the Organization to devise a system that is both realistic and flexible and that takes account both the susceptibilities of sovereignty and national policies and of the urgent demands and challenges of conflict situations\\\" [ibid., para. 174*.\nWe urge Member States to postpone no further the establishment of such a worldwide system or, at the very least, to begin discussions during the twenty-sixth session on the lines of the more limited scheme I have suggested.\n129.\tPledged, as we are, under the Charter to ensure \\\"that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest\\\", the pages of contemporary history continue to be filled with the record of armed conflict: of the war in IndoChina, which has now extended from VietNam into Laos and Cambodia and which will not end unless foreign intervention of ail kinds has ended and an environment secured in which incentives for reconciliation and peaceful solutions replace present incentives for obduracy and for war; of the convulsive conflicts of the Middle East, where differences over interpretation of Security Council resolutions for peace provide new bases for continuing tensions, while territory occupied by force remains a prize of war; of a miscellany of situations around the globe .where armed force or the threat of it is made to serve a national, rather than the common, interest.\n130.\tBut to focus upon these particular failures whether in disarmament or in peacekeeping or in the avoidance of armed conflict is surely to mistake the symptom for the cause; for the cause of failure lies in the malady itself, which is the absence of an ethos of collective responsibility for international peace and security. In the idiom of contemporary surgery, what the world needs is an international heart transplant so that that \\\"collective weakness and collective impotence'? which the SecretaryGeneral diagnoses in his report could be replaced by collective strength and collective effectiveness and the world body given a new chance of performing its primary function, namely, the maintenance of international peace and security.\n131.\tIt may be said that there is little that most States can do to advance this change; that the realities of our time condemn international peace and security to being held in pawn to power, and that it is futile to raise our voices in protest, in anguish or even in exhortation.\n132.\tMy delegation does not accept so hopeless a prognosis. In the first place, we believe that if we refuse to relapse into cynicism and despair progress can be made by patient persistence in the cause of peace, by raising the principles and precepts of the Charter to the level of an international ideology and by pursuing every practical possibility of advancing collective security through collective responsibility and action.\n133.\tBut, beyond this, we are not without hope, because the people of the world and, more especially, the young people of the world, whose inheritance we hold in balance are mindful of our derelictions and are everywhere asserting that they cease. When we are tempted to be intolerant of the protests of the young in any of the forms those protests take-it would be well for us to pause and reflect that theirs is the true spirit of the Charter, that theirs, not ours, are the authentic voices of peace, not just because they will be tomorrow's leaders, but because what they assert today is right and they must prevail. We would do well to match our actions to their mood and avoid, while there is still time, the condemnation of history for having failed to secure that better world which was, after all, our dream at San Francisco.\n134.\tAnd there are other respects, beyond international peace and security, in which that dream has remained unfulfilled; for international peace and security conceived of in terms of relations between States will mean little to the people of the world if they remain everywhere in chains. That is why in the Charter we reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women everywhere. That is why one of the early acts of the new world Organization was the promulgation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have made notable advances since that time, and the record of international action in advancing the processes of decolonization and in securing recognition of and protection for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual is one of which this Organization may rightly be proud. But while pride is justified, complacency is not; for tragic failures mar that record, both with respect to decolonization and the advancement of the dignity and worth of the human person.\n135.\tColonialism and discrimination are still with us, and from their vestigial outposts in southern Africa rise up in blatant challenge to this Organization and to the conscience of mankind. The triadic evil which the regimes in South Africa, in Southern Rhodesia and in the Portuguese controlled Territories of Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) represent must be confronted by a righteous and united world community if we are not to make the Charter a mask for hypocrisy. Yet there are all too few indications of that righteousness and of that unity, Struggles of liberation being waged in southern Africa receive tangible support from all too few of the countries of the world, We are ready to condemn, but reluctant to redress. Some Governments, like my own, make no apology for the assistance we give in this cause and it is heartening to see a major section of the world's religious community lending assistance to the liberation movements in their effort to cleanse these remaining enclaves of racial bigotry and oppression.\n136.\tBut it is one thing to abstain from a just struggle; it is quite another to give help and comfort and practical assistance to those on the side of injustice; and this is precisely what is happening in southern Africa. The SecretaryGeneral has reported that, notably with the help of South Africa and Portugal, Southern Rhodesia has so effectively surmounted the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council that it has managed actually to increase the annual volume of its external trade. Meanwhile, South Africa's trading partners, unwilling to make sacrifices at the national level for the international cause of human dignity, continue to make an investment in apartheid and to bolster the moral and physical strength of the regime by sustaining and strengthening relationships in trade, commerce, investment and diplomacy, and by a variety of mutually beneficial endeavors, including the supply of arms or of the patents for their manufacture.\n137.\tMy delegation repeats the call we made at the twenty-fifth session for the acceptance by other Members of this Organization of the commitment already undertaken by the countries of the nonaligned group to impose an embargo on trade with Portugal, South Africa and Rhodesia and by every other means open to them to make these regimes responsive to the will of this Organization [1876th meeting, para, 47]. How can we fail to take up the challenge which they have thrown down to humanity in general and to this Organization in particular?\n138.\tSouth Africa has elevated the creed of racial discrimination to the level of a social philosophy and has made it the cornerstone of national policy. The illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia shows every indication of moving in the same direction. South Africa continues to defy the decisions of this Organization on Namibia, despite the recent confirmation of their binding authority by the International Court of Justice. The regimes in the Portuguese controlled Territories flout the mandate of the Assembly for decolonization and use colonialism both as a shield and a sword against this Organization in its efforts to put an end to human degradation in Africa.\n139.\tOnce again, as in the field of international peace and security, what we lack is not international machinery for implementing the provisions of the Charter but the will to take the necessary decisions and, having taken them, to ensure their implementation and effectiveness. To foster that will, let us acknowledge as axiomatic the universality of human dignity; that human rights are not divisible; that they cannot be apportioned among States and peoples; that the dignity of man is everywhere affronted when the human personality is anywhere degraded; that justice must be given the worldwide dimension for which the SecretaryGeneral has called if injustice is not to debase our civilization and threaten the peace of the world. And let it be acknowledged, therefore, that gross violations of human rights wherever they occur in the world are the legitimate concern of the international community; that matters cease to be essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of a State when they give rise to humanitarian issues of such magnitude that the international community must of necessity grapple with them.\n140.\tBut just as the international community must legitimately be concerned with the debasement of human dignity, so the international community has an obligation to secure conditions in the world which are propitious to the advancement of human dignity and, more particularly* to the enjoyment of those fundamental human rights which are affected by forces beyond the control of the domestic jurisdiction. We have made great advances at the national and international levels in textual guarantees of human rights and we have made great practical advances in the effective protection of civil and political rights in most, even if not in all, parts of the world. The efforts that remain to be exerted in this area are essentially at the national level.\n141.\tIn the field of economic, social and cultural rights the picture is entirely different, and for the developing countries in particular the matter does not end with national action, for their enjoyment depends at least as much upon an international economic system that is conducive to the elimination of the development differential and is favorable to economic and social reform in the developing countries. Thus it is hypocritical in conditions of chronic unemployment resulting from underdevelopment to give assurances of the right to work; it is provocative in those circumstances to talk of the right to leisure. Yet, until more equitable economic arrangements can be established between the developed and the developing world, this distinction will remain between sentiment and reality, between promise and performance, between expectation and achievement. If added incentive be needed for more effective international action in the economic and social spheres, let the developed countries which are parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognize an additional responsibility extending beyond their national jurisdictions to all those whose lives are affected by their economic policies and the policies of the economic institutions they control.\n142.\tIn that same context of the interrelationship between development and the enjoyment of economic, social and culture rights we have looked with sadness and concern on the recent movement of millions of refugees across international frontiers from Pakistan into India and have shared as a brother with those countries the anguish of that great human tragedy. We have noted the SecretaryGeneral's statement in his report to this Assembly that the basic problem can only be solved if a political solution based on reconciliation and a respect for humanitarian principles is achieved [AffMOl/AddJ, para. 191], and we acknowledge with him that in a disaster of such vast proportions the international community has a clear obligation to help the peoples and Governments concerned in every way. Mindful of all the many dangers with which this situation is fraught, but conscious of the deep desire of both Governments for a lowering of the tensions which it has generated, we pray that the occasion of this Assembly might provide new opportunities for the pursuit of early, effective and satisfactory solutions.\n143.\tAs I indicated in my address to the twenty-fifth session [1876th meeting], the Government and people of Guyana recognize fully that national sacrifice and national effort by the developing countries are prerequisites for progress and we stand pledged with our colleagues in the nonaligned countries to make the doctrine of self-reliance the principal instrument of national development. On that same occasion, I suggested that in pursuing such a program of national development the primary efforts of the developing countries would have to be directed to control and ownership of their own resources in conformity with the spirit and principles of the Charter and with the more specific resolutions of this Assembly; and I invited an assurance from the developed countries that in relation to this effort they would refrain from imposing an economic imperialism to take the place of the passing political dominion and that they would pledge as part of their commitment to international development positive assistance to those developing countries which seek to help themselves by exercising effective sovereignty over the development of their natural resources.\n144.\tNot merely was that assurance not forthcoming, but the months between the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth sessions have demonstrated that, whatever may be the restraint shown by the Governments of some of the developed countries in relation to the implementation of such policies, multinational corporations and even international financial institutions are as yet unready to concede their legitimacy.\n145.\tIndeed, developing countries, such as mine, which have sought to pursue such policies have been the recipients from these quarters, not of encouragement and assistance, nor even of a benign acquiescence, but of a whole range of subtle and not so-subtle pressures to desist. We invite this Assembly to reiterate the right of all peoples and nations to permanent sovereignty over their natural wealth and resources for the purpose of enhancing their national development and the wellbeing of their peoples and to call again upon the capital-exporting countries to refrain from any action which would hinder the exercise of this right, whether directly or through those international financial institutions whose policies they so greatly influence.\n146.\tHowever, the movement of international development capital is only one facet of a complex international economic system which has produced the present disparities of wealth and development and which remains resistant to their removal despite the protests of the developing countries and the efforts of this Organization. Bolstering the system is an international legal order which must itself be reexamined in the context of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)J and with a view to ensuring that the work of the United Nations Development program and such organizations as the United Nations Industrial Development Organization makes an effective and permanent impact on the development gap. Thus, we need to reappraise, in the context of a critical' examination of the economic issues involved, the law relating to international shipping, with particular reference to the establishment of international freight rates, which can have such devastating effects on the economies of developing countries, and the law relating to international air transport, to international sale of goods, to international payments, to international monetary transactions, to international commercial arbitration to mention only a few. My delegation, therefore, welcomes the establishment of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as a move in this direction, and we trust that the Commission will see its task in terms of the progressive and equitable development of the law relating to international trade rather than the mere unification and harmonization of inherited norms. As a member of that Commission, Guyana will endeavor to ensure that the Commission so proceeds.\n147.\tFor like reasons, my delegation welcomes the enlargement of the composition and mandate of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction and its transformation into the committee preparing the conference on the law of the sea now scheduled for 1973 [resolution 2750 C (XXV)]. The enlargement of the international community since the Geneva Conferences on the Law of the Sea of 1958 and 1960 and developments both in technology and in understanding of the issues at stake will make it necessary for the 1973 conference to reexamine a variety of matters which the four 1958 Conventions crystallized at too formative a stage of their development. My delegation will lend its support both in the enlarged Seabed Committee and in this Assembly to all measures designed to ensure that the 1973 conference meets squarely the challenge posed by the existing unevenness in global economic and technological development and establishes ^ regime on the law of the sea which is genuinely equitable to all States,\n148.\tIf all Member States can approach the conference in this spirit it might yet provide an almost unique occasion for agreement on the distribution of at least one part of the world's resources based on the just needs and entitlements of all peoples rather than on the vicissitudes of self interested exploitation. If that can be achieved and If, in like manner, the spirit of internationalism can pervade the deliberations and condition the results of the forthcoming United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, we may indeed commence a new and more glorious chapter in the conduct of human relations. Certainly we shall come closer than ever before to demonstrating that determination which we proclaim in the Charter \\\"to employ international machinery for the economic and social advancement of all peoples\\\".\n149.\tIn the context of internationalism and a world legal order, I should like to say a word about the International\nCourt of Justice, It is, regrettably, the case that the United Nations has created as its principal judicial organ a Court which its Member States are reluctant to use. That the International Court of Justice should have no disputes submitted to it for decision would be a matter for satisfaction to the international community were it not the case that disputes abound which are within the jurisdiction of the Court but which States either submit for settlement to more expensive and protracted ad hoc arbitration or allow to remain unresolved. The International Court of Justice ought to be one of the more effective stabilizing and unifying influences in the international community. Its influence is sorely needed if we are to evolve a common law ' of mankind and substitute an effective international legal order for the arbitraments of power.\n150.\tWithin recent years a variety of proposals has been advanced for promoting more frequent recourse to the Court. Most of these proposals deserve serious and sympathetic examination with a view to making the Court an institution acceptable to all States as a tribunal for the settlement of those disputes between States which are amenable to the judicial process. If, after such examination, it proves to be necessary to amend the Statute in order to achieve such a result, we should not hesitate to embark upon that course. Just over a year ago, I suggested to this Assembly that there was much in the jurisprudence of the Court to justify optimism about the result of the Security Council's request to the Court for an advisory opinion on Namibia [Security Council resolution 284(1970)]. That that confidence, which would have been shared by many Member States, proved to have been fully justified may, I trust, still further advance the authority of the Court and, therefore, of a regime of legality in international affairs.\n151.\tFinally, let me say a word which must not at this Assembly be left unsaid. It is a word of tribute, of gratitude, of appreciation to the SecretaryGeneral of this Organization who has served it and us, its Member States, with such constancy, such integrity and such devotion to the cause of internationalism over these last 10 years. I come from a small country whose people are now neither of the East nor of the West, who have our present and our future in Latin America, whose recent links were with Europe but whose origins lay mainly in Africa and in Asia. We are, to some degree, a microcosm of the world, and this Organization and what it stands for under its Charter are of preeminent importance to us in our national and our international existence. The Secretary-General is at once both the symbol of the aims and the objectives of the Organization and its chief administrative officer to whom the world, sometimes quite wrongly, looks for their continuous attainment.\n152.\tNo one who has read the SecretaryGeneral's reflections on his decade of service as set down in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8401/Add.l, paras. 124137] can fail to be moved by the deep personal commitment that has characterized his service to this Organization. In like manner, no one who has read his personal testimony on \\\"The role of the Secretary General\\\" delivered to the United Nations Correspondents' Association on the eve of the twenty-sixth session can fail to be convinced that, when the full record can be written, his continuous and discreet, activity over the entire spectrum of international affairs during the last 10 years will, indeed, be seen as an effective and tangible contribution to the cause of international peace and understanding in our time. However, the best tribute we can pay him and his officers of the Secretariat who labor so resolutely and wit^ such sustained commitment in that cause is to ensure by our own efforts in the decision-making processes of the Organization that they do not labour in vain.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "31.\t On behalf of the Japanese delegation, 1 wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on your assumption of the presidency of the twenty- sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am confident that this session of the General Assembly will be led to fruitful accomplishments under your effective guidance, an outstanding statesman of Asia\n' who is making continuous efforts day and night to bring about peace and the relaxation of tension in that area. I have had the pleasure of maintaining the closest of relationships with you for a number of years and I hold you in the highest esteem. I cannot forget the great skill \ndisplayed by you at the Djakarta Conference on Cambodia in May last year.\n32.\tI wish to take this opportunity to express my deepest respect to Edvard Hambro, the former President of the General Assembly. We all came to recognize his outstanding leadership last year during our twenty-fifth anniversary session..\n33.\tI wish to pay my sincere respects to our esteemed SecretaryGeneral, U Thant, and to express my profound appreciation for his dedication to the noble efforts of the United Nations for world peace.\n34.\tI now take pleasure in extending my heartfelt congratulations to the delegations of Bahrain, Bhutan, and Qatar which have become Members of the United Nations at this session of the General Assembly. Our warm, cordial and friendly relations with Bahrain and Qatar, these two emerging States of the Persian Gulf, have been maintained and nurtured through diplomatic channels or visits of economic missions. I also recall with particular delight that H.R.H. Prince Wangchuk, the chairman of the delegation of the Kingdom of Bhutan, has long been a close friend of my own country.\n35.\tThe struggle for the peace of mankind, which has continued since the end of the Second World War, is today approaching an important turning-point.\n36.\tIn Europe, where efforts to lay the groundwork for easing tension have continued for the past several years through dialog between East and West, the four Powers, namely, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union, have recently entered into basic agreements on the Berlin issue. This we heartily welcome as an opportunity to accelerate the relaxation of tensions not only in Central Europe, but also in the whole world.\n37.\tLikewise, we ere beginning to see a ray of hope for easing tension also in Asia, many parts of which have suffered the ravages of war and which has been the arena of fierce confrontations between East and West for a quarter of a century after the end of the last war.\n38.\tOne year after the appeal made by President Park Chung Hee of the Republic of Korea on 15 August last year, a first step was taken to open a dialog between the Republic of Korea and North Korea. The fact that arrangements have been made to begin, in the near future, a dialog between the leaders of the United States and the People's Republic of China seems to open a new prospect of cooperation and the relaxation of tensions in the Far East, and in turn, the whole of Asia and throughout the world.\n39.\tIt is noteworthy that efforts for peace are being continued in the Middle East and VietNam by the parties concerned, in spite of a series of disappointing twists and turns. We sincerely hope that just and peaceful solutions will be achieved as soon as possible by the parties concerned with true courage and the spirit of conciliation.\nfeared involvement in war, are anxiously waiting for a relaxation of tensions.\n41.\tJapan, as a nation of Asia, and as a nation dedicated to peace, is determined to extend a helping hand in the struggle for peace.\n42.\tThe Japanese people, who suffered the ravages of the Second World War, are firmly determined that such a catastrophe should never be repeated. The Constitution of Japan, which is based on pacifism, embodies that determination. The Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Sato, enunciated anew last autumn from this rostrum [1877th meeting/ the fundamental policy of Japan's foreign relations, which is to defend freedom, steadfastly pursue peace and promote the peace and prosperity of the world. Above all, Japan intends to cooperate to the fullest possible extent with the developing countries in their efforts towards development and to safeguard its own peace and security by promoting the harmony and prosperity of all the peoples of the world. This point was also clearly stated by Prime Minister Sato last year in this Assembly hall. The Japanese people strongly hope that the big military Powers of the world, those which possess nuclear weapons, will be mindful of their grave responsibility for the maintenance of world peace and will make extraordinary efforts for the furtherance of disarmament and mutual understanding among nations.\n43.\tThe foreign policy of Japan based on peace is in full accord with the objectives pursued by the United Nations and, therefore, this world Organization commands the wholehearted support of the Japanese people. There are some who allege the revival of Japanese militarism. It will be clear from the foregoing statement of mine that nothing is farther from the truth than such a misunderstanding.\n44.\tBelieving that the struggle for peace is now entering a new phase, I should like to emphasize that the time has come further to strengthen the organization and functions of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. Japan will endeavor to strengthen the United Nations in cooperation with all Member States and will expand the scope of its contributions to various activities of the United Nations.\n40. The peoples of Asia, who for long years lived under 46. First of all, I believe that, in strengthening our gunfire, grieved at the division of their motherlands, or , Organization, the possibility of reviewing the Charter itself\n45.\tThe United Nations celebrated last year the twenty- fifth anniversary of its founding, and we witnessed on that occasion the upsurge of a mood for the strengthening of this Organization. It may be recalled that, in the general debate [1842nd meeting], I made on behalf of my Government a number of concrete suggestions concerning the strengthening of the organization and functions of the United Nations. I believe that this year, the first year of the 1970s, we should see to it that this mood is translated into practice. In this connexion, I should like to make a strong appeal, especially to the permanent members of the Security Council, on account of their grave responsibility for the pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations, not to take a backward looking attitude to the question of strengthening and reforming the organization and functions of the United Nations.\nshould not be ruled out. Since I have made the Japanese position on the question of the Charter review very clear in the general debate last year [ibid,, paras. 6181], I will refrain, from going into details at this moment. I should like to reaffirm, however, that such a review should be centered on the  following four points: namely, first, the organization and functions of the Security Council; secondly, the United Nations peacekeeping operations; thirdly, the organization and functions of the United Nations relating to economic and social development; fourthly, revisions or deletions of anachronistic provisions in the Charter.\n47.\tThe question of Charter review is to be taken up, as it was agreed upon, at the next session of the General Assembly \u201e but I think it is always necessary that we should go back to the Charter itself in conducting discussions and studies to explore the measures for strengthening the United Nations.\n48.\tIt is in the field of peacekeeping operations that the United Nations has made its utmost contribution for the maintenance of international peace and security. We should therefore first set to work to strengthen the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations for the strengthening of our Organization. It will be recalled that the strengthening of the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations was proclaimed in the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, adopted at the last session of the General Assembly [resolution 2734 (XXV)], as one of its major pillars. I believe that it is an important future task of ours to conduct effective deliberations on the various problems relating to United Nations peacekeeping operations in some appropriate forum of the General Assembly.\n49.\tThe recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the question of Namibia  clearly demonstrated the importance of the role to be played by the world tribunal for the establishment of law and justice in international relations. The problem of the review of the role of the International Court of Justice will be taken up again by the present session of the General Assembly [item 90], and I believe that we should tackle the problem positively with a view to strengthening the Court.\n50.\tI should now like to take up some of the pending issues in current international relations and to explain our position on these issues.\n51.\tThe question of Chinese representation in the United Nations has been under discussion in the General Assembly since 1950. In view of the recent development of the international situation, this question is regarded as one of the most important subjects of discussion at the current session of the General Assembly.\n52.\tAt the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the votes in favor of the so-called Albanian draft resolution exceeded those against it [1913th meeting/, A number of countries have since recognized, and established diplomatic relations with, the Government of the People's Republic of China. It was announced in July last that the President of the United States, Mr. Nixon, would visit that country. The international situation involving China is moving rapidly and the People's Republic of China is about to emerge from its long isolation and to join the international community as an important member.\n53.\tIt is highly desirable that the Government of the People's Republic of China cooperate with all countries of the world for the establishment of a lasting world peace. In this sense, we consider its participation in the United Nations meaningful and we welcome it.\n54.\tHowever, it is also a fact that there exists in Taiwan the Government of the Republic of China ruling a population of over 13 million. Should this fact be ignored, it would upset the international balance prevailing in the Far East and intensify tensions, rather than bring about a relaxation of tensions, in that part of the world.\n55.\tWith these considerations, the Government of Japan has decided to cosponsor the draft resolution requesting the General Assembly to decide that any proposal in the Assembly which would result in depriving the Republic of China of representation in the United Nations is an important question under Article 18 of the Charter [AfL.632 and Add.l and 2] and also the draft resolution seeking to affirm the right of representation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, to recommend that it should be seated in the Security Council as a permanent member, and at the same time to affirm the continued right of representation of the Government of the Republic of China [A/L.633 and Add.l and 2],\n56.\tThe Japanese Government holds the position that China is one, and we sincerely wish that the problem should be solved through peaceful dialog between the two parties concerned. I am convinced that our proposed draft resolutions are not prejudicial to either of the two conflicting claims involved, and that they are appropriate as a transitional step reflecting the reality of the international situation relating to China. I earnestly hope that our draft resolutions will be adopted with the support of a majority of Member States.\n57.\tIn order to restore peace in Indo-China, there still exists a number of difficult problems to be resolved. But we note with interest that the international relations surrounding Indo-China and the Paris peace talks suggest an increasing tendency towards peace. I appeal from the bottom of my heart to the parties and countries concerned to nurture and foster this movement for peace with great care. It is, needless to say, what is most required today in Indo-China and SouthEast Asia at large: not destruction through warfare, but peace-building and the maintenance of peace. Japan, being located in Asia and having deep concern with the changing situation of Asia, is determined to cooperate as much as possible with other Asian countries for the earliest possible restoration of peace in Indo-China. Moreover, we will undertake positive cooperation for the maintenance of peace in that region once peace is restored. I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate that my country is prepared to extend maximum cooperation for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the regions of Indo-China, regardless of the difference of political or social system and to make a due contribution for promoting such objectives.\n58.\tIn this connexion I take note with appreciation that SecretaryGeneral U Than! indicated in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization that the United Nations should contribute to the restoration and reconstruction of this area [A/8401/AddJ, para, 40].\n59.\tAs for the Middle East conflict, a long time has elapsed since the ray of hope for its settlement appeared on the horizon, and we regret that the pace of progress towards peace is all too slow. We must realize that delay in the settlement of the question will lead only to the further deterioration of all aspects of this extremely complex problem and the breeding of new problems with benefit to none. I should like to urge all the States concerned as well as the four great Powers to give full consideration to these conditions ana redouble their courage to reach, a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967). As an Asian nation and a member of the Security Council, Japan is prepared to make due contribution towards the peaceful settlement of the problem.\n60.\tIn Palestine and Indo-China, and in connexion with the question of East Pakistan, millions of innocent people have been deprived of their houses and lands and are living in hardship and destitution away from their homes. Their plight is beyond description.\n61.\tObviously, the disputes or the situations which have brought into existence such numerous refugees should be settled expeditiously, but the foremost responsibility of the United Nations and the international community at large is to exert the greatest possible efforts to give whatever relief is needed to alleviate the miseries and pains of these innocent sufferers. Moreover, in my view, such an effort for the relief of refugees will, as one of its effects, expedite the political solution of various complex problems brought about by intensified international disputes. The tragedy of the Palestine refugees with a history of more than 20 years should not be repeated anywhere else in the world.\n62.\tIt may be pointed out, in this connexion, that Japan's recent contributions for refugee relief and disaster rehabilitation amount in total to $12 million. We shall continue our utmost endeavor to increase the amount of such humanitarian relief aid as well as to effect its prompt disbursement. Moreover, we shall reinforce our cooperation in extending our aid in such fields as vocational training and education for refugees, carried out under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other international organizations in the belief that these aid efforts will lead to the fundamental solution of the refugee problem itself. Japan wishes to make its due contribution to the settlement of various problems related to international peace and security through its aid efforts in such fields.\n63.\tWhen we consider the problems related to international peace and security, we should never forget the continued existence of racial discrimination, the illegal minority regime and colonial domination in southern Africa, in defiance of repeated appeals and condemnation by the international community. Japan deeply deplores the situation prevailing in that region and strongly urges the States concerned to liberate colonial territories, dissolve the illegal minority regime and eliminate racial discrimination without delay, in compliance with the appeals of the international community.\n64.\tJapan will not spare itself in cooperating to the best of its ability with the international community, in particular with African States, in their efforts to achieve a lasting settlement of the problem by peaceful means,\n65.\tArms control and reduction are indispensable conditions for the maintenance and promotion of world peace. Especially, the early realization of nuclear disarmament would be imperative, when we come to think about the catastrophe which the use of nuclear weapons is likely to cause to humanity.\n66.\tI should like to emphasize the important responsibility of the nuclear Powers for the realization of concrete measures for nuclear disarmament, such as the promotion of bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic arms limitation and the prohibition of underground nuclear testing. My country, for its part, hopes that ,'he Governments of the Republic of France and the People's Republic of China will participate actively in the forums of disarmament talks, and that they will accede to the treaties already existing relative to disarmament. \n67.\tThe recent announcement of new economic policies by the Government of the United States and the subsequent developments can be considered as a clear reflection of the fact that the trade and monetary system which has supported the development of the world economy for 25 years after the end of the Second World War is now facing a crucial turning-point. How the United States and other countries of the world cope with this new and extremely fluid situation and what new order and rules they may establish will, I believe, have a significant influence on the welfare and peace of mankind. If the countries of the world should merely mind their self-interests and fail to face the present trial with a global perspective, I am afraid that it may bring about the unfortunate division of the world economy into blocs and worldwide economic stagnation.\n68.\tWith such considerations, my country intends to continue to exert, in close consultation with other nations, the greatest possible efforts for the creation of a new order of the world economy.\n69.\tThe Second United Nations Development Decade started on 1 January this year, and we are now entering the stage where we should act for the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Decade /resolution 2626 (XXV)]. We must bear in mind, however, that, in the light of the present international economic situation, the road to the attainment of the goals and objectives of the Development Strategy is not necessarily an easy one. The basic ideal for the Strategy for the Second Development Decade is to promote cooperative efforts between the developed and'the developing countries, while maintaining a system for the free and expanding trade and economy of the world. Therefore, I consider it particularly important, at this juncture, that the international community should reaffirm the above ideal and further strengthen the system of international cooperation for the realization of this ideal.\n70.\tAs for Japan, my Government last year established as its policy to endeavor to attain the 1 per cent aid target by the year 1975.1 wish to point out that the aid flow from Japan to the developing countries in 1970 exceeded $1.8 thousand million, which represented 0.93 per cent of Japan's gross national product of that year. My country will continue to make positive efforts to increase the volume as well as to improve the quality of its aid for development, including the expansion of official development assistance and the softening of the terms and conditions of its aid. We have implemented the generalized scheme of preferences in favor of developing countries since August of this year. I wish to reaffirm our determination that no efforts shall be spared for Japan's positive contribution in the field of international trade in accordance with the goals and objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n71.\tLet me now touch briefly on the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD1, which will be held in Santiago, Chile, in April next year. I believe that the third session of UNCTAD will be a most significant occasion where the possibility and effectiveness of the concerted efforts of the international community to create an affluent world will be tested. For the success of the Second Development Decade, it is essential that selfhelp efforts on the part of the developing countries to cast off the yoke of poverty and underdevelopment, and the earnest cooperation on the part of the developed countries to meet such efforts should be mutually coordinated and reinforced.\n72.\tI believe that it is indeed necessary for all the countries participating in the third session of UNCTAD to study concrete measures in advance, with a serious and creative attitude, on how they can contribute to achieving meaningful results and thus attain the objectives of the Second Development Decade. My country, for one, will explore all possible measures of contribution in a positive manner.\n73.\tThe importance of the United Nations and other international organizations in the field of economic and social development has continuously increased. As we pointed out m the general debate at the last session of the General Assembly, it is vital for us to enable the Economic and Social Council to act as a pivotal organ for realizing better coordination in the work of economic and social development and for providing overall guidelines for the activities of the United Nations family of organizations, so that the United Nations may effectively carry out its responsibility in promoting international cooperation in the field of economic and social development [1842nd meeting, paras. 78 and 79]. We welcome, therefore, resolution 1621 A (LI) adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its fifty-first session in July this year to strengthen and expand the membership of the Council. It is our earnest hope that the expansion of the Economic and Social Council will come into effect as soon as possible.\n74.\tLastly, I wish to touch on the problem of the human environment.\n75.\tIn creating the United Nations we affirmed it as our duty to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Today we are facing a new responsibility to save succeeding generations from the scourge of the destruction of the human environment, which was not foreseen by past generations. Since our earth is a closed ecosystem, pollution and other forms of destruction of the environment, if they exceed a certain tolerable limit, will entail the gravest of risks for mankind. Efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty and to bring about the wellbeing of our society through industrialization, modernization of agriculture and reformation of nature should go side by side with international efforts to preserve a wholesome human environment. Every possible form of international cooperation to protect the human environment must earnestly and urgently be pursued. From this viewpoint, we have great expectations for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which is scheduled to be held in 1972.\n76.\tProblems of the human environment have become particularly acute in Japan, which has a vast population in a small area and is. highly industrialized. These problems call urgently for solution, and my Government, for some time now, has been taking various measures to cope with them. With the enactment in December 1970 of an epoch-making body of legislation, incorporating the most developed legal provisions for preserving the environment, the Government is now in a stronger position to deal with the substance of these problems. Moreover, in order to coordinate more effectively environmental pollution-control measures, we considerably strengthened our administrative machinery for the purpose. A Headquarters of Countermeasures for Environmental Pollution, which had been established under the Cabinet in July 1970, was strengthened and expanded, and developed into the new Environment Agency which came into being this past July.\n77.\tAt the same time, as Prime Minister Sato made clear in his address at the General Assembly in October last year [1877th meeting], we are determined to make a positive contribution to the promotion of international cooperation in this field in the United Nations and in other international organizations. We were for example one of the first countries to ratify the latest amendment to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by (Ml which was adopted by the InterGovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization in 1969.\n78.\tThe United Nations has already established itself as the form for worldwide cooperation and collaboration in every field of international relations. In particular, it is gratifying that the United Nations is now actively engaging in such problems as those of the human environment, outer space, the ocean and the seabed, which have lately emerged on the international horizon as a result of scientific and technological progress. We expect that the United Nations will continue to produce many tangible and effective results in dealing with these problems.\n79.\tIt is my firm belief that the right approach to attain world peace is the reaffirmation by the whole world of the importance of this world Organization and of the need for further efforts to strengthen the Organization by invoking the original spirit which inspired the United Nations at the time of its foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "77.\t Your unanimous election, Sir, to the high office of President of this twenty-sixth regular session of the General Assembly is a resounding tribute to your eminent qualities as a statesman and experienced diplomat, and a source of legitimate pride for your country. Rwanda has particular reason for being pleased with that choice because of the more than friendly relations that my country maintains with Indonesia, whose noble son you are.. Indeed, there exists between our two countries a common destiny, sprung from the same source , that great \\\"event\\\", the African-Asian Conference, in Bandung 16 years ago, which summoned the heretofore colonized peoples to awake and forged in us a common awareness.\n78.\tMy delegation would like at the same time to express once again its very high appreciation for the remarkable way in which your predecessor, Mr. Edvard Hambro, President of the twenty-fifth session, discharged his heavy responsibilities.\n79.\tSecretary-General UThant, an untiring apostle of peace, deserves a special word of recognition. For so many years, he has dedicated his best energies to counseling Member States on translating into reality the great ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. My country would be very happy to see him remain even longer at the helm of this Organization.\n80.\tRwanda is also extremely happy to extend a warm welcome as members of the community of nations to the States of Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar, whose desire for peace and co-operation are known to us all.\n81.\tAs happens every year at this time, the entire world is again assembled in this forum to undertake a collective examination of conscience in order to weigh the successes and failures of nations' efforts to promote the progress and happiness of their peoples.\n82.\tThe maintenance of international peace and security, the development among nations of friendly relations based upon respect for the principle of the equal rights of peoples and on their right to self-determination; the achievement of international co-operation for the solution of international problems in economic, social and other fields, and the encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all are the principal objectives that have been accepted by States represented here in subscribing to the Charter of our Organization. 11 is in the light of those very objectives that their behavior should be assessed.\n83.\tRwanda, for its part, will continue, as it has always done in the past, to direct its foreign policy towards the achievement of those goals, whether it be domestically, in its relations with its neighbors, or within the framework of the Organization.\n84.\tThe lives of nations, just as the lives of individuals, have their shocks and tragedies,\n85.\tThus it is that Europe, which yesterday was solely ravaged by two world wars, today has great prospects for the future, thanks to the dynamic and far-seeing diplomacy of its leaders, who desired and have succeeded in re-establishing good relations between Germany and its neighbors and who just recently laid the foundations for a solution to the problem of Berlin,\n86.\tHowever, while Europe is actively working for a reconciliation with itself in order to regain its former grandeur, the situation is totally different in Asia, where absurd wars, imposed from the outside, spread needless suffering.\n87.\tWhat scope do the war in Viet-Nam and the conflict in the Middle East leave to international peace and security? In both cases a gun is brandished in the name only of \\\"might makes right\\\". But strength for whoever is strong lies not in the subjugation of the weak, but in mastering one's self to avoid falling prey to the excesses to which such strength might lead. As Gandhi, that great philosopher, said, \\\"strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will\\\" and non-violence means \\\"putting one's whole soul against the will of the tyrant\\\".3 It is certainly high time that all the parties to the war in Viet-Nam knew that the Viet-Namese people in particular and the world in general are impatiently waiting for the rays of the sun of peace again to emerge over that suffering area.\n88.\tIn the Middle East, hatred piled upon hatred has hardened and lulled consciences to sleep, by setting up the law of the sword and the cannon in men's hearts. It is necessary for all the Members of the Organization to support the efforts deployed by the four great Powers and by Ambassador Jarring to achieve a negotiated agreement whereby the Arab States may recover, without any preliminary conditions the territories occupied by Israel, and Israel may possess secure and recognized boundaries. This, in the view of my delegation, is the very essence of resolution 242(1967) of the Security Council. As the philosopher Aristotle has said, an unjust victory cannot convey a just claim.\n89.\tI should like to turn now to the problem of the representation of China within the Organization, a subject that has aroused passionate debate for so many years in this Assembly.\n90.\tIn the opinion of my Government, the exclusion of one quarter of humanity from an organization that aims at universality by references to all sorts of fallacious arguments is an absurd situation to which who should put an end. The People's Republic of China should be re-established in its legitimate rights and should take its seat in the Security Council as a permanent member, in conformity with Article 23 of the Charter, as well as its seat in the General Assembly.\n91.\tLike it, or not, the People's Republic of China, with its 750 million human beings and its area of 9,600,000 square kilometers, its economic, scientific and technical development, its diplomatic relations with countries in all the continents of the world, is a giant that must have its bit to say in the settlement of the world's problems if we wish this settlement to be permanent. No one is ignorant of the fact that States that make up this Organization have different political and social regimes, for each people chooses at a given moment of its history the ideology and the regime that it considers appropriate. Why, then, exclude the People's Republic of China from this Organization-a country created by a glorious popular revolution? The peace and security of the world will be built with the full participation of the 750 million Chinese, or they will not be built at all.\n92.\tThus the Government of Rwanda is prepared to support without any reservation whatsoever any proposal which is designed in a positive way to allow the People's Republic of China to make its contribution within the framework of the United Nations to the building of the future of mankind. Furthermore, my country is convinced that the question of the representation of China is by no means a question of the admission of a new member State or of the exclusion of a Member State within the meaning of Article 18, paragraph 2, of the Charter, because the State of China is a Member of the Organization and a permanent member of the Security Council in conformity with Article 23 of the Charter.\n93.\tAs far as the 14 million people living on Taiwan are concerned, Rwanda believes that they, too, have a natural and legitimate right to be subject solely to a Government of their free choice.\n94.\tI cannot leave the Asian continent without referring to the problem of Korea. As the Assembly has decided [1939th meeting] to adjourn a debate on Korea to the twenty- seventh session, I will confine myself solely to stating that my Government hopes with all its heart to see this country recover its unity. It is encouraging most actively the efforts for a rapprochement that have been made at the humanitarian level by the Red Cross organizations of the two parties in order to settle the fate of prisoners. May this contact be the forerunner of others and may it open the path to a fruitful dialog between the two Koreas, for let us not forget that it is up to the Koreans themselves in the long run to solve their own problem, free from any foreign interference, military or otherwise.\n95.\tIf it is essential to put a halt to the suffering caused by the wars in Viet-Nam and the Middle East, to promote the reunification of Korea and to do justice to the People's Republic of China by opening to it the doors of this Organization, it is equally necessary to condemn that great shame of the twentieth century, namely colonialism and apartheid, which are rampant in southern Africa.\n96.\tThese two scourges have repeatedly been condemned by the General Assembly. Yet, the Republic of South Africa and Portugal, the immediate authors of this hideous drama, continue to flout the decisions of the Organization.\n97.\tThus, Portugal continues to deny to the populations of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) their right to self-determination and independence; what is worse, it is carrying on a heinous colonialist war in these Territories. Its sinister annexationist plans even cause it to become involved in acts of aggression against Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, The monstrous crimes of which Portugal is guilty every day in Africa should lead to unanimous condemnation by the international Organization and should induce the latter to render it impotent to cause harm by forcing Portugal, by all possible means, to cease deliberately shocking the universal conscience by its conduct which has already manifestly been condemned by history,\n98.\tIn South Africa, the philosophy of racial segregation involves the South African Government in acts of bloody repression against the populations of African origin, acts designed progressively to exterminate them. Some sources advocate dialog with the racist regime of Pretoria. Of course, it is better to discuss, to negotiate, in a word to conduct a dialog, than to fight. However, a dialog presupposes the existence of at least two parties; but the authorities of Pretoria clearly do not want such a dialog, because by the principle of their racial segregation they definitely exclude their true partners in dialog, namely, the African populations of the territory who are directly concerned by the subject of such a dialog. The Government of South Africa should first agree to discuss with the Africans of that country in order to find ways and means of constructing a State that will fully guarantee the rights of the majority before seeking to lay traps for the independent African States, traps designed to sway their opinion on South Africa's policy of oppression.\n99.\tIn Namibia the situation is equally alarming. Although this Territory is directly under the jurisdiction of the United Nations, the Government of South Africa, which has refused to withdraw from this Territory, thus defying the moral and political authority of the United Nations, continues to carry out its criminal policy of humiliation and oppression. South Africa should know that it is illegal to give orders without the right to 4o so and particularly when this is against all laws. The Government of that country should enter into immediate negotiations with the Secretary-General in order to find the best ways and means to effect, without delay, the transfer of power and sovereignty to the legitimate representatives of the people of Namibia.\n100.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, Ian Smith and his clique hold millions of Africans under their yoke under the complaisant eyes of the United Kingdom, which, in the opinion of my Government, remains fully and directly responsible for the situation prevailing in that African Territory.\n101.\tThe unholy alliance of Lisbon, Pretoria and Salisbury obviously constitutes a permanent danger to the peace and security of the African continent, because despite numerous appeals made by our Organization this alliance persists in its error by ignoring the Irreversible laws of history which show that any revolution of substance always triumphs in the end.\n102.\tMy Government is equally shocked to see that certain Western Powers are deliberately violating the decisions of our Organization by continuing to supply arms to South Africa and Portugal and by failing to observe the total embargo which was proclaimed agains; Rhodesia. Such conduct weakens the authority of the United Nations and also gives encouragement to manifestly immoral causes for whose defense these arms are intended.\n103.\tIt can be foreseen that, exacerbated by the .colonialist repression of Portugal and Ian Smith, and by the inhuman and unnatural policy of racial segregation, the African populations of South Africa, Namibia, Southern Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) will finally decide to meet violence with violence and will take it upon themselves to choose the true path of their freedom, the path of revolution, Chairman Mao Tse-tung has said:\n\\\"A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined,.so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous, A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.*'*\n104.\tAs an African Government, my Government is greatly preoccupied with the tragic situation thai exists in the southern part of our continent. As a member of the world community of nations, it is equally preoccupied with the danger that hangs over our heads because of the huge Stockpiles of arms of all types which States, especially the great Powers, continue to manufacture, devoting enormous sums to their manufacture. The larger and smaller nations must become acutely aware of this dangerous situation and work more decisively for the destruction of all these stockpiles that serve less for the defense of humanity, than for its impoverishment.\n105.\tIn truth, the imperative need for peace and security throughout the world, and for good relations between countries, also requires increased international economic cooperation, in order to achieve more genuine international social justice, because* believe me, gentlemen, hunger, illness and ignorance throughout the world are as dangerous to the happiness and the security of peoples as is the sound of the camion.\n106.\tHie gap which has continued to grow between the richer and poorer countries is such that the equal right of sail peoples of the world to flourish in full measure and to enjoy the benefits of civilization has become an empty slogan today. Through science and technology, which man himself has developed, man today has pierced the mystery of the depths of the oceans and has conquered outer space. The walk on the moon, this event a legend throughout the ages for all civilizations, has now become a reality. Why is mm suddenly paralyzed when it comes to beating all records in demolishing slums in which thousands and thousands of human beings are stagnating and in providing men with a decent way of life, in other words, by offering them a chance to survive as well as a reason for living?\n107.\tThe International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, adopted by Member States on 24 October 1970 [resolution 2626 (XXV)J, is a true holy writ whose precepts should be kept constantly in mind by the leaders of the world today. The following is stated in the preamble to that text:\n.. the level of living of countless of millions of people ... is still pitifully low. These people are often still undernourished, uneducated, unemployed and wanting in many other basic amenities of life. While a part of the world lives in great comfort and even affluence, much of the larger part suffers from abject poverty, and in fact the disparity is continuing to widen. This lamentable situation has contributed to the aggravation of world tension.\\\"\n108.\tWhile it is encouraging to note that there is a universal awakening to the existence of this unfortunate reality, it would be unfortunate if States, particularly those which possess more material wealth than they need, were to be content with expressions of pious wishes, without having sufficient political will to commit themselves fully to the course of international co-operation.\n109.\tClassical law, born of the traditional structures of Western Europe, has for long accustomed us to the idea of the coexistence of States which are fully independent one of the other and whose sovereignty is limited neither at home nor abroad. Such an approach, which reflects the liberal spirit with which the Western civilization was impregnated, is now a thing of the past. The twentieth century demands that States bow to the law of our time, which is the rule of co-operation and interdependence.\n110.\tThis cooperation, so necessary in all sectors, is even essential in the economic field, where the developing countries are, from many points of view, treated unjustly. International social justice requires that the raw materials exported by these countries receive a fair price in world markets. The continuous deterioration of the terms of trade is of particular concern to the developing countries. It has recently been aggravated by the lack of equilibrium created in the world monetary system as a result of unilateral decisions adopted by certain States, without any account being taken of the repercussions they would have on commercial relations between the developed countries and the developing countries. It is important that the world community should do everything possible to remedy the situation.\n111.\tFurthermore, rates of interest for capital loans on the world market should become less prohibitive in order to allow all developed and insufficiently developed countries to have access to such loans, and thus to break the vicious circle existing today, in which loans are made only to the wealthy.\n112. As we were saying, in the past man has broken through the most stubborn resistance offered by the ocean depths. This adventure has also enabled him to discover other heretofore undreamt -of riches to which, in my Government's opinion, all mankind should have equal access.\n113.\tI should .also like to refer in this connexion to a problem of the utmost interest to my country: that of land-locked States. While Rwanda' is very pleased that the United Nations has taken cognizance of the importance of this problem, yet it deplores the fact that in this matter certain States are at times adopting practices that run completely counter to the decisions of the United Nations, It is necessary that all countries be' invited to become parties to the Convention on Transit Trade of Land-locked States, sighed at New York on 8 July 1965, and should adhere to the convention as soon as possible. My country therefore launches a pressing appeal to all States to conform to the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations on this subject.\n114.\tThe consolidation of this world Organization, designed l guarantee the peace and security of all nations, the promotion of a peaceful spirit which will induce States to solve their problems through negotiation and dialog, renewed urgency in the struggle against colonialism in all its forms and against racial discrimination in southern Africa, renunciation of the armaments race and the re-channeling of financial resources thus released towards the tasks of civilization and peace, the creation of social well-being for all human beings without distinction as to race, sex, color or religion and the creation of conditions that enable all human beings fully to enjoy their fundamental rights-this is .the challenge that the world of today, our common heritage, as President Nixon put it so well, must meet.\n115.\tFor its part Rwanda considers it a point of honor to state that, as a loyal partner, it can always be counted on to make a generous contribution towards the forging of a better future for humanity.\n\n\n\n\n"
