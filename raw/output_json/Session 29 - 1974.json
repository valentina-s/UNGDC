        "file_text": "The delegation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic associates itself with the congratulations which have been addressed to the President of the twenty ninth session, Mr. Bouteflika, Foreign Minister of Algeria. We are sure he will conduct a well organized and effective session so that we can in due course take part in the adoption of important decisions to strengthen the cause of peace and cooperation on an equal footing among all States.\n43.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR has been following the general debate very closely. Now that it is drawing to a close, we can say with good reason that virtually all States highly appreciate the continuing process of international detente and ever increasing confirmation of the principle of peaceful coexistence between States with different social systems in the practice of international relations. The current year has brought new illustrations of the further strengthening of universal peace and international security and of the growth and cohesion of the forces of peace, socialism and progress and the deepening of their influence on the development of the international situation.\n44.\tDetente is ever more confidently gaining ground, because powerful forces are working in its favor first of all, world socialism, which is exerting a decisive influence over the course of world events, and also the forces of national liberation and social progress, together with all peace-loving forces and public opinion that are actively working for the defense of the cause of peace. It should also be pointed out that Western leaders who are realistic in their thinking cannot fail to take into account the changed balance of forces in the world, and they acknowledge more and more that there can exist no other ground for relationships between States with different social systems than the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n45.\tThe developing countries approve of the relaxation of tension as the main trend in the development of events in the international arena. It is well known that the atmosphere of the cold war was a suitable source of nourishment for antidemocratic trends in international relations and for the suppression by imperialism of the interests and rights of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The historic experience of those countries shows how important the fruitful and versatile activities of the socialist States are for them, those activities designed to put the relations between the opposing social systems on the road to peaceful coexistence and making detente irreversible. Detente creates the necessary prerequisites to the realization of the plans for building a new future.\n46.\tThe further improvement in the international climate is inseparably linked to the results of the third SovietAmerican summit meeting. The peoples of all countries without exception have every reason to experience satisfaction that the USSR and the United States have clearly confirmed their determination to continue the course envisaged by them in 1972 and 1973 and to do their best to diminish and ultimately to eliminate completely the risk of a military collision between the two countries which would be tantamount to a world nuclear war with catastrophic consequences for the whole of mankind. In addition to the treaties and agreements that have been concluded already, of which the agreement on the prevention of nuclear war is particularly important, the parties have agreed upon new practical measures with a view to limiting and curbing the arms race.\n47.\tThe fruitful development of bilateral relations between the States of the socialist community and France, the Federal Republic of Germany and other countries of the opposing social system and their joint quest for ways to settle important international problems have promoted the strengthening of international detente.\n48.\tWe stress with satisfaction the increasing role in international affairs of the nonaligned States and their anti-imperialist policy, their contribution to the struggle for detente, the struggle against war and aggression, the struggle for peace, national independence and social progress, their cooperation with the socialist States in the solution of important international problems. As experience has already shown, while deepening and expanding relations in a spirit of trust and solidarity, the socialist and developing States are able decisively to influence the development of the international situation in the interest of peace.\n49.\tSome very important and welcome changes have occurred in Europe. A number of bilateral treaties and multilateral agreements concluded between the socialist and capitalist countries in recent years constitute a foundation for the political life of the continent in our era.\n50.\tThe successful completion of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe at the highest level is to play an immense role in bringing about a sharp turn for the better in relations between the European States and the strengthening of peace throughout Europe. For the Conference to be successful, it is first of all necessary that the basic principles of peaceful development of the continent should be clearly proclaimed and strengthened by the united will of all its participants, and that no one should try to slow down its work by submitting proposals incompatible with the principles of equality and noninterference in the domestic affairs of other countries.\n51.\tSuccessful completion of the talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe on the basis of strict observance by all of the rule of undiminished security for each side would be a substantial contribution to the cause of political detente on the European continent and would supplement political detente by military detente.\n52.\tThe Byelorussian people ardently welcome efforts to strengthen European security. Thirty years ago, in July 1944, peace and freedom returned to Byelorussia. They were won at an unprecedently high cost, requiring unparalleled military feats and toil by the entire Soviet people. In the Byelorussian SSR alone, every fourth citizen perished; more than one half of the national wealth of the Republic was plundered or destroyed. While solemnly observing the thirtieth anniversary of the liberation of the Byelorussian SSR from the German Nazi invaders, the working people of the Republic welcomed with satisfaction the award to our capital, the city of Minsk, of the glorious title of \\\"Heroic City\\\". They rejoiced at the results achieved in the construction of a communist society. In 1973, industrial production increased fold compared to the prewar period. This year, farmers have reaped 27.5 metric centers of grain for every hectare of grain crops. Science and culture have flourished, and the standard of living of the population has risen significantly.\n53.\tWe cherish the memory of the soldiers, partisans and underground workers who sacrificed their lives to secure freedom and independence for the Soviet Union and to save world civilization from the brown shirt plague; we are engaged in peaceful creative work, and we most emphatically insist that Europe should never in future be the source of a new world war or military conflict. We want a Europe that will be a continent of lasting peace and equitable cooperation.\n54.\tThe Byelorussian SSR feels that detente should not be limited to one part of the globe. It should extend to all areas of the world. The idea of creating collective security in Asia put forward by the Soviet Union is finding increasing favor. The putting into effect of that proposal is being promoted by new positive trends on the continent. It goes without saying that much still has to be done in this direction. It is necessary, first of ail, that problems arising between States should be settled by peaceful means, due account being taken of the legitimate rights and interests of all nations.\n55.\tAdoption by the General Assembly without delay of a decision to withdraw all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations and cessation of interference in the domestic affairs of the Korean people would be an important contribution by the United Nations to the cause of relaxation of tension on the Asian continent.\n56.\tThere is no doubt that all I have said accords with the interests of those who truly want to strengthen peace and to work for peace. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States with different social systems for the solution of extremely important international questions is fully and entirely in accord with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and supplements its activities in implementing its main task: the strengthening of peace and international security.\n57.\tAs was shown by the general debate, it is no mere coincidence that such a trend of development in interState relations finds the widest support.and approval. Therefore no one in the United Nations takes seriously the wild theory about the so-called conspiracy of the two superPowers put forward by the opponents of the cause of peace, detente and equitable cooperation. The statement of the representative of China [2252nd meeting], who since 1971 has repeated the same prefabricated cliches and utter inanities in the United Nations, reminds us of the situation of a blind man who has come up against a fence and cannot find his way round it.\n58.\tDetente does not come of its own accord. It is a complicated process requiring constant and single minded political struggle, active joint endeavors of the peace-loving States and broad support for that course of action by the popular masses of all countries. \\\"We are firmly convinced\\\", said Comrade Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, several days ago, \\\"that the struggle for the strengthening of peace and for the enhancing and development of detente must never cease\\\". It is the untiring and consistent struggle for the strengthening of international security which the Soviet Union, in cooperation with other States of the socialist community, has been carrying out in implementing the program of peace put forward by the twenty fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and which has become the banner of all peace loving forces.\n59.\tIn fighting for detente and developing relations with the capitalist countries on the basis of peaceful coexistence, the States of the socialist community at the same time consistently and firmly support the struggle of peoples for freedom and consolidation of national independence, against the forces of imperialism, reaction and aggression. Scores of African, Asian and Latin American States are experiencing the beneficial effect of the solidarity and support of the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist community in their struggle to consolidate their national independence.\n60.\tThe need to strengthen further the joint actions of all peace-loving States is all the more evident in that the reactionary and aggressive forces have not laid down their arms. The tragedy of the people of the Republic of Cyprus is an illustration of this. Who can remain indifferent when the military circles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] have embarked upon the materialization of plans hatched long in advance and directed against the Republic of Cyprus as a nonaligned State? It is inadmissible that Cyprus, a State Member of the United Nations, should lose its independence and territorial integrity, whether through foreign military interference or through the behind the scenes machinations of NATO.\n61.\tLike other socialist States, the Byelorussian SSR has always been on the side of the people of Cyprus. Urgent and effective measures must be taken to safeguard the Republic of Cyprus from outside interference, to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory, to restore constitutional order in that country and to allow the Cypriots to decide their destiny by themselves. The Byelorussian SSR favors the realization of the proposal of the Soviet Union for the convening, within the framework of the United Nations, of an international conference to settle the problem of Cyprus. It is at such a conference that it will be possible to achieve an effective solution of the international aspects of this problem with the proper authoritative international guarantees. The Byelorussian SSR has resolutely advocated this fundamental position in the Security Council. The dispatch of a special mission of the Security Council to Cyprus would meet the policy of ensuring the existence of Cyprus as an independent, sovereign and territorially intact State.\n62.\tFor many years the self-sacrificing and heroic struggle against imperialist aggression by the peoples of IndoChina has benefited from constant and comprehensive assistance and support from the Soviet Union and other socialist.countries, and today we stand together with the peoples of Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia.\n63.\tThe cessation of imperialist aggression in IndoChina and the conclusion of the Paris agreement on Viet Nam have created prerequisites for the consolidation of the turn away from war to peace, for the normalization of the situation in the IndoChinese peninsula and in SouthEast Asia as a whole. At the same time, we cannot but denounce resolutely the provocative activities of the Saigon Administration which, relying on the support of foreign forces, has been trying by every means possible to frustrate a political settlement in IndoChina. The Byelorussian SSR considers that the real way to strengthen peace and to normalize the situation in South Viet Nam lies in the strict and consistent fulfillment of the Paris agreements, a full ceasefire, the release of all detained military and civilian persons, the granting of full democratic rights to the population of South Viet Nam, the speedy conduct of negotiations between the two South VietNamese parties on the formation of a national council for reconciliation and concord with a view to creating favorable conditions for the holding of universal, genuinely free and democratic elections. This is the real way to strengthen peace and to normalize the situation in South Viet Nam.\n64.\tThe Byelorussian SSR favors the granting of the status of observer to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam.\n65.\tMore favorable conditions have been created for the struggle against imperialist aggression and the elimination of the hotbed of war in the Middle East, thanks to the active joint endeavors of the socialist States and nonaligned countries. Agreement on troop disengagement in the areas of the Sinai peninsula and the Golan Heights has been reached. However, these are only the first steps towards a settlement of the problem of the Middle East. It is not possible to permit the situation to be dealt with only by half measures, which is exactly what Israel and its protectors would like to see. Such a situation would be fraught with the dangers of a new military outbreak. The main issues of a political settlement in the Middle East are to be considered and solved at the Geneva Peace Conference which should resume its work as soon as possible. As is known, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied Arab territories and the elimination of the consequences of the Israeli aggression constitute the basis for a political settlement in the Middle East.\n66.\tIt goes without saying that the political settlement in the Middle East should guarantee the security and rights of all States and peoples in the area, including the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, whose representatives must have a seat at the table of the Geneva negotiations as an independent party.\n67.\tThe Byelorussian SSR has supported the proposal of the Arab countries to consider the question of Palestine at the current' session of the General Assembly, and is a cosponsor of the draft resolution inviting the representatives of the PLO to participate in the discussion of this problem [AjL.736].\n68.\tToday we are faced with a paradoxical situation in which real preparations for war continue while international tension is tangibly becoming relaxed. This is not only because of inertia but also because powerful imperialist forces are still active in the world, forces which for various economic and political reasons continue to speed up the flywheel of the arms race. These forces are trying to whip up the race of missiles and nuclear armaments which are most dangerous for mankind, trying to utilize the greatest achievements of the human mind for the creation of new and ever newer types of weapons.\n69.\tThe socialist countries have always fought against such a dangerous development, and we have every reason to pride ourselves on the fact that it is on the initiative of those countries that most disarmament questions have been considered or are being considered in the United Nations. The socialist countries have achieved positive results which are known to all, due to their consistent and resolute position and because they have proceeded in cooperation with the young independent States. This is in accord with the interests of all States, including the large group of developing countries which, in the solution of economic and social problems which they are 'facing, urgently need the release of funds being swallowed up by the arms race and the switching of those funds to the development of their national economies. For those countries peace is a primary and necessary prerequisite to save them from the colonial heritage and to give them a weapon to fight against neocolonialism. How pathetic is the attitude of one country which, in words, tries to present itself here as a friend of the third world and at the same time, by its deeds, opposes the cessation of the arms race and opposes disarmament.\n70.\tThe Soviet Union has submitted an important new item, entitled \\\"Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human wellbeing and health\\\" [item 100], for the consideration of the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session. In the opinion of the Byelorussian SSR, the drafting and conclusion of an appropriate international convention is most timely and indeed farsighted. It is imperative today that measures should be taken to save humanity from the danger of the use of new means of waging war which tomorrow may widely proliferate and which will then be much more difficult to curb. The conclusion of such a convention would be not only a step forward in the limitation of the scope of the arms race but also an important means of protecting the human environment.\n71.\tWe should do all we can at this session to implement the resolution adopted at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly on the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and the utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)]. That decision, which links together the problems of disarmament and those of development, may promote the cause of the strengthening of universal peace and socioeconomic development, provided there is good will on the part of all the permanent members of the Security Council.\n72.\tThe Byelorussian SSR will press for the adoption at this, session of a decision making it possible to start directly on the preparation of recommendations on the practical questions related to the convening of the World Disarmament Conference. We are confident that through the combined efforts of peace-loving countries the opposition of the enemies of the convening of such a conference will be overcome.\n73.\tThe world community continues to face the task of bringing about the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons, the cessation by everyone, everywhere, of nuclear weapons testing, and the implementation of other measures towards complete and general disarmament.\n74.\tWe expect at this session of the General Assembly to consider anew and in a broad context the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], which should result in additional specific steps for the strict implementation of the main provisions of that Declaration. It is essential that the discussion of this question should promote the strengthening and further development of the results already achieved in the general normalization of the international situation.\n75.\tAs a member of the Security Council, the Byelorussian SSR favors the adoption by the Council of appropriate measures to make mandatory the solemn resolution of the General Assembly on the non use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]. Such a decision by the Security Council will have a longterm favorable influence on international relations. It is high time for those permanent members of the Security Council that have been opposing the adoption of such a decision to cease their obstructionism.\n76.\tThe General Assembly must make the best use of the favorable opportunities available for a fruitful discussion of the problems of disarmament and the strengthening of international security. That in turn will serve the cause of the further extension and deepening of the process of detente and the solution of the tasks of economic development.\n77.\tThe admission to the United Nations at this session of three States, Bangladesh, Grenada and GuineaBissau\u2014whose delegations we warmly welcome here is further proof of the continuing, powerful upsurge of the national liberation movement and of the emergence on the world arena on a broad scale of the independent developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n78.\tInternational support for those fighting for freedom, national independence, democracy and socialism has always been an integral part of the foreign policies of the socialist States. As members will recall, in 1960, on the initiative of the Soviet Union, the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], an event of historic importance. The results of the struggle of the people of GuineaBissau have convincingly shown that the liberation movement is invincible when the alliance between it and world socialism has become an objective reality. The colonialists, though armed to the teeth, were incapable of bringing the heroic people of Guinea Bissau to their knees.\n79.\tThe chauvinists, blinded by their greatPower aspirations to hegemony, ultimately proved to be incapable of preventing the people of Bangladesh, who had embarked on the road to freedom and independence, from seeing their country become a Member of the United Nations.\n80.\tThe circumstances of detente have made it possible for the developing countries to intensify their struggle to eliminate unequal economic relations between developed capitalist countries and developing countries. The Byelorussian SSR actively supports the attitude and demands of the developing countries. The Byelorussian SSR took that stand at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, at which the developing countries presented a fully justified historical bill to imperialism and colonialism for centuries of exploitation and appropriation of their wealth and demanded the cessation of the pernicious activities of transnational monopolies.\n81.\tAs was rightly pointed out by the Foreign Minister of Algeria at the sixth special session, the adoption of the anti imperialist decisions at that session was the result of natural alliances of the developing countries with the socialist States, alliances and here I would quote Mr. Bouteflika's words: \\\"which are profoundly motivated by the will of the international community to establish a new era based on justice, progress and peace\\\". [2230th meeting, para. 185],\n82.\tThe support given by the socialist countries to the former colonial and dependent peoples has received a new and deeper meaning during the period in which a number of developing countries have embarked on and are carrying out broad socioeconomic transformations. That support and that assistance are rendered as a matter of principle and are devoid of any consideration of short term gain or aspirations to one sided benefits. We resolutely support the African fighters against colonialism, racism and apartheid, all democrats struggling for the freedom of their peoples and against Fascist tyranny.\n83.\tWe consider that the United Nations should increase its efforts to bring about the cessation of repression of democrats, the release of all political prisoners in Chile and the cessation of the arbitrary rule and lawlessness of the Fascist junta, which has sold itself down the river to foreign capital. And no matter how often an agent of the Fascist military regime of Chile runs up to this rostrum to spread slander, abusing the right of reply, honest people whether in Chile or in other countries will not stop their struggle against the crimes of the bloody dictatorship in Chile; they will constantly render support to the patriots and democrats of Chile in their just struggle, which is inseparably linked with the peoples* aspiration to lasting peace on earth.\n84.\tDuring the general debate, a number of representatives have tried to criticize the Charter of the United Nations and have even called for its revision. The Charter has been subjected to attacks for a long time now. There have always been people and there evidently are such people around today who regard the Charter as an obstacle. On the other hand, a number of young independent States which sincerely seek the speedy implementation of the basic provisions of the Charter are inclined to yield to the temptation to revise it, to reorganize the United Nations, and so forth. We should like to draw their attention to the fact that it is precisely at the moment when the United Nations has begun to solve more effectively the tasks assigned to it in the'Charter, at the moment when the rote and influence of the nonaligned countries have grown immensely, that the rabid supporters of the revision of the Charter have become active.\n85.\tWe oppose any attempts to revise the Charter of the United Nations, for it fully reflects the existing balance of forces in the world and the presence of two social and political systems: socialism and capitalism; it ensures the vitality of the United Nations; it is in accordance with the interests of the maintenance and strengthening of peace. The whole history of the United Nations convincingly shows that it has been the strict observance of the Charter and the consistent implementation of the decisions of the Security Council and the positive recommendations of other United Nations bodies that have ensured the way to the success of the United Nations activities. Those who would strengthen the United Nations should vigorously and actively press for this, while unmasking and isolating those who try to undermine the Organization on the false pretext of perfecting its Charter.\n86.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR, like many other delegations that have spoken in the general debate, is convinced that in the discussion and solution of any questions in the United Nations problems related to the strengthening of peace and international security, disarmament, decolonization, the struggle against racism and apartheid, economic development, the working out and observance of the rules of international law it is always necessary to have unity and cohesion, a high degree of activity and consistency on the part of all the anti-imperialist forces, in the vanguard of which the States of the socialist community march on and cooperate on a fraternal basis with the nonaligned and developing countries.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate Mr. Bouteflika on the occasion of his election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His election to this high office is a tribute that is paid both to Africa and to the Arab world.\n2.\tI also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General on his excellent report on the work of the Organization [A/9601 and Add.I], in which he very rightly emphasizes the concern, which we share, at seeing the present economic troubles and tensions jeopardizing the progress made in the sphere of international political relations.\n3.\tAs the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France [2238th meeting] has done in his capacity as current President of the European Economic Community and on behalf of the nine States of which it is composed, I should like to welcome the admission to the United Nations, with the unanimous sponsorship of those nine States, of three gallant and peace- loving new countries. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau has just acceded to independence in complete accord and friendship with Portugal. I shall have the opportunity in the course of this address to refer once more to that event. As the result of a friendly negotiation with a Member State of the European Community, Grenada has joined us to add its voice , to those, each year more numerous and always heard with respect, of the Caribbean region. It was with deep emotion that I heard yesterday [2243rd meeting] the noble voice of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, raised in this forum. His presence here bears witness to the successful working out of a difficult problem. The spirit of moderation and conciliation shown in this matter by all the countries of the subcontinent a spirit that should set an example for all of us has been at the basis of this solution.\n4.\tI cannot fail to mention here the grave catastrophes that have repeatedly befallen Bangladesh and many other developing countries, the most recent being that of Honduras, so severely stricken last Friday. My Government has done its utmost to be of assistance on every occasion, both by using its own means and by joining with our partners in the European Community. I can give my assurance here to the Governments of Bangladesh and Honduras that now too we will, to the extent of our means, help them to overcome the present crisis.\n5.\tOwing to tragic circumstances, our general debate last year was dominated by the new outbreak of violence and human tragedy caused by the Middle East war. As in so many of our previous discussions, the political confrontation of the nations was once more by the force of circumstances at the very center of our anxieties. As a result, the disruptions of the world's economic organization did not appear to us as clearly as they do today.\n6.\tToday each State wonders what its future and its development will be and what degree of security its nationals will be entitled to expect. We must work out the answers to these questions jointly. Indeed, only international co-operation will make it possible to overcome the tensions that, otherwise, would be aroused by the confrontation of national egoisms and the excesses of a competition based solely on the concept of profit.\n7.\tWe must realize that the energy crisis has altered the basic factors of the economic situation. The cost of the increased price of oil products is in the order of $100,000 million a year; we are far from having seen all its after-effects. The States of the European Community should react to this state of affairs by increasing their solidarity, strengthening their union and lessening their dependence on imported oil. Working together with other countries faced with the same problems, they should create the conditions for co-operation with the oil-producing countries. It is in everyone's interest to find an equitable solution; the consequences of inflation and monetary instability threaten all States in varying degrees.\n8.\tWe cannot bring ourselves to believe that the oil-producing countries still hesitate to join in the dialog that is proposed to them. How can a confrontation be prevented if all the parties are not willing to make co-operation the focus of their concern? The countries of the European Community are already facing serious difficulties and must agree to make sacrifices in order to solve their own problems. This severely handicaps their ability to come to the assistance of those who are even more severely tried. In spite of that, we once more confirm our basic options, even without waiting for the States that have suddenly acceded to an extraordinary level of wealth to take their legitimate share in the task of bringing about international solidarity.\n9.\tIn this respect, my country attaches the greatest importance to the Conference of Ministers which met in Kingston, Jamaica, on 25 and 26 July last, attended by the representatives of 44 countries of Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific [ACP] and the European Community. The subject of the Conference was the search for a new type of relationship between industrialized and developing countries. That Conference made it possible to adopt a series of texts that will serve as guidelines for later work between the Community and the ACP countries.\n10.\tWe note in particular the positive results obtained by the establishment of a system of stabilization of the export revenues.from basic commodities exported by the ACP countries to the Community. What is being contemplated here is a system designed to mitigate the harmful effects of a decrease in prices or in the amounts of the major products exported. The practical implementation of the system will be negotiated between the ACP countries and the Community.\n11.\tThe Kingston Conference also recognized the crucial importance of industrial co-operation. The Community was in .agreement with the general guide-lines given in a memorandum submitted on the subject by the ACP States. As for the terms of trade, these will include, as an essential element, free access by the ACP countries to the Community market, the former not being bound to reciprocate. Also acknowledged, on the one hand, was the need to ensure the stability of these terms and, on the other hand, the lack of balance in the relationships between the developing countries and those of the Community. Finally, the Conference made remarkable progress as regards financial co-operation.\n12.\tMy Government is deeply gratified at the fact that there is a common determination that the work of the Conference should succeed. A vigorous political impetus has been given to the negotiations, which augurs well for their final outcome. But while we are particularly pleased to see more stable and better-balanced relations taking shape among the nine countries of the European Economic Community and their present or future associated partners of Africa, the Pacific and the Caribbean, we are deeply concerned about the fate of the countries most seriously affected by the crisis in international prices and, more particularly, by the increase in the price of oil. The General Assembly at its sixth special session entrusted the Secretary-General with the task of launching an emergency operation, for a limited period of 12 months, to provide relief to the countries most seriously affected by the economic crisis resulting* in particular, from the increase in the prices of energy products, designed to maintain unimpaired during that 12-month period the essential imports of the most seriously affected countries {resolution 3202 (S-VI), para. X 2].\n13.\tOn 1 May 1974 the spokesman for the European Community stated that the Community was ready to contribute substantially to that special effort, on condition that the other members of the international community did so also. That proposal was confirmed on 25 June by the then President of the Community Council, Minister Genscher of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n14.\tOn the basis of global resources of $3,000 million, the Community is ready to make a special contribution of $500 million, provided that the other industrialized countries contribute two sixths of the total amount and the oil-exporting countries half. It is also obvious that an agreement has to be reached on the methods of allocating 'the emergency assistance and the criteria to be used in choosing the beneficiary countries.\n15.\tOn the basis of the results of the Ministerial Meeting of Potential Contributors to the United Nations Emergency Operation, to be convened on 27 September, in New York, the Community will very shortly make known its views on how it will participate in the emergency operation. As far as we are concerned, we sincerely hope in particular that that meeting will clearly show the breakdown of the contributors' commitments and how much multilateral assistance they intend to provide. We should also like to have a clear definition and comparison of the conditions in which the contributions will be made and, more specifically, how generous they will be.\n16.\tOur main concern is that the oil-producing and industrialized countries should take action to come to the assistance of entire populations whose survival is at stake. But we are still faced by political problems.\n17.\tIt is only fair that Europe, which in the course of this century has so many times been the cause of senseless conflicts, should today set an example of stability. On the regional level, the progress of detente gives good grounds for hope that there will be true co-operation among the States of Europe. We have cast aside war and the threat of war; we hope that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will result in concrete achievements likely to draw States and peoples closer together; and we hope that negotiations on the balanced and mutual reduction of armaments will enable all our peoples to enjoy the same kind of security, while lessening the oppressive burden of expenditures on armaments.\n18.\tThe Europe of the nine has a major contribution to make; Belgium is quite aware of that and for that very reason is looking forward to progress being made towards community integration; for, failing this, Europe will not be able to assume the responsibilities incumbent on it. More progress will have to be made before the end of this year. In many folds the nine European States already speak with r r? m- mon voice: they are getting ready, for instance, to initiate a dialogue with 20 members of the League of Arab States, and they have taken a stand on many of the problems that are on the agenda of this Assembly. I am therefore very pleased that the European Community, as a distinct entity, will soon receive the status of observer.\n19.\tBelgium takes a stand on the problems with which we are faced after consulting with its European partners, for we can no longer dissociate our national identity from the European identity. In this context 1 would recall the Cyprus crisis, the Middle East conflict and the problems of decolonization.\n20.\tThe European position on Cyprus is well known. It is based on the territorial independence and integrity of the Republic. Two urgent problems, however, require our vigilant attention: the serious situation of the refugees, and the financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus.\n21.\tMy Government will continue, and is considering a substantial increase in, its payments for the maintenance of the. Force, to which I am pleased to pay a tribute for the services it has rendered in difficult circumstances. I also wish to pay a tribute to the memory of those who have given their lives so that peace may reign in that part of the world.\n22.\tOn the humanitarian level, we respond to the calls of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and we will very shortly make larger contributions to assist the Cypriot people.\n23.\tAs to the Middle East, the negotiations have fortunately started again. The successive initiatives of United States Secretary of State Kissinger have already resulted in military disengagements which are the first step towards an easing of tension. I have no doubt that other steps in the same direction will follow shortly, and I hope they will bring about the conditions necessary to achieve a peace agreement based on the cessation of the occupation of territory, respect for the territorial sovereignty and integrity of each State and recognition of the legitimate rights of, the Palestinian people. The Belgian contribution to this peace undertaking is made on the European level and, as has been said by my German colleague, Mr. Genscher, the opening of a European-Arab dialog could lay the foundations for the vast task of reconstruction and development of the south-east Mediterranean [2239th meeting, para. 72].\n24.\tLike all preceding speakers who have welcomed the admission to membership in this Organization of three new States among them Guinea-Bissau I share the hope that an irreversible step has been taken towards the disappearance of colonialism in Africa. In this respect I listened with attention to the statement made on 23 September by my colleague, Mr. Soares, on behalf of the \\\"new Portugal\\\", the birth of which, its present concerns and its ambitions for the future he movingly described for us.\n25.\tIndeed, the attainment of independence by Guinea-Bissau demonstrated, above all, the fact that its people had a legitimate desire to find dignity in national independence. But, as Mr. Soares recalled, \\\"None of this ... . would be possible if the changes caused by the military and popular movement of 25 April had not occurred in Portugal.\\\" [Ibid., para. 105.] Since its installation in Lisbon, the new regime has received the full support of the Belgian Government. It was the return to the free interplay of democratic rules that enabled Portugal and Guinea- Bissau as well to free themselves.\n26.\tAt the present Stage, Belgium hopes that the speedy, orderly and peaceful decolonization process exemplified in the recent developments in Portugal and Guinea-Bissau will be carried out in the\nother Portuguese Territories of Africa, as envisaged in Security Council resolution 322 (1972). That hope is now a firm conviction because we heard Mr. Soares say on 23 September that:\n. . the rapid and reliable decolonization of the Territories under Portuguese administration, to be carried out in accord with the legitimate representatives of the will of the respective peoples and leading necessarily to independence.1' [Ibid., para. 109. ]\n27.\tIn another connexion, it can be foreseen and hoped that the success of this methodical process of decolonization will come as a revelation to the rest of southern Africa and, in keeping with United Nations resolutions, will prompt Pretoria to put an end to the occupation of Namibia and encourage Salisbury to return to legality.\n28.\tThe success of African nationalism in the territories under Portuguese rule should be a serious warning to the regimes I have just mentioned. Especially in view of the results of the negotiations, both Pretoria and Salisbury could be led to reconsider their regimes from a more realistic point of view.\n29.\tIn this context, Belgium continues to be acutely concerned by the situation which prevails, particularly in Rhodesia and Namibia, where- there are no indications as yet of any improvement. In this connexion the policy of Belgium is perfectly clear. It consists in applying sanctions to Rhodesia, and as far as Namibia is concerned I would remind you that Belgium subscribed to the advisory opinion given by the International Court of Justice on 21 June 197 P and has taken a series of measures to implement the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on the Namibia question.\n30.\tWe have just made significant progress in the field of decolonization: the Belgian Government sincerely hopes that the field of human rights will also be made part of this dynamic action.\n31.\tWe adhere firmly to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Belgium has always considered the United Nations, since its inception, as the surest if not the only guarantor of human rights. We have always expected the United Nations to set out and secure the observance of these rights, and we have always tried to make an active contribution in this respect.\n32.\tThus it is that Belgium is the only country which, in the matter of human rights, entrusts to a supranational organization powers that are within its sovereignty. It has indeed accepted since 1951 that on its territory the eligibility of refugees shall be decided not by Belgian officials but by the representative in Belgium of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Further, my country allows such refugees to obtain Belgian nationality after a stay of only three years.\n33.\tFurthermore, Belgium is proud of having always been, since its independence, a haven for political refugees. Thus at the present time we grant refuge to nearly 30,000 political refugees while an average of 600 new refugees settle in our territory every year. \n34.\tI cannot fail to mention here the numerous stateless persons who come to us year after year seeking refuge and support. Often they are persons who have been deprived for too long of elementary * rights, and the international community has an obligation to them if it truly believes in the defense of human rights.\n35.\tFinally, I should like to say that recently public opinion, like the Belgian Government, has been deeply disturbed by various reports showing the increase throughout the world of cases of torture and ill-treatment inflicted on persons who are held in detention. Such disregard of the human person is not only an outrage to all mankind but a degradation. That is why the Belgian delegation will firmly support all initiatives this Assembly may take in denouncing and proscribing such practices, which belong to another age. In this matter, too, no voice could carry further than the voice of the United Nations. That voice must be heard.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the Assembly comes at a time when dramatic events are taking place in Africa and the question of peace and stability on our continent is weighing heavily on the minds of the international community. May I on behalf of the Government and people of Ghana, and on my own behalf, congratulate you heartily and express our confidence that under your able presidency the urgent business before the Assembly will be conducted with all seriousness and in earnest. The election of such an eminent African statesman as President of this body is a matter of great pride to us from Africa. It carries with it prestige and preeminence, and is a tribute not only to our continent, your country and the people of Algeria, but also to you personally.\n85.\tSir, my delegation cannot help recalling that it was in Algiers and with your active assistance as the Foreign Minister of your country that Portugal concluded, on 26 August of this year, its talks with Guinea- Bissau. Those talks, among other things, resulted in the long-overdue recognition by Portugal of the inalienable right of the people of Guinea-Bissau, and that of all others in its other dependent Territories, including Mozambique and Angola, to self-determination and independence. My delegation has no doubt whatsoever that you, Sir, will bring the same resourcefulness to the direction of the work of this session. We on our part assure you of our co-operation.\n86.\tMr. President, my delegation is also gratified to have worked under the guidance of your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Benites. His patience, tenacity of purpose and dedication steered us not only through the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly, but also through the crucial sixth special session. I wish to convey to him through you, Sir, my delegation's unqualified appreciation.\n87.\tTo the Secretary-General, through whose purposefulness and dedication the affairs of the Organization have been so well managed despite unexpected and serious difficulties at times, we express our deep appreciation and sincere thanks. My delegation gladly accepts his repent to this session [AI9601 and Add.I], and remains confident that the qualities for which he has become so well known will continue to be applied for the benefit of the international community.\n88.\tMy delegation wishes to take this opportunity to welcome Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada to membership in this body. We are happy that one year after its independence Guinea-Bissau has been accepted as a member of both the Organization of African Unity and a Member of the United Nations, to mention only two organizations. We have no doubt that the participation of the new Members in our deliberations will contribute to the eventual attainment of the international justice and peace for which we all continue to strive.\n89.\tMr. President, in welcoming Guinea-Bissau to the Assembly when you are in the presidential chair, I am reminded in particular of the striking similarities between the triumphant struggle of the Algerian people and-that of the people of Guinea-Bissau. Both countries faced the implacable and ruthless action of colonial Powers. Both waged a long struggle of national liberation against colonial Powers desperately determined to pursue the untenable constitutional myth whereby African colonial territories were considered extensions of European metropolitan Powers. In both cases, while the Organization grappled with the problem of bringing the colonial Powers concerned to see reason, the iron determination of the peoples of the territories triumphed over the arms of the oppressors. In both Algeria and Guinea-Bissau, the two colonial Powers out of desperation sought to intimidate and terrorize sympathetic neighboring territories. Thus Algeria's neighbours\u2014Morocco, Tunisia and the Arab Republic of Egypt -can to this day show the world the scars of their wounds. Guinea- Bissau's neighbours\u2014Guinea and Senegal - suffered the ravages of external invasion and threats to their territorial integrity.\n90.\tThe heroic struggles of the peoples of Algeria and Guinea-Bissau have demonstrated to the whole world that colonialism is permanent aggression and a threat to international peace and security. Consequently, the struggles of both Algeria and Guinea-Bissau were given collective support by the United Nations. The independence of Algeria and Guinea-Bissau was recognized by the world Organization even before the formal ceremonial procedure of admission was effected. In their final hour of triumph, not only did the brave peoples of Algeria and Guinea-Bissau liberate their peoples but, by the irony of history, their struggles profoundly affected the internal politics of the metropolitan countries themselves, which led to popular, political, economic and social changes.\n91.\tAllow me to salute the gallant and heroic people of Guinea-Bissau. The Government and people of Ghana would like to pay tribute to both the people of Guinea-Bissau and the intellectual depth that has marked the philosophical and revolutionary horizons held out to the people by the vanguard party, Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC], at every stage of the long struggle.\n92.\tWe pay a solemn tribute to the revered memory of our brother Amilcar Cabral, who laid down his life for the noble cause of his country's liberation. On this occasion we are reminded of his wise reflections on the intellectual arrogance of imperialists on the destiny of oppressed Africa:\n\\\"There is a preconception, held by many people, even on the Left, that imperialism made us enter\nhistory at the moment when it began its adventure in our countries. This preconception must be denounced. We consider that, when imperialism arrived in Guinea, it made us leave history our history.\\\"\n93.\tIt is the history of the people of Guinea-Bissau, interrupted by 500 years of imperialism, that is now resuming its natural course before our very eyes. In celebrating the formal admission of the people of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations, we are celebrating the victory of the whole human race, the victory of the progressive forces of the world. Imperialism has done its worst to splinter our common humanity into fragments by creating hatred between peoples and by setting race against race. But the human spirit has always resisted and reasserted its wholeness. In this, it has not lacked dedicated agents, among which, we submit, the victorious people of Guinea-Bissau ranks among the high and honored in the revolutionary world.\n94.\tConsidering what havoc imperialism has wrought in terms of human and material resources, it is an achievement of no mean proportions and significance that the African peoples have yet managed to preserve their sense of dignity and to move forward in search of political, economic, social and cultural advancement. Suppressed, persecuted and betrayed even by those sections of the world community from which it could rightly expect support, African life has survived, seeking refuge in villages and forests and in the indomitable spirit of generations of victims of colonialist and racist oppression.\n95.\tThe people of Guinea-Bissau have a homespun saying: \\\"A crouching man cannot support anyone on his knees.\\\" In spite of all well-meaning assurances of future aid, Portugal cannot be expected to bear the entire brunt of making restitution for the years of economic misuse of the resources of Guinea-Bissau. We appeal to all Member States to offer genuine assistance. We feel bound, however, to qualify our appeal and to warn especially the once powerful allies of Portugal that if they join in making reparations to that small, newly independent State they must do so without any subtle attempts to substitute neo-colonialist arrangements for the crumbling colonial structure. We ourselves would have preferred all aid to be channeled, if possible, through the United Nations. That, at least, the people of Guinea-Bissau deserve of the United Nations. Let me restate here also that the time has come for those Powers to stop their unbridled interference in the affairs of the small nations, interference that has often created tragic situations for our peoples.\n96.\tI have dwelt at length on the independence of Guinea-Bissau because of its profound significance for peace and development in Africa. The aspirations of Africans are towards peace and development, and freedom in dignity is an essential ingredient of those aspirations. But so long as the framework of peace continues to be based on imperialist and racist interests in Africa, so long will our oppressed peoples continue to fight for their inalienable right to freedom and human dignity. The victory of Guinea-Bissau testifies - as, very soon, will the victories of Mozambique and Angola- to the indomitability of the human spirit, which, when aroused in indignation against injustices, oppression and all forms of indignity, can withstand and overcome ruthless forces of oppression.\n97.\tJust as today we welcome Guinea-Bissau, so shall we tomorrow welcome into the Assembly the new States of Mozambique, Angola, Sao Tome and Principe, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Azania. Time is on the side of the African majorities in southern Africa. Any conspiracy by the racist and reactionary white settlers in southern Africa to prevent the emergence of independent African States would not only be short-sighted but also would create a dangerous situation in southern Africa. Mother Africa can no longer remain heedless to the anguished cries of her sons and daughters still in bondage and servitude.\n98.\tIt was our own Kwame Nkrumah who warned from this very rostrum some 14 years ago: \\\"Africa wants her freedom; Africa must be free. It is a simple call, but it is also a signal, a red light of warning to those who would tend to ignore it.\\\"\n99.\tThe racist minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa are frightened by recent developments in the Territories under Portuguese domination. They are increasing their defense budgets and imposing special surcharges on their citizens in order to maintain the status quo in southern Africa. They are recruiting and regrouping mercenaries in order to cause confusion and upheaval in Mozambique and Angola. It must be made clear to those racist minority regimes in southern Africa that the only honorable way out of their present predicament is to come to terms with the revolutionary events crowding in on them while there is still time.\n100.\tThe Government and people of Ghana would like to place on record their satisfaction at the determination of the Government of Portugal to fulfill its promises of full independence for the peoples in the TerritorLi under its colonial control and express the hope that the progressive and enlightened influences in present-day Portugal will continue to respond positively to the urgent demand for freedom and in-dependence in its remaining Territories in Africa. It is our belief that, if the Government of Portugal keeps its pledge to the world and shoulders full translatability for the complete transfer of power to tnc accredited and proven leaders of the people in these Territories, Portugal can look forward to a new era of friendly relations and co-operation with independent Africa.\n101.\tNo group of States relies more on conciliation, dialog and communication in the search for a peaceful and just world than do the Members from the developing world. No one believes more in the effect of peaceful negotiations than we do. An honest reading of the positions that we have been advocating would expose the weak moral grounding of the allies of the racist regimes of southern Africa.\n102.\tOur words and actions stand in sharp contrast to the world-publicized ambivalence of South Africa's Western allies. This is no time for recriminations, but we fail to see any consistency between their declared support for the principles of the Charter that concern human rights and their continued support of these racist regimes. Their objections to sanctions and their rejection of enforcement measures designed to weaken the resolution of the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia to pursue their iniquitous policies only help to shore up the flagging morale of those regimes. It is not enough to express horror at the evil policies of those racist minority regimes. If mere pious words or declarations constituted the ultimate remedy for these evils, I am sure that we would not need the help of South Africa's Western allies. In the face of the present situation in southern Africa, we invite the trading partners of South Africa and Rhodesia to join us in exploring the avenues for rapid solutions to the questions of southern Africa, Namibia and Rhodesia.\n103.\tMy delegation has given consideration to South Africa's recent effort to save its face. I refer to document A/9775 of 26 September of this year.3 This document brings to our attention a statement issued by the Executive of the National Party of South West Africa. In the view of my delegation, the statement constitutes one more insult which the Organization has had to tolerate from South Africa. It is the hope of my delegation that the Organization will tell South Africa in no uncertain terms that the ultimate responsibility for the future of South West Africa lies with the United Nations. What is at issue here is South Africa's continued defiance of this Organization and its flouting of the decision of the International Court of Justice on the status of that Territory. What we would like to hear from South Africa is when that country will abandon this defiance.\n104.\t'\tIn defining the basis of Ghana's foreign policy recently, our head of State and Chairman of the National Redemption Council, Colonel I. K. Acheampong, said:\n\\\"We are not racists. Indeed we are opposed to racism in all its forms and manifestations. Thus we believe it is possible and desirable for various races and ethnic groups to live in equality and brotherhood in an African context, once all accept a common loyalty and devotion to the nation and its institutions. We have proved by many examples that it is possible to coexist with erstwhile colonialists when this takes place in an atmosphere of equality, freedom and tolerance.\\\"\nIt is this fundamental belief of Ghana, and our demonstrated commitment to it, which makes it possible for us to appeal here to the Western Powers to join us in the common purpose of helping to create speedily in southern Africa a society based on true freedom, equality and justice.\n105.\tWhile we are preoccupied with events in Africa, we are not unmindful of equally serious threats to peace that exist elsewhere. The Middle East, and more recently Cyprus, continue to pose a problem for the Organization. The Government and people of Ghana continue to view the situations with grave concern, not only because of the potential they have for causing a resumption of serious conflict, but more for the terrible consequences of those hostilities on the lives of the peoples of those areas.\n106.\tGhana is committed to assisting the efforts of the United Nations at securing peace in the Middle East. To this end, we have contributed troops to the United Nations Emergency Force serving in the area in the hope that, with the combined efforts of the countries which have done likewise, and with the guidance of the Security Council, we shall succeed in generating a willingness on the part of all the States concerned to come to terms with each other, respect each other's rights and eventually live in peace and harmony. Our troops will continue to be available to the Organization for so long as their presence is deemed necessary.\n107.\tIf there is any lesson to be drawn from the spiral of violence in the Middle East, it is that the claims of the parties to the conflict touch the very life and spirit of their peoples. Thus, my delegation believes that no lasting solution can be found without addressing ourselves seriously to the Palestinian question. It is evident also that there can be no easing of tension until the initial step is taken to discourage the acquisition of the territories of others by conquest. Historical claims to territory are the central issue in the question and the roads to peaceful negotiation will be blocked if there is any further alienation of territory from any of the parties to the conflict.\n108.\tTrue, there can be no lasting peace until all States in the area are assured of secure, recognized and guaranteed frontiers in an overall negotiated settlement. But, since peace begins in the minds of men, there can be no negotiation to determine secure and guaranteed borders until the parties can feel psychologically disposed to this. Therefore, we do not advocate negotiation based on pre-conditions. That is a denial of the very essence of negotiation/But it is clearly an illusion to believe that much can be achieved in this Middle East impasse by a reliance on the well- known proposition \\\"negotiation from a position of strength\\\". The foundations of peace in the Middle East have to be carefully laid on the basis of mutual tolerance and by avoiding the past mistake of resorting to a trial of military strength and technical superiority.\n109.\tSome of the tragic elements of the Middle East crisis appear to recur in the worsening situation in nearby Cyprus. We have from the very beginning advocated respect for the sovereign independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus. We have never seen any virtue in claims for annexation of the island by any Power. The integrity of Cyprus cannot be predicated on the uncertain and short-term advantage which some believe may accrue to one or other of the two communities in the island.\n110.\tMy delegation cannot subscribe to a permanent occupation of Cyprus by foreign troops of any origin; we cannot support any doctrine or policy aimed at uniting the island with any other State on purely ethnic grounds. It is our conviction that the solution to the Cyprus problem consists in creating a secure existence for all communities on the island. It is equally important to insulate the State of Cyprus from super-Power pursuit of strategic interests in the eastern Mediterranean.\n111.\tIt was barely a month ago that the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea came to an end in Caracas. That Conference was the third substantive attempt by the international community in the course of this decade to evolve an equitable, orderly and peaceful system for the utilization of the benefits which the oceans and- their floor have bestowed on mankind.\n112.\tSince the Caracas Conference, there have been comments from some quarters which indicate some disappointment, even disillusion, at the results achieved. The Ghana Government does not share these assessments. In our view, the Conference achieved what it could reasonably be expected to achieve.\n113.\tWhile saying thL, my delegation would be the first to recognize that the extent of progress we make at the next conference, scheduled to take place in Geneva in March and April next year, will depend upon our political will to negotiate at that session. Perhaps, out of frustration, which as I have already indicated is unjustified, hints have been dropped here and there that, unless an early agreement is reached on a convention on the sea, certain countries intend to start unilateral exploration of the sea-bed and exploitation of its resources. It is our hope that no country will resort to that course of action. We say this because we consider that course of action to be fraught with great danger to the harmony and peace of the world. Any such action, therefore, could not be considered responsible and in the interest of the world community as a whole.\n114.\tThe Caracas Conference followed closely on the heels of the sixth special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and a new economic order. That session taught all of us that it is only by conscious collective action that the problems of this planet can be resolved. Previous efforts at creating a fair and equitable international economic system, including UNCTAD, all foundered on the conflicting and seemingly irreconcilable interests of different groups of States.\n115.\tRecent events have shown and lent tremendous support to the conviction that it is only by creating a new economic and social order that we can hope to avoid the threatening catastrophe which is bound to be the fate of mankind if we persist in confrontation and the pursuit of selfish goals. The new economic and social order should reflect our global interdependence while eschewing the present inequities in international trade and world financial monetary systems.\n116.\tIf my delegation urges the international community to ensure adequate assistance to needy countries, we should not be understood to be preaching the perpetuation of the dependence of developing countries on alms from the developed or industrialized countries. What we are urging is the transfer of such technological \\\"know-how\\\" and other inputs as are most likely to conduce to the self-generating development of the receiving countries. By our request we seek to ensure that developing countries will ultimately become as self-sufficient and self-reliant as may be compatible with international interdependence.\nU7. Ghana, under the National Redemption Council, is today demonstrating its commitment to the idea of self-reliance which we have adopted as the cardinal principle of our charter of redemption. By its application in all our national endeavours we have achieved a measure of success in reorganizing our economy and improving our circumstances to the extent of reducing our dependence on external sources to feed ourselves. We are mobilizing our resources in a new spirit of self-confidence and our people are beginning to see the fruits of their efforts. Our expectation of a better life is therefore great. It is this great expectation that has made us so acutely conscious of the disastrous effects on Ghana's economy of the prevailing high and rising cost of oil.\n118.\tThe estimated increase in crude oil prices for Ghana for 1974 is 300 per cent over the 1973 prices, while in terms of foreign exchange expenditure the 1974 prices of crude oil and petroleum products account for about 63 per cent of our total foreign exchange expenditure. These are indeed staggering figures.\n119.\tThe over-all effect of the energy crisis on the Ghanaian economy is very wide-ranging not only because of the immediate strain it has placed on our foreign exchange disbursements but also because of the problems it poses, directly or indirectly, for the success of our policy of self-reliance. In this respect, an immediate victim wiH'Be the much-acclaimed \\\"Operation Feed Yourself' program.\n120.\tThere is little doubt that the picture I have painted applies generally to most if not all non-oil- producing developing countries. However, I do not want to be interpreted as indicting the oil-producing countries. I say this because it should be general knowledge that several factors are responsible for the present economic recession into which the world as a whole seems to be falling.\n121.\tWe cannot ignore the fact that in the past prices paid for raw materials as a whole have been very low, while those for manufactured goods have maintained constantly increasing levels. The action by the oil- producing countries is therefore seen by my delegation as a reaction to this situation and an attempt to introduce an overdue balance. The right approach to the problem, in our view, would be to give careful consideration to all elements which could be considered responsible for the present dislocation in the international economy. We believe that the present world economic crisis can be solved only by co-operative action by the international community as a whole. Recriminations and apportioning of blame cannot be the answer.\n122.\tMy delegation welcomes the agreements reached between the United States and the Soviet Union on further limitations on anti-missile defense systems and on the limitation of underground testing of nuclear weapons. We also appreciate the efforts being made for further limitation of strategic offensive weapons. We urge that these efforts be continued. In spite of this progress, my delegation does not believe that enough has been achieved in the area of nuclear disarmament to give us hope for the future of mankind.\n123.\tWhat to my delegation seems to be the greatest threat to peace and the human race is the arms race and the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons entered into force on 5 March 1970, but as yet not all countries have signed or acceded to it. My delegation has noted all the reasons which have been advanced by certain countries for not signing the Treaty. However, it is the belief of my delegation that so long as this situation persists, so long will these remain a real danger of other countries disregarding the Treaty and acquiring nuclear weapons of their own.\n124.\tIt has been stated, for instance, that some countries are now using the increase in oil prices as an excuse for developing nuclear technology as a means of generating alternative sources of power. It is common knowledge, however, that there is only a very thin line separating the peaceful uses of nuclear power from its destructive uses. My delegation recognizes the positive benefits which nuclear power can bestow on mankind. The nature of nuclear technology, however, seems to suggest that a system of international control of its use is necessary if mankind is to be able to enjoy its positive benefits without suffering the effects of its negative uses. My delegation thus continues to hope that the third session of the Preparatory Committee of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to be held in February 1975, will be able to advance the establishment of such controls.\n125.\tI have touched on some of the central issues which affect the precarious peace and unstable development in the world. I have done this from the perspective of a third-world State which believes that the rights and interests of the millions of people of Africa and the developing countries generally should more than ever compel the mature attention of the international community. If we have met again this year to review the basis of peace, let us not subordinate the interests of the third world to those of the big Powers and their allies. Let us constantly remind ourselves that our search for peace will be illusory if we remain blind to the issues facing the third world.\n126.\tTraumatic events during the past year in Africa, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the\nFar East point to the fact that we are at another historic turning-point. Whether or not the way ahead will lead to peace, justice and progress will, to some extent, depend on the positions each Member State takes on the urgent issues before us. Let us by our deliberations during this session, and actions to follow, demonstrate a determined will to pursue courses that will lead lo the ultimate fulfillment of the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and collectively tackle the problems of our time in the wider interests of the human race.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the Japanese delegation, I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. At the same time I wish to express my profound appreciation to Mr. Leopoldo Benites, the former President of the General Assembly. I wish to recall that Mr. Benites, with his broad perspective and objective judgment, superbly guided the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly, both of which were confronted with a number of difficult problems.\n74.\tOn this occasion I should like to extend my sincere congratulations and a warm welcome to the delegations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on their admission to the United Nations at the current session.\n75.\tAgainst the background of the steady consolidation of detente among the major Powers, the world's today searching for a new international order based tin a just relationship among all States. However, it is also a sobering fact that the world of today is still confronted with the task of bringing about peaceful settlements of local disputes and tensions which have not yet been eradicated. At the same time the world is, on the one hand, exposed to the dangers of frequent nuclear testing and the further proliferation of nuclear weapons and, on the other, it is facing the grave challenge of finding a solution for diverse international economic and social problems which can well affect the whole of mankind. In the present situation of the world, which is confronted with problems of historic gravity affecting both peace and prosperity, it is my firm belief that the only course left for individual members of the international community is to work within the broad framework of international co-operation in seeking to achieve their own prosperity and peace rather than blindly seeking benefits solely for themselves.\n76.\tThe successive efforts the major Powers have made during the past few years to seek understanding and co-operation rather than confrontation have resulted in the promotion of dialogs even among States with different political and economic systems. Despite that trend, however, some parts of the world have witnessed the emergence of fresh tensions and disputes and have continued to suffer from instability.\n77.\tWith regard to the Korean peninsula, I believe that we should reaffirm the aspiration of the people of Korea to the peaceful reunification of their country, as manifested in the consensus reached in the General Assembly last year, and that we should continue, as. in the past, to follow developments in the question of Korea, keeping in mind the fact that both the Republic of Korea and North Korea still entertain a common desire to bring about detente through their dialog and increased contacts.\n78.\tIn Cambodia, to our deep regret, fighting still continues, and no breakthrough towards a peaceful settlement is yet in sight. I earnestly hope that the unfortunate state of affairs in Cambodia will be brought to an end at the earliest possible date through talks between the parties concerned. For this purpose, all the parties concerned should indeed devote serious efforts to achieving a peaceful settlement of the Cambodian problem, and the United Nations, for its part, should spare no effort to achieve this goal. In accordance with this belief, I consider it encouraging that the Secretary-General made the following statement regarding peace in Cambodia in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization: \\\"I hope also that the time will come when the United Nations may be able to play a more active role . . .\\\" [ibid., p. 7].\n79.\tWith regard to Laos, the Government of Japan sincerely welcomed the establishment last April of a National Coalition Government for the reconciliation of the Laotian people, an event which may mark an important turning-point in the effort to establish a lasting peace in all of IndoChina.\n80.\tIn the Middle East, the trend towards peace has been gaining momentum since the fourth Middle East war, last October, and Japan, like other peace- loving countries of the world, entertains earnest hopes for the future progress of the Peace Conference in Geneva.\n81.\tThe problems which immediately confront the United Nations the situation in Indochina, the fourth Middle East war and the recent armed conflict in Cyprus seem to indicate that detente among the major Powers does not necessarily lead to immediate reductions in local tensions. In this regard I wish to commend the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations, which have played a significant role in the restoration and maintenance of peace, as well as in preventing the recurrence of fighting in the Middle East and Cyprus.- However, in view of the magnitude of the hopes entertained regarding the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations, the fact that all past operations were established on an ad hoc basis and that the United Nations had to improvise solutions to problems arising from their establishment and administration makes us apprehensive about whether the United Nations can take truly prompt and effective action in the event of similar emergencies in the future. Therefore I would express my sincere hope for the early establishment of guidelines for peace-keeping operations on the basis of lessons drawn from our past experiences. At the same time, I wish to assure the Assembly that the Government of Japan will continue, as in the past, to extend every possible assistance to peace-keeping operations.\n82.\tAnother area in which the United Nations is now expected to play an important role is in the solution of various problems with which the African countries are confronted, particularly in the attainment of self-determination and independence by the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and the abolition of racial discrimination. I firmly believe that the early solution of these problems will contribute immensely to the promotion of world peace. Accordingly, the Government of Japan welcomes the decision by the new Government formed in Portugal last April to recognize in principle the right to independence of the Territories under Portuguese administration Africa. I sincerely hope that it will not be long before these Non-Self-Governing Territories accede to independence by peaceful means and are admitted to the United Nations as peace-loving States. In the same spirit* I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on its attainment of independence and to the provisional Government of Mozambique, established on 20 September, on its achievement of an important step towards full independence. At the same time, the Government of Japan wishes to reaffirm its unchanging and basic position in opposition to South Africa's policy of racial discrimination and to South\nAfrica's continued occupation of Namibia, as well as to the white minority rule in Southern Rhodesia. The Government of Japan will continue, as in the past, to observe strictly the relevant United Nations resolutions, including those requiring economic sanctions against Southern Rhodesia, and will continue to provide the fullest possible co-operation with the peoples of Africa for the early achievement of their aspirations.\n83.\tAt this point I wish to invite the attention of the Assembly to the emergence of a situation which; as I said at the beginning of this statement, should be a source of serious concern for all countries, regardless of their size and geographical position, in view of the dangers it constitutes for the survival of all mankind.\n84.\tThe first of these dangers is that of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. On 18 May this year after a lapse of 10 years, another State conducted a nuclear explosion for the first time. Meanwhile the nuclear-weapon States, for their part, conducted intensive nuclear tests, both in the atmosphere and under ground, within a short span of time, in defiance of the opposition of world opinion to these tests.\n85.\tI cannot fail to express the grave concern of the Government of Japan over the possible consequences of the recent series of nuclear explosions which may well open the way to the further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world. To block such a dangerous trend towards nuclear proliferation is today undoubtedly a matter of the utmost urgency, and the concerted efforts of the international community are urgently required for the achievement of this goal. This is assuredly the well- considered view of the Government of Japan, which is now making the necessary preparations for the ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], in keeping with its fundamental policy of dedicating itself to the cause of peace and renouncing nuclear armaments. At the same time, I wish to state with renewed emphasis that, for the concerted efforts of the international community to become truly effective, it is indispensable that the nuclear-weapon States, which bear special responsibilities, make positive contributions in keeping with those responsibilities.\n86.\tAs has been pointed out repeatedly in the past, any effective and fasting measures for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons require the efforts of the nuclear-weapon States, in particular efforts to promote nuclear disarmament, starting with a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and also efforts to produce tangible results leading towards the realization of effective measures to strengthen the security of the non-nuclear-weapon States.\n87.\tIn the field of the peaceful uses of atomic energy, we fully recognize the need to promote inter-national co-operation. To lessen the risk of further nuclear proliferation, however, we should not only strengthen the existing regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons but also bring nuclear activities of States not parties to the Treaty under safeguards equal in stringency to those of the Treaty. Here again, one can hardly overemphasize the necessity for States which supply nuclear technology and materials, and above all the nuclear-weapon States which are the principal suppliers to maintain a cautious attitude and manifest a spirit of co-operation with the purposes of the Treaty.\n88.\tIn view of the special importance and great urgency of preventing nuclear proliferation in order to maintain peace and security in the world, it is our firm-belief that the United Nations the Security Council in particular should seriously address itself to this question and should play a central role in dealing with this issue. In accordance with this conviction, I venture to propose that the Security Council be requested by the General Assembly to study possible measures which might be adopted by the United Nations for securing the more effective prevention of nuclear proliferation, taking fully into account the outcome of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to be held in Geneva next May.\n89.\tI should like to observe, in connexion with my earlier reference to the special responsibilities incumbent upon the nuclear-weapon States, that the agreements reached between the United States and the Soviet Union early in July this year, and particularly the agreement pertaining to a partial underground nuclear test ban, do represent a valuable forward step towards the achievement of complete nuclear disarmament. However, I must state also that this agreement, although valuable, still falls far short of giving full satisfaction to the Government of Japan, and we hope that still further efforts will be made in this area by the States concerned.\n90.\tIt may be recalled that the Government of Japan submitted a draft convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament this year. In the same spirit, my Government welcomes the agreement reached between the United States and the Soviet Union last July under which they are considering a joint initiative on this matter. It is my sincere hope that the agreement thus reached between those two counties will produce a breakthrough to facilitate the solution of this problem.\n91.\tI should like now to turn to the second problem that is of concern to the world community in its aspirations to peace and prosperity. This is the problem of the present instability in the world economic and social situation, including the problem of natural re-sources. As our position was made clear at the sixth special session of the General Assembly regarding the resources problem itself [2211 th meeting], I should like to deal particularly with the role the United Nations should, in our view, play in the afU^'pt to solve such problems.\n92.\tThere exist innumerable problems in the various fields of the world economy, such as energy, natural resources, food, population, the sea and the sea-bed, and the environment, which vitally involve the very existence of mankind. Solutions should be sought for these problems with great urgency. I believe that most of them can be solved only through global, comprehensive and co-ordinated programs and, in this context, every country is looking increasingly to the role to be played by the United Nations, the most universal and comprehensive international organization.\n93.\tWe held the sixth special session of the General Assembly, on resources and development, last spring and the World Population Conference in Bucharest last August. In addition, the World Food Conference will take place in November. Those Conferences, together with the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was held to establish a new legal order for the sea, provide good examples of the roles now being played by the United Nations.\n94.\tIn order for the United Nations to respond effectively to these problems, it has become increasingly necessary to combine and co-ordinate all the efforts of the United Nations family and to make integrated plans for that co-ordination. However, because of the insufficient co-ordination among various United Nations bodies, the activities of the United Nations system as a whole show duplications. There is a tendency for the activities of the United Nations system in the economic and social fields to proliferate without limit, because of the lack of serious consideration in fixing priorities for projects and in setting up new funds and institutions. It is abundantly clear that the United Nations activities will not provide an active and efficient response to the requirements of the age if this situation remains unremedied.\n95.\tTherefore, for the purpose of discharging effectively its responsibilities in the economic and social fields, in response to the expectations of every country in the world, the United Nations assuredly must strengthen its capacity for comprehensively planning and co-ordinating economic and social activities in the United Nations system, with a view to utilizing efficiently our limited financial and human resources and concentrating these resources upon the activities that are most needed.\n96.\tIt is, in my view, the Economic and Social Council that should be the central forum for such planning and co-ordination. I should like to propose that the Council, taking into account the achievements of the World Population Conference, and the results that we expect from the World Food Conference to be held in Rome, should study concrete ways to co-ordinate programs carried out by bodies within the United Nations and outside, while at the same time formulating the vision of \\\"The Earth in the Twenty-first Century\\\" and \\\"The Future of Mankind\\\". I believe that, when such a study is made, the qualitative aspect, which takes into consideration the quality of life, should be fully considered, along with a quantitative approach to the problem of human existence, so that mankind, recognizing the interdependence of nations, can put into effect a rational distribution of the world's limited supply of food and other resources, permitting everyone to lead a life of dignity, worthy of human beings.\n97.\tAlthough Japan is far from being rich in natural resources, it is endowed with high standards of education and technological proficiency. We intend, by utilizing this endowment, to provide financial and technical co-operation for the development of the world economy. In pursuance of those efforts, and in response to the request made at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, my country is now providing the most seriously affected countries with assistance in the forms of commodity aid, debt relief, and aid on a grant basis, by adding at least $100 million to the level of assistance achieved during the past year, with a view to contributing to alleviating the difficulties that confront those countries as a result of the energy crisis. I am glad to add that we are now considering additional contributions, if necessary. The contribution to which I referred is being provided in spite of the serious effects of the present energy crisis on the economy of my country. I should like to take this opportunity to express our strong expectation that all other potential donors will make similar efforts.\n98.\tI believe it was made clear at the recent special session of the General Assembly that the traditional North-South concept, which has become accepted in the field of economic and social development, should be fundamentally reviewed. I say this because it is becoming obvious that the gap has widened between developing countries with natural resources and others with very limited such resources, and the necessity is being increasingly felt tKat all countries with the capability to assist, whether in the North or in the South, should strengthen their cooperation in helping to develop relatively less fortunate developing countries. This trend prompts a fundamental re-examination of the traditional concept of how aid should be given. In the provision of aid for development, it is essential to expand mutual co-operation from the. viewpoint of equity and solidarity, avoiding the creation of a particular group of countries enjoying prosperity while other groups suffer from severe difficulties. In my view, therefore, those countries which are endowed with capital and technology, as well as those with natural resources, have a duty, as members of the international community?* to co-operate in aiding the expansion and development of the world economy by utilizing their special assets. I firmly believe that the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, can acquire useful significance only by taking such an approach.\n99.\tIn view of the importance of all the subjects which I have mentioned, we cannot avoid confronting the problem of strengthening the United Nations. One of the problems we face is the fact that the United Nations is prevented from performing effectively and smoothly because of its accumulating budget deficit. I should like to take this opportunity to call once again on all Member States to take concrete action in order to find ways to solve this problem. Together with the strengthening of the financial basis of the Organization, it is also important to emphasize the reinforcement of the organizational framework of the United Nations. More than a quarter of a century has passed since the Charter was adopted, and there has been a great change in the international atmosphere in which the Organization finds itself. It would be desirable for us to face this change and prepare ourselves for future developments, bearing in mind that the United Nations should not become incapable of adjustment or lack the flexibility that the times require because of the gap between what was expected in the Charter and the changed circumstances. We have repeatedly stated that there is no change, of course, in Japan's support for the basic ideals of the United Nations and the principles of the Charter. But in view of the altered circumstances, we note that the question of Charter review has again been placed on the agenda of this session [item 95]. I should like to emphasize that our intention is to see the United Nations evolve, in fact as well as in theory, into the sole, comprehensive and universal international organization for world peace and prosperity, as the world enters into a new era. We should like to ask the understanding and the support of all Member States for Japan's hopes for this great Organization.\n100.\tIn this statement, I have made two proposals on the basis of my firm belief that the role to be played by the United Nations will become more and more important in the world of today, since the goal of a truly stable global peace is still distant, in spite of the basic trend towards detente.\n101.\tThe first proposal is that the General Assembly recommend that the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, study measures for securing the effective prevention of nuclear proliferation on the basis of the outcome of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The second proposal is that the Economic and Social Council, as the organ for the overall co-ordination of the economic and social problems of the world, be asked to formulate its vision of the future of mankind. Admittedly, the implementation of these two proposals is fraught with enormous problems, and it cannot be completed within a short period of time. Because of the importance and scope of the proposals, however, I am convinced that they deserve serious consideration by the United Nations which is dedicated to the promotion of peace and justice in the international community.\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, your unanimous election to the presidency of this Assembly is sure proof of the eminent personal qualities with which you have been so generously endowed and which have won for you today the esteem and confidence of this Assembly. That esteem, through you, goes to Algeria, your motherland, which throughout the sombre years of its history has fought with courage and determination to achieve its independence, and which today, under the noble guidance of its leader, Colonel Houari Boumediene, is the most successful example not only of the political, economic and cultural liberation of a nation, but also of a perceptive and tireless champion of universal social justice and of the full development of the third world.\n148.\tYour election pleases us all the more since it comes at a time when Africa, of which you are an illustrious son, is at a turning point in its total decolonization. We are convinced that your customary flexibility in negotiation, your dynamism and the clear thinking which has always characterized your approach to problems will enable our debates to reach realistic and practical solutions. My delegation would like to assure you that it pledges its full contribution to the success of this session of the General Assembly.\n149.\tI am also called on to repeat our expressions of appreciation to Mr. Benites of Ecuador, who during two sessions directed our work with wisdom, competence and devotion rarely equaled, especially in view of the exceptional circumstances of his presidency.\n150.\tThis is also a good opportunity for us to reiterate to the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the expression of the confidence of my Government because of his untiring and ceaseless efforts to render the Organization an effective instrument in the service of peace, social justice and security in the world. We publicly recognize the keen awareness with which the SecretaryGeneral has discharged his noble mission, to promote, at whatever cost, cooperation among the nations. Throughout his world travels his constant concern has been the endeavor to protect and defend understanding among men, peoples and nations.\n151.\tMore than ever in the past, this Assembly requires that we all become more keenly aware of our international responsibilities, in the interest of the fate of mankind as a whole. Since the twenty-eighth session many changes have taken place in the world. It has been clearly demonstrated to us that it is high time for the Organization to be given the adequate moral and material power, which is needed effectively to thwart the misdeeds of the ever present or latent forces of retrogression and reaction.\n152.\tMy delegation is pleased to welcome the new States Members of the Organization, Bangladesh, Grenada and GuineaBissau, which, through their admission, have enlarged the family of nations. Our particular welcome goes to the Republic of Guinea Bissau, which has achieved its independence at the cost of so many sacrifices. Our sister country knows very well what our sentiments were at the dawn of its hopes, and we express our best wishes as it takes its new path towards progress and full independence.\n153.\tIn Africa, the thaw in the situation in the Territories administered by Portugal is an event without precedent in the history of that country, which was the most unshakable bastion of colonialism. That development calls for adjustments on our part, and the international community, in order to carry out its mission properly, must channel that change towards a successful conclusion that is to say that on the one hand it should strike an appropriate balance between social justice and economic growth and on the other hand it should promote the maximum conditions for the exercise of equality and freedom for all men.\n154.\tThe efforts towards decolonization made by Portugal are appreciated by all of us. We know that the problem is to strike a balance between the imperatives of legal principles and the economic interests of the moment or of an era. That has often been the stumblingblock to the best of compromise formulas. Lisbon needed real courage to come to such a change of heart, but it is urgent to transform intentions into actions. Mozambique ar.d Angola await impatiently the glorious sun of real, authentic and unclouded independence.\n155.\tThe crises and tensions in certain corners of our planet, the deportations and separations of peoples and nations, have always been, and still are, a matter of great concern for my country, whether the problems concern Palestine, Korea, Viet Nam, Cambodia or Cyprus. My Government still believes that any attempt to settle the crisis in the Middle East must take full account of the legitimate aspiration and inalienable right of the Palestinian people to return to the country of which they have been robbed, and to decide their own fate.\n156.\tThe Government of Rwanda is following with great feeling the evolution of the situation in IndoChina. It hopes that the Paris agreements on Viet Nam will be fully implemented in order to improve the fate of the VietNamese people as a whole, We are pleased at the very substantial improvement of the situation in Laos and we follow with the closest attention, and with feelings of sympathy, the situation in Cambodia, a country torn apart by a long and harsh internal war. It is high time that an equitable and rapid solution be found, to bring that war to an end and allow the Cambodian people full opportunities of accomplishing the heavy task of national reconstruction and economic and social development.\n157.\tThe Korean problem is a cause of great concern. My delegation has never ceased to assert from this rostrum that the Organization must deal effectively with that problem. After the withdrawal of foreign troops from the entire territory of Korea, the peaceful reunification of the country, without foreign interference, is a matter for the Korean people alone.\nIt is for them, in the full exercise of their sovereignty and independence, to bring about democratically the reunification of the country and to ensure its future. That is why the Organization should beware of sanctioning any acceptance of a separation between the Korean peoples. Rather it should facilitate renewed contacts between North and South Korea with a view to reaching an equitable solution to this most important problem.\n158.\tFinally the drama of Cyprus still warns us of the fragility of peace on our planet. Aims of geopolitical and strategic supremacy in the Mediterranean and the Balkan peninsula have created a new hotbed of tension, which could lead to incalculable consequences if it is not dealt with in time. The solution of the problem of Cyprus will come only from concerted efforts, on a basis of sovereignty and free from all foreign interference, of the two communities inhabiting the island of Cyprus.\n159.\tAll sorts of foreign interference mark the four corners of the world, but IndoChina, more than any other region of the globe, has been a permanent source of conflicts and of insecurity. Today, as yesterday, the strengthening of peace and justice is one of the great aims of the United Nations. But everybody is aware that we live in a world of insecurity and injustice. This world which possesses this power of mass destruction; this world of local conflicts, sought and tolerated on behalf of power politics; this world where the most fundamental rights of men are daily flouted; this world of great masses, that have become aware of their destinies in the modern era, but have not become free from hunger and misery; this world, finally, where there is little security because many States have violated the principles solemnly proclaimed in declarations that reverberate around the walls of this house.\n160.\tThe sovereign equality of all States, the noninterference in the domestic affairs of other States, the respect for the commitments undertaken in good faith, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the renunciation of the use of force, freedom and self-determination as well as universal social justice are the principles that should guide an international community worthy of our times and of future generations.\n161.\tUnfortunately, reality does not reflect these principles. It is said that peace reigns among the great of this world, that there is detente; but there are devastating conflicts in various parts of the planet. IndoChina, the Middle East, Cyprus and southern Africa are still theaters of internal conflicts, sources of destruction and of misery. Since the last world war there have been 50 local wars, all of them disastrous. The world today is full of contradictions and a series of euphemisms. Thus, total and complete disarmament is no longer mentioned; rather we talk about mutual control of armaments. Peace have taken the name of detente among the great Powers. Hence there will be no \\\"war\\\" unless it is an atomic war and unless the superPowers are directly involved.\n162.\tThese are the facts that we cannot resign ourselves to. Far from finding an excuse for discouragement, the United Nations should redouble its efforts to become more effective. Universal morality advocates these efforts not only to thwart the nefarious forces of colonialism, racism and imperialism but also to silence weapons and to seek a new economic order which should transcend narrow egotisms and aim at universal social justice.\n163.\tPeace, a thinker has said, does not come by accident; it is created; it is built; it is a constant creation; it can be imagined only as a supreme duty rather than as the fruit of a well meaning order coming from outside. We are duty bound within our means and .our specific responsibility to work for the building of peace and international security. Our Organization cannot expect lasting peace as long as the arms race and the perfecting of increasingly deadly weapons and their introduction into hitherto peaceful regions proceed uncontrollably.\n164.\tThe international community cannot believe in peace when here and there in the world there are wars of attrition, struggles for influence, and millions of victims are claimed throughout the world. The international community will not know true peace as long as the unrepentant supporters of colonialism, apartheid and of zionism oppose with bad faith the appeals of this Organization to abide by its recommendations and resolutions.\n165.\tThe sixth special session forcefully proved that it is not only wars that violate peace but also social injustice. It is for this reason that we very clearly state that the international community will always be far removed from peace as long as three quarters of mankind possess only the right to live in poverty while a quarter of the inhabitants of the planet hold for themselves in their own consumer society 80 per cent of the wealth of the world.\n166.\tMay I take this opportunity to deal with the problem of the present international economic situation. My delegation as well as others have expressed the views of their Governments on the nature of the economic relations between the developed and the developing countries. I do not claim that I am bringing up a new subject, but I think that we should return to these matters more insistently than in the past since any objective observer of the present international situation must acknowledge the fact that there has been no tangible improvement On the contrary, there are signs of deterioration that constantly cause us concern and worry.\n167.\tIn almost all the developing countries, economic relations with the developed countries are characterized by a dependence that is far too close. The developing countries are forced to export raw materials and to import manufactured goods. But in this field, injustice and inequality could become the rule and could be systematized to the detriment of those who are weak.\n168.\tFor over a century the terms of trade have constantly deteriorated and still do so to the detriment of the poor countries. These countries cannot influence the market laws that are set by the wealthy countries without any consultations with the developing countries. Thus the prices of raw materials follow the inherent factors of the political, economic and financial situation of the industrialized countries.\n169.\tThe deficit in the balance of payments further aggravates the already precarious situation of our economies. The poor countries are deprived of a sizable amount of foreign currency upon which they were entitled to rely to cover the cost of imports they require in order to survive, such as capital goods and consumer items. The scarcity of these articles leads to a general increase in price since the local products inevitably follow the movement of inflation.\n170.\tWe must also not forget that the reduction of imports has also reduced the revenues of States since in our countries customs duties generally represent the greater part of government revenue. Since the prices received for exports have also followed a downward curve the State is forced to subsidize exports for obvious economic and political reasons. Often this can be done only by reducing or eliminating export dues, which, again, is a drain on the national treasury and a policy from which we at the moment cannot escape.\n171.\tThe situation that I have just outlined is serious enough to call on the international community to put an end to itFor, when all is said and done, proof has been given that in the long run the developed countries in turn may also suffer from an overall lack because of the breakdown in the harmony that should exist in international relations.\n172.\tIn order to force the wealthy countries to take into account the interests of three quarters of mankind, some countries have already taken drastic measures to control the development and marketing of their own resources on terms which they themselves fix. But this is a decision that must fall to the sovereignty of each State, and my delegation has repeatedly and unreservedly supported this fact. We stress that the States that can today act in this way are not too numerous. It is therefore, more than ever, indispensable that an international understanding be arrived at on terms of trade between the wealthy and the poor countries.\n173.\tMy delegation welcomes the conclusions and recommendations of the sixth special session, on raw materials and development. It was, in fact, encouraging for the international community to have recognized that it is urgent that everything possible be done to remedy the present situation by taking the necessary steps to improve the terms of trade for the developing countries by eliminating all maneuvers that might leave our countries in a deficit trade balance situation every year.\n174.\tBut to achieve these goals, the international community must insist that the developed countries eschew all action detrimental to the poor countries. It is, therefore, urgent to take drastic measures to abolish the trade barriers with the developing countries. That trade must be carried out at prices that take into account the interests of the exporting countries. The various techniques designed to manipulate the raw materials market in order to force a decrease in prices must be eliminated from international trade practices, which must remain fair, sound and mutually advantageous.\n175.\tAs I pointed out here at the sixth special session [2222nd meeting], for my country the question of world currency exchange is but one aspect of the much greater problem that covers the entire range of international relations, including the particular aspect of cooperation among nations. For years, the idea of international solidarity among the wealthy countries and the developing countries has been gaining ground. All the international conferences that have been held over the past decade have insisted, in vain, on the absolute necessity for the developed countries to lend their assistance to the economic and social development of the poor countries. Those appeals have fallen on deaf ears; and thus disturbing signs have been appearing more and more frequently in the gloom as the situation regarding assistance among nations deteriorates.\n176.\tIn fact, since the world energy crisis, bilateral aid has been diminishing. Multilateral aid, which generally draws its resources from investments made by the developed countries, will inevitably follow this trend if the attitude of those countries is not changed. This is why my delegation takes this opportunity to make a solemn appeal to the developed countries, urging them to maintain and to improve the volume and quantity of their aid to the developing countries. In this field, certain developing countries deserve particular attention, above all those which, as a result of the petroleum crisis, have lost considerable amounts in foreign exchange.\n177.\tHowever, the picture is not entirely gloomy. For the developing countries, it is encouraging to note that international cooperation relations have more and more been assuming new forms. In fact, besides those vertical relationships that have hitherto existed between the rich countries and those less favored, and principally between the former colonial Powers and their ex-colonies, we are witnessing the birth of a new horizontal international cooperation. I mean the cooperation that has been in existence for some years now among the developing countries themselves. These relations already exist in Africa, where efforts at regional integration are ready under way, with varying degrees of success. The friendly and fruitful relations that have been building for some time between the African States and the Arab States constitute a specific example of such solidarity among the developing countries. More often than not it is a question of the type of cooperation that can speedily prove to be mutually advantageous to the partners involved. Arab countries with capital available to them .can channel that capital into productive sectors and thus participate in the development of the African countries, while at the same time being assured of an adequate and reasonable return on their investments of capital.\n178.\tMy delegation is gratified at the progress achieved in this field. By their decision to create a development fund, the Arab countries that possess considerable financial means as a result of the petroleum prices have demonstrated to the world that the lofty proclamation of solidarity among the third world nations is not a mere exercise in rhetoric. The important actions they have taken in full exercise of their sovereignty deserve our admiration, for not only do they open up financial possibilities for the less favored countries but they also constitute a real change in international financial policy.\n179.\tHere likewise we have a profound transformation in the conception, on the part of the developing countries, of what they have to do in order to win the war against ignorance and want. In fact, for some years now our countries have realized that the development of the third world will take place first and foremost through the efforts of the parties concerned, and that foreign assistance will only complement our own efforts.\n180.\tThis realization on the part of the developing countries constitutes a guarantee to the wealthy countries that th; assistance the latter may grant will not be wasted, for the simple reason that it is regarded by the beneficiary countries as a necessary complement for continued economic, social and cultural development of their populations, who mu be the first to benefit from assistance to development. For it is to my delegation an obvious fact that man must be the focal point of concern in any economic policy or plan /or cooperation.\n181.\tSince I have raised the problem of the economic, social and cultural development of our peoples, I should also like to set forth briefly the point of view of my delegation concerning the question of population growth, which is still a very timely subject. This obviously involves a complex problem that concerns individuals as much as States and each country as well as the international community as a whole; and it is precisely because we are dealing here with a complex problem that the views expressed and the solutions proposed with regard to the question of population growth are far from receiving unanimous approval. Some utter cries of alarm; in a few years there will be too many human beings on the earth and there will not be enough to feed them. For others, more optimistic, the as yet unexploited potential of the earth will be sufficient, and the real problem is to mobilize all the manpower and all the technology, so that every human being, thanks to his own labor and assisted by international aid, will have every opportunity to lead a new and better life.\n182.\tMy delegation is of the view that, whatever the opposing positions may be, this question, in the last analysis, cannot be isolated from the general political context. The international community as a whole is involved. It is for this reason that my delegation was highly gratified at the initiative taken by the United Nations in convening the World Population Conference. We are very pleased that the third world succeeded in making itself heard there and was able to refute certain theories that all too often reflected only the selfishness of certain poorly disguised interests. For have we not, as a matter of fact, often heard it said that the developing countries should, at all cost, slow down the growth of their populations if they wish to develop? Certain theoreticians have gone even further than that and have subjected foreign assistance to the conditions of this twentieth century Malthusian policy. But in Bucharest the bell tolled with a different sound. The third world wanted to see birth control matched by a simultaneous limitation on the waste that goes on in the industrialized countries; in other words, they want to see a parallel reduction in both fecundity and inequality.\n183.\tMy delegation is not unaware of truth of the profound realities and difficult problems created by the population explosion. On the contrary, Rwanda is all the more aware of those problems in that we are confronted with them. In fact, though a small country, we must feed a population of an average density of more than 150 inhabitants per square kilometer. In certain regions our population density reaches 200 or 300 inhabitants per square kilometer. And may 1 add that the annual rate of natural increase stands at about 3 per cent, while at the same time our arable land is being exhausted day by day and our limited means do not permit us for the time being to modernize our agriculture and live stock raising so as to increase their yield.\n184.\tYet we believe that birth control, or, more generally, the slowing down of population growth cannot itself be set up as a valid policy. On the contrary, we are convinced that instead of being a goal, population policy must be considered as only one instrument among many used by a State to achieve its fundamental purposes, which must be primarily social and economic progress and the \\\"welfare of its inhabitants. For after all, the latest discoveries of the scientists demonstrate that the present total resources of our planet could feed more than 30,000 million human beings. For this reason we agree with those who say that the target in the field of population should be that of improving the standards and qualities of each individual's existence, bearing in mind, on the one hand, the diversity of conditions in the different parts of the world, and, on the other, the sovereign right of each country to determine its own population policies.\n185.\tMy delegation also feels that we should no longer try to impose a population policy that would be valid for the entire world. That is thinly disguised imperialism. We can agree to the United Nations coordinating national policies, but it must do so in absolute respect for the sovereignty of each State as also in respect for the right of each family to have the children it wants.\n186.\tAs the French Minister of Labor and Population, Mr. Michel Durafour, stated:\n\\\"A population policy must be integrated into the general development policy that is a prerequisite for the prosperity of mankind. In this perspective, the developed countries must give their technical and financial assistance to the underdeveloped countries that request it.\\\"\n187.\tThat statement coming from the representative of an industrialized country is highly encouraging. We hope that the other developed countries will adopt the same view and, above all, will implement it in the interest of the international community as a whole.\n188.\tMy delegation once again makes a solemn appeal to all the wealthy countries not to express international solidarity merely by declarations of good intent that are not followed up by concrete acts. We still see the insufficiency of official development assistance. That assistance not only falls short of the needs of the third world and of what the industrialized nations can afford but it is only half of the target set by the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. That target was to bring official development assistance up to 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries. But, unfortunately, we note today that official aid has not passed the 0.35 per cent of the gross national product of all those countries.\n189.\tIn speaking of this economic selfishness, we may recall another matter that is also of current interest, namely, the law of the sea. This is surely a field in which international understanding and cooperation should replace the traditional egotism of nations.\n190.\tIt is regrettable that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea that was just held at Caracas concluded without arriving at very positive results. On the contrary, the positions of the wealthy countries and those of the poor countries were so opposite that we might even say that the Conference was a failure.\n191.\tMy country considers it normal that a coastal State should claim the right to a much larger maritime economic zone than the area that is at present held to constitute territorial waters.\n192.\tAs regards the utilization of the sea, one principle has long prevailed, namely, the freedom of the high seas. To be sure, that principle corresponded with the colonial and naval interests of the great Powers. It was a satisfying basis for world order at a time when oceans were only used for navigation and fishing and in a manner that was relatively harmless for the marine environment. But that principle has already begun to be challenged. The development of technology has made possible a far greater and more intensive exploitation of the oceans. Thanks to modern technology, very possibly the resources of the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction can soon be exploited on an industrial and commercial scale.\n193.\tIt is to be feared that these resources will only profit a small number of countries that possess the advanced technical means required for large scale exploitation of this common wealth. In this field again, economic selfishness on the part of the developed countries may become widespread to the detriment of the countries of the third world, if we do not elaborate a new regime that will take into account the needs of mankind in general and of the developing countries in particular.\n194.\tA hard task awaits the codifiers of the new law of the sea, namely, to reconcile the particularly wide divergences of interest between States. In fact, the great Powers wish to maintain as wide a zone as possible, free from any restriction. On the other hand, the coastal States would like to monopolize the exploitation of the resources of the waters adjacent to their territories. It is therefore imperative that international law should succeed in taking account of the interests of both sides in order to ensure better worldwide cooperation.\n195.\tBut there is another category of countries that follows questions concerning the law of the sea with an interest that is all the greater since they do not have a natural access to the sea the landlocked countries. My delegation asserts that, in order to survive, the landlocked countries must have free access to the sea and freedom of transit across the coastal States. And within the framework of international cooperation, they should also be able to take advantage of the harbor facilities and related services of the coastal States.\n196.\tWe note that at present all countries seek to join or have already joined wide regional or international groups. Cooperation in this field therefore is possible. There are numerous examples all over the world to prove it. We all know how the landlocked countries of Europe have been able easily to gain access to the sea and thus develop their own maritime trade thanks to the understanding of their neighbors. All these examples prove that cooperation among the landlocked and coastal States is possible and that it can be consonant with respect for the interests of both sides. The new law of the sea will thus be founded on actual practice and will become a charter respected by everyone.\n197.\tIt is imperative for all countries, including the landlocked countries, to be able to benefit from the wealth contained in the oceans. An equitable distribution must be carried out in the interests of the international community as a whole in order to ensure a balanced development which is an absolute condition for lasting peace among nations.\n196. We trust that all these appeals will be heeded and thus by combining all their efforts men will cooperate from now on in the effective creation of a world of justice, progress, understanding and peace. A world where with the prospect of a new world order, all men of all continents and of all races will at long last be able to enjoy freedom, equality and dignity.\n"

        "file_text": "It is in no mere subservience to tradition that my first words in the general debate of the twenty-ninth session should be of gratitude to the President of the twenty-eighth session, our good friend Mr. Benites of Ecuador, and of congratulations and salutations to you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of the Assembly.\n42.\tTo Mr. Benites, of our own region of Latin America, we are twice indebted for the wisdom, the calm and the mature experience that guided us through the special session as skilfully and as safely as they had guaranteed our passage through the twenty-eighth session.\n43.\tAnd our congratulations to you, Mr. President, are enhanced by the special pride and satisfaction reserved for rejoicing in a kinsman's triumph; for have we not worked with you as comrades over many years in the councils of the non-aligned movement and in the several consultations which have brought us together in the causes of the Third World? It is reassuring that, in sealing your presidency with unanimous acclaim, the Assembly should have demonstrated the capacity and the resolve to be itself infused with that spirit of dynamism which today so pervades the environment of the international community, and of which you yourself, Sir, are so much a symbol.\n44.\tAnd as we welcome your election, so we rejoice in the admission to membership of the three new States\u2014Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau\u2014 for each of which the people of Guyana reserves a special sentiment: for Bangladesh, with which we watched through the travail of birth and with which we work in the fellowship of the Commonwealth for Grenada, with which we have shared 300 years of the unique West Indian experience -an experience of European wars of possession, of slavery, of indenture and the plantation system, of a protracted colonialism and the struggle for social, economic and political justice, of the steady growth of identity and of the structures of regional unity and with which, out of that varied past, we share now the expectation of a long future of working together in the fraternity of our Caribbean community as we seek, to build just, progressive and free societies; and for Guinea-Bissau, with whose yearnings for liberation we identified, though a continent away, and in whose success in the struggle we exulted as a beginning of the crumbling of the remnant ramparts of colonialism and oppression in Africa. Each in its different way, Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau, represents a further victory for the hallowed crusade of self-determination, a crusade whose foremost international champion has been the Organization itself.\n45.\tThe admission of Bangladesh draws attention in a particularly poignant way to the obligations of the world community for operations of relief and rescue in relation to natural calamities, particularly in developing States with little or no reserves for dealing with them. The disaster that struck our sister Latin American State of Honduras on the very eve of this Assembly only serves to reinforce these obligations. It is clear that there is still much more that we must do to equip the United Nations to discharge these burdens on behalf of the international community. The resources currently at the disposal of the Secretary-General are far too limited for effective immediate response?, and far too much must inevitably be left to the charity of friends and the mobilization of international anguish. This twenty-ninth session of the Assembly should take prompt action to enable the Organization better to discharge an obvious and a non-controversial responsibility and it must, meanwhile, lend its urgent voice to the appeals of the Secretary-General and of the States concerned for the provision of the immediate assistance so desperately needed.\n46.\tTogether, the admission of the three new States brings us closer to the goal of a United Nations that is representative of all of mankind. But we must not forget in our rejoicing those impediments to universality that persist. In particular, the admissions of Grenada and of Guinea-Bissau remind us of the victories for decolonization yet to be won in the Caribbean and in Africa.\n47.\tIn our own region, our brothers in Belize- a member State of our Caribbean community- are currently being denied independence not through the unwillingness of the colonial Power to withdraw or indeed through their own lack of enthusiasm for self-determination but, as this Assembly has already itself borne witness, because of the threat of total absorption which they face once the metropolitan Power is withdrawn the threat of a virtual smothering at birth. The time has surely come for the acceptance of those realities and rights of such settled communities and States that history itself has consecrated and for the abandonment of proprietary contentions that have their dubious origins in another age and are rooted in another colonialism. It is intolerable, and it is indeed alien to the noble traditions of Latin America, that, at this late hour, a people should find the exercise of their right to self-determination thwarted by expansionist ambition. This Organization must ensure that its mandate for decolonization is nowhere so frustrated.\n48.\tIn Africa, it is most heartening that the Government of Portugal now takes its stand with courage and without equivocation on the side of self-determination and human dignity; and that, even as the twenty-ninth session was commencing, significant practical advances towards independence were being made in Mozambique. Among those who spoke out in condemnation of past policies, let us likewise be uninhibited in applauding present trends and assuring Portugal of our support for all constructive programs in furtherance of them. And to that assurance we must imply more than passive appreciation. The free States of Mozambique and Angola, like the State of Guinea-Bissau, whose first anniversary of independence we celebrated last week, will require massive assistance from the international community if the triumph of self-determination is not to be overcast by the calamity of economic disaster. It is not too early to commit international resources on the scale that will be essential to the inevitable task of reconstruction. This twenty-ninth session should not pass without the necessary decisions being taken to that end.\n49.\tThe consummation of the struggle for liberation in Mozambique and Angola is, of course, both a vindication of the struggle itself and a renewal of confidence in the eventual victories that must be won by those other movements for liberation for whom victory may not be immediately at hand. But that confidence will only be justified if it does not degenerate into complacency. Self-determination in Mozambique and in Angola does not represent the end of the struggle for freedom in southern Africa. Namibia, Rhodesia, and South Africa itself will remain a charge upon the conscience and a claim upon the courage of free men everywhere.\n50.\tThe momentum generated at the international level in recent years by the movement for freedom in southern Africa has played an important, indeed a vital, role in the present prospects for victory. A loss of that momentum might even now impair those prospects; but, no less serious, a loss of momentum at this stage of partial victory would be an indefensible squandering of the tactical and psychological advantages that have been gained for the campaigns of liberation elsewhere. Mozambique and Angola will be free. Let their places be reserved at the thirtieth session. What we need now is to redouble the effort, to re-energize the struggle, to press home the advantages mindful always that the forces of racism and oppression will grow more desperate as they retreat behind their last defenses.\n51.\tLet us mark the promise which this session brings of major gains for freedom in southern Africa with a renewal of commitment not merely to a continuing but indeed to an escalating struggle in which the collective will of this Organization and of all its legitimate Members are brought to bear upon the final victories. And what better way to do so than for this Organization to act decisively as the Assembly has just done on the report of the Credentials Committee [2248th meeting] and, consistent with required procedure, to formally withdraw from South Africa those rights of membership which its gross, persistent and insufferable violations of the Charter forfeited long ago.\n52.\tAnd the case of Namibia represents a special challenge; for it is an international Territory in respect of which the Organization has assumed particular responsibilities. The positive actions just taken by the United Nations Council for Namibia whose current President it is Guyana's honor to provide in exercising its legislative power to secure the resources of Namibia in trust for the people of that Territory and in establishing in Zambia the Institute for Namibia are welcome assertions of the responsibility of the international community in advancing the struggle for freedom. The time is ripe for us, through the instrumentality of the Security Council, to take the further steps that may be necessary for ensuring that the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa is speedily and irrevocably terminated.\n53.\tNor can we forget, in passing, those divided States whose condition of division continues to contribute to their remaining outside the Organization. Let us, consistent with our commitment to universality, help to create conditions through which the peoples of all those lands may settle the internal issues of fragmentation without the interference, or even the inter-locution, of external forces in whatever garb they may be attired or from however far or near they may come.\n54.\tAnd as we try to create conditions that will assist in resolving those issues that keep the divided States outside the Organization, let us be alerted by the lessons of Cyprus to the threat to national independence and sovereignty of States already within the Organization. The people of Cyprus have suffered a tragedy of immense proportions. None of us, but particularly those of us who come from plural societies, can fail to be profoundly moved by the setback to national unity that has followed in the wake of the misguided adventurism that marked the beginning of these events.\n55.\tThere will be time hereafter to judge those events and those who contributed to their conception and their execution. What is needed now, above all else, is to help our brothers in Cyprus to bind up the wounds of their shattered society, to help them in their efforts to preserve the integrity of the State and to place at their disposal our collective good offices and the protection, and indeed the superintendence, of the United Nations itself in guaranteeing that integrity and the capacity of Cyprus to continue to play a constructive role in the affairs of the world community. To that process of recuperation many States may be able to make a modest contribution, and the opportunity that now exists to broaden the base of the international effort particularly to broaden it beyond the confines of super and major Powers should not be lost.\n56.\tWhile that effort is being assembled, and whatever may be the eventual political and constitutional solutions, we cannot afford to ignore the humanitarian problem which cries out urgently for solution and which, if unrelieved, will make the task of finding solutions immensely more intractable. The dislocation of a large proportion of the population of Cyprus demands the immediate attention of the international community. The fact that the numbers themselves are small compared with other human calamities of this kind with which the international community has been obliged to deal in the past should serve only to quicken the pace with which programs of relief are agreed upon and put into execution.\n57.\tThere is still a chance to save Cyprus from deteriorating into yet another embattled zone petrified in division by the patronage of major Powers. There are clearly men of good will on all sides ready to work tirelessly to avoid so dismal a prognosis. In the days and weeks ahead let the Assembly, let the Organization, let all Member States, help them to find those ways out of the present darkness.\n58.\tWe join the Secretary-General in paying homage to the members of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force who gave their lives in Cyprus. But the lessons we must draw from that tragedy, the acknowledgment we must make for their sacrifice, is that there is need for the international community to rethink its approaches to peace-keeping, to the scale of peacekeeping operations and to the difficult questions of authorization, of control, of command and of supply that need to be settled, and settled along lines compatible with current needs of international peace and contemporary concepts of international action.\n59.\tThe international community, like all communities at the national level, must sometimes learn hard lessons out of the experience of great tribulation. Perhaps out of the Cyprus experience the international community will learn some lessons about peace-keeping. Perhaps we shall be led at last to a perception of the Organization's true role in preventive peace-keeping -a functional role, consistent with national sovereignty, of maintaining international order and preserving the integrity of States more effectively than we ever can do through token forces assembled in the aftermath of conflict.\n60.\tThe important developments in peace-keeping in the wake of the recent crisis in the Middle East and the present unhappy experience in Cyprus should certainly provide justification for a major effort during this session to advance the issue of international peace-keeping as one of the major mandates of the Organization under the Charter. Strengthened by contemporary insights of the global unity of mankind and the concomitant interdependence of men, we should not permit past impediments to consensus on this issue to obscure our prospects of future accord and we should not, therefore, be deterred from pursuing it anew.\n61.\tBut while at this twenty-ninth session we deliberate the political issues of peace-keeping and disarmament, of decolonization and apartheid, of the crisis in the Middle East and the situation in IndoChina, it is the economic issues confronting the world community and impressing themselves upon the daily lives of people everywhere that will demand our most urgent attention and our most penetrating examination and debate.\n62.\tThat we should have reached the stage where all Member States acknowledge the priority character of these issues is itself a notable advance. There was\n285\na time, not so long ago, when, to the developed world of east and west, these Were the peripheral issues of the international dialog, relegated almost to the category of \\\"any other business\\\" on the international agenda. It can no longer be so. For these issues are now as critical to the prosperity of the developed world as they have always been to the survival of the developing.\n63.\tIt would have been encouraging had we reached this unanimity of concern from a position of principle responsive to the mandates of the Charter, but in truth we have not. Despite the inevitable failure of a succession of international palliatives to redress the economic imbalance between the rich and the poor countries of the world; despite the mounting frustration, the cynicism and, indeed, the resentment of the world's under-privileged; despite even the gradual emergence of a global consciousness, a planetary awareness of an interdependent world community despite all these, the developed countries, for the greater part, but with some important exceptions, refused to come to terms with the need for fundamental change. It required the catalytic compulsions of the energy issue to force recognition of the need for a new international economic order. Even so, it was with a sometimes reluctant developed world that we reached a halting consensus at the sixth special session on the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S'VI)] and of the Program of Action to implement it [resolution 3202 (S-VI)].\n64.\tWith the special session on raw materials and development behind us and the special session on development and international economic co-operation in 1975 ahead of us, it is essential that these pressing economic issues occupy a major part of our time at the twenty-ninth session. This general debate can serve an important purpose if, through frank exchanges, we can advance the dialog of change and close the gap that Obviously still exists between the expectation of the poor and the intent of the rich.\n65.\tTo close that gap we must reach agreement on the purposes of our endeavors, on, Our basic aims and objectives. In the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order we have agreed on the rhetoric of change. In the Program of Action we have identified together some of the mechanisms by which it might be initiated. But have we agreed upon the philosophy of change? Have we reached from our different starting-points an accord on the ideology of international economic reconstruction?\n66.\tIf the search for consensus at the sixth special session has meant no more to the developed world, or to major parts of it, than minor modifications of the international economic system to appease the claimant demand for change or, worse still, a process of minimal adjustment of positions within the existing system to meet the particular needs of what might appear to be a transient emergency and there is, let it be admitted, evidence enough that to several developed States that search for consensus meant only the one or the other if this is really so, then we are still far from that agreement on a common purpose which is the precondition of co-operative action. And for so long as that discord persists at the level of objectives neither the rhetoric of the Declaration nor the mechanisms of the Program of Action will contribute significantly to the resolution of those basic economic issues which will persist in demanding our attention. Without the energizing spark of mutual commitment, the former will be a lifeless parchment and the latter a withered blueprint, both destined for the international archive of lost causes.\n67.\tIf, however, we are to persevere in pursuit of mutuality; if we are to proceed by consensus, as we are almost threateningly urged to do -as indeed both principle and expediency enjoin the developing States to do- then let it at least be clear to all engaged in the dialog that that mutuality, that consensus, must relate primordially to the philosophy of change, must be founded in a joint response to the seminal questions. What kind of world is it which we must strive to change? What kind of better world is it to which we seek to move? If we are not agreed upon those essentials of change, consensus on the mechanisms of change is a meaningless concept and the search for it is bound to end in futility, in frustration and, inevitably, in confrontation. But if we can reach agreement upon these essentials, real and genuine agreement supported by the conviction that it is in the ultimate interest of all States to advance that transformation, then the Declaration adopted at the sixth special session will possess the quality of an organic instrument of our new world community and the Program of Action wiK be a living charter of progressive reform.\n68.\tI cannot and do not purport to speak for all the Third World; but I suspect that the view from Guyana's corner of the developing world is much like the view from many another Third World window. And I suspect that our vision of the world as we seek to move from it is much like the vision of the remaining two thirds of the world's people who yearn for change. Perhaps for this reason it is easy for me to adopt the description given of our contemporary scene by one of the distinguished economists of the Third World, Mr. Mahbub al Haq of Pakistan, speaking recently in commemoration of a great internationalist of the developed world who understood our view and shared our vision:\n\\\"He would have been greatly saddened\\\" -said Mr. Haq- \\\"by a world which was so divided economically as to have about 20 per cent of the population enjoying about 80 per cent of the world income. We have today about two thirds of humanity living if it can be called living at all on less than 30 U.S. cents a day. We have today a situation where there are about 1,000 million illiterate people around the world, although the world has the means and the technology to spread education. We have about 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the children in the Third World suffering from malnutrition although the world has the resources to give adequate nutrition to all of its population. We have maldistribution of the world's resources on a scale where the developed countries are consuming about 25 times more of the resources per capita than the developing countries. We are in a situation where in the Third World millions of people work incredibly hard for very miserable rewards. It is easy to be sophisticated about it and to explain it all in terms of stages of development; but it is not likely to carry much conviction in our countries where people toil in a broiling sun from morning till dusk for mere subsistence and for premature death without ever discovering the reason why.\\\"\nIt is one of the more heartening and indeed more hopeful realities of our time that those words were spoken in the propitious environment of Sweden in a keynote address at a seminar on development and independence held in commemoration of the work of Dag Hammarskjdld.\n69.\tThat picture of our modern world is, I believe, fairly representative of the vieW from the third world generally. It may look slightly better for a handful of developing countries; it will look slightly worse for several. But its essentials are unchallengeable and the need for its rectification must be self-evident. It is on that issue of rectification that we must seek consensus, consensus that we will employ our intellective talents and our technological skills, consensus that we will indulge our humanism no less than our instinct for survival to change the world while there is still time to do it by volition.\n70.\tHow many of us, developed or developing Member States of this Organization, have not determined to reject a national society founded on such gross inequities? How many States have not in fact been established on the basis of rebellion against such injustices? And for how many of us are not these distortions an outrage to the tenets of our national philosophies of social and economic justice? Why, then, do we permit these feudal structures to persist in the community of States, and how long do we really believe they can survive without rendering indefensible a strategy of change through dialog?\n71.\tWhether we are going to end these inequalities and injustices and distortions, whether we are going to build on this planet an egalitarian world community in which the world's income is more fairly shared, in which the world's resources are more evenly consumed, in which the quality of human life derives from belonging not to the world's minority elite but to the human race itself -these are the issues on which we need to reach accord. I have no wish to oversimplify the matter. It is easy to pay lip-service to these objectives, and it is fashionable to do so. It is much more difficult to elevate them to an ethos of international life and to translate that ethos into the practical reality of living. And yet, is there an alternative, if we are indeed to proceed by consensus?\n72.\tIf we are, therefore, so to proceed in earnest, the developed world must be ready to accept change that is truly fundamental. The world's economic system lbs at the base of the world's economic inequalities, injustices and distortions and that system itself must change in radical ways, some of which the Program of Action has already identified. I wish merely, in terms of the philosophy and the ideology of change, to allude to but one aspect of this process. Aristotle long ago perceived a fundamental truth which is as valid today in terms of relations between States as it was 2,000 years ago in terms of relations between people within States. \\\"As between unequals\\\", he asserted, \\\"equity itself demands non-reciprocity\\\". You cannot, he was showing us, change the basic condition of relative inequality except by unequal inputs. If the weak are to be made strong, if the poor are to be lifted out of their poverty, if the under-privileged are to enjoy an equal share, they must, as against the strong, and the rich, and the privileged, be specially advantaged; and the equalizing mechanisms required for redressing these imbalances must inevitably alter in radical ways the very system which produced and sustained them.\n73.\tWhat all this means is that if we are to reach consensus on the philosophy of change, the developed world has first of all to care enough about what happens in the third world and to its people; has, in the second place,, to acknowledge that its own long-term interests require profound modification of the status quo; and has to care enough and be enlightened enough to accept the sacrifices and the dislocations of change; and to accept them, not carpingly as temporary inconveniences to unbridled national prosperity, but nobly and with pride as a new way of life fashioned so that all men may share in the prosperity of our human effort.\n74.\tWe believe, of course, that a mature self-interest ought to dictate the need for consensus on these terms; that our perceptions of an interdependent world make it inevitable that these changes must be wrought; that the demographic reality of the twenty-first century in which today's developed world may be but a mere 10 per cent of the population of our planet makes it essential that they should be wrought long before these disparities become even more absurd than they are at present.\n75.\tBut consensus on such a philosophy of change will not emerge out of old attitudes and old approaches. It is not the consensus of the market-place or that which speaks out of the barrel of a gun. It cannot be a consensus extracted by competition or dictated by power. Our search for consensus must be guided, instead, by a new ordering of values, of values which derive from the imperatives of the human condition in this last quarter of the twentieth century.\n76.\tEver since the emergence of human life on earth many years ago, there have been innumerable hazards to man's existence. They have come from time to time in varying forms, not infrequently from man himself through internecine war. Some of those hazards remain; but the crisis of our time derives from the very success of mankind, from his very success in survival and in his building of a global community that now truly possesses the earth, a community that daily grows more interdependent as our human needs press ever closer to the limits of our small planet. Over-consumption in one place today frequently means scarcity in another; and it also exacts its own deprivation in the environment of the indulgent.\n77.\tOur human condition has changed fundamentally; but the organization of human society has not responded to this basic change in man's relationship to his world. We still have a community of mankind in which many are weak while others are strong; in which many are poor while others grow more enriched; in which many are sick even while science 'conquers disease. The perception of the finiteness of our planet must produce an awareness that all these major problems are interrelated; Food security, problems of population, pollution of the environment, the distribution of the new wealth of the sea and of the scarce non-renewable resources of the land, the elimination of poverty, malnutrition and illiteracy, respect for the inherent dignity of man -all these must be taken together on the agenda of human survival. And in that debate, the antediluvian politics of competition and of power must yield to the politics of world order. When it does -but only when it does- consensus on that philosophy of change, which may be the precondition of man's survival on this planet, will no longer be beyond our grasp.\n78.\tIt was precisely because we had not reached consensus on these fundamentals of change that our development decades and what has up to now been the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] have failed to produce significant change, have failed to effect even the token transfer of resources from the developed to the developing world which was their modest ambition. If we do now agree to embark upon effective international economic reconstruction, one of the primary objectives of the equalizing mechanisms we devise must be a significant transfer of resources from the rich nations to the poor; for herein lies the very heart of change, and it is in this area more than in most that we will test the strength of the commitment of the developed world to meaningful reform.\t\n79.\tIn this regard, two factors need to be acknowledged. The first is that if we are to secure a significant transfer of resources from the developed to the developing countries, if we are to redistribute the world's wealth along more equitable lines, the equalizing mechanisms which we adopt may have to be highly innovative. In the area of trade, for example, mere access to markets may well not be enough. It will certainly not be enough where the assumption is that such access will materially assist the developing State through expansion of exports produced on the basis of cheap labor, for concepts of cheap labor which serve to perpetuate the inequalities of the present system can themselves provide no foundation on which to commence the process of reconstruction. In any transfer of resources designed to eliminate the most stark inequalities of the contemporary scene, therefore, the developed world may well have to face for at least some period of time not ju. an end but, indeed, a reversal of the patterns of trade on which the industrialized societies grew strong: the pattern of buying cheap and selling dear.\n80.\tIt is a measure of the persisting absence of consensus between us on these fundamentals that much of the criticism that continues to be directed to the members of the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries [OPEC] proceeds on the assumption that this .system of low negotiated prices for primary products and high invoiced prices for manufactured goods is somehow preordained and consecrated and that any departure from it, let alone its reversal, borders on heresy and intolerable impertinence.\n81.\tMore particularly, however, experience has shown how easily real improvement in the export receipts of the developing countries can be frustrated by rapid inflation in the developed world. If the problem of achieving meaningful redistribution of the world's income is going to be tackled with a new resolve, then the implementation of schemes of indexation can no longer be postponed. In order to achieve concrete progress with such schemes, we may have to be content, at least initially, with something less than a perfect technical solution. If it be so although the most recent UNCTAD studies appear to confirm the technical feasibility of the system let us nevertheless proceed. We cannot continue to further postpone decision because of an infinity of unresolved subtleties. The patience, not to say the capacity for economic declension, of the developing countries must not be assumed to be endlessly extensive.\n82.\tThe second factor is the more obvious one of the emergence of new strengths within the developing world, strengths that derive in large measure from the unity and resolve of the third world and from practical co-operation within producer associations established by developing States in defense of their right to just terms of trade. OPEC is but one of these associations. Others have already been established, not just on the basis of the experience of OPEC, but in response to the awareness that has been emerging over a number of years that developing producer States, separately weak, can multiply their negotiating strength several times over in dealings with the developed world and its multinational corporations if they act in concert and sustain their unity. The emergence of the new strength which these associations bring to the developing world ought to be a factor of the most profound significance in motivating the developed world both to reach consensus on change and to reach accord on the mechanisms for bringing it about.\n83.\tThe choice between consensus and confrontation is not a choice which will be determined by the developing world. It is a choice that will be dictated by the developed. In any such choice the developing countries must inevitably prefer the former; but if consensus is unattainable and if confrontation is imposed, then there at least exist some levers of strength through which in the last resort a net transfer of resources might be secured.\n84.\tBut let me make it clear that when I speak in this context of a net transfer of resources, it is of a transfer from the developed to the developing States as a whole, a shift of income towards all parts of the developing world. Transfers whose effects are so gross as to create new disparities or new areas of elitism; transfers that are so indiscriminately imposed that they fall equally upon the poor as upon the rich, but with far grayer consequences for the former; or transfers whose base of recipiency is so narrow as to encourage and facilitate a recycling of resources back to the developed countries -such transfers do not fulfill their true potential as equalizing mechanisms and they are questionable symbols of commitment to an egalitarian world community.\n85.\tBut other equalizing mechanisms may be at hand. Certainly, in our effort to redress existing economic imbalances, the new resources of the sea and the sea-bed and the vast potential of outer space can play a unique role. Conceptualized already as a heritage of mankind, what ideal opportunities they provide for creating mechanisms for bringing about a more equitable over-all distribution of the world's\nresources. If we are, indeed, to reach by consensus the goal of global justice, it should be in the interest of the developed States to maximize the returns from these new resources to the peoples of the developing world. But this, also, involves a commitment to fundamental change on the part of the developed world and a willingness to accept constraints on excessive aggregations of wealth in the interest of achieving this end.\n86.\tThere are, of course, important contributions that the developing countries themselves must make to the fulfillment of the goal of an equitable international economic order. IHs axiomatic that just economic relations between States will not fulfill the ambition of an egalitarian world community unless they are made to serve the cause of economic justice within States. The installation and preservation of just societies within the developing world must be as much the consequence of as it clearly is the paramount reason for the securing of a regime of economic equality between all States. For this reason, if for no other, we must accept that the status of human rights everywhere in the developed and in the developing worlds, of civil and political rights, of economic, social and cultural rights, are, and must continue to be, the legitimate concern of the international community, and that their most gross and patent violation must demand the attention of the Organization. The imperatives of economic justice and of respect for the dignity of man once marshaled in the cause of human survival cannot be halted at national frontiers.\n87.\tAnd, of course, the developing countries may well be able to do much to help themselves through more effective economic co-operation in such important areas as trade, transport, industrial development, transfer of technology, and monetary and financial arrangements. The non-aligned movement, pursuing concepts of economic self-reliance, has already adopted an action program for economic co-operation between the non-aligned countries and other developing countries along these lines, and the Assembly has given its blessing to assistance for these efforts from the United Nations [resolution 3241 (XXIX)]. More direct trade between developing countries, through shipping routes that run not merely north to south between developed and developing States, but east to west in the southern zone of the world, may yet significantly enlarge the prospects for development of at least some developing countries. Certainly, such arrangements can contribute greatly to lowering the level of dependency of third world countries and effect qualitative changes in prevailing international economic relationships.\n88.\tMost of these developments -all, indeed, save the last -depend essentially upon the ability of the developed and the developing worlds to reach consensus through dialog. This urgent necessity makes it essential that we utilize the United Nations system to maximum advantage in pursuing that dialog and in maintaining, for so long as it is maintainable, the options for consensus.\n89.\tIt follows that the Organization must be made the focal point for the dialog of development and for the establishment of the new international economic order, and that present efforts to transfer that dialog to and to install the machinery for decision-making in, multilateral associations controlled by the developed world must be resisted.\n90.\tHow deeply indebted we are, all of us, to the Prime Minister of Australia for reminding us, in the eloquent and forthright language of progressive internationalism, of the primacy of this role of the United Nations in the search for solutions to our current problems.\n91.\tBut our need for dialog does draw attention to the unique service which can be rendered, and rendered now, by other institutions, by institutions old and new, which bring together segments of the developed and developing worlds in an environment of genuinely free consultation. Mankind stands greatly in need of consensus-building mechanisms of every sort and at every level between the developed and the developing countries. Indeed, never before has there been as great a need to use these institutions and mechanisms for reaching consensus in the interest of the international community as a whole.\n92.\tBut if we are to use them to this end, we must be mindful of their potential for contributing to that global consensus toward which we work. These consensus-building mechanisms include existing institutions, like the British Commonwealth, that bring together on a basis of ever-enlarging intimacy and understanding States old and new, industrialized and developing, States of north and south, of east and west, States pluralistic and multiracial -a microcosm, indeed, of the world community- embryonic institutions, like that emerging from the new dialog now begun in the Americas, deriving not from old traditions of hegemony but from new insights and possibilities of co-operation between all the States and I repeat, all the States of the hemisphere; incipient associations, such as that which now seems possible between the European Economic Community and a group of some 40 or more States of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific -a relationship which, eschewing a passing neocolonialism, now seeks to explore the potential for economic co-operation between the world's most powerful economic grouping and States that individually are among the weakest, but together are not without strength, and to do so on terms consistent with the wider international objectives of the new economic order.\n93.\tIn all these groupings, and more, there must be pressed into service the search for global consensus on which rests our best hope, perhaps our only hope, not merely for establishing the new international economic order we have already proclaimed, but of evolving that consensus on an egalitarian world community without which our other expectations would be utterly illusory.\n94.\tIf this session is to help to turn us away from the dangers of confrontation, I suggest with(all humility that it is on the intensive search for consensus of this kind and of this quality that we must all agree to embark, developed and developing States alike, both here in the United Nations and in those other organs of. international consultation that provide opportunities for the understanding and reconciliation which persistent dialog inevitably brings.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I would like, at the outset, to express my delegation's satisfaction and, in particular, my own, at seeing you directing the work of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I remember with special satisfaction the brotherly relationship we shared at Algiers, in 1967, when I had the pleasure of sitting beside you when you presided over the first ministerial meeting of the developing countries. On that occasion there were countless times when we found that our views converged regarding solutions for the most urgent and acute problems the developing countries were facing. No less numerous were the occasions on which I witnessed the demonstration of your exceptional qualities of leadership. For this reason, I am convinced that you will prove able to impress upon the deliberations of this General Assembly the objectivity, the firmness and the political acumen required by the complexity of the subjects under debate.\n3.\tI also offer Mr. Leopoldo Benites the thanks of the Brazilian delegation for the able and sound way in which he presided over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Mr. Benites is not only an asset of this Organization, which he has served for so many years with unchanging dedication, but is also an asset of Latin America and of his valiant country\u2014Ecuador\u2014which has in him a respected spokesman in the service of its most authentic aspirations.\n4.\tMay I be allowed to address a very special word of greeting in our common language to the representatives of the Republic of GuineaBissau, present here today in their full right, to the great rejoicing of us all.\n5.\tAs Minister for External Affairs of Brazil and as a Brazilian, nothing could give me greater satisfaction than to salute the admission to this Organization of a new country of Africa and of Portuguese speech, to which we feel linked therefore by bonds of blood and culture. These links constitute the strongest guarantee for the close and fertile friendship which will certainly unite our two peoples.\n6.\tOur greetings are also directed to the delegation of Bangladesh. We are sure that there will be many opportunities for us to extend within the scope of the United Nations the friendly relations we already entertain bilaterally.\n7.\tI also address an equally warm expression of brotherly feelings to the delegation of Grenada, which has added its presence to our regional group.\n8.\tAn honored tradition, which goes back to the first session of the General Assembly, gives Brazil the privilege of opening this great dialog of sovereign nations each year. This tradition I take up today, speaking for the first time as my country's Minister for External Affairs in this forum. I do so with redoubled emotion, for I am conscious that I am addressing the community of nations at a particularly important moment in the history of the Organization and of our participation in it. It is unnecessary to make more explicit the importance of this hour in universal terms. It seems obvious to all that we are at the threshold of a new era which will be one of peace and prosperity or of insecurity and poverty, according to whether we know how to harmonize, in a constructive fashion, the most essential objectives and the most enlightened national interests of each country here represented. Brazil has the benefit of facing the challenge Of this new hour with a Government whose term has just begun and which carries, in its objectives and mode of action, the indisputable stamp of realism and diligence. This allows us to contemplate our action within the Organization against a background that is simultaneously broader in time and more encompassing in tenus of solutions to the problems under consideration.\n9.\tWe have repeatedly and publicly enunciated the principles on which the international conduct of President Ernesto Geisel's administration is based, and we have already given sufficient demonstration that we know how to unite action with words when it comes to turning those principles into reality.\n10.\tDuring recent years Brazil has taken broad steps, first in correcting the main distortions that disrupted its economic and social development and, subsequently, in the consolidation of a model of growth that truly attempts to respond to the authentic aspirations of our national community. Thus the country has grown internally and thus also it has grown in terms of its presence, its potentialities and its responsibilities in the international field. While this is happening, we try to avoid the traps of history by not repeating the errors of nations which became great, many times at the expense of others. We want our presence in a wider ranging international scene to be accompanied by the preservation of the primordial ethical values that have been and that continue to be the bases of our foreign policy.\n11.\tWe want our words in the international field to be direct and simple, without ambiguity or subterfuge. We want the Brazilian Government to be able to accomplish the oecumenical vocation of its people, who are open to uninhibited and frank communication. We want to explore the paths of understanding, for we believe, fundamentally, that cooperation is more effective than antagonism and that mutual respect is more creative than ambitions of preponderance.\n12.\tOur conduct for attaining those objectives is pragmatic and responsible: pragmatic to the extent to which we desire effectiveness and to which we are disposed to seek, wherever Brazilian national interests may move us, areas of convergence and zones of coincidence with the national interests of other peoples; and responsible because we will always act within the framework of ethics and exclusively as a function of objectives clearly identified and accepted by the Brazilian people.\n13.\tI do not intend to comment on the various items on the agenda of the present session. There will, I am sure, be many occasions on which the Brazilian delegation will speak on those items during the coming weeks. From this rostrum I wish only to underline which are the problems, in our understanding, to the solution of which we must jointly dedicate our most urgent attention.\n14.\tImmediately the problem of decolonization springs into view. We have on this question a position of absolute clarity: Brazil believes unreservedly that there is no justification for delay or subterfuge in the process of decolonization, both in the American continent itself and over the entire world. Brazil will give its support so that those peoples still subject to forms of colonial domination may achieve, within the shortest possible time, the national independence to which they aspire. We believe that to the extent that the will of the community of sovereign nations in support of acceleration of the decolonization process becomes general, so much greater will be the possibility that decolonization may be achieved peacefully and under conditions that will allow constructive cooperation between the peoples of those countries that were previously held as colonies and the peoples whose Governments had theretofore followed a colonizing policy. In this sense, support given to emancipation is as important as action directed towards the colonizing Governments so that they may detach themselves quickly and with conviction from their policies of colonial domination. In both forms of action the forum of the United Nations has demonstrated its effectiveness, and it is our intention to support it in this role.\n15.\tBrazil is following this; path, which is not always the easiest one or one which pleases those who cannot distinguish appearance from reality. For the Brazilian Government, the challenge faced by those who want to rid the world of the colonial stigma is the challenge of efficacy. To blame the colonizing past is not what matters; what matter? is rather to help build the future of free nations. This position corresponds to what is deepest in the Brazilian soul. We are prepared to make explicit those sentiments and the aspirations that correspond to them by offering our concrete cooperation in the building of these new nations.\n16.\tAmflcar Cabral, the great leader of the independence of GuineaBissau, was aware of the anti colonialist will of the Brazilian people. His words are so similar to those we have so often uttered in relation to African peoples under colonial domination that they seem almost to have come from the same mouth. I quote them:\n\\\"Our interest\\\" in developing relations of friendship, solidarity and cooperation with Brazil is all the greater as we feel ourselves linked to the Brazilian people by bonds of blood, culture and history, and we ardently desire to establish with Brazil, after the conquest of our independence, broad fraternal relations in all fields, just as we desire them with the people of Portugal, which we never confused with Portuguese colonialism.\\\"\n17.\tThe same feeling of brotherhood binds us to Mozambique and Angola, whose independence we want to see completed. We hail the agreement that on 7 September the Portuguese Government concluded with the Frente de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO]. Little more than a century and a half ago the same date marked the first independence of a former Portuguese colony, and it is Brazil, that former colony, which is here represented and which offers its hand to its African brothers. To Brazil this gesture signifies not just an unbending adherence to the inalienable principle of self-determination. To us, the emergence of African nations to independent life has an additional dimension which allows us to take up again, on an equal footing, the close sharing of life with peoples that have been among the most generous sources of our mode of being.\n18.\tTo the opening up of prospects for the populations in the Territories under Portuguese administration in Africa, there has not been, unfortunately, any corresponding visible progress in respect to areas under colonial domination in other continents. In the same fashion, there still remain forms of subjugation resulting from racial or religious prejudices.\n19.\tIn the United Nations and outside, apartheid has been universally condemned in the name of the most diverse principles. Ethically, it runs directly contrary to the universal values of the human conscience. From the viewpoint of doctrine, it incorporates the most discredited theories of alleged racial superiorities.\n20.\tWhen we repudiate apartheid we also repudiate any pretension of the international community wishing to colonize culturally the nations of Africa. Thus, when we rejoice at the emergence to independence of new Portuguese-speaking nations, we are not uttering praise for any cultural supremacy but are simply welcoming the opportunities now open for a broader brotherly understanding by the communities of the same language. For the African Portuguese-speaking nations and for other nations what we want is that they may be authentic in the expression of their own rich and varied cultures. We in Brazil, who owe so much to the different African cultures, can only hope that they may reinvigorate themselves in the climate of freedom offered to them by national independence.\n21.\tIt has been said, and rightly so, that in the history of mankind ours is the first generation upon which has fallen the task not only of making the world but also of preventing the world from being unmade. It is an enormous responsibility for those who, like the great majority of mankind, have such minute means available to them for influencing global decisions which have such a great effect on them.\n22.\tWe stand almost as helpless spectators of the accelerated arms race, which is incessantly pursued under the mantle of protestations of detente at promises of disarmament. The disproportion between the scope of the problem and the measures agreed on for its solution is smaller only than that which exists between the alleged defense justifications and the overwhelming destructive power that has been accumulated already.\n23.\tMore than anything else, it is shocking to see the magnitude of financial and technological resources devoted to arms production, so many times higher than that which would be necessary to reform the present structure of economic inequities and thus to allow men to live in a world free from fear, more unfettered by shame and, above all, more favorable to the expression of its creative potentialities.\n24.\tThere would be reasons, perhaps, to welcome the evolution during recent years from a world in a climate of \\\"cold war\\\" to a world in a climate of detente. We would have more reasons to rejoice if we could see confirmed in the future what seems to be the present evolution of that climate into a virtual entente. It depends in part on ourselves, the countries that seek development, whether such an entente will be made to our benefit or to our prejudice. It is to a certain extent natural that the great Powers should seek such an entente and, above all, for the preservation of the status quo -which, however, would benefit them only in the short run. However, under its shadow, and this is the only benefit which we receive, we who are less strong must seek only to realize a policy of closer and less tense cooperation in the international field. We must utilize this opening in order to obtain a better coordination of the less developed countries in the defence of their interests in economic and social progress.\n25.\tThis evolution has saved us from the spectre of apocalyptic war, which would be the logical consequence of a boundless arms policy. This does not mean that the world has reached the certainty of being able to live in peace and security, a certainty which is the most profound aspiration of the majority of peoples. Many are those who still continue to suffer from the bitterness of armed conflict or who live under the recurrent threat of its intensification. We have to recognize that the contribution made by the countries not directly involved in those conflicts to their solution is precarious. And we have to admit that it is the very terror of total nuclear conflict which feeds or allows the growth of those localized wars.\n26.\tThe question of the Middle East deserves constant and real attention from all of us.\n27.\tIt is surprising\u2014I would even say shocking - to see that the world seems to turn its preoccupations towards the Middle East only when a war crisis occurs in that disturbed region. The set of problems which for so many years have afflicted the peoples of the Middle East should require of the international community a concern to .bring about continuous and creative cooperation. Within that context, if the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) may indeed constitute one of the possibly indispensable conditions for the development of the solution to the problem, it is also true that that implementation does not exhaust the range of measures essential to the attainment of the greater objectives of peace, security, tranquility, and social and economic development of the countries of the region.\n28.\tObjection to wars of conquest is a constant factor in the history of Brazil and a norm inscribed in our Constitution. We hold the right to territorial integrity and the obligation of respect for sovereignty to be absolute. Consequently, we believe that withdrawal from the occupied territories is an integral part of the solution to the conflict.\n29.\tOnly those frontiers which have been negotiated and recognized by all for the good of all will be calm. This is the solution which, by bringing them peace and security, will truly serve the countries of the region.\n30.\tWe, the countries of the American continent, are fortunate to have an institutional solution to such problems and we are proud that the security agreement binding us together has determined, for many years now, that all regional conflicts be solved starting from the initial and indispensable assumption that occupying forces are withdrawn from areas under military invasion.\n31.\tThe drama of the Middle East is enlarged and made universal to the extent that it involves human aspects which cannot be ignored. The community of nations must not spare an/ effort, including efforts made in conjunction with the peoples of the Middle East, to ensure that the sufferings of the Palestinian people are alleviated by appropriate measures. It is inhuman to consider that any solution that does not attend to their rights is equitable, and it is an illusion to think that such a solution would be lasting.\n32.\tWe are sure, on the other hand, that a greater effort of international cooperation with the countries of the Middle East in the economic and social fields may provide a decisive contribution to peace. It is gratifying to note that wide prospects seem to be opening up in this direction, and there will arise if all parties, conscious of their growing responsibilities, work with creative imagination and firmness of intention unprecedented modalities for cooperation which will be of great significance to the international community, and especially to the developing countries. Such cooperation, which is in the interest of all countries and all regions, if correctly implemented, may bring about results of extreme importance in the reorientation of the flows of trade, of investments and of financing, correcting the existing distortions which contribute to insecurity and instability in the international field.\n33.\tLatin America, in its mutual solidarity, has a clear conception of the challenge that the present crisis represents for each one of our countries. This challenge does not frighten us; rather, it stimulates us to redouble internally, within each country, the efforts needed to accelerate national progress, and to expand, in the external field, forms of cooperation to achieve common objectives resulting from the convergence of our national interests.\n34.\tOne of the characteristics of the time in which we are living is the growing command that developing countries are assuming over their natural resources. This evolution is allowing those countries to reduce their excessive dependence on the economies of the developed countries and better to orientate their own economic growth. It also opens up unprecedented opportunities for cooperation among developing countries.\n35.\tIn Latin America, an awareness of the importance of this process is visibly increasing. The full use of natural resources in Latin American countries is fundamental to the acceleration of the growth of the region and may become a relevant Latin American contribution to the alleviation of the world crises of energy, raw materials and food. At the same time, the strong cultural and political solidarity that binds together the countries of Latin America, also makes joint endeavors in the economic field ever more viable. Thus we see ever-growing possibilities of cooperation in the use of natural resources common to or shared by more than one country. The. novelty of this form of cooperation, at least on the scale on which it is being developed in Latin America, has not yet permitted a general understanding of its potential or of the problems it involves. I consider it important to bring before the international community my country's point of view on these questions.\n36.\tBrazil considers that the free use and exploitation of the natural resources in its territory is a right inherent in the sovereignty of the State. Such a right cannot brook restrictions. In the case of resources which are, by nature, not static and which flow through the territory of more than one country, that right remains unalterable, those restrictions alone being acceptable that result from the obligation not to cause significant or permanent damage to the exploitation by other countries of the natural resources in their territories. To subordinate the sovereign utilization of our own natural resources to consultations of a.suspensive nature would be to introduce an intolerable disruption in international order, with the result of making the right that we were trying to preside a mere \\\"dead letter\\\". The Brazilian Government, which does not refuse to make use of or to resort to consultation between Governments in this as in any other matter, and which has resorted to this method of procedure frequently in the past, cannot 'accept the perversion of the cooperative function of consultation by questioning the sovereignty of States. For this reason we think it is our duty to awaken the consciences of Governments to the implications of principles of consultation that would injure the sovereign right of countries to use their natural resources, and that, though seemingly constructive, would be potentially disruptive to the international order, which it is our aim to preserve, and an impediment to the material progress of nations, which it is our objective to stimulate. We should all be aware that natural resources, the use of which it is intended to regulate in opposition to the sovereign decisions of territorial Governments, do not flow over ground only. There are those that flow beneath the ground, as there are those that flow in the territorial sea. The characteristics of certain resources must be the motive for responsible behavior on the part of those who use them, rather than for hindering their use and thus benefiting no party at all.\n37.\tWe are experiencing all these problems in Latin America and we are seeking solutions to them based on the principles of harmony of interests, peaceful understanding and enlightened cooperation, principles that this Organization has established as the foundations of international life. If I bring to this rostrum the example of Latin America, it is because I sincerely believe that it constitutes a positive contribution to the realization of the ideals of the United Nations.\n38.\tMy reflections have barely touched on some items of the agenda for the present session. The reason is that I have tried to confine myself to an enunciation of Brazil's. position on questions that belong to the agenda of mankind more than to the agenda of the Assembly, and on the set of fundamental problems, the solution of which will determine the shape of the coming decades.\n39.\tI have chosen to concern myself with those problems that are more closely connected with the aspirations of liberty, human dignity, justice, progress and peace. On many of these questions the international community has made considerable progress. On others, the results obtained have been imperceptible. Nevertheless, there is no reason for dismay. The severity of the problems should constitute for all of us not a reason for disenchantment, but an incentive to redoubled efforts, creative imagination and fidelity to the purposes and principles upon which this Organization of sovereign States was built.\n"

        "file_text": "It is fitting first of all to note that the current session of the General Assembly re-presents a turning-point in the history of the Organization. The events which coincided with the session and the conditions under which it is being held reveal a major change in the movement of world history. Concepts have changed; some of the characteristic traits of the old world have collapsed. New signs have appeared that, if taken seriously, might indicate a new course for man in international life.\n101.\tMay I be permitted to congratulate the General Assembly on electing Mr. Bouteflika as President of the current session. The Algerian struggle represents a historic attainment for Africa and the peoples of the world in general. When Mr. Bouteflika, in the name of Algeria and Africa, assumed leadership of the General Assembly at its current session, we took it as recognition of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the freedom of their country and the dignity of man.\n102.\tOnly one year after the last session, the President declared the admission of a struggling people to the United Nations, a people that, until a few months earlier, was labeled a band of terrorists. Does not the President agree with me that a new concept has arisen and that the voices that have been trying to prevent the freedom fighters from reaching this forum must inevitably be silenced for ever? The admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations and the election of its representative as Rapporteur of the Fourth Committee at this very session reaffirm the facts I have mentioned. Now, let us devote this session to re-deeming those who are still under the yoke of colonialism, apartheid, racial discrimination and foreign domination.\n103.\tAnother significant characteristic of the last session was the presidency of Mr. Leopoldo Benites. His appreciation of the heritage of man, his deep comprehension of world history and his far-sightedness inspired us to appreciate the turn of events we witness today. We recognize with appreciation, inter alia, his contribution to the adoption of the Arabic language as an official and working language of the United Nations, a language imbued with a rich cultural heritage and human values, and I should like to emphasize here that his frequent praise of this language was an important factor in introducing it. It would not have been easy for anyone else to have assumed such leadership during recent developments. We note with appreciation the positive developments in the relationships between the old world, whose civilization has paved the way for the discovery of the new world, and that part of the new world from which Mr. Benites comes, and where emigrants to Latin America, while preserving their heritage, worked out a blend of the old and the new.\n104.\tThose were two positive aspects. However, we cannot escape the fact that a negative aspect has ac-companied and will accompany this new course. When his country called for a special session of the General Assembly, Mr. Bouteflika noticed, as did Mr. Benites while presiding over that session, that there were those who sought to impede the reconsideration of international relations in such a manner as to assert the rights of the majority. The dominant Powers of the old system tried to put the blame on the third world by fabricating imaginary crises, by sowing the seeds of disagreement among the countries of the third world, by threatening to ban shipments of food and clothing, by promoting wars, espionage, subversion and coups d'etat, and by taking advantage of certain rights given them during the period of their might and dominance, thus obstructing the adoption of resolutions.\n105.\tThe sixth special session provided a precious opportunity to test the extent of the dominant Powers' readiness to adjust to the new order. Members may have noticed their disregard for the demands of the third-world countries and their attempts to obstruct any understanding on a new international economic system. When they realized that they could not prevent the adoption of such a system, they all registered their reservations. Could such an attitude be a prelude towards mutual understanding and international interdependence?\n106.\tThis Assembly, presided over by Mr. Bouteflika, and with the participation of the progressive forces of the world, cannot be used as a rostrum to invite us to dissension and threats. Discordant voices have tried to exploit this rostrum to prevent our session from considering the genuine problems facing us. There have been many arbitrary stands, but those who use threats must accept the responsibility for their attitude. It is high time that we unveiled the motives behind those voices.\n107.\tWe are happy today at the admission of Guinea-Bissau; yet we are not going to forget that the imperialist Powers have never lent a hand in support of the struggle of its people and have attacked the liberation movements by providing assistance to the former Government of Lisbon. We cannot be expected to forgive that shameful attitude simply because they did not oppose the admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations. We must not forget the shameful attitude of the imperialist Powers in ignoring the African liberation movement. Through assistance rendered to the former despotic regime in Lisbon, they stabbed it in the back. The new reality has been brought about despite their stubbornness and their opposition. We are ready to let our wounds heal, but we are not willing to weave glorious banners for them out of our blood.\n108.\tThe African liberation movement has rendered a service to the peoples of colonialist Powers, not only by ridding them of their dishonorable wars against freedom fighters in Africa, but also by giving them the opportunity to get rid of their corrupt and tyrannical regimes. The freedom fighters in Guinea- Bissau, Mozambique and Angola have struggled for the cause of man as a whole. Their victory helped the people of Portugal to put an end to years of tyranny and suppression. If anybody deserves gratitude for this development, it is the people of Guinea-Bissau, led by the late Amilcar Cabrai, and the peoples of Angola and Mozambique with their respective revolutionary leaders.\n109.\tThis development should have been received in the General Assembly with the admission by the imperialist Powers of the failure of their former policies and of the decline of their political and economic empires. Yet, some of them deemed it appropriate to use this forum as a vehicle to talk about tightening belts, about using food and natural resources as a political weapon, and about the rights of the minority vis-a-vis the majority. They should instead pay the price of the well-being they enjoy at the expense of those who perished of starvation, those who have no schools, those who have no medicine, and those who have nowhere to live.\n110.\tThe extravagances of these countries were perpetrated at the expense of all those we have mentioned. Those who request co-operation could have paid the price for such opulence. They could have made unconditional sacrifices, but, on the contrary, they insisted on maintaining this high standard of extravagance and, moreover, they demanded that others make more sacrifices either voluntarily or under duress.\n111.\tIn the chaotic conditions created by the imperialist Powers, the so-called rights of the minority must be looked on as only a continuation of the privileges of the minority enjoyed at the expense of the suppressed and deprived majority. This minority would convince us that the future of the world depends on this continued exploitation of the world's resources. This is totally unacceptable. The call for democracy within the international community is being blocked by the refusal of the minority to fit into the new reality. This can be achieved only if the minority yields to the view of the majority, and if the majority takes part in formulating the decisions which determine the future of international relations. Slandering the policies of the oil-producing countries for fixing prices should not be taken at face value. At most, it reveals the anxiety of the industrialized countries in so far as that measure might lead to other actions by the developing countries which produce raw materials, because the industrial countries have established their economies on the basis of obtaining raw materials at the cheapest prices and selling their manufactures at the highest prices. Obviously, as shown by their spokesmen, they are not willing to alter this formula, hence their campaign of slander.\n112.\tCan we then attach our future to the desires of countries which, although they are in a minority, are only interested in protecting their own rights without acknowledging their duties? The discussions of the Working Group drafting the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States are a striking example of the unwillingness of the imperialist Powers to give up the gains they obtained illegally when they were in control of the world's destiny. In defaming their policies, those countries only considered the future of their own economies. None of them cared to discuss the political and economic future of the world. Nor did they admit the failure of the economic and monetary policies which they had imposed upon the world. They did not deplore the looting and plunder practiced by their multinational companies which sought to obtain the lion's share of economic revenues for their share of the products of the third world. They said nothing about their intentions to lessen the gap between their advanced economies and the economies of other countries. Nor did they render any assistance in the field of technology. They did not extend a hand to the freedom fighters struggling for the realization of their right to self-determination and control over their natural resources. All they offered was lip service. They demanded that the third-world countries continue to sell their supplies at the lowest possible price lest the world economic order collapse. This is a false theory, as if scores of years of accumulated errors, plunder and looting to which the peoples of the world were subjected were not sufficient for the major developed Powers. They would have the third world remain a political colony or, at least, remain economically dominated, offering all it had at the lowest price for the sake of helping the imperialistic Powers to maintain their grip on its economy and destiny. We believe that it has become obvious that this political practice is a deceit; it is even an absurd deceit which we can no longer overlook.\n113.\tThose who trade in wheat and use it as a means to interfere in the internal affairs of States are the most unfair and the greatest violators of the international code of ethics, and they cannot presume to lecture other States on human conduct.\n114.\tThe Arab countries which applied an embargo on the United States have done so as a reaction to an act of aggression initiated by this imperialistic Power and still being perpetrated against our peoples. Can any sensible individual expect us to provide energy to the hand that stabs us daily, by means of its Zionist agents, for the sake of satisfying their greed in dominating the world and its destiny? The United States has thus far offered only deceit to the peoples struggling for their freedom. On the other hand, they provide weapons and means of destruction to the racists in order to enable them to continue their domination of the peoples of the world. We are not willing to supply this war machinery with the fuel it needs to perpetuate itself. Putting these facts in their proper perspective exposes the ugly face of the elements that are trying to display their concern over the fate of the world. The worth of the military equipment supplied at one time to the Zionists would have been sufficient to feed millions of people who are dying of starvation in the Sahara, and yet the United States offered only empty promises, and conditional ones at that, to those dying of hunger.\n115.\tThe true problem resides in the re-establishment of an economic balance of power in the world and in the restructuring of a new world economic order in accordance with the resolution of the General Assembly which was adopted at its sixth special session, to which the industrial countries, led by the United States of America, entered reservations because it did not meet their desires.\n116.\tMay I draw your attention to a positive indicator which characterizes this session. It has become possible for us now to discuss the issues in their proper context. No longer are we afraid of talking openly. Palestine is the very issue that concerns the world as a whole, and there is no reason why we should not employ its right name. The issue is not the truce, nor is it the Middle East problem; it is not the disengagement of forces; it is not a matter for compromises. It is not any of that nonsense. The issue, in fact, is that of a sacred land which has been flagrantly usurped, the rights of whose people have been trampled upon. Those people have lived homeless for more than a quarter of a century.\n117.\tThus, the imperialist and colonialist Powers and their subversive agents have sought to prevent the discussion of this issue on an international level. Yet that transformation, witnessed by the world today, has made it possible for this item to be listed on the agenda and will, in turn, make it possible for an appropriate solution to be found. The world, and especially this Assembly, has been warned against any solution based on compromises or shortcuts or bargaining. We must not ignore the facts, such as they are. We have been warned against failure to acknowledge realities and against any partition schemes contradictory to the spirit of the Charter. Today, we warn against any solutions propagated by the so- called miracle makers. Miracles can only be made by the struggling peoples, and thus no one but the Palestinian people themselves can bring about a solution. We must invite the legitimate representatives of the Palestinians to participate in the debate, as this will make the consideration of the item serious and genuine. It will further silence those who seek to smear the just struggle of the Palestinian people.\n118.\tThose who have tried to obstruct the inscription of the item, and those who have tried to label the Palestinians and their representatives as subversives and terrorists ignore the history of the United Nations and the history of the struggle of peoples. Most of those participating in this discussion and representing the third-world countries were once labeled as terrorists. Yet when their peoples' struggle triumphed, they became the true representatives of their people at the United Nations.\n119.\tThe situation in Cyprus has a bearing upon the security and safety of the area. It has an effect upon our humane and emotional feelings. The imperialist Powers have tried to follow the same policy they have followed in other situations by fabricating solutions and devising compromises. We deem it the duty of the General Assembly to recall that the United Kingdom bears the greatest responsibility in creating the tragedy of Cyprus. This country has never abandoned an area that had been blighted with its colonialism without leaving behind a problem or the seeds of a problem. It is high time that the plot was exposed. The influence of the United Kingdom, its bases and its allies should be isolated rather than be allowed to poison inter-national relations. Let us leave the affairs of Cyprus to the Cypriots, whether Turk or Greek. The promotion of mutual relations between the two communities and the protection of the rights of each will pave the road to a peaceful solution which will restore independence and non-alignment to the island, making it free of bases of the imperialist Powers and of their allies.\n120.\tThe Mediterranean is full of military fleets belonging to Powers distant from its shores, and which have no connexion with it. The continuation of the presence of the Sixth Fleet and the attempt of NATO to gain a foothold on the island of Cyprus constitute a threat to the security and safety of the population as a whole. It is our duty seriously to endeavor to make of the Mediterranean a lake of peace and civilization, free of rivalries and spheres of influence.\n121.\tIn this statement my delegation will not dwell upon the other items on the agenda. These will be dealt with in due course in the committees. Yet we are concerned about the fate of the world because certain issues have been kept on the agenda for a quarter of a century without ever having been resolved. We realize that the decision concerning those items rests with the determination of the peoples involved, for the Charter makes special provisions for the peoples and disregards imperialistic regimes.\n122.\tOur numbers have risen at this session with the admission of Guinea-Bissau, Bangladesh and Grenada. We welcome them whole-heartedly. However, we are still waiting for the day to come when the representatives of the racist minorities will be replaced by the true representatives of Palestine and South Africa, and when we can welcome the true representatives of Zimbabwe. Then we shall be able to say that the provisions of the Charter and the universality of the Organization have been realized.\n123.\tThe decision of the General Assembly [resolution 3207 (XXIX)] to refer the question of the relationship between the racist regime of South Africa and the United Nations to the Security Council is a new step that should be followed by others in order to make the representation at the General Assembly consistent with the provisions of the Charter. How could the Assembly admit into its membership those who daily violate the provisions of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? The argument that this matter should be looked upon in a legal or procedural context sacrifices human dignity for the sake of abiding by technicalities. The reference of this matter to the Security Council exposes the imperialistic intentions of certain Powers and unveils the organic relationship between them and the racist regime in South Africa. That, however, has not prevented the Assembly from stating its view with regard to this matter which is in itself a good start.\n124.\tAs we await the completion of the liquidation of colonialism in the Portuguese colonies, we are concerned about a neighbor of Portugal which still occupies and dominates an African-Arab Territory. Spain's obstinate position regarding Sakiet Al-Hamra and Rio de Oro places that country on the list of the last of the old imperialistic Powers that have not yet come around to understanding the movement of history. Spain's insistence on adhering to that position is in contradiction to that movement. Any argument presented by Spain in defense of its presence in that region is nothing but a colonialist argument. The inhabitants of the region and their Arab brethren are capable of achieving their freedom and well-being; they are in no need of Spanish trusteeship or aid.\n125.\tA new world is emerging today. There can be no escape from the formulation of new bases comparable with this new beginning. The United Nations must become an effective instrument for the realization of its Charter. We the majority and we are proud of being a majority have the duty to lay new foundations for the course of the Organization. We shall not be intimidated by the stubborn attitude of the old Powers. Our interrelationships will not be affected by any willful mischief. In fact, we are terminating our relations with the old racist Powers in an effort to expel them from the Assembly Hall, while we welcome new delegations representing friendly countries.\n126.\tThe new economic Powers have made continued sacrifices for the benefit of the world. They have never exploited the world. The old Powers, on the other hand, have failed to do anything to alleviate the calamities that befall the peoples of the world whom they continue to exploit. The peoples of the third world have never willfully destroyed their raw materials as did those advanced countries that burnt their grains at a time when people were perishing from starvation. The oil-producing countries have not consumed one third of the total production of the world's energy supply in extravagant and sophisticated luxuries as the privileged few have done. Rather, they produce their materials, export them and make them available for the world, and whatever revenues they get in return, they use for their own development. Whatever surplus remains, they share with fairness and dignity. It has not been couched in deceit or given as a bribe or used by their intelligence apparatus to topple legitimate Governments. The aid has been designed to give a hand to liberation movements, with an eye to ridding man of the scourge of colonialism, suppression and apartheid.\n127.\tThe 80 per cent of the world's population that is the legitimate owner of most of the world's natural resources also has the legitimate right to discuss and administer its affairs. Now the road is clear, and we must march on despite the opposition of others.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I take great pleasure in joining distinguished speakers who have preceded me \\\"in. congratulating you on your election to the high office of the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your eminent qualities are known to me over the years of our personal acquaintance and your abilities as a dynamic representative of the sister State of Algeria are known to us all in this Assembly. You will bring further credit to your own nation and to Africa, and in doing so you will have the full co-operation of my delegation.\n87.\tDuring the last session, as a member of the General Committee in which I had the privilege to serve as Chairman of the Second Committee, I had the honour to admire the high competence and skill of your predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador, who so memorably added to the body of precedent and prestige set by your predecessors for the achievement and discharge of your manifold duties and responsibilities.\n88.\tMr. Kurt Waldheim, Secretary-General of the Organization, continues to serve the international community with vigor and dedication. I wish to pay tribute to him, particularly for the constructive role he has played in the peace-making efforts of the Organization and for his deep humanitarian concern to assist the drought victims on my continent.\n89.\tThe United Nations family of sovereign and independent States comes together again this year in the General Assembly, enlarged and strengthened through the admission of Bangladesh, Grenada, and Guinea-Bissau. Their representatives have taken their rightful places amongst us; I extend to them the warm welcome of my Government and delegation.\n90.\tAmong the positive developments for consideration in our coming debates that have occurred since last year's session, my Government would particularly note the limited but significant agreements concluded in the Middle East, the growing recognition of the vital economic interdependence between the developing countries and the industrialized nations, and the outcome of the freedom struggle in Africa which is inducing the present leadership in Portugal to pursue a more realistic policy in that continent.\n91.\tThe sharpest negative developments during the same period have been the largely unrelieved suffering of millions of our fellow men in the severely drought- affected world, the sudden shattering of peace and tranquility in Cyprus, and the severe dislocation in the international economic and monetary systems.\n92.\tI shall briefly indicate my Government's views on some of the more pressing issues.\n93.\tEthiopia has whole-heartedly welcomed the troop disengagement agreements which have followed the cease-fire in the Middle East. But while I express my Government's appreciation for the statesmanship of the Governments directly concerned and the indefatigable energy of the United States Secretary of State in achieving these preliminary steps, I am also bound to state my country's deep concern that what has been accomplished may be frustrated by the explosive potential of the present situation.\n94.\tWithout in any way wishing to oversimplify the complexity of the problems that are coming before the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, my Government would urge that prompt action be taken to regain the momentum generated by the achievement of the disengagement agreements. It is also the view of my delegation that a peace settlement in the Middle East must be achieved within the letter and the spirit of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and that, for it to last, it must take into account the legitimate rights of all peoples in the region, including those of the Palestinians. I need hardly add that Ethiopia has most acutely suffered from the long closure of the Suez Canal and will assist in every way possible efforts to reopen this vital artery of international commerce.\n95.\tTo those of us in Africa the past nine months have brought a particularly welcome application of the sacred principle of self-determination by Portugal's recognition of the independence of Guinea-Bissau and the establishment in Mozambique of a transitional Government led by the Frente de Libertao de Mozambique [FRELIMO], now on the road to early independence. This relentless and valiant struggle of the national liberation movements and peoples in those Territories is heart-warming in its achievement and in its promise for the future.\n96.\tAgain, we are reminded of the adage that independence is often won but seldom granted. In fairness to the new leadership in Portugal, however, we join the many who have given it due credit for commanding the courage to rise to its opportunities and to meet its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. In that effort and in that achievement the Portuguese leadership has our sympathy and encouragement.\n97.\tEver since the sixteenth session which began in 1961, when I had the privilege of speaking from this rostrum on the question of Angola [1097th meeting], my Government has been concerned about the fate of the people of that Territory. My delegation would support today active efforts to work out modalities with the national liberation movements in Angola ways and means of facilitating the peaceful and rapid transfer of power. The fact of Angola's independence is acknowledged, and the achievement of that independence must be hastened.\n98.\tIt is true that in the twenty-ninth year of the life of the Assembly we can congratulate ourselves that a global conflagration has been avoided. That indeed represents a cause of justifiable pride to the peoples of the United Nations and the triumph, to a certain degree, of human reason. But, on the other hand, localized wars in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere- colonial wars, wars of conquest and of intervention -have caused untold suffering to millions of people. We must emphasize that, in terms of the cumulative loss of human life, the suffering and the havoc wrought, the effect of local wars certainly of no less severity to the victims than that of global war.\n99.\tIn this context, let me state at once that Ethiopia does not pretend to have any magic formula for the total elimination of wars and international conflicts. My country has, however, consistently urged the strengthening and the use of the established machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.\n100.\tMost recently, the tragic events in Cyprus have aroused anxious concern. Ethiopia has always supported the use of international machinery and means to obtain peace and security as one of the primary purposes of the Organization. Consequently, we supported the dispatch of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force to Cyprus in the early 1960s and its stabilizing presence on the island for more than a decade. Whatever may be the procedures and means adopted to restore peace and tranquility on the island, Ethiopia believes that the unity of the people of Cyprus and sovereignty and territorial integrity should be strictly preserved.\n101.\tMy delegation remains concerned about the uncertain situation in South-East Asia and has noted with satisfaction the withdrawal of the bulk of the armed forces of a super-Power. As regards northern Asia, we hope that the discussions between North and South Korea will be resumed and will lead to a reduction of tension. My delegation trusts that the obstacles to a peaceful settlement may be removed in both South-East and northern Asia.\n102.\tThe international community continues as helpless as it is indignant about the repugnant situation still prevailing in southern Africa. It is shameful that, 29 years after its founding, the United Nations should still be deliberating upon the twin problems of colonialism and apartheid. The disregard by some Member States of the provisions of the Charter and of the decisions of the Assembly and of the Security Council is obvious. The subjugation and degradation of millions of people in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa should surely be a thorn in the collective conscience of the Assembly.\n103.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, the Smith regime, far from being brought to its knees, as we were told it had been eight years ago by the administering Power, has on the contrary consolidated its illegal exercise of power through the complicity and blessing of some Member States. The systematic violation of sanctions imposed by the Security Council against Southern Rhodesia has given sustenance to the white minority regime and strengthened its grip over the defenseless African people in the country. Ethiopia, mindful of its own bitter experience in the 1930s, has time and again drawn attention to the futility of sanctions unless they are scrupulously observed by one and all.\n104.\tThe question of Southern Rhodesia continues to be a test case for the United Nations, and my Government regrets that the uncooperative attitude of some Member States has contributed to the undermining of the principles enshrined in the Charter. If the Organization is to be a source of hope for mankind, it is imperative that we act in concert to restore its prestige and make it effective. My delegation therefore appeals to the world community and to the Organization to implement the mandatory sanctions of the Security Council, so that law and order may be secured with justice.\n105.\tIt is distressing to note that in South Africa the odious policy of apartheid is being relentlessly pursued, with even more vigor, and that the majority is increasingly faced with the enactment of new suppressive laws and supporting violence. In spite of.the efforts of the United Nations, the Namibian people is still denied the right to self-determination and independence.\nICR My Government is aware that the Government of South Africa has of late resorted to the use of classic ploys of delay and deception, with pronouncements from Pretoria of plans for political and constitutional development for Namibia. The timing of those pronouncements by the South African Government, when the General Assembly is in session, is obviously intended-to sow confusion and frustrate consensus when the item on Namibia is discuss d in the General Assembly. South Africa's tactics in confusing the issues, evident in the composition of its delegation to the current session of the General Assembly, have been most properly rebuffed in the Credentials Committee.\n107. In flagrant violation of the Charter and the re-solutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council, the Government of South Africa has not only continued but also intensified its policy of exploitation and oppression in Namibia. The failure of the United Nations to remedy this situation will no doubt be recorded as the most disappointing episode in the history of the Organization.\n108.\tMy delegation is heartened that the General Assembly has adopted, only a few days ago, a resolution requesting the Security Council to examine the question of South Africa's continued membership in the United Nations, in the light of that country's persistent defiance of its Charter obligations [resolution 3207 (XXIX)]. As sanction deeply concerned over the plight and fate of our brethren in southern Africa, we feel that the Security Council should have recourse to the provisions of Article 6 of the Charter, as a preliminary measure. Given the well-known position of intransigence of the apartheid regime in South Africa, the international community will have to consider the possibility of resorting to other provisions of the Charter, relating to enforcement actions, in order to secure the compliance of South Africa with the decision of the United Nations.\n109.\tDisarmament is yet another problem for which effective action has so far eluded the international community. While slight progress has been made by the conclusion of certain arms control and related measures for instance, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] - recent events make us wonder whether what little gains have been made are not actually being eroded.\n110.\tIn the past year, atmospheric as well as underground testing of nuclear devices has continued. The hope we expressed last year from this rostrum [2127th meeting] that the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963 should be improved to ban underground testing of nuclear devices has not materialized. Nor have any additional nuclear Powers signed the Treaty in the past year. Unfortunately, too, no appreciable progress seems to have been registered during the year's sessions of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to further the attempt to reach agreement on an effective mechanism for the comprehensive prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and the destruction of the existing arsenal of such weapons. My delegation cannot emphasize too strongly the need to reach agreement on this and other vital issues of disarmament.\n111.\tOf no less consequence is the fact that, even as actions are being taken towards the dismantling of foreign bases in developing countries, new bases are being set up in new localities, bringing new areas within their range and risk. Measures of progression matched against equivalent retrogression will not help the world community to make headway towards achieving the aims and purposes of the Charter.\n112.\tThe Assembly has come to accept the proposition that co-operation among nations is indispensable if mankind is to survive and progress in an interdependent world. Acceptance of this thesis, however, has not been accompanied by the kind of co-operative behavior necessary for the solution or at least the amelioration of the economic and social conditions that bring such misery in the wake of natural disaster.\n113.\tThe Sahelian region of Africa and my own country have suffered and are still suffering from severe food shortages caused by several years of drought. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children have lost their lives. The humanitarian response which we received from the international community has been encouraging. It is gratifying for me to take this opportunity to express from this rostrum my country's deep appreciation and gratitude to those sympathetic individuals, friendly nations and international and non-governmental organizations that came to our rescue. It must be emphasized, however, that the relief aid going to the drought-stricken parts of Ethiopia, both from domestic and international sources, falls far short of the amount needed to cope with the situation. Ethiopia trusts that the international community will continue to respond to the desperate needs of the victims of drought and natural disaster.\n114.\tIn view of the unprecedented food crisis in vast areas of the world, especially on the African continent, my delegation feels that it is imperative for the international community to take prompt action and, in particular, to adopt the necessary measures to create an internationally agreed system of food stocks and reserves.\n115.\tEthiopia's capacity to combat the natural calamities that have befallen it has been severely limited by the soaring prices of agricultural inputs, especially the rapid and overwhelming increase in the price of fertilizer. The price of this invaluable agricultural input is of great concern for most of the developing countries, which have committed such large proportions of their national resources to increasing their agricultural production. The problem is even more acute in Ethiopia than in many other countries due to the fact that fertilizer was only recently introduced into the traditional form of agriculture. Hence, high prices are a disastrous disincentive to potential users. It is to be hoped that the World Food Conference, soon to be convened in Rome, will place this item high on its agenda.\n116.\tIn order to maintain at least the present level of food supply, a considerable increase of food production is of vital importance to meet the requirements of population growth. If this can be done, food relief aid can be kept at temporary stop-gap levels. But in order to contain the age-old cyclical recurrence of famine, medium- and long-term planning and large- scale financial outlays are necessary for irrigation, afforestation, and resettlement and rehabilitation of people. Ethiopia has embarked upon such long-range planning. Being one of the least developed countries, however, its ability to finance the necessary projects envisaged in the plan from its own resources is extremely limited. It is evident, therefore, that unless international assistance of adequate magnitude is made available to it, Ethiopia's aspirations for accelerated progress in economic and social development will be severely constrained.\n117.\tThe maintenance and development of food production is, of course, completely enmeshed in general economic development. We share the view that the adequate transfer of resources from rich to poor nations would help the developing countries in the achievement of their present programs. It is sad to note, however, that such resource transfers are continuing to decline. The target set for the Second United Nations Development Decade called upon the developed countries to give 0.7 per cent of their gross national product in official development assistance by 1975. It is now estimated that by 1975 official development assistance levels will not exceed 0.35 per cent. This is only half the modest target envisaged for the Second Development Decade. The failure of the rich countries to honor such a modest pledge is discouraging, to say the least, especially when one realizes that the developed countries could double their present official development assistance without undue sacrifice. They would need to allocate less than 2 per cent of the amount by which they annually grow richer during the period of the Second Development Decade. In my delegation's view, the achievement of this target neither demands the lowering of the high standard of living of their people, nor requires them to neglect their domestic priorities.\n118.\tAt this session we again urge that the official component of the net transfer of financial resources to the developing countries should be increased so as to attain the targeted level of 0.7 per cent by 1975. Furthermore, we suggest that grant elements should constitute a higher percentage of all development aid. To be truly effective, development loans must be concessionary and untied. We also feel that-the inter-national financial institutions must increasingly adjust their lending policies to meet the needs of the developing countries.\n119.\tAlthough foreign aid can play a vital role in the development of poor countries, its role must be viewed only as supportive. It is the opinion of my delegation that, in order to sustain an effective program of national development, a nation must be able to generate and earn income through its trade. Because of the scale associated with modern productive enterprises, and the need to earn foreign exchange with which to purchase the indispensable capital goods, international trade has become the mainstay of the economies of developing countries, Future progress in these countries depends upon ability to gain free and unhindered access to the markets of the developed countries for their agricultural products and raw materials. However, trade relations between the developing and the industrialized countries are characterized by unstable prices for exported primary commodities, rising prices of imported industrial goods, and restrictive policies of the developed nations in regard to processed and semi-processed agricultural products from the developing countries.\n120.\tThe single most important feature of the economic structure of most developing countries is the predominance of the primary sector in their economies: primary products account for a very high percentage of developing countries' exports. The unstable foreign exchange earnings from the exports of primary products underpin their development programs. As long as the income from this sector continues to fluctuate, we in the developing areas of the world will be faced with difficulties in our attempt to carry out long- term development plans, which require stable and substantial foreign exchange resources. As long as our access to the markets of industrialized countries is hindered by tariff and non-tariff barriers, most of our plans for economic expansion will suffer severe restriction.\n121.\tAlterations in the international economic order must be made to enable the developing countries to increase export earnings and assure them access to adequate, and steady financial resources for their development. The deterioration in the terms of trade for exports from developing countries must be avoided by establishing a close link between the prices of products exported by developing countries and the prices of goods and services imported by them from industrialized countries.\n122.\tEthiopia welcomes the Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI), adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth special session, which was convened on the timely initiative of President Boumediene. That session went a long way in defining the present economic problems and in suggesting programs of action. It is for the current session to give earnest consideration to the proposals for concrete, practical implementation during the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n123.\tThe necessity for the transfer of technology from industrialized countries to the developing nations is undisputed. The contribution of technology in enhancing the productive capacities of man is obvious. To realize the gains, it is necessary that the problems and the mechanism of technology transfer should be dealt with at the international level.\n124.\tMy delegation urges the developed countries to give developing countries access to relevant modern technology at minimum cost and to increase the adoption of that technology for the conditions prevailing in the developing areas. In the longer term the industrialized nations should do their utmost to extend assistance to the developing countries, in terms of research and development, so as to enable them to develop indigenous technology.\n125.\tWhile appreciating the transfer of technology through agencies such as the transnational corporations, my delegation would call on the Assembly to develop codes of conduct to prevent abuses in the activities of such corporations in the development programs of the developing countries.\n126.\tEthiopia has supported and will always support all efforts to discourage and condemn any practice which tends to hinder the free and effective exercise of the rights of every State to full and permanent sovereignty over its natural resources. In this connexion, allow me to express my thanks and those of my delegation to the Group of Eminent Persons to Study the Impact of Multinational Corporations on Development and International Relations, which has made a painstaking study and prepared a number of proposals.1\n127.\tThe need to reform the international monetary system is as urgent as, and no less important than, the need to reform the mechanisms through which foreign aid, trade and the transfer of technology between developed and developing countries are facilitated.\n128.\tThe defects of the present international monetary system and the consequent monetary crisis have adversely affected the development processes of several developing countries, and have accentuated the already difficult economic situations in the developing nations.\n129. In the view of my delegation, the efforts to reform the international monetary system should be based on the principles and objectives contained in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution, 2626 (XXV)). Ethiopia, for. its part, has always urged the' building of an international monetary structure that would promote an equitable system of trade between the developed and the developing countries; as well as the transfer of resources. It is with this in mind that Ethiopia has always attached great significance to the establishment of a link between special drawing rights and the provision ^development finance, assuring the allocation of aid increasing share of the special drawing rights to the developing countries.\n130: It is the hope of my delegation that the present session of the General Assembly will make substantial progress in implementing the Declaration and the Program of Action of the sixth special session of the General Assembly. What is required is good will, courage and action,\n131.\tI hope that my reiteration of Ethiopia's position on many issues will serve to shed some more light on our mutual problems, and that it will confirm the identity of many of our objectives and our resolve to attain them in the interest of our respective nations.\n132.\tIn conclusion, may I respond to the inquiries and expressions of friendly interest made by my esteemed colleagues regarding events in my country and acquaint Members with the facts of the recent peaceful change of government in Ethiopia.\n133.\tThe change of government was brought about by the Co-ordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police and the Territorial Army, without a single shot being fired and in a manner unprecedented in recent political history. The powers of State having been effectively assumed by the Provisional Military Government as of 12 September 1974, peace and tranquility reign throughout Ethiopia.\n134.\tThe national policy of \\\"Ethiopia Tikdem\\\" that is to say, \\\"Ethiopia first\\\" is founded on the principles of unity and equality among all Ethiopians. In its foreign policy Ethiopia will continue to be strictly non-aligned; it will continue to adhere to the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of the Organization of African Unity and will honor all international obligations on the basis of mutual respect and equality; Ethiopia will do everything in its power to help people in colonial Territories in the world in general, and in Africa in particular, to gain their independence; Ethiopia will maintain and further strengthen existing friendly ties with all friendly Governments in the world, and its relations with the African countries and with its neighbors, the Sudan and Egypt -the two nations which most greatly share the waters of the River Nile -and with its other close neighbors, Kenya and Somalia, will be maintained and strengthened.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, before beginning my statement on behalf of the delegation of the Dominican Republic I should like to express in this General Assembly the great sorrow which overwhelms the Government and people of the Dominican Republic at the tragedy which our sister Republic of Honduras is living through. Honduras which; in this period of its history, is making extraordinary efforts to achieve progress on the road towards development, at this time suddenly has to face the violent forces of destiny. There has been practically total destruction as though an apocalyptic hand wanted to plunge it into despair. But that is why we are all here, the sister republics of Honduras, meeting in this international forum so that we may here raise our voices and help in an effective manner the families which are at this time living through terrible anxiety. We express our solidarity with and condolences to Honduras.\n15.\tThe Dominican Republic, which takes pride in being one of the founding Members of the United Nations, has always paid its tribute of faith to the principles of the Organization, which have opened tip new horizons for an international legal order, the structure of whirs > as since its establishment resisted the onslaughts on the circumstances of life of peoples, is pleased to extend to the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, our most cordial good wishes on his election, through the unanimous will of the countries represented here, to allow him to preside over this session and to guide us with his well-known experience and wisdom in the tasks which await us.\n16.\tWe know very well that, as well as having eminent qualifications, he is a patriot determined to bring about the progress of Algeria so as to maintain in the forefront the prestige which it enjoys as a country which loves peace and independence, which has outstanding virtues and is concerned to see that the ideals and principles of the Charter will also contribute to the rule of peace and brotherhood among all peoples. Thus, our delegation is aware that your enlightened mind will assist us to find during this session the most correct solutions to the problems that we shall be dealing with under our agenda, and thus to fulfill the objectives laid down in San Francisco when the United Nations came into being.\n17.\tMr. President, we are certain that you too represent the continuity of that humanistic and universalist philosophy which has been represented here so brilliantly by Mr. Leopoldo Benites, an illustrious son of Ecuador, a man whose impact is already continental and universal.\n18.\tIn the course of the year that has elapsed between the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth sessions of the General Assembly, there have been negative international events which we have had to deplore and which have had repercussions on our Organization, the guiding genius in which the peoples that created it entrusted their major objectives for peace and universal solidarity.\n19.\tYet it is those very events which put to the test the principles of the Charter and the complicated mechanisms available for the attainment of the fundamental objectives. For that reason we must recognize that we must also be convinced that there have been positive events on which the task of the United Nations is nourished.\n20.\tWe must have the hope that the sanctity of nature which is approaching is the foundation of a new beginning, of a new history. Our motto from now on should be: we shall all work. Nothing could give us more encouragement than these wise words of the immortal North American poet Walt Whitman: \\\"If you don't find me at once, don't be discouraged; if I am not there, look for me elsewhere. I am waiting for you. Somewhere I am waiting for you.\\\"\n21.\tAll our peoples are convinced that since the State came into being as a legal concept propelled by the history of civilization up to the present time and since the beginnings of the concept of law, which in America goes back to the \\\"Sunday before Christmas in 1511 when in Santo Domingo the Dominican Antonio de Montesinos delivered a sermon in a church with a cane roof', a revolutionary sermon which he himself called \\\"a voice crying out in the wilderness\\\" and which the immortal Dominican humanist Pedro Henriquez Urena later called \\\"one of the great events of our spiritual history\\\", these concepts have constituted the most astonishing invention which the mind of man could have created to ensure the survival of the human species despite all the destructive forces which very often have threatened to eradicate the little world we live in.\n22.\tThe certainty that we gain from these facts which history and philosophy teach us should be for us and for all the peoples represented in this Organization the supreme factor which encourages us even more to become stronger, to recognize that, while it is true that very often some events have aroused inevitable and convenient criticism and others have been viewed as signs of a weakening in the attainment of our fundamental objectives, it is no less true that in every case the principles have become stronger.\n23.\tNo one can deny that in this century of the atom the horror of war could lead to the destruction of the planet. Our Organization, far from remaining static -although some of its principles have been violated in circumstances which have led some to believe in a crisis of the law- has proved, as has been said, that: \\\"Development of relations among States in the world of today could not be conceived of without a universal organization of the scope of the United Nations. If the United Nations did not exist, we would have to invent it.\\\"\n24.\tBecause of changes in political thinking in a period in history in which our civilization is going through a transition which was already forecast by perhaps unexpected developments and which will change the face of the world, in past years we have expressed similar concepts in response to the quest for constructive solutions; among these we might mention the system of international security and defense.\n25.\tThe fact that we are witnessing quick changes in ideas which require profound revisions in the systems of law among States, and accordingly in the Charter, has been recognized lately, with great vigor and decisiveness, in the Latin American region.\n26.\tHence, the Organization of American States [OAS] in carrying out in-depth studies which have led to drafts for fundamental reforms of the constituent instrument, which will be submitted to the fifth General Assembly to be held in April 1975 and to be preceded by the Consultative Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, to be held in Quito next November. That must be the point of departure for the revitalization and reorganization of the OAS, so that it may continue to serve as an effective instrument for the aspirations to peace, development and integration of the peoples of our continent. This means that in this forum too we have felt the vigorous onslaught of changes in structure which, although they have been correct and effective for a long time, have now been powerfully affected by the new facts of the international procedures, thus confirming the postulate that principles are nothing more than an emanation of necessity .\n27.\tThe Latin American region can be proud at this time that it is testing with useful results -at least so far- an effective instrument which inevitably will be called upon to be more general in international relations. I am referring to the new dialog.\n28.\tWe would like to refer logically to the dialog that started in Bogota within the broadest framework of brotherhood and equality where, with great clarity and sincere frankness , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Latin America decided to hold talks with the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Mr. Henry Kissinger, so as to seek by joint agreement all Latin America united, together with the United States the solution of the most immediate problems of the countries south of the River Bravo. This new dialog was continued in Tlatelolco, in the beautiful capital of Mexico, and later in Washington.\n29.\tWe can point with satisfaction to the spirit of Tlatelolco, as we have called this new dawn of a meeting of minds among Latin American countries, without claiming to lay down standards for other regions of the world, since other problems, such as those which affect other areas in Europe and Asia, may find in a similar policy legal, practical and honorable solutions such as permanent peace in the Middle East and a solution of the Cyprus case, to mention only two striking examples.\n30.\tWith regard to the Third World, it is no bold statement to affirm that one of the causes which regrettably affect respect for human rights, without involving in it the blind crudity of political passions, is forceful measures and the great dissatisfactions aroused by the underdevelopment of peoples, and this is cruder and rougher when it reflects unemployment and poverty which bring about a confrontation between the scant resources available to satisfy these needs and the impossibility of making those resources sufficient.\n31.\tThus we cannot fail to support, as we have supported in the past, in this General Assembly the need which cannot be postponed to give priority to the claims of the countries of the Third World. Even though it cannot be denied that progress has been made in that direction, we must frankly admit that in fact there exists no effective dynamic action for a frontal approach to the problem created by underdevelopment in more than 100 areas of the world in so far as the jurisdiction of the United Nations extends. We therefore advocate the application in this field of the postulate whereby the developed countries of the world have contracted a natural obligation to contribute so that the countries of the Third World may more speedily attain development.\n32.\tThat is the policy drawn by the Charter of Algiers, where the matter was considered in its full, tragic consequences with the recognition, therefore, that it is an undeniable truth that the world of today gyrates around the economy, which is the axis which centralizes all constructive forces, on Which depend the inevitable and changing social developments of peoples, which are so personally linked to the economic developments* that there is not a single activity of social gathering or of man himself, individually, which does not depend on the economic tides which show the alternatives to our present civilization.\n33.\tWith regard to international progress, on the other hand, there are perspectives within the present international situation which lead to the recognition that there is a substantial advance towards progressively normalizing situations which have been of concern to States and peoples and which have prevented agreements which would facilitate and reduce to a minimum the causes that bring about a departure from the line of conduct drawn for permanent peace by the United Nations, within its legal order for all peoples.\n34.\tIt is encouraging to contemplate that some obstacles that had seemed to be insuperable have been removed from the road so as to bring about the essential reconciliation required by the concept of universality, which should govern an organization such as ours which already has welcomed more than 138 sovereign and independent States and will receive into the world family more States in compliance with the principles of the self-determination of peoples and the total decolonization of the world, an event in relation to which all peoples can legitimately consider themselves to be brothers.\n35.\tBecause of the effectiveness which we attach to dialog, in an atmosphere of friendship and equality and constructive frankness, as a method which should be attempted more frequently in the new diplomacy, we have removed certain clouds which shadowed the prospect of a better understanding between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, as well as with the People's Republic of China.\n36.\tWe do not believe that it is going too far to affirm that this has been the result of the fact that confrontation has been followed by a new and sound criterion of negotiation following the best course for men and nations, so that sooner or later all the rough edges which bar the way to international harmony may be made smooth.\n37.\tConcerning the Law of the Sea, two years ago our country had the privilege to be the host for the 1972 Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea. As the result of the deliberations of that important gathering, which was attended by all the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of all the countries of Central America and the Caribbean, a new instrument was drafted, called the Declaration of Santo Domingo.7\n38.\tThe agenda covered many important aspects on that subject, among which we considered the territorial sea and the exploitation and conservation of marine species, as well as the regime for the sea-bed, within our joint geographical circumscription, and we also dealt with concrete aspects of pollution as the merciless enemy of marine fertility.\n39.\tOn that memorable occasion, the idea of the patrimonial sea was stated, the idea of exclusive exploitation not to extend more than 200 miles starting from the base lines.\n40.\tThe results obtained were undeniably positive in effect, and they have had fruitful repercussions at the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Caracas in 1974, on the fascinating subject of the wealth of the sea and its subsoil as a promising way out for the problem raised by shortages of food and of overpopulation, the projections of which are alarming everywhere in the world.\n41.\tIt was a fortunate coincidence that the Specialized Conference, held in Santo Domingo in 1954, on the territorial sea, the continental shelf and exploitation of the wealth of the sea and related matters, suggested as a conflictive contribution the concept of exploitation, which was an advance over the doctrinaire formulations regarding horizontally and vertically as modules within which the rights of the\ncoastal countries adopted in 1954 in the Geneva Conventions should be regulated.\n42.\tThe Dominican Republic therefore has for decades been co-operating for the development and adoption of a new legal regime for the sea. It was with these convictions that we were present at Caracas, and while the Conference there did not arrive at a draft convention on this important subject, which involves the interests of all countries equally, it is no less true that it will make it possible to arrive at final formulations on the points on which no agreement was reached at Caracas, particularly in respect of the criterion of the Dominican Republic that major industrial installations on narrow straits must be the subject of negotiations so as to contribute to the prevention of any kind of pollution.\n43.\tConcerning new States, when we consider the perspective offered by the continuous growth of the United Nations, we must rejoice at the fact that the prophecy that we would arrive at the universality desired by its founders, made when it took its first steps in an uncertain world, has been fulfilled.\n44.\tWe also recognize that this decision on the part of the new States to become Members of the Organization shortly after achieving independence is an unequivocal sign that the Organization is moving forward and that its instruments are effective for the attainment of its objectives, despite changes which occur internally in States and internationally.\n45.\tWith these convictions, our delegation is pleased and honored to welcome Bangladesh, Guinea- Bissau and Grenada. We are certain that, as they were able to win independence, so they will be able to share the common responsibilities of all States Members of the United Nations.\n46.\tI turn now to Panama. It is of great benefit to America that, after the meetings of the Security Council held in the city of Panama, where all the Latin American countries supported the position of Panama in its claims for a revision of the Canal Treaty, and after the visit and the dialog with Mr. Henry Kissinger, negotiations have been started in a spirit of friendship, mutual equality and respect. This is a step forward towards the changes proclaimed in the last international meetings in the Latin American region.\n47. America has started what we have called the new dialog, which we are taking advantage of only to implement, through a practical, coherent and harmonious system and in accordance with the most deeply felt needs, of Latin America, the plans and projects which we need to face the reality of our own situations.\n48. To speak now of a policy for accelerated economic development: at this very hour the countries I of the world are meeting in the highest of the inter' national forums and come here loaded with beautiful illusions and with a series of beautiful formulas backed by arguments which are profoundly convincing but often difficult to translate into reality, and require that at this time we frankly and honestly put a stop to the uncontrolled outpouring of projects, plans and programs, many of which have failed to provide the expected results.\n49.\tWe are going to make a sincere suggestion to the countries that are gathered here, particularly to the countries of Latin America. Basically we suggest that we should seek a mechanism or the mechanisms necessary for the true, ultimate development of our peoples.\n50.\tIn these times much is said about the population explosion, which has given rise to great discussions and important meetings, such as the World Population Conference held at Bucharest from 19 to 30 August 1974. FAO met in Panama not long ago to speak about the need to increase agricultural production. In Yugoslavia, from 16 to 22 of this month, the second round-table was held on agro-industry. Much is said of the need to obtain investments for the principal industries and, above all, much is said about the energy crisis and about inflation as one of the problems which have absorbed all mankind in recent times.\n51.\tWe cannot deny that the apparently disproportionate rise in prices brought about by the petroleum-producing countries lies at the root of the dis-concerting runaway inflation which shakes to its very foundations the culture of super-consumption and the relative prosperity maintained up to now. The drama of the situation is clear when we compare the prices of some commodities: a metric ton of corn in 1972 cost $51; in January 1974 it rose to $122. The price of wheat which, In large measure, is a world food staple, rose from $60 per metric ton in 1972 to $214 in January 1974. Rice, which is one of the products of highest consumption in the underdeveloped countries, rose alarmingly from $131 per metric ton in January 1972 to $538 in January of this year.\n52.\tThe ominous consequences of this dramatic economic process have had the most catastrophic and desperate impact on the poorest countries, where hunger and malnutrition have killed millions and millions of human beings and will do vast harm to future generations, since the infant mortality rate of the poor countries attained its highest point during the year 1973, which surely history will baptize the year of malnutrition and human wretchedness.\n53.\tDespite these tacts, we realize that the process seems to be irreversible. That is why we are convinced, and we wish to make this known to this Assembly, that the means of solving our problems is the rational and intensive exploitation of our soil and at the same time the industrialization of its products, our goal being to attain maximum productivity.\n54.\tThis policy will of necessity lead us to use the most modern agricultural tools and equipment and the most advanced technical methods in the administration of production, industrialization and marketing programs for agrarian products and, together with agrarian reform, would complement the integral development of Latin America.\n55.\tIt is necessary to incorporate into our development plans the concept of agro-industry, which calls for industries to be established where; agriculture is being practiced, so as to bring to our agricultural peoples not only the possibility of taking part in enterprises which would ensure them a fixed income, social security, bonuses, old-age pensions, and so on, but also an opportunity to educate their children, to change their habits and to raise their standard of living, which bears no comparison with the standard of living of the urban workers, who enjoy high salaries and relative equality of opportunity.\n56.\tThis policy is different from the policy of import substitution, which leads to an industry without a capacity for innovation and is always underdeveloped. It obliges economic integration to start with micro-economic units forming part of a harmonious scheme, until they can be molded into a single body able to generate the necessary energy to satisfy every need with the greatest possible social justice. It would furthermore be a rational method of halting the great migration of people from the rural areas to the urban centers, attracted by the illusion of a nonexistent industrial development.\n57.\tIt has been said that an integrated agro-industry is a modern enterprise aiming to industrialize one of the most ancient and most important activities of mankind. Hence it is not new; it is the clear and objective definition of its goals that is new, as is also the certainty that it constitutes an effective and fundamental mechanism for a genuine solution to our problems.\n58.\tThe world is today facing one of the gravest crises ever recorded in the history of mankind, and that is the disproportion between food production and world population growth. There are even large areas of the world where agricultural production has decreased substantially in the past years.\n59.\tThe essential reason for this almost general deficit in agricultural production is. fundamentally based on the lack of a clear policy which would motivate man and lead him to work his soil in the social conditions required by the world today, such as the technology, the training and administration, the financing and marketing, so that the optimum yield\nmay be obtained from the soil.\n60.\tIt is no accident that cane sugar was, has been and will continue to be one of the main substances of the economic process of the Dominican Republic, and that the manner in which it is sown, harvested and processed is industrial, with a high degree of technology -this is one of the spheres where man has been able to produce raw materials at the lowest prices. Cane sugar and its industrial processing constitute a powerful agro-industry in many of our countries, which allow for effective agricultural and industrial yields for the economies of our people.\n61.\tThe man in the field must have in his hands the necessary means to extract the highest yields from nature. Nature, which is wise, has always had its own mechanisms, and since the very beginning of mankind there have always been, although not in the dramatic proportions of today, population growth and production deficit. And today all that we men have achieved has been to create some of the necessary elements for a precarious subsistence for the vast majority of our peoples.\n62.\tThat is why we make an appeal from this inter-national forum so that all countries, and in particular the Latin American countries, may consider the adoption of this policy, since Latin America is the area of the greatest hope of the world. It is the area of the world which is least exploited, where the land has not yet been worked technically, where the man in the field constitutes 70 per cent of our population of 300 million inhabitants today, and it is the region that could become one of the most productive areas of the world.\n63.\tRegrettably, so far most economic policies in our area have been circumscribed to the mere subsistence of the individual. Few times and in few countries has any thought been given to or action taken of heroic proportions to face our ills.\n64.\tWe are totally convinced of the effectiveness of the system of agrarian reform, because in our country, which has a territory of barely 48,070 square kilometers, in the last eight years, under the administration of the constitutional government of Mr. Joaquin Balaguer, thousands and thousands of families have achieved a substantial increase in their agricultural production. But if we were to create the concept of the manager of the field and make of it a reality, \\\"a manager and man from the city in the field\\\", possibly the social mutation that would occur in our countries would have highly positive repercussions for future generations, because if the man of the city were to go to the field and set himself up with a large enterprise, in a constitutionally legal manner, as was done in the Dominican Republic, the land would become the property of the one who cultivated it, with laws for minimum salary, social security benefits and other kinds of benefits for workers in the field, like the treatment accorded workers in the city; then migrations towards urban centers would be reduced and small countries, such as mine, for example, could relatively easily become societies where all the men who work in the field, would have electricity, television sets, refrigerators and all the advances of modern times, together with fresh air and the beauty of nature.\n65.\tObviously the State must provide these managers with the necessary resources, such as the required infrastructure, so that the execution of these projects follows standards of productivity, with a minimum of expenditures, as incentives for the development of managerial skills of this kind.\n66.\tIt is also vital for international institutions such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank to intensify their actions so that this type of undertaking may serve the purposes sought.\n67.\tTwo decades ago the world had an eminently political criterion. Today the criterion is eminently economic. The most obvious proof is how world policy has changed because of the surprising rise in oil prices and the under development of such countries as Brazil and Venezuela, which have now attained some of the highest production levels and some of the highest standards of living ever recorded in their history by those great and powerful South American nations.\n68.\tMost of the countries of Latin America have suffered a great ill, and there is no more important forum than the General Assembly of the United Nations for us to carry out our own self-criticism. And this great ill is the legendary tendency to live by asking for help from the powerful, at a risk of undermining the self-determination of our people, to find ways for the powerful to help us, while we maintain an attitude almost of indifference, and not just of collective irresponsibility, expecting others to do things for us, instead of facing our problems with our own intelligence, our own resources and our own means.\n69.\tThe world of today -and absolutely no one disputes this-is made up of a series of independent States with interdependent economies. It is now clear that all the key economic factors must be assessed, both in relation to their national repercussions as well as their international repercussions. It is only in our times that the world leaders seem to have become fully aware of the importance of what has been called economic interdependence. As an expert on economics at Harvard University, Professor Raymond Bermond, said: \\\"Suddenly sovereign States feel naked. Concepts of national sovereignty and a national economic potential seem to be curiously lacking in meaning.\\\"\n70.\tWe wish to emphasize that perhaps the most curious aspect of this new development of interdependence is that the reactions that have been aroused have followed no foreseeable standard. Few developed or developing countries seem to know how to deal with this. Some consider this as coercion and others consider it as an opportunity. But there is complete agreement only in assuring that interdependence is a fact and that it would seem that in certain circumstances it may represent an unprecedented opportunity for development and prosperity.\n71.\tHowever, we cannot ignore the fact that, unless we achieve genuine and integral development in our peoples, interdependence will come to an end, and we shall go back to the humiliating and anachronistic dependence which violates the most elementary 'principles of the integrity of our State.\n72.\tTo strengthen this thesis and so that we may be conscious of the fact that all that we have stated here is absolutely feasible, we need do no more than read articles 29, 30 and part of 31 of the Charter of the Organization of American States, as amended by the Protocol of Buenos Aires, of 27 February 1967,3 which state the following:\n\\\"Article 29. The Member States, inspired by the principles of inter-American solidarity and co-operation, pledge themselves to a united effort to ensure social justice in the Hemisphere and dynamic and balanced economic development for their peoples, as conditions essential -to peace and security.\n\\\"Article 30. The Member States pledge them-selves to mobilize their own national human and material resources through suitable programs, and recognize the importance of operating within an efficient domestic structure, as fundamental conditions for their economic and social progress and for assuring effective inter-American co-operation.\n\\\"Article 31. To accelerate their economic and social development, in accordance with their own methods and procedures and within the framework of the democratic principles and the institutions of the inter-American system, the Member\nStates agree to dedicate every effort to achieve the following basic goals:\n\\\"(a) Substantial and self-sustained increase in the per capita national product;\n\\\"(b) Equitable distribution of national income;\n\\\"(c) Adequate and equitable systems of taxation;\n\\\"(d) Modernization of rural life and reforms leading to equitable and efficient land- tenure systems, increased agricultural productivity, expanded use of undeveloped land, diversification of production; and improved processing and marketing systems for agricultural products; and the strengthening and expansion of facilities to attain these ends;\n\\\"(e) Accelerated and diversified industrialization, especially of capital and intermediate goods;\n\\\"(f) Stability in the domestic price levels, compatible with sustained economic development and the attainment of social justice;\n\\\"(g) Fair wages, employment opportunities, and acceptable working conditions for all;\n73.\tWe are aware that the analysis that we have thought agro-industry deserves does not require so much attention by the countries which, benefiting from the wealth of the subsoil, have been able to make up for some of the poverty with other structures where an extraction industry mobilizes large amounts of capital and thereby have obtained an accelerated course towards development and self-sufficiency.\n74.\tIf we, the peoples of America, are to achieve and bring to a happy conclusion and concrete reality the programs for agricultural development and industrialization, we shall all of us see our efforts crowned with glory and the efforts of those illustrious statesmen who, with their brave deeds and their glories and the courage of their peoples and the firmness with which they have brandished their swords, gave us our freedom and thereby the right to go on promising and attaining the establishment of a just society where slavery will never exist, nor servility nor dependence.\n75.\tOn behalf of my delegation, permit me to pay a tribute to peace, which is the supreme objective of the United Nations, on the MQittient of whose principles the destiny of mankind depends more than ever today. Peace is all the more hidden when we most seek it. It most hides when it is best loved. It is most confused when it is nearest. It is most sacred When it is distant. It is most radiant when it is denied.\n76.\tThe great geniuses of political thinking of antiquity and of modern times have tried to define peace within its philosophical vastness. Let me here, however, simply state the theological thinking of St. Augustine, who said:\n\\\"The peace of men is orderly concord; peace at \nhome is agreed uniformity among those in authority and those who obey and live in it; peace in the city is the orderly concord of citizens and neighbors in ruling and obeying; peace in all things is tranquility in order, and order is nothing more than a disposition of equal and unequal things, which gives to each its proper place.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, first I should like to extend my warmest congratulations to you upon your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Your long experience as Foreign Minister of your country, your outstanding personality, recognized by everyone who knows you, your dynamism and indeed, there is no need to conceal it your youth, combined as it is with knowledge and ability, all these things are a guarantee to us of your success in the arduous task which you have just assumed and will give a new impetus to our deliberations. It is also a particular pleasure for me to recall here that the Turkish and Algerian peoples cherish mutual feelings of fraternity and esteem which go back very far into history. We would also like to greet you as the representative of a country which has become one of the symbols of the awakening of the African continent. I would add that the excellent relations between Turkey and the group of countries you represent here only serve to add to our satisfaction.\n103.\tI would also like to express my warm gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, Permanent Representative of Ecuador to the United Nations, who so diligently discharged his functions.\n104.\tWe would also like to thank the Secretary General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who has spared no effort to maintain peace in such a turbulent period in international life.\n105.\tWe are also glad to join in welcoming the new Members of the Organization, the Republics of Bangladesh, GuineaBissau and Grenada. Each of these countries belongs, to a great continent namely, Asia, Africa and Latin America, respectively. We are convinced that the entry of these new Members into the United Nations constitutes a further step towards the realization of universality in the Organization.\n106.\tThe presence here of GuineaBissau, as it emerges from a remarkable struggle of independence, is, in our view, the manifestation of a new order, whereas that of Bangladesh is a sign of the peaceful conditions that now obtain on the Asian subcontinent owing to the agreement reached with Pakistan after a fratricidal confrontation. Grenada has joined our family as the result of a process which for some time now has enriched the United Nations every year with a new contribution from the Caribbean region.\n107.\tWe have learned with great distress of the catastrophe that occurred in Honduras, and that has caused countless loss of human life and considerable material damage. On behalf of my Government, I would like here to state that we fully share their feelings of sorrow and we have the greatest and deepest sympathy with the people of Honduras.\n108.\tIt is almost a custom in this Assembly at each session to undertake a general survey of developments that have occurred in the world political arena since the previous session. I have no intention of breaking with this custom, but I shall try to be as brief as I can in this area so that I can subsequently go into further detail on some subjects which, in our view, are of a rather more special character.\n109.\tNevertheless, I do feel it useful at the outset to say a few words to define the particular position of my country, in order better to highlight its foreign policy and its attitude towards the major international problems. Situated on the. borders of both Asia and Europe, having more than half a century ago set the first example of a war of independence, enjoying cultural and historical relations with the countries of the Middle East, seeking to resolve our own problems within the framework of a democratic system, having been obliged, as a result of the circumstances of our time, to take its place within systems of collective defense, having no territorial claims, but requiring that this same attitude be adopted by others Turkey is pursuing a foreign policy that is the result of all these factors. In the pursuit of this policy, outlined already by Atatiirk on the basis of the fundamental rules of international law and confirmed once again when Turkey endorsed the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, our country has shown remarkable continuity and constancy, even through periods of tremendous international upheaval.\n110.\tHaving made this point, I would like now to turn to some current international problems. The international scene today encourages us neither to excessive optimism nor to despairing pessimism. This is the reason why I will opt for realism, a realism full of hope, goodwill and benevolence, as is prompted and indeed required by the policy pursued by my country for half a century.\n111.\tThe most marked development of the last decade has been, in our view, the detente between East and West. Much has been said by previous speakers from this rostrum about the origins and development, the advantages and risks of detente. The ideas that have been put forward, while not identical, have at least been similar. That is why I shall confine myself to stressing a few points which seem to me essential.\n112.\tFirst, there is no denying the fact that in the East, as in the West, there seems now to be a full understanding that no discord, no situation, no matter how disastrous, can possibly be more so than a general conflagration.\n113.\tSecondly, detente, which constitutes a stage on the way to the establishment, between East and West and particularly in Europe, of a more stable order that will be more humanitarian and freer from anxiety about war, should not be considered as anything but a means, and not as an end in itself. Its final objective should be true peace based upon understanding and conciliation. Detente should be merely a stage on the way to this goal.\n114.\tThirdly, it should be pointed out that for the first time in contemporary history, if I am not mistaken, three international negotiations have taken place simultaneously to strengthen detente in its broadest sense. This, in my view, is an event worth stressing.\n115.\tOn the subject of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which my country is playing a full part, we feel that this Conference constitutes an important stage in the process of detente, that it will contribute to the efforts of understanding and cooperation and that it will establish a climate of mutual security. On this occasion I would like to add that, in our view, European security cannot be considered in isolation from that of the Mediterranean and the surrounding countries.\n116.\tWith regard to the negotiations on the mutual reduction of forces and armaments in Central Europe, in which Turkey is participating with a special status, my country, on the basis of the idea that security, like detente, is one and indivisible, was particularly in favor of the view that the measures to be taken with regard to forces and armaments in Central Europe should in no way compromise the security of other countries.\n117.\tWith regard to the negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms which are taking place in Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union, we can say that they are only bilateral and commit only those two countries. The fact none the less remains that the scope of these negotiations is not just of interest to the future of those two countries but is of concern also to the destiny of the entire international community. It is with this comment in mind and in this context that we view the new phase of these negotiations which have just begun a few days ago.\n118.\tDisarmament is, without any doubt, one of the most important questions of the day. Turkey is convinced that it is one of the fundamental elements in the establishment of an equitable international peace and a system of common security. My country feels that, to ensure the establishment of this order, a disarmament program can be applied only under effective international control, embracing both nuclear weapons and conventional weapons. Within this framework Turkey also gives a favorable welcome to the various collateral measures designed to hasten general and complete disarmament, and it is within this framework that we are studying and will continue to study favorably and attentively all proposals put forward or which may be put forward in this field by various countries.\n119.\tA conference on a world scale recently took place on the law of the sea. As my country is a peninsula three quarters of which is surrounded by sea and has more than 7,000 kilometers of coastline, it was quite natural for Turkey to take an active part in the deliberations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas throughout the past summer. Some progress was marked at that Conference, particularly with regard to the simplification and clarification of the most important problems before it.\n120.\tIn this area we should not lose sight of the fact that the geographical configuration of each part of the Earth is different from that of the others. Consequently, instead of tackling the problem from a uniform or, rather, abstract standpoint, it is indispensable to deal with this subject from a standpoint which, first, will take into account the needs of mankind and also will take full account of the special circumstances and the particular geographical, geological and other features of each region. Thus we sincerely hope that humanity will avoid repeating in the case of the seas and oceans the mistakes which were committed when attempts were being made to resolve the problems of the land.\n121.\tThe task awaiting the next meeting of the Conference is certainly a very difficult one, and it is to be hoped that the data submitted to it will be dealt with in such a way that new questions will not arise for certain regions as long as the old ones remain unresolved.\n122.\tWe have come a long way since the time when the man in the street, or even the man seated comfortably in his armchair, had no interest in what was happening at the other end of the world or even in a neighboring country. Happily things are quite different today. High speeds and considerably increased networks and diversified means of telecommunication, with the expanded possibilities of the mass media, certainly have played a large part in this. But what have been even more important, surely, are the feelings of responsibility and international solidarity which have entrenched themselves more and more deeply within the hearts of the most advanced and the most prosperous nations. This, however, leads me to the rather bitter observation that in spite of this development, there are still millions of human beings living under foreign domination who cannot find enough to eat. This \\\"foreign domination\\\" is not just a political and juridical notion, because at times it also has economic connotations, In a word, colonialism and poverty continue to exist in this world which is technically so advanced and which does have a few sufficiently rich nations in it.\n123.\tOn the subject of colonialism, the attitude of my country could not be clearer: the Republic of Turkey, itself being born of a war of independence and having thus set so successfully the first example of an anti-imperialist war, has defended and will always continue to defend the cause of peoples fighting for their independence. That is why the Turkish Government so warmly welcomed the change of policy which has occurred in Portugal with regard to its \\\"former Territories\\\" in Africa. We would like to congratulate the Portuguese Government on its decision concerning the independence of the Republic of GuineaBissau and also the Lusaka Agreement, which opens the way to the total independence of Mozambique. We have every reason to hope that the same process will be swiftly applied to Angola.\n124.\tHowever, there has been hardly any change in the situation prevailing in Zimbabwe and in Namibia. Turkey is one of the active members of the United Nations Council for Namibia, and has been ever since its inception, and considers that the Council is surely going to become more effective as a result of the unanimous cooperation of the international community and the increase in the number of its members.\n125.\tAs for the minority regime still prevailing in Southern Rhodesia, its adoption of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony by Beethoven, who was one of humanity's 'great geniuses, as the national anthem, shows that that country is still hoping to lull others to sleep with this music by taking it as a kind of cradle song which will send no one to sleep except itself and will succeed in concealing nothing from mankind.\n126.\tMy country continues to condemn apartheid in all its forms, and particularly its inhumane application in South Africa. I would like to add, Mr. President, that your presence in the* presidential seat this year, a year when we have seen the last vestiges of colonialism crumble, is something which will surely add much weight and liveliness to debates on this question, since you belong to a country which has waged an exemplary struggle for independence.\n127.\tOn the subject of the so called underdeveloped countries and the aid which should be given to them, I shall be more laconic. My colleagues pointed out to me a few days ago the following sentence in a daily paper known for its objectivity and seriousness: \\\"One thousand billion French francs are spent each year on the arms race and 35 billion for public assistance to the underdeveloped countries\\\".\n128.\tYes, a thousand billion for armaments and 35 billion for poor people. These two figures say a great deal about what is being done without wisdom and about what could be done if people were a little wiser. In our view, no weapon is more dangerous than hunger and poverty, which threaten a large part of the peoples of the world; we feel that it is in this spirit that attention should be focused on a better utilization of resources.\n129.\tHere I cannot but recall some words of the great founder of our Republic, Kemal Atatiirk, who said a long time ago: \\\"If we want a durable peace, we must take international steps to improve the situation of the masses. \\\"The prosperity of the whole of mankind must replace starvation and oppression.\\\"\n130.\tInternational economic questions, however, still loom large, casting a shadow on the work of this session of the General Assembly in spite of the special session on the subject held last April.\n131.\tDevelopments in the economic area in recent years have become so complex that the classic, conventional economy cannot find any solutions for them. The indecision which continues to prevail concerning monetary problems and the rapid expansion of accelerated inflation pose enormous difficulties for all developing countries, whose resources and economic possibilities are limited. Even countries which are relatively little affected by these developments, or those which do not yet seem to be feeling their effects, cannot escape the consequences of a general economic collapse.\n132.\tThe famine which has afflicted the countries of the SudanoSahelian region and Ethiopia, and also the surrounding countries, as a result of the drought, is a serious warning that solutions to the problem of the general lack of food must be sought. In this context the shortage of chemical fertilizer and the price increases affecting production which have occurred this year show the need for a far reaching solution. Consequently, we await with hope the results of the World Food Conference to be held in Rome next November. We also note with satisfaction the results of the World Population Conference, held in Bucharest last August, given the very close link between the question of food and that of population.\n133.\tThe present situation is no longer a problem affecting only certain countries. It is manifesting itself in a form which requires global solutions. The slowing down in the rate of development of industrialized countries signals a dangerous trend for the world economy. The reduction in the rate of rehabilitation of the developing countries can only render even more difficult the efforts aimed at eliminating hunger and poverty. The problem is to ensure a redistribution of wealth and resources.\n134.\tIt is necessary to increase the share of the developing countries a group which includes Turkey in world economic activity and to contribute towards the establishment of an economic order which would give the people of these countries the opportunity to live as they should. We therefore welcome and support the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, since it establishes the principles of a future economic order. In this spirit, we should also like to welcome the positive developments which have occurred with regard to the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. We also hope that the special session of the General Assembly to study the problems of development, envisaged for next year, will succeed in adopting concrete measures to establish this order.\n135.\tThe results of the sixth special session of the General Assembly, which met on the initiative of President Boumediene of Algeria, give us ground for hoping that under your aegis, Mr. President, the next special session will be successful.\n136.\tI shall now turn to certain problems liable to have a much wider impact, indeed a global impact problems which at first sight , seem to be of direct interest to a small number of countries or to be regional in character but which, in fact, are still unresolved.\n137.\tI should like to talk about the Middle East first. The conflict in the Middle East has long constituted one of the standing items on the agenda of the General Assembly. Turkey, a country of that region having abundant traditional, historic and spiritual ties with the nations of the area, has had a constantly growing interest in the development of this question. This conflict from time to time reaches culminating points which are liable to lead to a military confrontation between the great Powers and thus endanger world peace, as was the case with the 1973 October war.\n138.\tAt the present time we do feel relative satisfaction at the signing of the disengagement agreements on the two fronts. We should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the leaders of the countries directly involved on their wisdom and their spirit of conciliation. We should also like to congratulate the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, who by his tireless efforts has contributed to such a large extent to the conclusion of these agreements. We also wish to welcome the spirit of conciliation shown in this respect by the two great Powers.\n139.\tNevertheless, in spite of these military disengagement agreements, major problems remain to be solved. Egyptian, Jordanian and Syrian territories are still under occupation.The Palestinian people, which has been suffering for a quarter of a century, still remains deprived of its legitimate rights and interests. My country has from the very beginning supported the Palestinian cause. We are gratified that this year the question is a special 'item of the agenda, and we have high hopes for the outcome of the debate to be held on this subject, and shall follow it with great attention.\n140.\tThe military disengagement agreements on the two fronts, Which have resulted in the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops, in our view do not constitute anything but a first step towards the evacuation of the occupied Arab territories and the recognition of the legitimate rights are interests of the Palestinian people. Furthermore, with regard to Jerusalem I should like to reaffirm here that Turkey, whose policy has always been opposed to faits accomplis, can accept no fait accompli with regard to the status of that city.\n141.\tOn the subject of the Middle East, I have just stressed that the foreign policy of Turkey is based above all on pacifism and is against faits accomplis. I should like to add that by its very nature, the Turkish nation not only does not support oppression but indeed is always on the side of the oppressed, as we have so often demonstrated in this very Organization. That inevitably leads me to talk about the grave problem of Cyprus.\n142.\tI shall explain briefly to the Assembly Turkey's attitude towards this question by summarizing what I have already had occasion to say in various places and at various times. Turkey has spared no effort to And a peaceful solution to this problem by negotiations, interrupted from time to time, between the two national communities. These negotiations have lasted for more than 10 years without leading to any concrete results, indeed, to any results at all. In the meantime, Turkey has constantly had to face faits accomplis of increasingly serious scope, particularly since 1963. The most recent and the most serious of these faits accomplis was, as we all know, that of 15 July last: a foreign Power undertook a coup d'etat which it had long been fomenting and the purpose of which was to annex the island.\n143.\tNow, Cyprus constitutes an essential element not only in the balance already established by the Treaty of Peace signed at Lausanne on 24 July 1923 by Turkey and Greece, but also, by the nature of its international status, of stability and peace in the Eastern Mediterranean and in the Middle East region. Any action or intervention jeopardizing the independence and territorial integrity of the island consequently is inevitably a breach of this balance and a danger to peace in the region . We are surrounded in this area by friendly and fraternal countries, for whose security we are as attentive as for our own, and we certainly do not want to change the balance there a balance which has been so difficult to preserve because we do not want to do any damage to that security. That is why my country has always attached vital importance to the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and international status of Cyprus. Respect for the international status of the island constitutes for us a fundamental element of our foreign policy and is an integral part of our own security. I therefore formally and solemnly deny all the lies that our detractors have spread in the corridors of diplomacy with regard to Turkish policy vis-a-vis theCypriot State.\n144.\tOne of the principal guarantees if hot the only guarantee of this status consists in the recognition of, and respect for, rights based upon the equality of the two national communities that constitute the State of Cyprus. Neither of those two national communities may impose its will on the internal structure of the State or claim to represent that State in international organizations.\n145.\tIf, following the coup d'etat of 15 July last, Turkey, after having sought put all opportunities for contact and consultation and having exhausted all means of negotiation, undertook an operation on the island, it was precisely for the purpose of restoring order, putting an end to chaos and averting any intervention aimed at annexing the island. The operation undertaken by Turkey thus in no way signifies and I wish to stress this point an occupation or annexation of a part of the island. It was not an occupation; quite the contrary, it was an operation designed to prevent an occupation.\n146.\tI must emphasize once again that Turkey continues to believe, for its part, that the negotiations will be resumed within an appropriate framework, making it possible to achieve a speedy solution that will put an end to the sufferings of the two national communities in the island and relax the tensions that are hindering the maintenance of peace and security not only in the island but also in the entire area.\n147.\tI should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute also to the countries that have contributed to the efforts of the United Nations on the island in the field for the maintenance of peace and security.\n148.\tThe problem of Cyprus is too serious to be turned into a subject of polemics for domestic purposes. That is the reason why I did not want to go back, in my statement, to the past, or to speak about the piecemeal extermination to which for more than 10 years the Turkish community has been subjected. I intend to continue in this course and I shall refrain from replying to my colleague, Mr. Mavros, in the tone that he used yesterday evening [2239th meeting]. But I should be remiss in my duty to seek a peaceful and friendly outcome to the crisis that now disturbs us, were I to fail to correct certain allegations or to bring out into the open the intentions that some seek to conceal from world public opinion.\n149.\tMy colleague, Mr. Mavros, said in his statement yesterday that the coup d'etat of 15 July was not carried out against the TurkishCypriot community. Does he mean by this that the coup d'etat was quite harmless and disturbed no one, and that therefore it should not have called for any reaction from anyone at all? I am merely making a note of that.\n150.\tThe coup d'etat of 15 July was directed precisely against the Turkish community and was directly aimed at the annexation of the island to Greece. If Mr. Mavros wishes to see proof of this, I need only quote Archbishop Makarios. In an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on 18 September, he said, and I quote his exact words:\n\\\"General Ioannides has had a personal grudge against me ever since 19631964, at the time when he was a member of the Greek contingent in Cyprus. Through Mr. Nikos Sampson, he requested and obtained a secret meeting with me. At the Archbishop's residence where the conversation took place, he submitted to me a plan involving a general attack against the Turkish community of the island, an attack that would have made it possible to bring about enosis. I indignantly rejected his plan.\\\"\nThat is what Mr. Makarios said,\n151.\tMy Greek colleague has not forgotten, surely, that his Government followed and this was to a certain extent due to the events then taking place  the Government that was in the hands of Ioannides, and that this coup d'etat in Greece brought ill famed Sampson to power.\n152.\tI am therefore still wondering how Makarios could have indignantly rejected that proposal. After all, it was very much in keeping with his profoundest desires. What is more, he has never made a secret of it. In fact, on 20 September 1964, Makarios stated, in the Washington Post: \\\"For my part, I wish to be something more significant than the temporary President of Cyprus. My ambition is to have my name go down in history as that of the architect of enosis.\\\"\n153.\tMore recently, in 1970, in interviews granted to Independent Television and the British Broadcasting Corporation, the * Archbishop repeated: \\\"If enosis cannot be achieved at the present time, its objective remains unchanged.\\\"\n154.\tAnd finally, last May the Archbishop reminded us, through the Frankfurter Rundschau, that: \\\"If he had a free choice between independence and enosis, he would support enosis.\\\"\n155.\tWas it the independence of the island that Makarios claimed he was safeguarding? Was it the policy of nonalignment of the State of Cyprus? Mr. Mavros said a great deal at the previous meeting about that policy of nonalignment. I should have liked to be able to congratulate him for the respect he shows for the policy of a large number of countries in this Assembly. But I very much fear that this was not his intention. The nonaligned countries are too numerous in this august Assembly, and my colleague intends rather to beg their support as he poses as the standard bearer of that policy, to conceal, for the time being, the policy of enosis.\n156.\tThe Republic of Cyprus as an independent State would long ago have disappeared if the resolute opposition of Turkey and the resistance of the Turkish community of the island had not prevented enosis, that is to say the annexation, pure and simple, of the island to Greece.\n157.\tTo safeguard the independence of the island and see that its policy is respected, there is only one thing to be done, and that is to condemn any attempt at enosis or at partition of the island any attempt that has been made in the past and any attempt that may be made in the future. On behalf of the Turkish Government, I condemn any idea of partition, whether in the past or in the future, and I look for the same condemnation of the idea of enosis from the Greek Government. Without that, we shall never be so simpleminded as to believe what we are told here. And I shall continue to wait for the answer to my proposal from the Greek leaders.\n158.\tI have not, however, finished correcting all the false allegations and baseless charges made by my colleague. I reserve the right to do so when we speak on this matter before the General Assembly. My Greek colleague's speech, unfortunately, shows the nature of the atmosphere in which the debate will take place on the future of the two communities, Turkish and Greek, in the island. It is not by letting ourselves be carried away by his style, or with any thought of outbidding each other in national or international public opinion that we shall succeed in finding a solution that is just, equitable and realistic or that we shall assist the two communities to live in peace and why not say so? in brotherhood, side by side, in the same State, forgetting the painful past and looking only towards the future.\n159. Before concluding, I should like once again to say that Turkey, situated as it is by geography at the crossroads of civilizations and also of confrontations, is striving, for its part, to play its proper role in bringing peace among nations and groups of nations and happiness and wellbeing to mankind. It is a privilege and an honor to be able to reaffirm that in this Assembly, which is doing so much for the peace and prosperity of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "The pride and military superiority of some nations have led them not only to the conquest and domination of others, but also to the shameful exploitation of apparently defenseless people. But, in a resurgence of dignity and with a thirst for justice for all time, the peoples of the world, whatever their degree of development or their color, have said no to the colonial yoke, and to injustice in all its forms.\n157.\tFrom its very beginnings, mankind has known deadly wars because of men who place their selfish interests above those of the international community and who invent systems or regimes intended to perpetuate injustice in the world. Against those anachronistic regimes, people who love peace, justice and freedom must wage a relentless war so that man will be reconciled with man and all the peoples of the world be free and finally emerge from the nightmare of war, so as to devote themselves to the task of building a new society based on freedom and justice, in a world rid of colonialism and imperialism, the ill deeds of which weigh on international relations throughout the world.\n158.\tIn Africa, a large part of that continent, full of vitality and hope, is still plunged in a sombre reign of violence and exploitation of millions of human beings who are persecuted solely because of the color of their skin. Under our eyes, and with our complicity or our complacence, the most elementary rights are trampled under foot by an illegitimate regime based on racism, apartheid and colonialism. \n159.\tNot far from Africa, and with the blessing of certain Powers, signatories of the Charter of the United Nations, which declare themselves to be the defenders of freedom and dignity in the world, an entire peaceful people has been expelled from its homeland and lives without shelter. The Palestinian people, ever since the artificial creation of the State of Israel, has been living a tragedy which does not seem to prick the conscience of mankind at all. Some people even deny them the right to come out in the open and to appeal to international solidarity. Yet oil causes a great deal of ink to flow and, it seems, deprives some of the great men of this world of some hours of sleep. The Middle East, the Mediterranean and Indochina are still the scenes of wars created by the antagonisms of world hegemonies, which are responsible for much human suffering.\n160.\tThe military arsenals of the great Powers are competing in the stockpiling of weapons, while the States of the third world live in the fear of war; while they suffer shameful economic exploitation or live in the devastation caused by natural calamities, other countries toss into the sea the surpluses of their opulence.\n161.\tThe political and economic situation of the present world presents a spectrum which reflects broad and profound changes, the rays of which give rise to concerns but also to horizons of hope.\n162.\tDespite the complexity of contemporary history, man intends to guide his course towards the total liberation of peoples which are called upon to act in concert in this era of interdependence. It is for this purpose that every year heads of State and Government, ministers, those responsible for administration, scientists, men of letters as well as other eminent personalities travel long distances and personally come to this most distinguished rostrum to denounce the current injustices in the world and to propose remedies to the present situation which bears the seeds of destruction but which also offers hope and survival because of certain victories at which we must rejoice.\n163.\tThe General Assembly, at.its twenty-ninth session, is called upon to deal with these various problems which I have mentioned above all, decolonization, the war in the Middle East and in Indochina, the economic crisis of which our States are all victims and, finally, the need for international co-operation to remedy present problems.\n164.\tThe international community is at an important turning-point not only because of the breadth and number of the issues to be dealt with but also because of the revolutionary determination of the peoples, who are prepared to fight and even to shed their blood to attain their independence and achieve their happiness by developing their own riches. To attain these objectives, the peoples represented in this forum needed a statesman who represented these ideals and who could guide and lead our work successfully. Aware of its responsibilities, the Assembly, at its present session, chose for its President a person who, because he is an undoubted international figure, has become the candidate of us all. The unanimous election of Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria for more than 10 years, is of the highest significance. It represents a tribute paid to the enlightened policy of Mr. Houari Boumediene, President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria and current President of the non-aligned countries. This happy choice is a victory for Africa and for the Arab world, for the non-aligned movement and for all the countries which love peace, justice and freedom: It is an endorsement by the international community of the brilliant qualities and the great competence which have always distinguished Algerian statesmen, and of their great experience, superior intelligence and diplomatic skill in the conduct of international affairs. By the wise choice of this great personality, we have not only reflected the importance of the problems before this session, but we also wished to hail the highly positive record of the Organization, which has benefited from valuable co-operation from Algeria.\n165.\tAllow me, therefore, to acknowledge the successes achieved by the Organization due to the fore- sightedness and contribution of our Algerian brothers and the enlightened direction of its leaders.\n166.\tMy country has inscribed in the annals of the history of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries the important decisions of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers in 1973,8 which gave the non- aligned countries an economic and social charter which is at the basis of the declaration and the establishment of a new international economic order adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly, on the problems of raw materials and development.\n167.\tThe fact that the international community has become aware mangers for mankind of Israel's policy of aggression and annexation is, in our view, another important event in international relations.\n168.\tIt was with great satisfaction too that the Re-public of Burundi welcomed the victories of the peoples of Indochina, to which the non-aligned countries give unshakable support against imperialist aggression and occupation.\n169.\tHow can we fail to mention the success just won by the people ^f Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola and even of Portugal against the Fascist, retrograde and colonialist regimes of Salazar and Caetano?\n170.\tIt is for all these reasons that in Burundi we consider Algeria not only a country which welcomes revolutionary ideas and men but also a symbol of the irreversible and final liberation of countries that wish to rid themselves of retrograde, Fascist, colonialist and imperialist systems. This is the sense which, Mr. President, we endeavored to reflect in a previous message when we expressed our optimism concerning the success of the present session, as well as our unflagging support for your initiatives, and which the delegation of the Republic of Burundi has received instructions to bring to you, on behalf of Lieutenant- General Michel Micombero, the Secretary-General of the UPRONA Party, Head of State and Government and liberator of the people of Burundi, who, with his colleague and friend, President Houari Boumediene, has consolidated friendship and solidarity between Algeria and Burundi.\n171.\tAfter such an eventful year, I shall acquit myself of a very pleasant duty by expressing my appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who guided the debates of the sixth special session with remarkable skill and whose activities were crowned with success.\n172.\tI also have the privilege of paying tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his eminent qualities of a great statesman with a heart sensitive to human distress. On behalf of the President of the Republic and his Government, I wish to express to the Secretary-General our admiration for his great competence, his diplomatic skill and his devotion, his deep sense of international responsibility and his unshakable faith in a better world where justice and not force will prevail. Africa will always be grateful for the efforts he unceasingly deploys to free the continent from the scourges which still plague it in southern Africa. We should also like to express our warm congratulations to him on the positive results of the Organization, whose prestige grows because of the personal action of the Secretary- General.\n173.\tOn 17 September 1974, the United Nations family welcomed the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, whose admission we welcome as an important event in the Organization, in its progress in the emancipation of peoples and in the consecration, of its universality.\n174.\tThe Republic of Burundi most warmly congratulates the People's Republic of Bangladesh and Grenada and hopes that they will consolidate their independence in peace and friendship with the other States of the regions and will be prepared to co-operate. We declare ourselves ready to co-operate with these new States.\n175.\tAt present we wish to pay a particular tribute to the people of Guinea-Bissau, which, under the guidance of the great revolutionary party, the PAIGC, has, in the most striking and glorious manner, consolidated its past victories over colonialism. Burundi expresses its brotherly and most cordial congratulations to this avant-garde people, who, because of the revolutionary spirit instilled in them by the eternal hero, Amflcar Cabral, father of the free and independent country of Guinea-Bissau, accomplished a gigantic task which evoked the admiration of the enemy.\n176.\tThe first anniversary of the sovereignty of Guinea-Bissau, which we celebrated this year, was welcomed in my country as a reaffirmation of the principle whereby the revolutionary determination of a people does away with sterile negotiation so as to conquer by defiance that which was refused by selfishness and scorn.\n177.\tI bow before the flag of Guinea-Bissau, which has been raised at the United Nations and which represents the glory of the freedom fighters of Guinea- Bissau. It flies to the honor of the Guinean people and arouses the warranted hopes of the other fighters in Mozambique, Angola, the Cape Verde Islands and southern Africa. We hope that the Government of this new State will find understanding and generosity in the international community so as to benefit from substantial aid and rapidly to rebuild that country, which was devastated by the war imposed upon it by colonialism. Thus, it will be able to consolidate its political independence and devote itself to the pro-gramme of economic liberation, together with the other revolutionary peoples of the world.\n178.\tIn Mozambique, we welcome the victories of the Mozambican people, under the leadership of FRELIMO, after centuries of implacable struggle against abject colonialism which caused so much innocent blood to flow. We also congratulate the FRELIMO leaders, who succeeded, to the astonishment of the world, in preserving the unity of their people in the revolutionary action which has just been crowned with success by the signing of the agreements of Lusaka between FRELIMO and the Portuguese Government. We emphasize the clear sightedness and political maturity of the FRELIMO leaders and of the new leaders of Portugal, who have succeeded in doing away with the barriers to the application of the Lusaka agreements. However, we wish to share with our brothers in Mozambique the experience of the Burundi people, which for years fought to safeguard its independence and the achievements of its great November revolution. Imperialism and colonialism are always hatching plots against revolutionary regimes and peoples, because they never admit defeat. That is what peoples must always be vigilant. We also hope \\\"that no Power will obstruct the rapid accession to independence of that country, which is called upon to play an important role within the concert of nations, particularly on the African continent.\n179.\tWe are pleased with the assurances given by the Portuguese Government. The new Portuguese regime has given rise to hope that the people of Portugal are finally moving towards co-operation with the other peoples of the world, since it has committed itself totally and radically to do away with Fascist and colonialist regimes which have dominated the political life of that nation for centuries and alienated from it the friendship of the peoples of the world that love peace and democracy.\n180.\tThe people of Burundi assures the people of Portugal of its friendship, and the Government of the Republic of Burundi promises its full co-operation with the Government of Portugal as soon as the latter has proceeded to the transfer of the attributes of its sovereignty to Mozambique and Angola without any malice intended to undermine internal unity or promote civil war after the granting of independence.\n181.\tIn Angola, we welcome the victories won by that great people, which will reconquer its freedom as soon as possible so as to become the master of its destiny. The existence of several liberation movements in that country cannot in any way justify the creation of obstacles that would bar the way to the total liberation of Angola, which is committed to an irreversible process of liberation. Trusting in the wisdom of its leaders, the people of Angola will achieve its unity, which will enable it to continue its triumphal march towards the final victory of total independence for which so many sons and daughters of Angola fell on the battlefield of honor.\n182.\tThe international community must warn the multinational corporations which are greedy for the immense riches of that country and would not hesitate to think of the formula of Balkanization. All the peoples of the world who love peace and justice must destroy that Machiavellian plan, which is a genuine conspiracy against the unity of the Angolan people and the territorial integrity of that vast country.\n183.\tWe hope that Portugal, consistent with the commitments solemnly formulated from this very rostrum, will assume its responsibilities to eliminate such maneuvers and transfer as soon as possible the attributes of sovereignty to all the territories still under its colonial domination.\n184.\tWhile it is regrettable to have to recognize that incomplete decolonization leaves in the world strangle-holds on freedom, it is still more painful to note that in southern Africa millions of human beings are maintained in the chains of slavery; the peoples of Azania, Namibia and Zimbabwe suffer treatment that is wounding to the dignity of man, and the most elementary rights are trampled underfoot, because in that region those who are called colored people are victims of the most barbaric crimes.\n185.\tSouth African racism is not directed only against black Africans. It does not spare any category. Coloreds, Indians and other Asians are equally victims of racial discrimination. This means that it is a problem which concerns all mankind and not only the African continent. This scourge of apartheid, the philosophy which feeds the ideologies of Pretoria and Salisbury, is the shame of our century.\n186.\tIn order to bring Pretoria to reason, international authorities have used persuasion, dialog any other diplomatic procedures. These approaches should have led South Africa to reconsider, but it paid no attention, encouraged as it is in its criminal obstinacy by certain Western Powers which not only maintain economic, trade and diplomatic relations with the Pretoria regime but also support its war industries by means of massive investments.\n187.\tStates Members of the United Nations which condemn the apartheid regime should practice a consistent policy and refrain from any direct or indirect support of the Pretoria regime. The Republic of Burundi, for its part, is pleased to say that it has no commercial, economic or diplomatic relations with Pretoria or Salisbury. Although it is land-locked, Burundi refused to sigh the air agreements which could have permitted aircraft to fly over our country en route to or from South Africa and Rhodesia. All merchandise produced in those countries is prohibited from Burundi territory. This policy may lead to sacrifice in many respects, but it is in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU which condemn the regimes of racism and apartheid.\n188.\tIf Burundi unreservedly applies the relevant provisions of resolutions in regard to southern Africa, a fortiori the great industrial Powers, and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, should take appropriate measures to put an end to these anachronistic regimes which, unfortunately, spread to other regions of southern Africa and, in particular, to Namibia, which should be directly under the authority of the United Nations after the revocation of the Mandate of South Africa, which has been, guilty of the crimes of apartheid perpetrated in that territory. We condemn the policy of bantustanization practiced by South Africa in Namibia, intended to dislocate the Namibian nation.\n189.\tIf South Africa practices a policy contrary to the principles of the United Nations, then why have a dialog with Pretoria or even maintain its status as a Member of the United Nations? It is high time we learned the lesson of the permanent violation by South Africa of the Charter of the United Nations and pronounced its expulsion from the Organization. Burundi is gratified at the General Assembly's decision not to allow the representatives of Vorster to speak, and hopes that that decision will be endorsed by other United Nations bodies, especially the Security Council.\n190.\tIf it is difficult to understand the behavior and final aim of the Salisbury regime, it is no easier to understand the attitude of the United Kingdom towards the rebellion of one of its colonies. London is no longer disturbed about the Salisbury regime; indeed, it sympathizes with that regime, despite the fact that it still has the task of leading the people of Zimbabwe to self- determination and independence.\n191.\tThe United Kingdom has not hesitated to put down rebellions when faced with similar situations in the past. In the case of Rhodesia, London's attitude can be interpreted only as complicity, which the people of Zimbabwe cannot tolerate any longer, for they are aware of their strength, which is being asserted more and more alongside that of the other revolutionary peoples of the world.\n192.\tSalisbury and Pretoria should, while there is still time, review their policy and follow the example of Lisbon, which has just renounced its political and economic exploitation of African States and has become their privileged friend.\n193.\tOn this same subject of decolonization, we hope that Spain will grant independence to so-called Spanish Sahara.\n194.\tWe welcome the agreement between Morocco and Mauritania to request an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice. That will enable all the parties concerned to reach agreement, before the granting of independence, on the future juridical status of the Sahara.\n195.\tIn another region of the world, there is a tragic situation in the Middle East. The Zionist State of Israel has gone so far as to annex by force territories belonging to the Arab States of Palestine, Egypt, Syria and Jordan. That Zionist policy of annexation has deprived the Palestinian people of all its territory.\n196.\tIt is inadmissible in our times that a State should annex by force of arms the territory of another in-dependent State, and thus remove that State from the international political scene. If there is one monstrous injustice in the world that the Organization cannot accept, it is the case of Palestine, for an entire people has been deprived of its home and thereby condemned to a condition of despair.\n197.\tThe most recent war, that of October 1973, while it had the advantage of destroying the myth of Israel's invincibility, did not however lead the Zionist State to seize the opportunity for negotiations to put an end to the Israeli-Arab conflict. If the Palestinian people and the other Arab States of Egypt, Syria and Jordan cannot recover their territory usurped by Zionist imperialism, there is a real danger that a new war, even more deadly than the preceding ones, will break out.\n198.\tMy delegation ventures to remind the Assembly that any solution of the Middle East problem that does not call for the restoration to the Palestinian people of its legitimate right to regain its homeland, with all the powers of sovereignty, is doomed to a total impasse.\n199.\tMy delegation is gratified at the inclusion in this session's agenda of the question of Palestine [item 108], to be discussed separately; that will allow us to examine the problem in more depth. In order to be able to discuss the Palestine question with a full awareness of the facts, the Assembly should invite the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], the sole legitimate and unchallenged representative of the Palestinian people. Indeed, it would be a paradox to try to settle the problem of the Palestinian people without having heard the party mainly concerned.\n200.\tIf the present chances for a settlement of the Middle East crisis fade, Israel will have to bear the responsibility.\n201.\tThe delegation of the Republic of Burundi wishes at this stage to express once again its unflagging support of its brother Arab States, and especially of the Palestinian people, which can count on us for fraternal and militant solidarity. My delegation proposes that the United Nations should take appropriate measures to compel Israel to implement the relevant Security Council resolutions, and to impose sanctions against the Zionist State if it refuses to do so.\n202.\tThe States Members of the United Nations should, individually or collectively, take concrete measures to make Israel respect the territorial integrity of the Arab States of the region, the freedom and self-determination of the Palestinian people, the Holy Places of Jerusalem, the Charter of the United Nations and the Organization's decisions. If the State of Israel does not yield to those imperative necessities, peace and security will remain seriously threatened and the present climate propitious to the search for a settlement of the conflict will, regrettably, be dissipated.\n203.\tAs I said earlier in this statement in reference to disarmament, the world is going through a period of great upheaval resulting from the wars of national liberation, particularly in IndoChina. Viet Nam and Cambodia are at present the most acute anti-imperialist fronts.\n204.\tWith regard to Viet Nam, my delegation would first wish to express its warm congratulations to the heroic people of Viet Nam on the striking victory which it has won and continues to win against imperialism and its puppets. The victories of that great people have proved to the world, and above all to imperialism itself, that a committed and determined people is invincible. We ask the international community to use its prestige and its influence to ensure that finally, after almost half a century, the people of Viet Nam may regain its lost peace and bind up the deep wounds left by the various wars imposed on it by imperialism.\n205.\tMy delegation urgently appeals to the signatory parties of the Agreement on ending the war and re-storing peace in Viet Nam, signed in Paris on 27 January 1973, to respect all its provisions scrupulously. We demand that all foreign troops still stationed in Viet Nam, under whatever label, be withdrawn without delay, in conformity with the Paris Agreement. We condemn the Saigon administration, which obstinately continues its encroachment operations, in violation of the Paris Agreement.\n206.\tSince the Paris Agreement recognizes three administrations in Viet Nam and since the United Nations has admitted the Saigon Administration as an observer, my delegation demands the admission of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam as an observer, particularly since that Government is the valid representative of the South Vietnamese people.\n207.\tThere is another anti-imperialist front in the Indochinese region: Cambodia. Following the plot hatched against Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, the people of Cambodia, weapons in hand, began an all-out war for the national liberation of Cambodia, and in four years they have liberated almost the entire country. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, led by the the head of State, Norodom Sihanouk, has been recognized by more than 60 countries and continues to enjoy the support and assistance of all the peoples of the workhwho love peace and freedom. Last year, the Head of State of Cambodia, Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, received a warm and enthusiastic welcome at Algiers from the non-aligned family. Recently, the Deputy Prime Minister, Khieu Samphan, visited several countries in Asia, Africa and Europe, and had great success everywhere.\n208.\tThe Lon Nol clique has dared in recent days to put forward some fallacious proposals for \\\"peace negotiations\\\". Those maneuvers fool no one; indeed, they only confirm the precarious position of that puppet regime, which in no way represents the Cambodian people any longer.\n209.\tConsistent with its policy, the Government of the Republic of Burundi once again states its support for the restoration to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia of its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and hence for the expulsion of the Lon Nol representatives.\n210.\tThere is another problem on the same continent which should be of concern to the Organization and on which we should take a decision.\n211.\tAt its last session, the General Assembly took a very important decision to dissolve UNCURK. At the same time, it confirmed the will of the United Nations to see Korea reunified peacefully and without outside interference.\n212.\tMy delegation believes that we must continue to go forward in the search for peace in the Korean peninsula. The two parties have begun a dialog, and the only obstacle to constructive results remains the stationing of United Nations troops in the southern part of the country. My delegation demands the total, immediate and final withdrawal of all the troops stationed in Korea under the United Nations flag. The Government of the Republic of Burundi regards that withdrawal as an indispensable prerequisite to the reunification of Korea and, in our opinion, any attempt to admit the two parties to the United Nations separately is a plot to prevent the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea.\n213.\tWe have referred to the violence which prevails throughout the world, and particularly in the countries of the third world. We believe that the Organization should not only take note of all its manifestations, but also draw up a plan of peace for the world which would go to the roots of the evil.\n214.\tThe great Powers of the world should first of all renounce their policy of domination and hegemony, which is at the basis of the incessant arms race, whose aim is to eliminate the weaker States. It is no mere chance that all the conflicts and hotbeds of tension are located not within the spheres of the super-Powers or of the industrialized countries, but in the developing countries. It therefore appears clear that the true victims of the arms race are indeed the countries of the third world hence their interest in total and complete disarmament, because they would become the main theater of operations should another world conflict occur.\n215.\tThe present approach of entrusting the question of disarmament only to the nuclear Powers, more accurately to the two super-Powers, must be rejected, because this question interests all mankind and must be dealt with by all countries, whatever their geographical size or whatever their power hence the need to hold the World Disarmament Conference, the content and definition of which must be clear to all.\n216.\tIn fact, a certain confusion has been created by the two super-Powers. They intend, above all, to achieve a limitation of strategic nuclear weapons and a ban on the proliferation of atomic weapons. As we see it, this partial disarmament means maintaining the status quo while adopting minor arrangements among the super-Powers and continuing the arms race at a uniformly accelerated speed. The international community is being asked to confirm the monopoly of nuclear weapons held by the two super-Powers. Without questioning the good faith of statements made on the subject, we are nevertheless compelled to note with bitterness that at the very time when one hand offers us treaties banning the proliferation of atomic weapons, another hand is offering plutonium and factories for the separation of isotopes to Israel and to South Africa, although those countries are known for their policies of aggression and of violation of the Charter of the United Nations.\n217.\tHow can this be taken seriously? My delegation considers that the objective of disarmament is the total destruction of nuclear weapons. All nuclear Powers should first of all solemnly undertake never to use that nuclear arsenal against any non-nuclear country, to respect the denuclearized zones, and never to use those arms to commit aggression against other countries. In the next phase, the two super-Powers should carry out effective and controlled disarmament, because they are not threatened by the other Powers. At a third stage, disarmament should be generalized and complete and all countries should be called upon to join this process of disarmament and reduction of military budgets, which would preclude any further nuclear tests.\n218.\tThe Government of the Republic of Burundi is also in favour of dismantling all military bases on the soil of third-world countries, because they constitute a permanent threat to the stability and security of the States of the region.\n219.\tFinally, the Government of Burundi is against the hegemony of the great Powers, whose military navies travel the seas and oceans, thus constituting a permanent threat to the coastal States and seriously hampering world peace and international co-operation.\n220.\tAccording to the experts, the world spends $250,000 million on the arms race, a sum which is larger than all the national incomes of the developing countries of Asia and Africa. This vast sum could relieve multitudes of poverty-stricken human beings if it were devoted-to development purposes.\n221.\tSince the last session of the Assembly, we have witnessed events of considerable importance and scope in international economic relations. All petroleum- exporting countries have adopted historic decisions and initiatives intended to ensure a rapid development for their respective economies and a constant improvement in the standard of living and well-being of their peoples, by a revision of their policy on the exporting and exploitation of their natural resources. The prices of certain other raw materials have also risen substantially. In the main developed capitalist countries, inflation and monetary erosion have become more acute, and there is no reason to expect an improvement in the situation unless leaders in those countries decide to take energetic measures to remedy the functioning of the mechanism of their respective economic systems.\n222.\tThis situation has gravely affected many countries of the world which have not yet started producing their own raw materials and whose means are scant because their economic development is slow. Thus, the overwhelming majority of the world's inhabitants view the future with a largely justified concern. It is the duty of the entire international community diligently to meet its responsibilities by seeking the most favorable, effective and just solutions to the grave problems of our time. Otherwise, peace, entente and concord among the peoples and nations which we represent here will be seriously jeopardized.\n223.\tIf we wish to establish, once and for all, balanced and harmonious international economic relations among all the partners, if we wish to solve the present economic crisis, we must first and foremost seek to identify its origins and roots. To that end, courage and clear thinking will be needed. There must be a real spirit of dialog and tolerance. Above all, the rich countries must rid themselves of their complex of power and superiority and take up the discussion in a spirit of equality.\n224.\tThe sixth special session, which was convened on the happy initiative of Mr. Houari Boumediene, President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, to whom we renew the expressions of our deep gratitude, was in fact intended, as we all know, to arrive at solutions acceptable to all and capable of overcoming the threatened breakdown of our respective economies. Today we find that, despite the goodwill and the spirit of concession Of the developing countries at that session, we have not yet reached the end of our sufferings.\n225.\tThe cold, if not hostile, welcome among the developed countries to the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New Inter-national Economic Order augurs no good for the future.\n226.\tWorse than that, certain rich countries, having failed to impose their views and solutions on the rest of the world, are now trying to find scapegoats for their problems, to reject their own responsibilities in the present crisis by laying them at the door of the countries that are producers of raw materials, to provoke and encourage the breakup of the \\\"front\\\" of developing countries. They even threaten to restore by force the old economic order which was characterized by the exploitation, pillage and shameless waste of the natural resources of the poor countries.\nSuch conduct is fraught with dangers for international peace and security.\n227.\tMy country believes that the industrialized countries, with the so-called market economies, should accept a major part of the responsibility for the present economic disorders. The editorial writer of a major newspaper recently wrote that if the present economic situation was out of control it was in the first place because the Western countries had long refused to control their currencies.\n228.\tContrary to what some would make us believe, everyone knows that inflation appeared in the developed countries in the second half of the 1960s. It therefore did not follow the rise in the prices of raw materials; it provoked it. As for the impact of the prices of raw materials on the acceleration in the rate of inflation in developed countries, I should like to recall that, according to a study undertaken in November 1973 by experts of a large Western Power, the doubling of the prices of all primary products could not at that time give rise to more than 4 per cent of the inflation. Since then, the prices of only an insignificant number of primary products have risen considerably. Under the circumstances, how can inflation rates of 15 per cent and more in the main industrialized countries be justified?\n229.\tIt is true that the quadrupling of the price of oil and its derivatives in the space of three months did create serious problems of adaptation for each of our economies, particularly the most fragile. It is also true that we are where we are because the developed countries have always received with indifference and con-tempt the many appeals addressed to them by the countries of the third world within the framework of UNCTAD and in this Assembly to improve the terms of trade of the poorer countries.\n230.\tThe cause of the generalized inflation from which we are suffering is to be sought in the very functioning of the economies of the developed countries. The world will never know a sound international economy as long as the rich 'countries refuse to face their responsibilities. The economic system whose merits and performance they have too often boasted of has been able to survive and prosper only because of the pitiless exploitation of the weakest by the rich and the unmitigated pillage of the wealth of the third world. It must be reviewed and adjusted to the needs, ideals and requirements of our times.\n231.\tAlthough Burundi has seriously suffered from recent developments in the field of international economic relations, my country fully recognizes that the oil-producing countries were quite right to revalue their resources, and we support their struggle to improve the purchasing power of the products they export. Let us denounce maneuvers of blackmail, intimidation and threats directed against them by certain-of the wealthy countries. Through the countries members of OPEC, those threats are addressed also to other commodity-producing countries which might be tempted to follow a rational policy for the development of their resources in accordance with the general well-being and legitimate interest^ of the peoples for whom they are responsible,,\n232.\tHaving said that, there is no doubt that a certain number of the countries of the third world need a great demonstration of solidarity from the international community to guarantee for their peoples a standard of living that accords with the requirements of human dignity. In that regard, my country notes with satisfaction that certain oil-exporting countries have shown a great deal of understanding and a spirit of generosity in regard to the countries most gravely affected by the latest economic events. We hope the developed countries will soon reflect in concrete gestures the present attitude of compassion in regard to the disinherited peoples of the planet. However, the conditions some developed countries have placed upon contributions to the Special Fund established by resolution 3202 (S-VI) lead us seriously to doubt their good faith and sincerity. The show of solidarity of which I have spoken must be spontaneous. It must not be bargained, nor can it depend on the attitude of a group of third countries, when the need and urgency are recognized by all because of the conditions of despair under which millions of human beings live.\n233.\tTo conclude this economic chapter, I should like to make one point clear. Rumors have been spread according to which the African States have severed diplomatic relations with Israel to ensure their supply of oil. It was further alleged that this was the only reason for their support of the Arab States. My delegation protests against such calumny, intended to break Arab-African solidarity.\n234.\tThough it is among the States whose economies have been most affected by the rise in the price of oil, the Republic of Burundi wishes to make it clear that we severed diplomatic and other relations with Israel for no such reason. Militant and brotherly solidarity with the Arab peoples was decided upon by the Government of Burundi quite independently and in all sovereignty, without any bargaining. Burundi therefore considers that those divisive maneuvers are devoid of any logic and should be ended so as not to lend substance to the slanderous attempts at blackmail to sow discord between the African countries and our Arab brothers.\n235.\tSince the Organization came into being, eminent statesmen and distinguished diplomats have come to this rostrum to proclaim their faith in the ideals of peace, freedom and progress. The brilliant wars of national liberation against colonialism and for independence that have been waged almost everywhere throughout the world for nearly 30 years and continue in southern Africa, in the Middle East and in IndoChina demonstrate, should that still be necessary, that international peace will be precarious as long as a single people or a single nation is subject to domination, humiliation, exploitation and racism.\n236.\tToday, because of the rapid development of mass communications media, the world has become smaller than ever, and each of its inhabitants is better informed on the conditions of life of his fellow men. International peace and security will always be threatened as long as millions of human beings suffer from hunger, malnutrition, disease and other scourges of mankind while a privileged minority wallows in abundance, waste and indifference.\n237.\tAll peoples aspire to live in dignity, freedom and pride. Every effort must be made, all energies and all resources must be mobilized so that all the peoples of the earth, and above all the most disinherited, may lead a decent life, so that they may simply live with the hope of a better future. To that end, international solidarity and co-operation, of which we have said so much, must be reflected in concrete action.\n238.\tIn that context, we urgently appeal to the developed countries to honor the commitments they entered into freely and solemnly vis-a-vis the developing countries within the framework of the Second United Nations Development Decade. We also invite them to withdraw the reservations they have expressed regarding the results of the sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development.\n239.\tInternational relations must become democratic through the taking up of problems in equality and mutual understanding. International relations must be based upon concerted action, dialog and a spirit of compromise, and no longer on force or diktat. While not losing sight of our own preoccupations and priorities, let us justly appreciate those of our partners. By acting thus, every country represented here will make a valuable contribution to the building of a more human world of greater solidarity and brotherhood in which we shall forever banish injustice, poverty, frustration and humiliation, to the greater glory and well-being of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish at the outset to convey to you the very warm congratulations of the Irish delegation on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is doubly fortunate, since your personal wisdom and experience will guide our deliberations, and you represent a country which in both the political and the economic spheres has a record of initiative and leadership.\n26.\tMy delegation wishes, too, to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Benites of Ecuador, Who guided the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly with brilliance and juridical sagacity.\n27.\tIt is my privilege to be the first after the address of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh to welcome Bangladesh to the United Nations. The Prime Minister's moving address has emphasized to us the urgent and terrible problems which face many parts of the world none more so than his stricken country.\n28.\tWe particularly welcome Guinea-Bissau as a new Member State. Its gallant struggle for freedom has been vindicated and its presence here today reflects the rebirth of democracy in Portugal, whose previous regime's colonial policy I described at the previous session of this Assembly [.2125th meeting] as doing an injustice to the Portuguese people, their traditions and their past contributions to human knowledge and culture. We hope soon to greet the newly emerging independent States of Mozambique and Angola. My delegation wishes to pay a special tribute to the inspiring and heart-warming address delivered here on Monday [2239th meeting] by the Foreign Minister of Portugal and to offer to his country our congratulations and most whole-hearted support in the new phase of its history which is now opening.\n29.\tTo Grenada, the Isle of Spice, we also give our warm felicitations. As the Prime Minister, Mr. Gairy, has said [2233rd meeting], the presence here of Grenada is an expression of faith in fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of man which underscores the principle of self-determination.\n30.\tThe world that we have inherited from the past has had its own equilibrium. Supply and demand have been kept more or less in balance by the price mechanism; the spheres of influence of the great Powers have remained more or less stable over a full generation; and even within particular regions of the world where local conflict situations have existed, a political balance has been maintained, disrupted only infrequently by the outbreak of conflicts, which have in each case been successfully localized.\n31.\tThe fact that such a balance has existed throughout the past generation has obscured for many the fact that the relationships which have found themselves more or less in equilibrium during this period are themselves in many instances inherently unjust and therefore unstable. The equilibrium has in fact in many respects been a false one, reflecting an inherited balance of forces that has no objective justification other than the fact that it has secured a certain short-term stability in world affairs.\n32.\tWe in this generation now face the consequences of the understandable, but perhaps near-fatal, neglect by those who have gone before us of the fundamental problems involved in this false equilibrium. We face the problem of setting right imbalances between and within nations and social and economic injustices on a global scale, as well as the problem of creating a new world political equilibrium that will reflect the rights of peoples vis-ct-vis each other a new equilibrium that will replace a pattern of international relationships that owes all too much to injustices inherited from history.\n33.\tIt is only in the past decade that rich and poor nations alike have for the first time come to a full realization of how unjust is the present distribution of the world's resources and how inequitable is the sharing of power between the world's peoples. This belated realization brings with it, naturally, a desire to set things right, to create a true equilibrium in place of that false equilibrium that has hitherto existed between the nations of the world.\n34.\tThat radical changes in the relationships between rich and poor nations and in the distribution of the world's resources are urgently needed is now common ground among all but the most selfish and most reactionary. A new sense of mutual commitment between nations and peoples has been a feature of the past decade in world affairs and has begun to influence the attitudes of nations and their political leaders towards each other.\n35.\tThe problem of putting right a world structure which is so evidently and pervasively wrong is not, however, going to be easy to solve; on the contrary, it seems likely to prove frustratingly intractable. For, unjust though the economic and political equilibrium that has hitherto existed in the world may be, it is an equilibrium, and a delicately balanced one at that. We have seen on a number of occasions in recent decades how in the sphere of power politics even a marginal shift in the political balance between the super-Powers can endanger world peace.\n36.\tIn the economic sphere also we are learning at this time how sensitive is the equilibrium that has hitherto existed among different groups of nations in the world the United States, the countries of Western Europe and other industrialized countries, the State-trading countries, the oil-producing countries, the producers of other raw materials and those countries which are not endowed with natural resources. For the past 12 months the world economic system has been reverberating with the shock-effects of a sudden readjustment in the terms of trade between the oil-producing countries and the rest of the world, and to a lesser extent between other raw material producers and the rest of the world.\n37.\tSo finely balanced are the economic and social structures that have grown up through the centuries, and so accustomed have most peoples, especially in the developed world, become in recent decades to a regular annual increase in their real incomes, that the impact of a sudden adjustment in real incomes of even 5 or 6 per cent has proved dangerously disruptive and threatens the economic and perhaps even the political stability of some countries.\n38.\tMoreover, the chain effects of any disruption of this balance are so immensely dangerous to the economy of the whole world and all its peoples, poor as well as rich, that all who are concerned with securing a more equitable distribution of wealth and power throughout the world have been forced by these recent events to consider carefully the manner in which this objective can be achieved without doing more harm than good to the poor as well as the rich, not merely in the short term but indeed over an indefinite period ahead. We have to face the unpalatable fact that already the sudden shift in the terms of trade has sparked off an unprecedented inflation, and that a world recession, the effects of which would inevitably hit the poorest and weakest worst of all, and with which we are most ill-prepared to deal, now threatens.\n39.\tThere will, no doubt, be those in the world who try to draw from this the conclusion that however great the injustices that blemish the international order it may be more prudent to leave these untouched than to attempt reforms whose unanticipated shock- effects on the system might in the short and medium run be harmful beyond any gains that can be achieved. This, however, would be a counsel of despair, for the economic, social and political injustices prevailing in the world are so great, and are now so clearly seen to be so, that no counsel of reason could prevent or inhibit efforts to set them right.\n40.\tWhether we like it or not, the old order has to change, and it is clear that, rather than seek to persuade those who suffer under this system to hold their hand lest worse should befall them, we must set out to plan a readjustment of the relations between nations and between economies on a scale large enough and at a rate rapid enough to secure acceptance by those who suffer most from the injustices of the present system. This readjustment must, however, be prepared and planned sufficiently skilfully to ensure against the danger of shocks so great as to increase still further the sufferings of those who are the losers from the present unjust equilibrium.\n41.\tThe onus for such plans and preparations lies upon the \\\"haves\\\" of the world; it is they who must, not only in their own enlightened self-interest but also in the interest of the rest of the world, seek the means of putting right what is so evidently wrong, at a pace and in a manner, as I have said, that will secure the confidence and trust of those who suffer from the present system.\n42.\tThis I take to be the message from the sixth special session of the General Assembly and from the meeting in Mexico of the Working Group on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, established by UNCTAD; and no doubt it will also be the message that will come within the next couple of months from the World Food Conference in Rome.\n43.\tThe inequities in the distribution of wealth in the world are not, as some have perhaps simplistically believed, merely the immediate consequence of past colonialism. Many inequities are rather the product of a technological gap which formerly made colonialism possible but which remains an equally formidable force after the end of the colonial system. Other inequities in the distribution of wealth are the product of an unequal distribution of raw materials, with which the nations of the world are most unevenly endowed. Others, again, may reflect massive disparities of size as between different nations: disparities of geographical size, which is often relevant to the range of raw materials available; or of population size, which determines the scale of the domestic market and therefore, to a degree, the possibilities of mass production.\n44.\tWe are just learning at present to understand the full complexity of the unequal distribution of wealth as we see how increases in the prices of oil and raw materials aid the economies of only some developing countries, and damage, in certain in-stances disastrously, the economies of others less well endowed. What seemed up to a year ago a relatively clear-cut, although not easily soluble, problem of two sets of nations, rich and poor, is now universally perceived to be much more complex, involving First the developed countries, which are suffering the consequences of increased oil and raw material prices; secondly, the oil-producing countries, whose resources have overnight been increased on a scale which, for some at least, creates problems of disposal and investment; thirdly, a range of other raw-material-producing countries, some of them great gainers from the rise in the price of certain raw materials, some less markedly benefiting because of a less fortunate pattern of raw material production, and some even losing because the prices of their raw materials have not risen at all; and, fourthly, that group of countries with no raw materials to speak of, which are now far worse off than ever before.\n45.\tThat is, surely, the primary lesson brought home to all of us at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, convened earlier this year on the inspired initiative of your country, Mr. President: the complexity of the problem. The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (5-K/J] stresses in its paragraph 3 \\\"reality of interdependence\\\" and the fact that \\\"the prosperity of the international community as a whole depends upon the prosperity of its constituent parts\\\". And the complexity of the interests which must be reconciled is reflected in the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-VI)].\n46.\tIn my delegation's view, the solution to the imbalance of wealth in the world must include three essential elements: first, there must be an assurance of a continued long-term improvement in the relative prices of raw materials from developing countries vis-a-vis the prices of industrial manufactures.\n47.\tSecondly, there must be an assurance to those countries which, because of their lack of natural resources, may be expected to lose rather than to gain from such a continued price adjustment of long- term and continuing aid of a kind, and on a scale, that will enable them to share fully in the continuing redistribution of world wealth, and, over a period of time, to secure self-sustaining economic growth.\n48.\tMy own country has not in the past played as full a part as it should have done in the provision of development aid to countries much less well off than itself. We have, however, quadrupled our development aid program in the past 18 months and have committed ourselves to a continued expansion of the real volume of this aid designed at least to-treble it again within the next four or five years.\n49.\tBut, thirdly, there must be, as between the developed world and the developing countries, whether endowed with raw materials or not, a transfer of technology to bridge that most fundamental gap which, as I said a few moments ago, remains a formidable force perpetuating the division of the world into the \\\"haves\\\" and \\\"have nots\\\" even after the end of the colonial era. The forthcoming Euro-Arab dialog, in which my country as a member of the European Economic Community will be participating, will, I hope, among other things, lead to a beginning of such a transfer of technology in favor of one group of developing countries and could perhaps, if successful as we hope it will be provide a model for similar arrangements between other groups of countries.\n50.\tBut pending the development of a long-term plan comprising inter alia these elements, we must ensure as a preliminary step that there is no recurrence of the disastrous cycle of gross fluctuations in the prices of raw materials which has in the past inflicted such misery on poor countries dependent on raw materials for their livelihood and disrupted the markets of the industrialized countries, whose stability is important to the world as a whole.\n51.\tIn other words, the benefits gained by many poor countries as a result of the rise in the prices of raw materials in the past couple of years must by some means be substantially guaranteed pending the development of arrangements that will assure to them a continued, steady future growth of real income from these sources. The European Community, in its negotiations with the associated African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in Jamaica two months ago, undertook some first tentative steps in this direction which will, however, need to be reinforced and to be extended much more widely if the trading gains secured by the raw-material-producing countries in the last couple of years are to be maintained.\n52.\tNext, as part of the immediate program demanded by the urgent needs of the present situation, there must be an adequate emergency fund to help those developing countries which, because of their lack of raw materials, have merely had their poverty made even more absolute by these recent price movements and have, in some instances, been threatened with actual starvation, as we have just heard in moving terms from the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. The efforts to get an emergency fund of this kind off the ground have been frustratingly slow, and have hitherto evoked a somewhat uneven response from those whose means impose on them a severe responsibility in this matter. A number of countries, including those of the, European Economic Community and a number of the oil-producing countries, have tried in their different ways to give a lead in this matter, but this lead has yet to be followed on a scale large enough to offer an assurance that the action to be taken in respect of this aspect of the problem will be in any degree commensurate with the urgent need.\n53.\tFinally, and equally urgently, effective international action is required to prevent the impact of the recent sudden deterioration in the terms of trade of the industrialized countries from precipitating a world recession. Almost a year has now passed since the increase in oil prices, and well over a year since some prices of raw materials started to move sharply upwards, but there still seems to be a dangerous hiatus in the redirecting of surplus funds not being spent on current consumption or investment by those who have received them; these funds are not yet working their way back into the system on a scale sufficient to maintain world economic activity. Moreover, as between the countries within the industrialized group of nations, no adequate progress has yet been made with smoothing out the uneven distribution of the impact of these events on somewhat differently placed national economies, nor has there been on the part of most of these countries sufficient progress in tackling the inflationary impact of the sharp price increases they face, which now threaten to precipitate a dangerously sharp second-stage wage cost inflation within many of these States.\n54.\tWhat I have just said concerning the need to replace a false equilibrium in the economic sphere finds its application also, I believe, in the political sphere. There was a time when the world political balance seemed to be a function almost exclusively of the relationship between two super-Powers. We see today clearly that this is no longer the case; quite apart from the new situation created by the return of China to its rightful role as an active world Power, by the emergence of Japan as one of the world's major industrial Powers, and by the coming together of nine of the countries of Western Europe in a new European community, there has been the emergence of the group of non-aligned countries. Moreover, the relationship between the two super-Powers has settled into a more stable pattern and the confrontation that existed between them has, to a degree, been replaced as a source of world tension by local conflicts in various parts of the world, some of which carry in themselves, however as others have already pointed out in this debate the seeds of a threat to world peace.\n55.\tAt the same time, the former simple balance of terror between the nuclear capabilities of the two super-Powers has been replaced by a new, increasingly dispersed, and therefore perhaps increasingly threatening, proliferation of nuclear weapons and of the means to create them. The dangers posed by these developments, and the 'need for effective action to deal with them, were rightly stressed here last Monday by the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger [2238th meeting]. As a country which a decade ago played a constructive part in the initiation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], Ireland is particularly concerned at the recent evidence of a breakdown in the safeguards then introduced and will join in any effort to restore tight control over the spread of nuclear weapons.\n56.\tThese new problems cannot be met by old, simplistic solutions; they require a far more sophisticated approach, one that will involve many nations in the exercise of statesmanship and self-restraint. What frankly is frightening is that here in the political sphere as in the economic sphere the achievement of a new and more equitable world equilibrium, one that would be acceptable to the world's peoples as well as to their Governments, seems to be beyond the competence of our existing international institutions, as we work them today. The kind of international order needed to cope successfully with these problems demands an institutional structure far better organized and far better disciplined than that which we now have.\n57.\tThis poses great problems for the world's nations: for the super-Powers, which will find it difficult to accept any constraint on the freedom of action which their potential for destruction has hitherto given them; for the former colonial Powers, which cannot find it easy to adapt to the loss of their ancient privileges; but also for the new States, those like my own, with half a century of independence behind them as well as those which have secured their sovereign freedom only within the past decade or two. For all of us newer States the acceptance of constraints on our individual freedom of action in the interest of stability, and even of the survival of the world, must be somewhat irksome coming within decades, or even only within years, after we have achieved our long-sought independence.\n58.\tNo country can, however, escape from the constraints imposed by the situation that faces the world today. In southern Africa, in the Middle East, in Cyprus and in Northern Ireland, to name but four parts of the world, there are dangerous situations, each of which owes its potentially or actually explosive Character to the world's too ready acceptance of past festering injustices a failing to which the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, Mr. Callaghan, referred in the course of his address yesterday [2240th meeting] and to the failure of one or other party to these disputes to face up to the inherent instability of a situation that momentarily may have seemed to favor their interests.\n59.\tIn Cyprus an inherently unstable situation was made even more dangerous by the emergence in Greece of a military dictatorship which was far too readily tolerated, and even aided, by some members of the world community. When that regime eventually succumbed to adventurism in Cyprus, the uneasy balance in that island foundered, bringing misery and death to the Cypriot community, Greek and Turk alike.\n60.\tThe disproportionate response by Turkey to the events precipitated by the coup in Cyprus has brought in its train tragic hardship and dislocation to the Cypriot population and a threat to the sovereignty and independence of Cyprus as a State. We trust that negotiations will permit the speedy and safe return to their homes of all those, from both communities, who have been uprooted, as well as the full restoration to Cyprus of its right to sovereignty and independence.\n61.\tThe course of events in Cyprus has not made the task entrusted to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus any easier, and we share the sorrow of those countries whose soldiers have died under the flag of the United Nations in the cause of peace in the island. We also wish to pay homage to the devoted and unflagging personal efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, to bring communal leaders of Cyprus together in a dialog of peace.\n62.\tIt is our earnest hope that from the tragic drama of Cyprus in recent months, the participants and the rest of the world too may learn that attempts to resolve conflicts of communal rights by forceful means not only can bring greater hardship to the communities in whose name the actions were taken, but can also damage the international machinery available under the Charter for the solution of such problems and can undermine the principle that lies at the heart of the Charter itself the sovereign equality of States.\n63.\tIn the Middle East, the unwillingness for so long of Arab States to recognize the right of Israel to exist and the reluctance in turn by Israel to recognize and work towards a resolution of the problem of the Palestinians have together contributed to instability, and thus to repeated armed conflict.\n64.\tIn southern Africa the same danger of confrontation persists. Happily, as I noted earlier, the emergence of a democratic Government in. Portugal is helping to resolve this problem peacefully in several of the Territories involved; but these developments serve only to stress the urgency of a movement towards a solution in the rest of southern Africa, which has been suffering from the intransigence of its white minority regimes and from their shortsighted determination to perpetuate injustice in defense of a perverted concept of \\\"civilization\\\".\n65.\tWithin the past couple of days there have been reports from South Africa that the Government of that country may be about to announce a significant change in its policy with respect to Namibia. My delegation hopes that those reports are well founded, not merely for the sake of the Namibian people, whose welfare in the future is the special responsibility of this Organization, but also in the hope that such a development might mark a first step by the Government of South Africa away from its past policies which have cut it off from the rest of the world.\n66.\tWe in Ireland have also suffered in our turn from a failure on the part of those who had the authority to do so to tackle in good time the problem of injustice to the important nationalist minority in Northern Ireland. The explosive situation which inevitably developed from this failure burst into open conflict in 1969. This conflict increased fears on all sides, and even though many of the long-standing injustices were gradually rectified, self-righteous and ruthless men the members of the illegal Irish Republican Army were able to exploit the situation by claiming to act as defenders of a threatened minority. Their ruthlessness in the years that followed provoked from paramilitary groups amongst the majority indiscriminate retaliation against innocent members of the minority and the consequent cycle of violence has been compounded by cases of lack of judgment or lack of discipline on the part of security forces trying to cope with the situation. In an atmosphere where all live in fear of violence from any one of several sources, reason cannot easily prevail nor moderate policies gain the widespread support they need to bring a term to the crisis racking the Northern Ireland community.\n67.\tThe aim of my Government is, by initiating constructive policies and by rejecting the pursuit of mere self-interest, to work towards the calming of passions and the achievement of peace with justice in Northern Ireland. Accordingly, since the last session of the General Assembly we have made it clear that we abjure irredentism, that we accept that the factual position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom can be altered only with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.\n68.\tUnhappily, even that clear statement, which we offered to incorporate in a solemn agreement to be registered at the United Nations, has failed to persuade the majority section of the community in Northern Ireland to accept the terms of a widely acclaimed agreement reached last December at Sunningdale in England between the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom and the parties to a power-sharing Government in Northern Ireland, which at that time commanded a majority in the then recently elected Northern Ireland Assembly. That agreement provided for participation by both sections of the people of Northern Ireland in the government of the area an arrangement which actually operated successfully for a period of five months  and for an institutional structure between North and South that would have given expression to the close economic, social and cultural links that bind together the two parts of Ireland.\n69.\tIt is tragic that this solution to the problem, despite its initial good reception and despite the support given to it by the United Kingdom Government and opposition parties and by the Government and opposition in my own country, failed as a result of a recrudescence of intransigence amongst the majority section of the Northern Ireland community. But we have not abandoned our efforts to secure a solution along these lines and to achieve acceptance for it amongst both sections of the community in Northern Ireland on a scale that will ensure its success. We have not been deflected from our efforts at conciliation by the rejection of the agreement reached at Sunningdale nine months ago. We remain convinced that the principal elements of that agreement are essential to any enduring solution. And, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, we shall continue to pursue the path of conciliation in the cause of peace.\n70.\tI know that in our efforts to resolve this problem within the island of Ireland, and in co-operation with the United Kingdom Government, we have the support of the world community.\n71.\tI should like to end by referring to the question of human rights, including safeguards against torture, a problem which increasingly is attracting the concern of world public opinion. My country takes the view that human rights transcend all questions of national sovereignty. We formally reject the view that any country has the right to infringe on basic human rights, let alone use torture within its territory, or to be free from inquiry, from inspection, or from condemnatory action by the international community in respect of such breaches of the rights of man.\n72.\tWe ourselves accept the jurisdiction of the European Commission and Court of Human Rights in respect of such matters and have fully accepted the obligation to justify our domestic actions before these tribunals. To the extent that the United Nations code of human rights is less effective than that of the Council of Europe, we would wish that it be strengthened and rendered less open to evasion, and more capable of protecting individuals every, where from arbitrary acts by Governments.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first of all, Mr. President, to offer you, on behalf of my delegation, our warmest congratulations on your election to the important post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. That choice is o^ particular significance to my delegation: first, because you represent Algeria, a country with which Niger has for many centuries enjoyed relationships of friendship and cooperation and, secondly, because your personal qualities and complete understanding of international problems are a sure guarantee that this Assembly's work will be fruitful.\n211.\tI also wish to associate my country and my delegation with the well-deserved congratulations ad-dressed to Mr. Leopoldo Benites, the representative of Ecuador, who presided over the work of the twenty- eighth session with remarkable skill and courtesy.\n212.\tI likewise wish to express to the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the great confidence my country feels in having him conduct the affairs of our Organization. His recent journey to the drought- stricken Sahelian countries and his swift and timely action in both the Middle East and the Mediterranean area are, for my Government, further demonstrations of his constant interest in the grave problems that regularly afflict our world.\n213; I should like, first, to address the delegation of Honduras and to offer the full sympathy of the Government and people of Niger because of the catastrophe that has so cruelly struck that country. The people of Niger, who have just suffered through six years of natural disaster, feel for that reason particularly close to the people of Honduras and have no difficulty in understanding the impact of that catastrophe and, above all, the difficulties it has caused in their attempts to rehabilitate their national economy.\n214.\tOn behalf of the Supreme Military Council and the Government of the Republic of Niger, I should like to voice here the satisfaction I feel at the admission to this Organization of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. My country is most gratified at the decision taken by the General Assembly. We are deeply convinced that the admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to the United Nations will help prevent any new war in the Indian subcontinent and, consequently, will further the strengthening of international peace and security.\n215.\tMy delegation likewise welcomes the admission of Grenada to the great family of the United Nations. The presence of Grenada among us is added proof that our Organization is becoming truly universal.\n216.\tAnother great source of satisfaction to my delegation is the admission of the sister Republic of Guinea- Bissau to full membership in the United Nations. My country has special reasons for considering its admission as an historic event. In our view, it is the culmination of many years of struggle against colonialism. The brilliant victory that the people of Guinea- Bissau has just won honors not only all the peoples of Africa, but also ail men who reject the domination of one people by another.\n217.\tIt is for this reason that l wish to assure the delegation of Guinea-Bissau of the high esteem felt by the people of Niger for the people of their country, a people that has shown exemplary courage and unshakable tenacity. Amilcar Cabral, a hero who has become a legend throughout all of Africa, will remain forever graven in our memories. Now, as his country achieves independence, it is with great emotion that we recall the immense sacrifice of that valiant son of Africa.\n218.\tMy delegation followed with particular attention the statement delivered from this rostrum by Mr. Mario Soares, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal, specifically when he said:\n\\\"With respect to the other Territories, in accordance with the declaration made during the visit of Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim to Lisbon, Portugal has solemnly reaffirmed what its constitutional laws already guarantee: that it fully recognizes the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. Portugal is therefore ready to apply the United Nations decisions to that effect, reaffirming also the fulfillment of its obligations arising from Chapter XI of the United Nations Charter and General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), which contains the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as well as resolutions referring to Territories under Portuguese administration.\\\" [2239th meeting, para. 116.]\n219.\tMay I most heartily welcome this new unequivocal position that at once does honor to those who hold it and to the new Portugal as a whole. The Government of Niger is reconsidering its relations with the new Government of Portugal. In so doing, we realize we can help speed up the process of decolonization.\n220.\tThe example of firmness set by the new Portugal in respect of recent events in Mozambique should serve to inspire those who claim that nothing can be done in Rhodesia. Many problems of Africa could thus find solutions in keeping with the aspirations of the oppressed peoples.\n221.\tI take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the freedom fighters, to all those who have given their lives, to all those who are still stubbornly fighting so that their peoples may finally regain their dignity and freedom.\n222.\tThat part of the African continent unfortunately still remains the scene of massacres, imprisonments and harassments of all sorts inflicted on populations that have already suffered so greatly. The policy of apartheid, so often denounced here and elsewhere, is a defiance hurled in the face of the international community, and of our Organization in particular, by the racist and anachronistic regime of Pretoria and the illegal minority Government of Rhodesia. We are in duty bound to take up that challenge. Thus, my delegation appeals most urgently again to all the Powers that directly or indirectly support those Governments, calling upon them to come to their senses and condemn these racist, colonialist regimes that are justly regarded as historical anomalies. That challenge we shall take up sooner or later, alone or with the understanding or the participation of the international community, even if it means the sacrifice of more African lives.\n223.\tAs regards the sensitive problem of the Spanish Sahara, my delegation has noted with satisfaction and relief the statements made here by the Foreign Ministers of Morocco [2249th meeting] and Mauritania [2251st meeting], two sister African countries interested in the solution to that problem. My delegation is therefore pleased to learn that the present trend is towards arbitration. Niger can only encourage such attitudes where disputes among nations are settled in peace and harmony, particularly disputes among sister African countries. This is fully consistent with African tradition and wisdom.\n224.\tMy country, ever anxious to promote peace in the continent as well as in the world, has set for itself, as a guide-line in its foreign policy: friendship with its immediate neighbors, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, non-alignment vis-a-vis all blocs and the establishment of friendly relations with all peace- and justice-loving countries. Thus, in the Ave months since the National Army took command in my country, the new Government, as one of its tasks, is determined to strengthen its friendly and good- neighborly relations with the countries around it.\nBecause the people of Niger have no warlike designs on its neighbors and that it does not consider any of them to be an enemy, the Government of Niger has denounced all defense agreements linking it with other countries and has condemned the stationing of any foreign troops in other countries.\n225.\tLikewise, the new Government of my country, as part of its policy to establish friendly relations with all peace- and justice-loving countries, has decided to normalize its relations with the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which are countries that have always fought for the emancipation of peoples oppressed by imperialism and colonialism. Within this framework the policies of my country will be to extend a hand, without any exception, to all those who, through their international attitudes, share our ideals of peace, equality and co-operation.\n226.\tOur concern to maintain peace in the world and our concern for peaceful coexistence, prompt us to view with some anxiety the recent developments in Cyprus which are an additional source of tension amongst the major Powers.\n227.\tWe are pleased here to pay a particular tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization, whose efforts have led the two Cypriot communities to start talks, the only means in our opinion, here or elsewhere, to find a just and equitable solution to any dispute. Also, we should like to extend our warm congratulations to all who have given substantial humanitarian aid to the Cypriot communities.\n228.\tWe fervently hope that Cyprus will find peace in harmony and that this will take place in the enlightened self-interest of the Cypriot people as a whole. To this end we would express the hope that the leaders of the two communities will continue their dialog with the assistance of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in keeping with resolution 361 (1974), adopted by the Security Council on 30 August.\n229.\tAs regards Korea, my country fully supports all efforts exerted by both parties to settle peacefully their conflict free from all pressure or foreign intervention. Foreign intervention in some countries is still present in our minds and reminds us that the desire for hegemony and interference are the main source of conflicts in today's world.\n230.\tMy country is now more than ever before convinced that the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries should be the corner-stone of the foreign policy of all the States of the inter-national community. The disturbances in South-East Asia is a striking example of this interference. All the hopes born of the Viet Nam agreements remain, regrettably, unfulfilled. Viet Nam and Cambodia, for instance, continue to suffer as they have been suffering for decades, and look to the international community for more co-operation and peace than armaments.\n231.\tWhile there are still trouble spots on the inter-national arena, we nevertheless remain optimistic. Indeed, we are pleased and reassured that detente has become a reality among parties to conflict. We should like, however, to reaffirm our unfailing support for the cause of the Arab nation, because we are firmly convinced that a just and durable peace will prevail in the Middle East only if Israel abandons its expansionist policy and withdraws from the occupied Arab territories, in accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967.\n232.\tMy delegation will of course also support any resolution which recognizes the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination and the recovery of all the territories of which they have been dis-possessed.\n233.\tWhile my country is generally concerned with the maintenance of peace in the world, its greatest concern is none the less the many problems of development. Priority naturally goes to the relentless struggle that the Supreme Military Council has decided to wage to assist the populations that have been victims of the drought. For us it is first and foremost a matter of eliminating all the after-effects of this disaster, which has so severely struck our country, using our own resources and those that international solidarity is good enough to make available to us.\n234.\tNiger has just suffered the most terrible of natural disasters. The drought has lasted six long years. It has killed 80 per cent of the country's livestock. It has prevented all harvests for six years. It has burnt pastureland and young trees. It has lowered the water-table to a depth which could never have been imagined. Trees are dead; men and cattle, when possible, have fled. The sands of the desert have swept over vast areas. My country is slowly drying up, whereas elsewhere deserts are greening. The people of Niger, so proud and so dignified, are compelled to await a generous gesture from their brothers in the international community.\n235.\tWe are determined never to have to witness this humiliating spectacle again. The events of April 1974 are in keeping with that decision. Our economy, which has been shattered, must be rebuilt and the Supreme Military Council is tackling this colossal task with an awareness of the scanty resources of the country and the amount of the international assistance necessary for it to succeed in this huge task. It can rely on its voluntarily mobilized popular masses to achieve precise objectives. That is the price we must pay for national reconstruction. However, it will take time and will require technical and financial assistance from the international community.\n236.\tMay I take this opportunity to thank all the friendly countries, national and international organizations, public and private, that have shown concern for the fate of the Sahelian countries. Their immediate response to the food shortage has been deeply appreciated by our people. It is on behalf of those people, who during the last year have at last found reason to hope again, thanks to the rain that is now falling there, that I express my profound gratitude.\n237.\tThat food assistance should continue, and we are grateful to those countries which, within their agricultural policies, have considered expanding their aid. Our populations still need it, for it is not possible, even with a year's sustained efforts, to remedy the cumulative effects of a long drought that has sown devastation, misery and death everywhere.\n238.\tOver and above food assistance, we should thoroughly reappraise the problem. To eat fish is all very well and good, but to learn how to fish is to ensure one's future and independence and to regain one's dignity. My Government earnestly hopes that the economic reconstruction program for the Sahelian countries will be studied with interest by all those with the means to participate.\n239.\tWe do not underestimate the seriousness of the economic difficulties that have been plaguing the world for some time now. But the energy crisis must not become a pretext for ignoring our cause. We are feeling the effects of inflation even more keenly; and this inflation is due solely to the lopsided policy of economic expansion needlessly pursued by certain Governments. The increase in the prices of raw materials, wrongly labeled as an evil, is merely incidental. Indeed, it is a welcome happenstance in fact in that it has curbed the constant widening of the gap between the developed countries and those of the third world. Some were getting rich at the expense of the weakest. The restoration of the balance should not open the way for blackmail or for justification of the negative attitudes which some have been tempted to take. There are historical responsibilities that one cannot evade without running the risk of being discredited.\n240.\tI cannot conclude this statement without mentioning the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the World Population Conference. My country is a land-locked one. Nevertheless, it has an even greater interest than others in everything that concerns the problems of the law of the sea. For us the sea is a link between continents and people; it is also a source of new resources for mankind. The most technically and technologically developed countries should renounce the appropriation of its resources, and no longer, in the name of a pseudo-right of force, take what belongs to all. Indeed, we cannot shut our eyes to the scandal that is brewing and that is likely to occur next year in Geneva. That scandal would lie in finding ourselves powerless, at the end of this twentieth century, to prevent a partition of the sea that would permit only the countries capable of engaging in the exploitation of its resources to benefit therefrom. Raw materials are far from being inexhaustible, and no one can assume the right to monopolize the common heritage of mankind.\n241.\tMy delegation suggests that the resources of the sea, when they are part of the common heritage, should be set aside, all proceeds therefrom to go into a development fund for the benefit of the most impoverished countries. We are convinced that the resources of the sea-bed can well serve to help countries out of their underdevelopment rather than to widen still further the gap in the living standards dividing the industrialized countries and those of the third world.\n242.\tAs for the World Population Conference, held in Bucharest, my Government is of the view that the population growth on our planet vis-a-vis the growth in food resources is actually only a subject of concern for a few Malthusians who tremble at the idea of losing the insolent material comforts that they cannot do without. Such thinking is likely to have an adverse effect on development assistance. My country is convinced that man, while not necessarily a sacred being among other creatures, should continue to be the main object of care from his society. There is global development and selective development. Family planning programs can be envisaged only at a relatively high level of living. Why not give everyone -every couple- on earth the hope of developing, understanding and choosing?\n243.\tIn conclusion, let me express all the faith and hope that my country places in our Organization in its efforts to ensure the maintenance of peace on our planet and to promote co-operation among all nations of the world. But everyone in this Assembly is aware of the threats to this fragile peace and this co-operation that has not yet found its true path. The arms race is a real peril which we cannot forget and which must constantly be dendUnced. It compromises the development of our countries by diverting vast resources to hastening the apocalypse; it makes peace more remote when selfish interests are at stake, when the fate of humankind remains subject to the will of certain Powers, unless wisdom can prevail to halt this frenzied race immediately and destroy the existing arms stockpiles.\n244.\tThose, in brief, are the few thoughts that my Government has charged me to put forward at this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like first of all to offer you the congratulations of my delegation on your unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your great country, Sir; has been in the forefront of progressive action in the third world and has played an important role in the world community, and we are particularly happy to see you presiding over the work of this Assembly.\n111.\tEver since he accepted to shoulder the burden of the most impossible job in the world, our distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, has spared no effort in his work for peace, justice and progress. We warmly congratulate him for his tremendous, prompt and positive actions not only at times of political crisis but also in the quieter fields of economic development.\n112.\tWe should also like to welcome Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau as new Members of the United Nations.\n113.\tWe listened attentively and with much interest to the stirring address of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman [2243rd meeting], a heroic statesman. We warmly welcome the presence among us of the representatives of Bangladesh.\n114.\tGrenada, the \\\"Spice Island\\\", shares with Mauritius the beauty of nature- except that the beaches of the star and key of the Indian Ocean are much more beautiful.\n115.\tThe admission of Guinea-Bissau is the victory of a right and just cause. We are proud to see among us the valiant representatives of this new African court- try, and never shall we forget the name of Amilcar Cabral.\n116.\tOur sympathies go to the Government and the people of Honduras in their present plight after the cyclone \\\"Fifi\\\". We hope that the world community will, as usual, be generous in helping to alleviate the sufferings of our fellow human beings not only in Honduras but also in Bangladesh -which, once again, is stricken with natural disaster and elsewhere.\n117.\tAs a brief reminder of the problems which confront the United Nations at this session, I would point out that the special emergency operation to which we agreed at the sixth special session has not yet resulted in concrete measures to assist those among us who are most affected by the present world economic crisis; that we still have to tackle the complex question of general disarmament, that is to say, disarmament which would lighten the burden arising from the arms race and increase the opportunities for development; that peace has not yet been restored to South-East Asia; and that such serious political problems as the situation in the Middle East and the question of Cyprus remain to be solved. So, in addition to finding ways and means to promote a new economic order, we still have to find appropriate solutions to long-standing problems so as to promote political stability.\n118.\tMauritius has welcomed the atmosphere of detente among the major Powers, because it believes that it could be the basis for universal peace, thus lessening the possibility of confrontations between them. Detente, however, has not eliminated the possibility of confrontation in the Indian Ocean.\n119.\tDeclared a zone of peace by the Assembly three years ago [resolution 2832 (XXVI)], the Indian Ocean is at present the scene of dangerous rivalries. Any decision of the United Kingdom and the United States to extend communications and military facilities on the island of Diego Garcia would constitute a flagrant violation of the United Nations resolution on the subject. May we appeal to those directly concerned, especially the United States of America, to reconsider their present policy which, certainly, far from being conducive to the creatL J of a zone of peace is rather conducive to the creation of one of tension. Mauritius, therefore, with other countries bordering the Indian Ocean, views with grave concern the activities of the great Powers, which could create an explosive situation. The peoples of the countries of the Indian Ocean must be allowed to live in peace and security. Mauritius will therefore continue to explore with others every possibility of maintaining peace in the area.\n120.\tBut world peace cannot be ensured if the global issues of disarmament are not solved. For us, genuine disarmament means not only an end to the arms race -which, it should be recalled, costs about $270,000 million annually -but also the destruction of all existing arsenals. The work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament should be accelerated and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks should be allowed to yield more positive results. It is the view of our Government that what is needed is a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, and that any other agreements concluded- should not be aimed at preserving primarily the prerogatives of those countries that are already nuclear Powers. It is in that context that we would consider the proposals fm nuclear-free zones in some parts of the world.\n121.\tAlthough the solutions proposed at the sixth special session have remained unimplemented, the session was useful in so far as it helped to underline the great degree of interdependence of the world economies, particularly the interrelated nature of the economies of the producers of raw materials and those of the developed countries which nerd the raw materials for their continued industrialization. Since the special session, the world economy has further deteriorated. Inflation in the developed countries is felt also in the developing countries, which are paying higher prices for food, fertilizers and manufactured goods. The energy crisis has taught the developed countries their dependence on petroleum. In this respect, we believe that oil price increases should be discussed in the general context of a system of adequate remuneration for basic commodities. My country, which draws about 90 per cent of its total export earnings from the export of sugar, has greatly suffered in the past from the constant deterioration in the terms of trade. The economic, situation of countries which, like Mauritius, export raw materials, will remain unstable as long as an adequate and equitable system is not found to counter the cyclic fluctuations to which the prices of raw materials are subject. While we continue to search for long-term measures, contributions are urgently needed for the emergency operation in order lo assist the hardest hit among the developing countries.\n122.\tIt is our belief that existing specialized agencies or international institutions, such as UNIDO, UNCTAD and the regional economic commissions could greatly contribute towards the search for long- term solutions. In spite of their efforts, developing countries are still compelled to specialize in the production and supply of raw materials to the developed countries. We feel that their action would be more fruitful if they concentrated on an increased transfer of technology from the developed to the developing countries, in order to achieve the aims of diversification and industrialization. We suggest that, so far as Africa is concerned, the conclusions of the UNESCO Conference on the Application of Science and Technology to Development in Africa should be implemented without delay . We also note the early implementation of the African regional plan of action for science and technology, which aims at creating the necessary apparatus to enable an easy, transfer of technology from the highly industrialized nations. Finally, we suggest that the EC A, whose main contribution has so far been the preparation of studies and the organization of meetings, seminars and symposia, should be enabled to assist African States in a more practical manner.\n123.\tBefore turning to some of the political problems confronting us, I should like to refer briefly to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Mauritius, which is an island, of course attaches great importance to the problems of the sea, the sea-bed and its subsoil and their resources. At the second session of the Conference held recently at Caracas some of the basic issues were raised. We view the question of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the . sea, its soil and subsoil up to 200 miles as being particularly important. It is essential that the establishment of a 200-mile coastal zone be accepted over which the States concerned can exercise the right to exploit the natural resources of the sea for the economic development and welfare of their peoples. A second element which the final legal order of the sea should emphasize is the idea Of universal ownership of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and its administration by an international body in the interests of the peoples of the world as the common heritage of mankind. Those two elements have clearly emerged from the Caracas session. Together with most of the countries of the Third World, Mauritius will support the final instruments relating to the Law of the Sea.\n124.\tWe are gratified to note that among the political issues before the General Assembly this year we will not have to devote the usual amount of time and attention to the questions of the Portuguese-administered Territories.\n125.\tIn the course of the general debate at the twenty- fourth session of the General Assembly, my Prime Minister, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, said, referring to the colonial Powers, particularly Portugal:\n\\\"These to my mind are the main currents of colonial policies adopted by many Powers. Why do they not want to withdraw gracefully from the Territories they have occupied for centuries? At times it was* advanced by them that the peoples Of those Territories were not ready to assume independence; at other times it was said that those Territories were economically backward and not viable. On either ground, they have forfeited their right to continue to maintain their rule because after centuries of colonial rule they have failed on all counts.\n\\\"Colonial Powers should no longer invoke the principle that the affairs of Territories under their rule are purely their internal affairs. The time has passed for such a concept; and they should voluntarily divest themselves of their political rule without necessarily impairing their cultural links.\\\"6\n126.\tIt is therefore with great pleasure and admiration that we have followed the efforts of the new regime is Lisbon, not only to restore democracy and freedom to Portugal but also to negotiate with the recognized leaders of its colonies the transfer of power.\n127.\tThe statement made by the Foreign Minister of new Portugal, Mr. Mario Soares [2239th meeting], was historical inasmuch as it ended over four centuries of colonial oppression. On behalf of my Government, I wish to pay a tribute in regard to those efforts which have already led to a peaceful settlement in Guinea-Bissau and to the Lusaka agreement concerning the independence of Mozambique. We are confident that with the usual statesmanship the new leaders of Portugal will tackle with success the outstanding problems which are to be solved with regard to Angola and that the decolonization process in that Territory also will be as* smooth as in the other cases. While saluting the wisdom and statesmanship of the new Portuguese Government, we should like to praise the freedom fighters for their long and heroic struggle to liberate their countries.\n128.\tWe hope that the developments in the Portuguese-administered Territories will have a healthy impact on the situation in the rest of southern Africa, which is still under the domination of colonialist and racist regimes.\n129.\tWe are gratified to note that the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. James Callaghan, has reaffirmed that the United Kingdom still has an outstanding responsibility in Southern Rhodesia and has given us assurances that the British Government will adhere to the policy f ^t \\\"there can be no satisfactory settlement without :e agreement of the African people who live in Rhodesia\\\" [2240th meeting, para. 229]. We assume that all concerned realize from what is happening in Mozambique that there could be no settlement without majority rule. Another lesson which should be learned from the patterns of settlement in the Portuguese-administered Territories is that no peaceful settlement is possible in Southern Rhodesia except through negotiations with recognized leaders of the people. It follows that without the release from detention of the leaders of the Zimbabwe liberation movement, no negotiated settlement is possible. The only alternative would be to continue the liberation struggle which, with the possibility of increased assistance from the OAU, is bound to be intensified. We trust that the British Government, like us, wishes to avoid unnecessary loss of life. Taking into account the new developments, we believe that it can more forcefully impress upon the rebel regime of Ian Smith the urgent need for peaceful change. Of course, all other States can, and should, help in tightening the sanctions against Rhodesia.\n130.\tThe situation in Namibia has worsened over the past year. But it appears, from some statements made by representatives of the white minority in the Territory, that there is some awareness that the reign of terror of the apartheid regime cannot continue indefinitely, when Angola is expected to become independent in the near future. We hope that there, as in Southern Rhodesia, political realism will prevail: In the meantime, the armed struggle waged by the freedom fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization will continue and Mauritius is determined to continue to support it.\n131.\tWhether the abhorrent system of apartheid in South Africa will be affected by the admirable example of humanity and political wisdom set by Portugal is debatable. The nature of the evil system of apartheid is such that it would take a revolution similar to that which has occurred in Portugal to change it. It is an opinion, indeed a conviction, however, that the apartheid policy is doomed to failure. Mauritius is determined to continue to associate itself fully with all action that might be undertaken by the United Nations to bring about the end of the racist minority regime in South Africa.\n132.\tBefore concluding, I would like to indicate very briefly the position of Mauritius on a number of other political issues before us.\n133.\tThe representative of Mauritius, at the time of the violent overthrow of President Makarios, expressed in the Security Council the shock and emotion felt by the people of Mauritius. The position which the representative of Mauritius stated still stands: namely, that Archbishop Makarios was, and remains, the legitimate head of the State of Cyprus and that the restoration of constitutional order implies that he should be allowed to return. Our position is a simple one as it h based on the fact that Archbishop Makarios is the elected President of Cyprus. We hope that our forthcoming deliberations on the Cyprus question will pave the way to restoring full sovereignty to that country and to safeguarding its territorial integrity and independence to the satisfaction of all the inhabitants of the island.\n134.\tOn the Middle East question, Mauritius fully supports the position of the OAU, particularly on the demand for complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories. This is not only a just demand but a requirement for the restoration, of durable peace in the region. That measure and any others aimed at safeguarding the independence and territorial integrity of Israel are, in our opinion, the issues which should be resolved at any resumed talks in Geneva if complete peace it to return to the Middle East. Any solution would also have to take into account the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine.\n135.\tMy delegation welcomes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the supplementary item entitled \\\"Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well-being and health\\\" [item 103]. We congratulate the Foreign Minister of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mr. Andrei Gromyko, and his delegation for having proposed the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the Assembly [see A19702], which my delegation will actively support.\n136.\tThe World Population Conference, in which Mauritius participated, has accomplished considerable results and we trust that all Member States, and others, will co-operate and help generously towards the implementation of the World Population Plan of Action, which was adopted by acclamation in Bucharest by no less than 135 participating States.\n137.\tNow we are hopeful that the World Food Conference, scheduled to be held in Rome this November, will result in the adoption of measures which will lead to the alleviation of the food problems that the world is facing today.\n138.\tTo conclude, allow me to return to the point I started a little while ago, namely, to the immediate region where Mauritius is situated. My Government has the friendliest relations with the leaders of the Seychelles. We have welcomed the decision of the ruling party, the Seychelles Democratic Party of Mr. Mancham, with regard to the independence of the Islands, and we are looking forward to co-operating closely with the independent Seychelles.\n139.\tFurthermore, we were pleased to hear earlier this week from the French Foreign Minister, Mr. Sau- vagnargues [2238th meeting], that France was completing its own efforts in the domain of decolonization by preparing, with the agreement of the freely elected leaders of the Comoros, the accession to independence of the islands. We welcome these developments and are also looking forward to establishing friendly relations with the independent Comoros. The co-operation of the Seychelles and the Comoros as well as that of all other States of the region is needed firmly to establish the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.\n140.\tMay I, on behalf of my Prime Minister, the Government and people of Mauritius, reaffirm our unbounded faith in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like, first of all, to tell you how justly proud my delegation is to see one of the valiant sons of Africa and the third world presiding over the work of the Assembly's twenty-ninth session.\n40.\tOur continent is of course honored by your election, but my country, Mali, takes particular satisfaction in participating in the international consecration of the former Commander Si Abdel-kader El Mali, that intrepid fighter who won those glorious titles on the Algerian-Malian frontiers in the heat of the liberation struggle of his country.\n41.\tMali, which at that time still had only internal autonomy, was already committed to Algeria's struggle. That prestigious nom de guerre \\\"El Mali\\\", which your comrades-in-arms borrowed from my country and gave you, awakens deep memories in us.\n42.\tIn other words, Mr. President, for the people of Mali, among whom you so worthily represented the National Liberation Front, you have remained our brother and friend, an ardent patriot.\n43.\tYour past as a fighter, your eminent qualities as a statesman and your brilliant political career predestined you for these lofty functions, there can be no doubt that you will be able to give our work the same mark of faith and dynamism that characterizes the foreign policy of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, with which Mali enjoys solid relations of friendship and solidarity forged throughout centuries of common history and life.\n44.\tIn offering to you, through me, its warm and fraternal congratulations, my delegation wishes also to take this opportunity to express its sincere thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, on the remarkable way in which, with so much competence, he conducted the proceedings of the twenty- eighth session and the sixth special session, which was devoted to the problems of raw materials and development.\n45.\tWe wish also to congratulate the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who has spared no effort in fulfilling as satisfactorily as possible the extremely heavy and difficult task that we have entrusted to him.\n46.\tWe should like to associate ourselves with the many messages of sympathy that have been addressed to the delegation of Honduras, a country which has been ravaged by a terrible hurricane. We extend our friendly sympathy to the people of Honduras and its Government, and we express our deep condolences to the Honduran nation and the bereaved families.\n47.\tThe admission to the United Nations at this session of the fraternal States of Guinea-Bissau, Bangladesh and Grenada is an important milestone on the difficult path to the universality of the Organization. My delegation extends its fraternal congratulations to the representatives of those new States and wishes their people much success in the difficult tasks of national construction awaiting them. The admission of each of those three States is in itself a historic event of great significance.\n48.\tFor-the People's Republic of Bangladesh, it represents the crowning of long and patient efforts undertaken, with the assistance of the international community, by Pakistan, India and Bangladesh itself to put an end to the painful crisis that had torn the Indian sub-continent apart in 1971. In this respect, we cannot pass over in silence the historic Simla Agreement of 1972, on bilateral relations between India and Pakistan, which laid the foundations for that settlement.\n49.\tFor Grenada, admission to the United Nations has put an end to more than 200 years of colonization in that West Indian island.\n50.\tFor the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, this extremely happy event is both a fruition and a beginning. It is a fruition because this 138th Member of the Organization has thus been given international recognition after so many years of heroic struggle under the banner of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [.PAIGC]. It is a beginning because the process of decolonization begun by the new Portugal has only just got under way. We would therefore express the hope that that process will be pursued so that the representatives of peoples still under Portuguese colonial administration who are engaged in the same kind of liberation struggle will very soon be able to take their places among us here.\n51.\tWe cannot talk of the independence of Guinea- Bissau without paying a warm tribute to all the freedom fighters, to the martyrs of the PAIGC and the glorious action of its leader, Amilcar Cabral, that outstanding figure of fighting Africa who fell on the field of honor.\n52.\tLast year, after having set forth at the twenty- eighth session the views of my Government on the international situation and having defined its position with regard to the problems of survival facing our society, I concluded my statement by saying that \\\"we have no choice but to work jointly for the coming into being of a new international order based on justice and equity.\\\" [2145th meeting, para. 145.] Such a choice requires from us, above ail, courage and political will to discharge fully our responsibilities before history. It cannot, therefore, be reconciled with bad compromises and inconsistent agreements which only skim over the surface of the vital problems of our times. Nor can it be reconciled with colonialism, racism and apartheid, which are still rife in the world.\n53.\tIn spite of certain developments in the field of decolonization in the territories under Portuguese administration, since the coup d'etat which, in Lisbon, on 25 April 1974, overthrew the Fascist regime of Caetano, the spiritual heir of the dictator Salazar, millions of people still remain deprived of their freedom. And while we welcome the agreements concluded on 7 September 1974, at Lusaka, between the Frente de Liberta$ao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] and the Portuguese Government, we are nevertheless apprehensive about the future of Angola and the other territories under Portuguese administration, because of the unsuccessful coup of.the white extremists in Mozambique and the most recent crisis which erupted within the new regime in Lisbon. Those events should, in our view, prompt the Portuguese Government to act more quickly and firmly in carrying out its program of decolonization and to apply the agreements already concluded or about to be concluded with the liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU].\n54.\tThe State of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands must, without further delay, recover its national unity and territorial integrity.\n55.\tThe United Nations, for its part, must remain vigilant and assume its responsibilities vis-a-vis the peoples of the territories under Portuguese administration. It cannot recover from a further affront of the kind inflicted on it by the rebel Ian Smith regime.\n56.\tWhile decolonization has made some progress in the territories under Portuguese administration, we cannot say as much for the rest of Africa. Indeed, apart from the undertaking of the French Government to give independence to the Comoro Archipelago in 1975, with respect for its territorial integrity, we have seen no encouraging sign for the other territories under colonial domination.\n57.\tWe will venture to hope that, in their awareness of the irreversibility of the course of history, the other colonial Powers will emerge from their immobility and, in accordance with the provisions in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], will promote the decolonization of the last remaining territories under their domination.\n58.\tThis is the place to make an urgent appeal to Spain to put into effect as soon as possible, and in consultation with the sister States of Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria, the relevant resolutions adopted by the various bodies of the United Nations on Spanish Sahara.\n59.\tOn the question of the Comoro Archipelago, we have no doubt that the French Government will associate itself fully, in the consultations which are to lead to the independence of the Territory, with the Mouvement de liberation nationale des Comores [MOL1NACO] and with all the political exiles of the country, in accordance with the recommendations in the decision adopted by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples on 6 September 1974.\n60.\tWith respect to Southern Rhodesia, the white usurpers continue to defy the United Nations, with the complicity cf the administering Power. The people of Zimbabwe, who in 1972 rejected the Anglo-Rhodesian proposals for a settlement, once again demonstrated its standing as a great people by refusing this year to lend itself to the electoral masquerade which was organized on 30 July by the Salisbury rebels.\n61.\tThe repugnant and criminal theory of racial superiority has been reflected in Southern Rhodesia in the deprivation of the political and civic rights of the black majority, the proliferation of homelands, which are nothing but concentration camps, and the recrudescence of political assassinations. The manhunt organized against the inhabitants of Musiwa last February, and the ensuing summary and public execution of the leaders of that village give us, if there is any need for it, some idea of the sufferings the people of Zimbabwe have endured for more than 10 years.\n62.\tThe United Kingdom bears responsibility for this and should follow the example of Portugal, which, although it did not enjoy the same degree of military or economic power, nevertheless succeeded, early in September, in crushing the revolt of the white extremists in Mozambique and in establishing law and order.\n63.\tThe United Nations has tried in vain to exert pressure against the rebel Salisbury regime. The most recent to date, that is to say the economic sanctions decreed by the Security Council, were breached by some of its most influential members. For our part, we have in any case never believed in the virtues of those sanctions.\n64.\tThe Assembly should learn the proper lessons from this and prevail upon the administering Power to discharge all its responsibilities towards the Zimbabwe people, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and the resolutions adopted on the question.\n65.\tAlthough primary responsibility for the Rhodesian crisis falls to the United Kingdom, as the ad-ministering Power, responsibility for Namibia, on the other hand, a territory under the trusteeship of the international community, lies entirely with the United Nations. Unfortunately, the United Nations finds its actions thwarted by the allies of South Africa, that is to say the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] Powers.\n66.\tThe racist regime in Pretoria has naturally taken advantage of this situation to extend its authority to that territory and install and reinforce there its odious policy of racial segregation. Patriots are persecuted, citizens relegated to homelands, while the white settlers who have come from South Africa and the representatives of foreign interests are engaging\nin a systematic plunder of the country's resources.\n67.\tThe Secretary-General himself recognized this in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, when he says: \\\"It is with regret that I report that there has been no improvement in the internal situation in Southern Rhodesia, while in Namibia conditions continue to deteriorate.\\\" [A196011 Add., sect. IX.J\n68.\tThe appointment, in December 1973, of the United Nations Commissioner for Namibia has not brought us any closer to a settlement of the question, except for the attempts at dialog which had previously been made by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative. The Organization must get out of its rut and assume with more determination its proper responsibilities in Namibia, the very responsibilities derived for it from the Charter and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the question.3\n69.\tThe panorama of white power in southern Africa would not be complete if we did not give some account of the repugnant policy of apartheid which over-shadows and casts opprobrium on the regime of Pretoria. This Power, which has been placed in the dock by the international community for more than a quarter of a century, has recently been associated with an influential member of the Security Council in carrying out military maneuvers in the Indian Ocean. This is the same Power that some members of the Security Council, heedless of the appeals of the international community, are enthusiastically arming against the defenseless populations of Azania, with the secret ambition of turning that country into a bulwark of their wars of colonial reconquest.\n70.\tIt is for all those reasons that the Assembly, by its resolution 3207 (XXIX), wisely rejected the credentials of the representatives of the racist regime of Pretoria and called upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa in the light of the constant violation by South Africa of the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n71.\tThe conflagration ignited in southern Africa by the partisans of racism will not, of course, consume that part of the world alone, for the events in the Middle East have dismissed the very carefully thought out theories on the localization of conflicts. Indeed, the world found itself last October on the brink of world war because it allowed injustices and acts of gratuitous provocation to pile up over the years in the Middle East. Instead of trying to bring about a general settlement of the Middle East crisis, we have, since 1967, been content with provisional solutions which, far from creating the essential conditions for lasting peace in that part of the world, have led to a situation of stagnation: neither war nor peace.\n72.\tWe needed to await the Israeli-Arab confrontation of October 1973, and the fears to which it gave rise, in order to make some progress towards a final settlement. Apart from the opening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East this year, other developments included the signing by Egypt and Israel on 18 January and by Israel and Syria on 31 May of agreements on disengagement of forces. A few rays of hope have thus emerged, but they have been rapidly stamped out because of the expansionist designs of Israel, which continues to occupy Arab territories and to deprive the Palestinian people of its homeland.\n73.\tThe just and lasting peace the international community would like to see established in the Middle East cannot come about until all the Arab territories have been evacuated by Israel and until the national fundamental rights of the martyred people of Palestine have been restored.\n74.\tThe Palestinian problem is not one which presents itself in humanitarian terms, which is how it has been represented for more than 30 years now, but rather in political terms, because it relates to the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination.\n75.\tNo definitive solution can be found for the Israeli-Arab crisis without the effective participation of the Palestinian people in the search for that solution. The Palestinian problem, as we see it, is at the very heart of the Middle East tragedy. The delegation of my country has had occasion to make that point in all the international bodies that have dealt with the question from 1967 until this very day. That is why my country takes pleasure in today seeing the General Assembly sharing its views and finally-embarking upon the course that should lead to the final settlement of the Middle East crisis. The inclusion in the agenda of this session of the question of Palestine [item 108] should be understood in that sense.\n76.\tThis year, the Mediterranean, at another of its nerve centers, the island of Cyprus, has been the scene of distressing events. We have followed very closely and with great concern the development of that crisis, because Cyprus and Mali both belong to the third world and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\n77.\tThe Cypriot State, composed of two communities of Greek and Turkish origin, respectively, has ceaselessly struggled to reaffirm its national independence and identity. The fragile equilibrium that had been maintained with the support of the United Nations was abruptly broken by the coup d'etat of 15 July, fomented by imperialism -a coup d'etat which entailed unutterable suffering for the Cypriot people.\n78.\tThrough those developments, the crisis called into question the very existence of Cyprus as an independent State. It must therefore be the task of the Organization, which has the question before it, to work above all for the safeguarding of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that Member State. It must require and obtain the withdrawal of all foreign troop stationed on the island of Cyprus. Any attempt to solve the crisis which fails to take account of those fundamental facts is doomed to failure.\n79.\tAlthough, in the last year, the Organization has had to its credit the settlement of the grave crisis in the Indian sub-continent and the bringing about in Laos of national concord, it is nevertheless a fact that the picture in Asia is very dark indeed.\n80.\tWhile the war in South Viet Nam and Cambodia continues with disturbing ferocity, foreign intervention continues to maintain the Korean crisis, with everything that implies as a threat to peace.\n81.\tIn spite of the efforts of the Provisional Revolutionary Government, the hopes born of the conclusion, in 1973, of the Paris Agreement on Viet Nam vanished as a consequence of the repeated violations by the Saigon administration and its imperialist masters. The International Commission of Control and Supervision has in fact been paralyzed.\n82.\tIn its diversionary attempts, the Thieu regime is multiplying its provocative acts against the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, is violating its airspace and exerting pressure along its frontiers.\n83.\tIn Cambodia, the Lon Nol regime has, for more than a year, been kept inside its capital by the patriotic forces of the Royal Government of National Union, which controls the whole country, apart from a few pockets.\n84.\tIn Phnom Penh itself, in spite of an infernal machine of repression elaborated by the regime, the opposition is maintaining a climate of constant agitation while the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, organizes the administrative, political and economic life of the liberated regions.\n85.\tIn Korea, where the General Assembly's dis-solution, last year, of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea [UNCURK] was welcomed as a first step towards normalization of the situation, the people are finding it harder and harder to tolerate the presence of foreign troops on the demarcation line.\n86.\tThe consensus on the Korean question, adopted by the General Assembly on 28 November 1973,6 far from having encouraged the Seoul authorities to resume negotiations with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has, rather, encouraged them to adopt a negative attitude.\n87.\tIn Seoul, there is total insecurity. The administration resorts to repression in order to stifle the voice of the people, which is being raised to call for the departure of foreign troops and the independent reunification of the country.\n88.\tThe puppet regimes established by imperialism in Saigon, Phnom Penh and Seoul constitute, as we can see, the main obstacles to the return of peace in Asia, and that is why they have been rejected by the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Korea. They owe their survival solely to the vast material and human resources imperialism uses in their countries to protect its interests in Asia.\n89.\tIt is certainly worth recalling that the covetousness aroused by the vast potential of the Gulf of Tonkin was behind the launching of the second Indochina war, which is still going on.\n90.\tThe Organization cannot continue to identify itself with those regimes without renouncing its primary mission. It is therefore high time for it to meet the aspirations of the peoples of South-East Asia, which have not known the joys of peace for more than a quarter of a century, by calling on the Thieu Ad-ministration correctly to apply the Paris Agreement, by restoring to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia its legitimate rights in that country, and by withdrawing foreign troops stationed in Korea under the flag of the United Nations.\n91.\tBy leaving to the parties the task of settling their dispute free from foreign interference, we should at the same time be promoting a resumption of the peace process that was blocked in that region by traitors to their country, manipulated by imperialism.\n92.\tCertain statements made in the course of the twenty-eighth session suggested that real progress would be realized in 1974 in the field of disarmament. In fact, one year after those proclamations, we are obliged to note that no substantial agreement on disarmament has been concluded and that, in fact, the arms race has intensified, the club of nuclear Powers has expanded and the rate of research on and development of nuclear weapons has accelerated. The two major Powers have passed from the second-generation nuclear arms, that is, the remote-controlled multiple-warhead missiles (MIRV), to the third generation, the \\\"Tridents\\\" (MARV) , which are capable of evading the anti-missile missiles. More than $200,000 million is swallowed up every year in the arms race, to the detriment of development. In .such an atmosphere of unbridled competition, and given the mutual outbidding of those States, the efforts of the international community to achieve general and complete disarmament can only be in vain. Intensive armament still seems to be the only guarantee of the security of States.\n93.\tThere is no doubt that this is where we find increasingly emerging the selfishness and vanity of man, when we realize that just one quarter of the sum of money spent every year on such arms and missiles could save more than 1,000 million human beings from poverty, hunger and disease. My delegation will go into detail on this distressing problem when the time comes. At this stage, we should simply like to express our total support for the proposals on the denuclearization of the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent proposed by the delegations of Iran and Egypt [AI9693 and Add.l to 3] and of Pakistan [419706], respectively.\n94.\tThe discovery of the immense resources of the sea is opening up new prospects for our development provided, of course, that this matter of the seas and the oceans can also somehow be removed from the sterile interplay of struggles for influence and policies of domination.\n95.\tAlthough it did not live up to the expectations of the developing countries, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Caracas, nevertheless made it possible for the international community to clarify its positions on the major questions debated there.\n96.\tThe Government of the Republic of Mali would like, for its part, to reaffirm its attachment to the OAU Declaration on the Law of the Sea with regard to the exploitation of marine resources by land-locked countries, the right of transit and of free access of those countries to and from the sea, and the establishment of appropriate international machinery for the exploitation of the resources of the high seas.\n97.\tWe would venture to hope that, at the next session of the Conference, in Geneva, the political will to negotiate and to arrive at final agreements on the exploitation of the sea's resources for development purposes will be manifested.\n98.\tAlthough there has been some progress towards detente on the European continent and beyond, particularly with the holding of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the beginning of a European-Arab dialog, we cannot but recognize that a certain separation of States according to their economic power is now apparent between the northern and southern hemispheres -that is, between developed and developing countries.\n99.\tFurthermore, the rich have been continuing to get richer, and the poor to get poorer. The affluent world, concentrating exclusively on its interests and trembling for them, has given voice to indignation and has uttered thinly veiled threats in the face of the rise in petroleum prices.\n100.\tWhile the deterioration of the economic situation which is being deplored today goes back a long way into history, it did not hold the attention of certain affluent countries as long as it was the third world that was bearing all the costs.\n101.\tThe developing countries, however, harbor no illusions, knowing as they do that the struggle of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to affirm the permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources is also their own.\n102.\tThe attempts made by certain Powers in their bitterness are doomed to failure.\n103.\tThe subtle theory of a \\\"fourth world\\\" or a \\\"quarter world\\\" invented by those same Powers in an effort to create a conflict of interests within the third world by trying to arouse the indignation of the least advanced among the developing countries is also bound to collapse.\n104.\tIn the current confrontation, the third world countries - which are the mayor exporters of raw materials -will close ranks around OPEC, because they are quite aware that the outcome of this trial of strength will decide the future of international economic relations.\n105.\tToday, the offensive is directed against the oil producers. Tomorrow it may be directed against the producers of copper, bauxite, sugar, uranium or coffee.\n106.\tThe energy crisis thus calls into question the whole edifice of the present economic order.\n107.\tThe sixth special session, devoted to the problems of raw materials and development, after having highlighted the absence of an overall plan to integrate the economies of the developing countries within a coherent world-wide system of production and trade, adopted two documents of vital importance: the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)].\n108.\tThat Declaration and Program of Action not only make an exhaustive analysis of the world economic situation but also indicate all the measures that should be undertaken in order to build a new international economic order.\n109.\tWhat we have to do now is to work for the total implementation of the recommendations made at that special session. Only thus will we be able to contribute to the preservation and maintenance of international peace and security.\n110.\tThe year 1974 has been a trying one for the people of Mali because of the persistence of a drought which has beset the Sudano-Sahelian region for nearly seven years. Thanks to international solidarity and my Government's perfect organization of assistance, the worst has been avoided.\n111.\tMy delegation feels duty bound, therefore, to thank warmly the United Nations and its specialized agencies, friendly States and all donors, public and private, that have rendered their assistance to us in our struggle to limit the effects of this terrible catastrophe.\n112.\tWhile we are about to attain this first objective, it is no less true that the problem itself remains, because the phenomenon is becoming chronic. That is why the last meeting of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel, held at Ouagadougou, in Upper Volta, with the participation of representatives of international organizations and other sources of financing, worked out a medium-term and long-term integrated economic development plan that would make it possible finally to eradicate this evil. Inasmuch as the necessary funds for the implementation of that plan are well beyond our means, the delegation of Mali would like to associate itself with the other States of the region in issuing an urgent appeal to the international community to take part in our crusade against drought, that challenge of nature which threatens the very existence of more than 30 million people in the Sudano-Sahelian region.\n113.\tWe await with great interest the holding, next November in Rome, under the aegis of the United Nations, of the World Food Conference. We hope it will do everything it can to find final solutions for the distressing problem of hunger in the world.\n114.\tAs the survey of the international situation I have just undertaken has shown, the world is at a crossroads: while the old order based on imperial rights is disappearing, a new era of justice and effective solidarity can be glimpsed on the horizon. This historic turning-point may mark either the breaking apart or the meeting of the two hemispheres.\n115.\tAlthough it is always difficult to give up centuries-old privileges, we have no doubt that all sides will appreciate the danger of disintegration that threatens us and will opt for the second alternative that of building a new international order in which problems will be viewed in a world context, as was recommended to us at the historic sixth special session of the Assembly. In so doing, we would be coming close to fulfilling one of the fundamental purposes of the Charter. My delegation would venture to hope that this twenty-ninth session will take a very big step in that direction.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives my delegation great pleasure to offer you warm felicitations on your election as President of the General Assembly. We regard this election as recognition cf the notable role played by Algeria in the furtherance of the just causes of the third world. You are a symbol too of the dynamic and resurgent forces of liberation that animate the great continent of Africa, forces which will continue to have our resolute support.\n78.\tI should like to take this opportunity to pay our tribute to Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador, who presided with distinction over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly, as well as over its momentous sixth special session.\n79.\tI wish to express also the distress of my country at the appalling tragedy that has struck Honduras and to convey to those who have suffered the deep sympathy of the people of Pakistan.\n80.\tMy country joins other Members of the United Nations in welcoming the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau as new Members of this Organization. We look forward to the distinctive contributions we know they will make to the work of the United Nations.\n81.\tThe past year has taken us somewhat closer to the realization of the objectives of the Organization. There have been welcome serious moves to resolve the long-standing Arab-Israeli conflict in order to bring peace to the Middle East. In Africa, a momentous step has been taken towards decolonization. The Third World has succeeded in promoting widespread recognition of the need for a more equitable international economic order. These are positive developments, but we have? yet far to travel to reach our goal.\n82.\tThe world is still haunted by a pervasive sense of insecurity and, as a result of the mounting inflationary pressures, the poorer nations face a desperate struggle for economic survival.\n83.\tThe detente between the super-Powers has gone some considerable way in relaxing tensions in Europe. It does not, however, encompass all regions of the world. To say this is not to belittle the important agreements that have been reached between these Powers. In the field of disarmament the strategic arms accords are in the nature only of preliminary steps in the direction of arms control. But* in absolute terms and in the context of the commitments undertaken under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], they fall considerably short of what the world expects from these Powers in the matter of promoting the objective of general and complete disarmament. Undoubtedly, this is not a matter which lends itself to a quick solution. Nevertheless, the progress so far made has been painfully slow.\n84.\tOn the other hand, the development of science and technology, particularly nuclear technology, has proceeded apace. Today, a large number of countries can acquire, should they so choose, the capability to develop nuclear weapons. That they might actually do so was brought sharply home to the world by the explosion of a nuclear device this year by yet another country, India. This is a development of grave import.\n85.\tThe Government of India affirms that its nuclear explosion was intended entirely for peaceful purposes. The real difficulty lies in the fact that, in technological terms, there is no difference between a nuclear explosion for peaceful purposes and one that is conducted to develop a nuclear weapon. There is the further danger that India's experiment may have removed the restraint on nuclear proliferation and, unless effective safeguards can be provided against it, the Indian example may be emulated by others.\n86.\tIndia's nuclear explosion came up for discussion at the Fifth Islamic Conference, attended by 37 countries, which met in Kuala Lumpur in June this year. It unanimously adopted a resolution which, inter alia, called upon all nuclear-weapon States to give a solemn undertaking in the nature of an obligation not to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear- weapon State. In the view of my Government, such an undertaking is necessary not only in itself: it is needed also if nuclear proliferation is to be checked.\n87.\tThere is one other line of action which might be fruitfully pursued in our search for security. It is now widely recognized that the goal of general and complete disarmament can be brought nearer by collateral measures such as the establishment of nuclear- free zones in various parts of the world. The General Assembly has commended this idea on several occasions. The non-nuclear States Conference also adopted a decision to this effect in 1968. The countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] have taken a similar stand against the introduction of nuclear weapons in their region. The Organization of African Unity [OAU] has taken the same position with regard to Africa. In Latin America, a treaty is already in effect aimed at making that area a nuclear-free zone. On this year's agenda [item 101] there is a similar proposal, jointly introduced by Iran and Egypt, with regard to the Middle East.\n88.\tNearly two years .ago the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, proposed that South Asia should be declared a nuclear-free zone [see AI9706, explanatory memorandum, para. 2]. Other countries of South Asia have also proclaimed their opposition to the introduction of nuclear weapons into the region, or their acquisition. Sri Lanka conceives the zone of peace in the Indian Ocean proposed by it as being free of nuclear weapons. The Government of India also has repeatedly asserted that it has no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons and remains opposed to military uses of nuclear energy.\n89.\tPakistan feels that this common desire of the States of South Asia now needs to be translated into a formal arrangement. A model for such an agreement already exists in the Treaty of Tlatolco. That treaty net only contains an unequivocal commitment by the regional States not to acquire or manufacture nuclear weapons: it establishes a regime for independent observation and verification of explosions conducted for peaceful purposes as a safeguard against the diversion of peaceful nuclear programs to military ends.\n90.\tWe are confident that all Members of the United Nations that desire to promote a climate of peace in South Asia and all those that, like us, feel concerned at the prospect of nuclear proliferation will welcome the proposal to declare the South Asian region a nuclear-free zone. Pakistan considers that the proposal to create such a zone in the Middle East also is a timely initiative, for the danger of nuclear proliferation looms large in that area as well.\n91.\tWe are happy to note that the situation in the South Asian subcontinent is progressively returning to normal. Bangladesh was recognized by Pakistan in February of this year. By the end of April, following two agreements between Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, all of the prisoners of war had been repatriated to Pakistan. And thanks to the very valuable assistance given by the United Nations under the able leadership of its Secretary-General, some 250,000 Bangladesh and Pakistan nationals stranded in either country had been repatriated to their homes by a massive air operation. These developments cleared the way for further steps to be taken for the normalization of the situation in the subcontinent as envisaged in the Simla Agreement.5 Accordingly, experts of the two countries met recently and concluded an agreement for the restoration of postal and telecommunications and travel facilities between the two countries. They also agreed to examine the questions of resumption of air links and trade at an early date.\n92.\tIt is obvious that normalization of relations is not an end in itself; it is only a means of achieving the larger objective of peace, so that the peoples of the subcontinent may be able to devote their pitifully limited resources principally to eradicating poverty and hunger rather than fritter them away in senseless conflict and confrontation. A firm commitment to the principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect for the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of each country and a just and equitable settlement of their differences remain essential prerequisites to the building of a durable structure of peace.\n93.\tThe presence of Bangladesh as a Member of the United Nations marks a new relationship between the peoples of Bangladesh and Pakistan. The fraternal sentiments that animate them were vividly reflected in the warm welcome accorded to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman when he visited Lahore to attend the Islamic Summit Conference and in the tumultuous welcome Prime Minister Bhutto received when he arrived in Bangladesh. Undoubtedly some problems remain to be settled. Given goodwill and understanding, these too, we hope, will be solved. It is now increasingly recognized by the people of both countries that they must rise above the tragic events of 1971 and, in their mutual interest, work as sovereign and equal nations for the establishment of a friendly and co-operative relationship,\n94.\tAgainst the background of these developments aimed at promoting subcontinental reconciliation and reinforcing the foundations of peace in the region, it is a matter of considerable disappointment to us that our relations with our other neighbor, Afghanistan, should be strained at this moment. This is all the more unfortunate when every consideration -historical, geographical, political, cultural or economic demands that the relations between the two countries should be especially close and friendly. We trust that the present unsatisfactory state of these relations is only a passing phase. It is the settled policy of my Government that we establish \\\"the best possible relationship with Afghanistan\\\" and, so far as we can, we will continue to work towards that end.\n95.\tDuring the last year, war has erupted in two areas. On 6 October last year the fourth Arab-Israeli war broke-out the inevitable consequence of international failure to help settle the issues arising out of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. A cease-fire was brought about as a result of Security Council resolution 338 (1973) of 22 October. That was followed by a period of intense diplomacy and, thanks to the remarkable efforts of Mr. Henry Kissinger, the United States Secretary of State, and the sense of realism displayed by the parties to the conflict, the guns were silenced and the disengagement of forces was eventually effected.\n96.\tBut disengagement is no settlement. By itself it is not peace. It is only a preliminary step towards facilitating negotiations for a peaceful settlement. The Islamic Summit which met in Lahore in February this year unanimously resolved that the essential elements of a durable settlement are: first, the Complete withdrawal by Israel from the Arab territories occupied by it; second, the full restitution of the national rights of the Palestinian people; and third, the restoration of Arab sovereignty over Jerusalem. All these elements derive from the principles of a just peace in the Middle East set out in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Short of a settlement on these lines, there will be no durable peace in the'Middle East.\n97.\tIn July fighting broke out in Cyprus following a coup d'etat against its constitutionally established Government, engineered by the Greek military junta in order to annex the island. This was a flagrant violation of the London, and Zurich Agreements, which guaranteed the independence of Cyprus. Turkey, which, together with Britain and Greece, is a guarantor of the independence of the island, moved in, both in order to discharge its obligations under those Agreements and to protect the Turkish community in Cyprus. It is fortunate that Greece now has a democratic Government and we hope that a lasting settlement can be achieved which fully safeguards the legitimate interests of both the Turkish and the Greek-Cypriot communities.\n98.\tIn regard to the Korean peninsula the encouraging trends which the Assembly noted last year have not produced the desired progress towards the reunification of that divided country. Pakistan will support any measures that the parties consider conducive to achieving the objective of peaceful reunification.\n99.\tThe presence of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau in this Hall today is an event of more than passing significance. It marks the culmination of a leng and unrelenting struggle by a people determined to free itself from colonial rule. It is the harbinger of the end of colonialism wherever it still exists. In bidding welcome to the representatives of Guinea-Bissau and expressing the hope that they will soon be joined by representatives of the other Territories under Portuguese control, we should like also to felicitate the new leadership of Portugal on the imaginative steps it is taking to liquidate its colonial empire in Africa in recognition of the legitimacy of the African liberation movement. We trust that the racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia will draw the necessary lessons from this development.\n100.\tI now turn to the grim economic crisis that faces the developing countries. The future of the peoples of South Asia and much of the third world is today threatened by a danger of global proportions. It is caught up in an inflationary squeeze. Vast populations in the developing countries suffer from hunger and privation while the developed world is preoccupied with its own problems of inflation and monetary instability.\n101.\tThese grave problems constitute perhaps the greatest challenge which at present faces the nations of the world rich or poor. They have accumulated over the decades, due in large part to the failure of the international community, and particularly the affluent nations, to accept and make the adjustments necessary to build a just and balanced world economic order, even when such adjustments were called for in the interests of the developed countries themselves.\n102.\tThe General Assembly demonstrated a welcome unanimity at its sixth special session last April on recommendations to deal with the immediate difficulties facing countries which have been most severely affected by the current economic crisis. A number of countries have responded to the emergency operation to be launched by the Secretary-General as a first step in the Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI), Special mention may be made of the generous assistance rendered by some of the oil- producing countries, particularly Iran, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and Venezuela. These countries are making commendable efforts, bilaterally as well as through multilateral channels, to ease the burden of the developing countries most severely hit by the high rise in prices. A much greater effort by the international community, however, would be required to assist these countries if the relief is to be commensurate with the magnitude Of the formidable difficulties they face.\t\n103.\tEmergency relief alone is no substitute for the more fundamental changes needed to prevent the recurrence of such a catastrophic situation. So far, there is little evidence of any progress having been made towards the new economic order called for by the sixth special session of the General Assembly [resolution 3201 (S-VI)]. Nothing is being done to improve the terms of trade of the developing countries, to provide them greater access to the markets of the developed countries, or to build a monetary system which ensures the transfer of the needed resources to the developing countries. Unless such fundamental changes are made to restructure economic relations between the industrialized countries and the third world, the developing countries may have to consider whether they can continue to play a game in which they are cast as the perpetual losers.\n104.\tMost of the policies being considered in world financial circles to deal with the current balance-Of- payments deficits of the developed countries give rise to doubts and fears. Those developing countries which do not produce oil may be further squeezed by the deflationary policies of the industrialized world. There may even be an actual transfer of their financial resources, in the form of payments for higher oil bills, to the developed countries and by way of the heavy investments being made by oil-producing countries in the industrialized nations. The eventual outcome of such a process could be an economic collapse in most developing countries.\n105.\tThe best way. to assist developing countries in their present economic difficulties is to ensure the injection of a substantial proportion of international monetary liquidity, in the form of investment and concessionary assistance, into the developing world. This would generate a greater demand for imports from the industrialized countries and help the latter to rectify their balance of payments. It would also open up a productive avenue for the investment of financial surpluses of the oil-producing countries and a source of supply for the commodities and goods needed by them for their own industrial and economic growth.\n106.\tThat is but one reason for the Third World to develop economic and technical co-operation among its own members. The Second Islamic Summit in Lahore, the Kuala Lumpur Conference of Islamic Foreign Ministers and the summit meetings of the non- aligned nations and of the OAU have all contributed significantly to the promotion of economic co-operation and unity of purpose among the countries of the Third World.\n107.\tBy maintaining that unity and promoting its economic strength, the Third World will be able not only to help to build a just economic order but would also ensure a more universal respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n108.\tWe can build the structure of a new democratic world order only on the basis of compliance with the principles and resolutions of the United Nations, on the basis of sovereign equality of States. The effort to secure this great objective must be carried on at every stage and every level of State relations, bilateral or multilateral/But it is in this world Organization that all these efforts can be synthesized and brought into focus.\n109.\tLet me therefore express the hope that this Assembly will carry us closer to the objectives, the purposes and the aims which the United Nations set for itself nearly 30 years ago.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, my first words will be to offer you my personal congratulations and those of my country on your election to the distinguished office of President of the General Assembly and to tell you of the hopes this gives us for the success and the efficacy of our work.\n105.\tA few months ago, in this very Hall, you participated actively in the special session on raw materials and development. Your election to the presidency of this twenty-ninth session rightly confirms the importance of the role you have played, and since virtually all international relations now fall within the realm of our debates, it provides you with an arena commensurate with your abilities and experience as a statesman. In honoring you, the community of nations is also honoring your country, Algeria. Everyone can understand why France has special reasons to welcome this.\n106.\tI should also like to pay a special tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Benites, who had the rare privilege during the past 12 months of presiding over two sessions of the Assembly, during which he displayed outstanding qualities as a statesman and jurist and was thus able to crown most prestigiously a career that had been so closely linked to the work of our Organization for so many years.\n107.\tLastly, I should like to greet Mr. Kurt Wald heim, with whom I have enjoyed a longstanding friendship. I should like to tell him of the trust and high esteem in which he is held by the French Government for his tireless efforts and for the competence and effectiveness he has shown in carrying out his extremely important and difficult tasks.\n108.\tThis is the first time that I have had the honor of speaking on behalf of France before this Assembly, a privileged forum in which to recognize that there is a basic truth which characterizes the modern world and will dominate our common destiny with increasing severity, regardless of the degree of development or the political philosophies of the societies to which we belong.\n109.\tIn this \\\"little corner of the universe\\\" -to quote Pascal- on this earth which the human eye has been able to contemplate in its entirety for the first time in its history a blue ball, an oasis of life in the blackness of space, a planet which scientific and technological progress has shrunk and at the same time unified by subjecting it to accelerated and profound change men, peoples and States arc dependent on each other and are becoming increasingly interdependent. The death knell will sound for everyone it we fail to appreciate this interdependence, if selfishness, fanaticism, the lust for power and domination threaten the possibilities for a sincere effort to seek together gradual and well-balanced solutions to the difficulties of our times, difficulties which our very progress only serves to accentuate.\n110.\tThe fine name of the United Nations thus takes on renewed significance. The enemy that we must confront together is underdevelopment; it is the tragedy of poverty and hunger which the past year, alas, has shown to be distressingly present; it is the turmoil that inflation is causing in international economic relations; it is disorder, inequality and injustice in all their forms; it is the remnants of racial discrimination; it is everything that still exists to hinder the full recognition of and respect for the rights of the individual and the rights of peoples.\n111.\tNeed 1 stress before this Assembly of nearly 140 nations-and I doubt that anyone can remain indifferent to a reminder of the great universalis! traditions of my country and the message it brought to the world almost two centuries ago that France, with the legacy of the French Revolution, is determined to strengthen the liberal nature of its diplomacy, to be in the vanguard of the peaceful struggle to give the world greater liberty, greater equality and greater fraternity?\n112.\tI should like to recall here the words spoken by the President of the French Republic last June when the Paris diplomatic corps was presented to him:\n\\\"This change signifies, lastly, that France, reaffirming and emphasizing her liberal mission, will do everything in her power to contribute to the dawning of a new era in international relations based on mutual esteem and respect and on a spirit of understanding and liberty, and, Under pressure from the peoples of the world, to ensure that the bastions of constraint and intolerance are toppled. She thus hopes to introduce into relations among States a greater measure of simplicity, trust and, may I venture to say, optimism.\\\"\n113.\tThe essence of the \\\"liberal\\\" philosophy which France advocates and which must, in our opinion, be applied by everyone to international relations is this: that order and justice are in no way contradictory but, rather, are complementary; that only progress towards political and economic order, coupled with consideration for the interests of each State, is likely to guarantee our international society the minimum of stability without which there can be no lasting progress for anyone.\n114.\tThis joint effort and the transformation it entails must, of course, be made without losing sight of the ultimate goal of our Organization. The intention to ensure peace and security by gradually eliminating the causes of conflict, whether political or economic in nature, must be matched by the constant concern to eliminate any desire for, or any possibility of, not only conflict but even confrontation.\n115.\tThe two basic principles which my country long ago initiated and advocated -namely, detente and cooperation - must therefore be implemented more and more at the international level.\n116.\tIn the midst of the alarming turmoil of today's world, it is sometimes difficult to perceive practical ways of implementing these principles. However, a closer look reveals a few breaches in the wall, a few rays of light of unmistakable brightness. We are living in a world of light and shadow. Perhaps it might be useful for me to state how France and the French Government currently view the causes for concern and the reasons for hope.\n117.\tYou will not be surprised if first, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, I turn my eyes to Europe. As current President of the Council of the European Economic Community, I can testify to the aspiration of our peoples gradually to organize themselves so that from their age old civilization there can emerge little by little a new political organization based on pluralism but capable also of unifying what must be unified.\n118.\tThis organization of Europe involves, first and foremost, for my country and for its partners in the Community, the creation in the western part of our continent of a coherent entity that will be capable of confronting the problems of our time; one that will be able to make a genuine contribution to detente and cooperation which are so necessary for our world if it is to survive; and, I might say, one that will serve as a model. The task begun nearly 25 years ago, right after a war which we decided would be the last, is not a simple one. But the leaders of our countries are determined not to miss the rendezvous with destiny which history has scheduled for our generation.\n119.\tThat is why you will hear the voice of the European Economic Community becoming more and more distinct. It will speak the language of peace, justice and reconciliation. For, although this Community must of necessity actively pursue its own development, it cannot and it never would wish to turn in upon itself. By virtue of its mission and by necessity as well, the Community is open to the world, alive to the hopes and needs of the underprivileged, aware of its responsibilities in international balance and progress. That is why it intends, through concrete and innovative action, to make its contribution to the necessary effort to restore order to economic, financial and, hence, political relations among the countries of the globe.\n120.\tThe Community is faithful to its traditional friendships, first among which is its friendship with the United States of America and Canada, a friendship which is even stronger now that it is yet better balanced and which is constant and indispensable to peace. And yet it does not forget the role that geography and history have allocated to it in the Mediterranean and in Africa, nor the close ties it has maintained with the Soviet Union and all the countries of Eastern Europe, whose contribution to our civilization is so important and with which we hope to foster genuine detente in the Old World. In this spirit we are taking part, as you know, in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, well aware of the scope of the undertaking and thus of the need to work towards the desired goal with great patience and wisdom.\n121.\tAnother source of comfort and confidence in the future stems from a new and important step our Organization has taken towards its goal of universal representation, which we are now close to achieving. We are happy to welcome in our midst during this twenty-ninth session the representatives of Bangladesh, Grenada and GuineaBissau.\n122.\tAfter the trials that marked its birth, Bangladesh, despite serious economic difficulties, courageously is embarking on the path that should lead to reconciliation and cooperation on the subcontinent. May the efforts made by the States concerned achieve the results that we all are hoping for.\n123.\tThere are two reasons why we can be pleased with the decolonization that is under way in the Portuguese Territories of Africa: first of all, because it has come about in connexion with a return to democracy in a country that is a friend of France, and secondly, because it is being done for the benefit of a whole group of courageous peoples that have long had many reasons to ask themselves why they were deprived of the independence which their neighbors enjoyed.\n124.\tI should like to hail the delegation of the Republic of GuineaBissau and convey to it our best wishes and congratulations. I should also like to pay a tribute to its members and to the representatives of the new Portuguese Government, a tribute that the political wisdom evidenced during the recent fruitful negotiations in Algiers rightly deserves. The European Economic Community, deeply committed to the values of the democracy on which it is founded, can only welcome any agreements which result in the practical application of the principles of selfdetermination on the continent of Africa. It feels that recognition of these principles will soon be extended to Mozambique and then to Angola. It welcomes in particular the agreement that was just concluded at Lusaka.\n125.\tAllow me to add at this point that France, which was one of the first Powers to foster self determination for many countries that are now influential Members of our Organization, is currently completing its own endeavors in this domain by preparing, with the agreement of the freely elected leaders of the Comoros, the accession to independence of these islands. The French delegation will in a few weeks be pleased to give further information which will emerge from the bill providing for an early referendum in the Comoro Archipelago.\n126.\tOther aspects of the world situation are, however, more disturbing.\n127.\tThe situation in Africa is still troubled by tensions and the injustices which persist in the southern part. I would like to record once again here France's complete disapproval of the policy of apartheid. Furthermore, France regrets that the efforts made by our Organization to begin a dialog with the Government in Pretoria with a view to leading Namibia to self-determination and independence have remained fruitless.\n128.\tThe situation in the Middle East is still marked by dangerous uncertainty. Following upon the tragic events which have taken place since our last session, disengagement agreements have been concluded thanks to the wisdom of the parties to the conflict and to the tireless diplomacy of the Secretary of State of the United States. These agreements and the stabilized situation on the battlefield, thanks to the control of the United Nations, are the first encouraging steps. However, we must not permit the momentum of peace to grind to a halt. The basic problems have not been settled. The situation is still precarious and it is therefore imperative that the negotiations should be resumed so that an equitable settlement can be reached as soon as possible, one that can be endorsed by the international community, that is to say, the Security Council.\n129.\tFrance for its part is still in favor of a settlement based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967), confirmed by its resolution 338 (1973), which provide for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, as well as for commitments to peace giving each State the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.\n130.\tFrance believes it is high time for the international community to recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, which this settlement should take into account. It is ready to contribute to the quest for a settlement based exclusively on the genuine interests of the peoples of the region and acceptable to the parties concerned -each and every one of them- among which my country is far from forgetting Israel.\n131.\tAlthough the crisis which broke out in Cyprus on 15 July and which was singularly exacerbated on 14 August had the highly positive effect of promoting a return to democracy in Greece -and I would like in passing to pay a tribute to the courageous efforts of Mr. Caramanlis- it is yet one more example of the serious difficulties we face this year.\n132.\tIn the first place, the crisis concerns the United Nations which, after trying to promote a settlement to the conflict by sending an international force to Cyprus in 1964 and more recently by sponsoring enlarged talks between the communities, must now do everything in its power to prevent the crisis from deteriorating and to facilitate a speedy settlement.\n133.\tIt is for the Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities in this matter, which it did as the tragic events unfolded by adopting resolutions that my country helped to draft, as was its duty. We remain convinced that respect for these resolutions by the parties concerned is still the indispensable basis for an equitable settlement.\n134.\tTroubled by this dispute and anxious to restore harmony in Cyprus and between two countries linked to the European Economic Community by the same tie, the nine members of the Community have felt it to be their duty, during the course of several meetings, to add their efforts to those of the Security Council.\n135.\tThe most serious problem in Cyprus today is, without question, that of the refugees. We feel that permitting these people to return to their homes freely is consistent with both justice and public international law. We therefore believe that we should make an urgent appeal on this point in the hope of preventing the inception of another tragic refugee problem such as those which, unfortunately, we have already had, which are poisoning the international atmosphere. The problem in Cyprus can be resolved only by negotiation, without recourse to force. In this respect, we consider the talks now under way between the leaders of the island's two communities to be encouraging. I hope that these talks will pave the way, if the necessary gestures are forthcoming, for the negotiations that we should like to see started among Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, countries to which we are bound by longstanding ties of friendship.\n136.\tThere is another region where war continues to wreak havoc in various but no less cruel ways, and that is SouthEast Asia. We welcomed the Paris agreements on VietNam and the hope that they engendered. Can it be said today that those agreements are really being respected? I am fully aware of the difficulties encountered by each of the parties; but how can one fail to hope that they will have the strength to overcome the legacy of the past and ultimately to achieve peace with understanding and reconciliation?\n137.\tFaced with these highly contrasting pictures, we can probably say that at least the danger of world confrontations involving the fate of all mankind seems to be less threatening than it was a few years ago.\n138.\tDetente is still fragile. The protective net that it could cast still hangs too slack. Detente obviously remains -and will long remain - linked to a sustained defense effort.\n139.\tFrance, for its part has, over the past 15 years, halved the proportion of its gross national product destined for military expenditure. But France has not neglected the need to ensure its security and independence by the means that others have already adopted. As a country that was the battlefield of two world wars, France is profoundly aware of the duty incumbent upon it to be capable of defending its independence. Having noted the refusal, and perhaps even the inability, of the greatest Powers to renounce their nuclear weapons, France has resolved, to its regret, to acquire them itself.\n140.\tWe too have had to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere, which, in terms of number and size, can in no way be compared with the tests previously carried out by others in the same field. We went ahead with our tests only when we were sure that they would cause no harm; and this was verified by our own controls and by those of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. We have now reached a stage in our nuclear technology that makes it possible for us to continue our program by underground testing, and we have taken steps to do so as early as next year.\n141.\tIf, given the present state of the world, no country can renounce the means of ensuring its defense, it is obviously in the general interest gradually to lighten the burden necessarily imposed by the arms race on our economies and, by the same token, on the opportunities for development. Therefore the French Government wishes solemnly to reaffirm that it is prepared to participate immediately in any undertaking designed to lead to genuine disarmament, that is to say, to the effective, gradual and controlled destruction of all existing arsenals. It was in this spirit that France gave its support to the idea of convening a world conference which, if it were to include the five nuclear Powers, might create the conditions under which real progress could be made and might strengthen the foundations for the lasting peace that is the highest aspiration of all peoples.\n142.\tAfter this brief review of the world picture as it is today, I should like now to come to what is doubtless the basic issue. I refer to the present state of international economic relations and the outlook for those relations. This vital problem does not appear on our agenda, but is should be, quite clearly, the focal point of our concerns, all the more so since the situation which prompted the convening of a special session of the General Assembly this spring has deteriorated markedly in the last four months.\n143.\tInsecurity is spreading far and wide. The most striking example of this is inflation, which is becoming rampant and to varying degrees affects every country with its attendant woes. All the elements of a world crisis are already present.\n144.\tThe developing countries, those which are not producers of oil or of important raw materials, are obviously those most affected by the rising prices of the products necessary to economic activity. But the majority of the industrialized countries have also been seriously affected, at least for the time being, There are only two or three major countries among us that are sure of having the resources indispensable to the survival of their economies and their populations, come what may, because those resources exist in their own territories. But although such States, unlike the others, do not have to fear strangulation, none, I repeat, none of the Members of our Organization can remain blind to the serious threats to the mechanisms of the world economy, to the flow of production and trade, and therefore, ultimately, to world peace.\n145.\tThe events we are witnessing are, of course, not lacking in positive features. The general redistribution of trump cards held by the highly industrialized nations and the developing nations begun by still disorganized courses of action will be described in history books as a decisive turning point of the era in which we live. This will be true if this redistribution proves itself eventually to be a transition to a new world order, better balanced and more just, and the prelude to an original and fruitful common effort.\n146.\tSuch a redistribution was both necessary and inevitable. My country, which in the past has constantly warned against the dangers inherent in the progressive deterioration of the terms of trade and in the growing gap between the industrial societies and the less favored countries, is the first to recognize that it would have been unhealthy and, ultimately, detrimental to everyone to cling to a system of inadequate remuneration for basic commodities. The prolongation of this system was doubtless one of the causes of the recent price rises.\n147.\tThis puts me in an even better position to say frankly to this Assembly that none of us can allow himself to ignore the urgency and gravity of the problem which the somewhat random nature of those increases presents not only to my country but, I believe, to all of us. Our world community can withstand the severe disruption of equilibrium that has just occurred only if we make a combined effort, on the one hand, to halt the trends towards a breakdown that are beginning to emerge, and, on the other, to achieve a new world order based on mutual consultation and cooperation.\n148.\tIn the spirit of the Charter, which for 30 years has encouraged us to cooperate in order to ensure economic and social progress for our peoples, appreciable efforts have already been made along such lines. The texts adopted on 1 May by the General Assembly during the sixth special session [resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 fSF/j] are in keeping with this tradition of the Organization. Their significance and importance, I feel, lie not so much in the Program of Action that was outlined as in the clear and precise affirmation of the interdependence of all the elements of the world economy.\n149.\tThat the growth of the world economy is currently being compromised and with it the opportunities for development is so obvious as to make it superfluous to stress the need to open up new vistas in cooperation among our States. Together we must define the main lines along which the world economy must operate. In this connexion, the right of the third world countries not only to receive a fairer share of the fruits of economic and world progress but also to influence the choices on which this activity depends cannot be contested. I would add to this the hope that international aid, which is still indispensable, will gradually give way to structural reforms in which the less favored countries should have a voice.\n150.\tAlthough the very great majority of the States that we represent have no intention of withdrawing into themselves, they reject the mechanisms of laissez faire, which are erratic and merciless to the weak, and my country, which has championed international cooperation for many long years now, cannot but give them our complete approval on this point. The march towards a better order is, however, incompatible with disregard for economic realities and laws, the solidarity which unites consumer and producer, and, especially, the basic consideration that no one, no matter how powerful he may be, can be sure of gaining lasting advantages by means of unilateral decisions.\n151.\tWithin a country, when one group in society tries to increase its share of the national income and when, on the other hand, other groups try to prevent their share from being reduced, inflation becomes rampant and restores, after a fashion, an often unjust and precarious balance between the claims of each group. Today this is also what is happening in the world's economy. The free rein given to market trends, the exploitation of strong positions, and the setting up of a sliding scale mechanism or of automatic indexing can lead only to a speeding up of the inflationary spiral. Among nations, as within each nation, nothing can take the place of dialog and negotiation among all the parties concerned. The natural framework for this dialog is, of course, the United Nations, and one can only regret that six months after the sixth special session no serious discussion on setting the world's economy in order has been initiated.\n152.\tThe United Nations, and not only its specialized bodies, has a general competence in this matter and is particularly qualified since it both anticipates and reflects the world community of the future to arrive at a truly \\\"integrated\\\" concept of our planet's economy. But this is a tremendous task and the adjustments to be made are numerous and difficult. The \\\"global\\\" approach within the United Nations must be supplemented by efforts at cooperation and consultation on a regional scale which should, of course, take place within an international framework.\n153.\tIt is in this spirit that the member countries of the European Economic Community have, as representatives know, just embarked on what we both call the EuropeanArab dialog with the 20 countries of the League of Arab States. Of course the undertaking is still in its early stages and it would be premature to specify its goals, but I think it is quite natural for me to mention it today in this forum, especially since you, Mr. President, have played and are continuing to play an important and even decisive role in the conception and application of this undertaking.\n154.\tThe new type of cooperation that we are trying to establish between the two groups of countries does set an example and is promising. It is a question of working together, with all the participants on an equal footing, towards social and economic progress, towards entente and rapprochement between the member countries of the European Economic Community and the member countries of the League of Arab States. It is also understood that the undertaking must not interfere with the interests of any country. On the contrary it must, when the time comes, extend its benefits beyond the European Arab group, especially to the regions close to Africa and the Mediterranean.\n155.\tMy hope is that it will be possible to present some results of this undertaking at the forthcoming session of the General Assembly. However, it might be useful, if our partners in the League of Arab States would agree, to inform the United Nations before that time of what developments may have emerged.\n156.\tIt is in the same spirit of cooperation that the European Economic Community participated in the ministerial conference which took place at Kingston, during which a fruitful dialog emerged between the countries of the Community and the Caribbean, African and Pacific States on the major political trends of their future association. The conference also set an example. Innovative formula were introduced which, I have no doubt, will help to create a new style in relations between industrialized and developing nations, and even in the drafting of a new strategy for development.\n157.\tThe European Economic Community and the United Nations are quite clearly called upon to cooperate more and more often. This is why my delegation, speaking on behalf of the Community [A 19701], has asked for an item to be included on the agenda for this session relating to the granting to the Community of observer status within the Organization.\n158.\tAnother example of this cooperation is quite obviously the Community's offer to participate, together with other States, in the urgent measures advocated by the General Assembly at its sixth special session.\n159.\tLet me say a word about the Organization to conclude my statement. The Charter assigns it the mission of maintaining peace and contributing to the emergence of a world that is more stable and more equitable. Let us not be complacent; the distance we must still travel before this ideal becomes a reality is great. But let us learn to apply to ourselves the severe judgments we sometimes bring to bear on the shortcomings and plodding of the United Nations. The Charter in itself possesses no magic formula, and no change could give it one. The work of the Organization depends primarily on the determination of the Governments represented here.\n160.\tOne cannot reproach the United Nations for having failed to discern the great issues at stake in today's world or for failing with respect to the great questions of the day because of a lack of imagination or indifference. The problems of development, hunger, the sea and population have been dealt with in four world conferences held under the auspices of the United Nations this year. Let us note, however, that the conclusions drawn from these major international meetings sometimes leave us dissatisfied. This is not only because it is difficult to reconcile so many interests and differing viewpoints, even when goodwill is present. It is, perhaps, also because our methods and our procedures could be improved by concentrating on the most important issues and on the search for effective action.\n161.\tWhile these international meetings have the advantage of exposing all points of view, the size and number of the meetings pose problems of organization, method and procedure that are quite different from those the smaller, earlier conferences had & solve. There is a great temptation to use certain stratagems in order to finish more quickly, and it is noticeable that States are in no hurry to put into practice recommendations that have not evolved through the conventional process. Let us then try to act in concert genuinely, in the sole interest of the common good. We can do so within the context of the present Charter, whose potential could be more fully realized.\n162.\tWe are living in an age of transition. All around us we find hope, efforts being expended, and the first stages of entente and union, but at the same time we see opposition, and conflict. Which trend will finally prevail? The one that will inevitably lead to our organizing ourselves and unifying ourselves or the one that will lead, albeit temporarily I hope, to hostility, violence and division? Which will prevail?\n163.\tThe future of this world never before so conscious of its potential unity, never before so torn by real divisions is still uncertain. The task of our Organization is to guide it in the right direction, but that is also and primarily the task of each of the States represented here. The choice is either organization and reason, or passion, violence, rivalry and confrontation, and eventually, chaos and misfortune for us all. The simple statement of this choice is sufficient to explain our determination and our faith in the emergence of universal reconciliation.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to express the sympathy of the Government of Oman for the Governments and peoples of Honduras and Peru for the natural disasters which have struck those two countries recently.\n23.\tMr. President, I should like, on behalf of the Government of the Sultanate of Oman, to express to you our heartfelt congratulations and our full satisfaction on your election as President of the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session. The long years of experience which you have acquired as Minister for Foreign Affairs of our sister country, Algeria, undoubtedly have, and will be, fully appreciated by the representatives here; and I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to assure you of our full support and cooperation in the conducting of our deliberations at this session.\n24.\tAllow me, Mr. President, to extend, on behalf of my delegation and my Government, our feelings of appreciation and gratitude to Mr. Benites, for his skill, ability and wisdom, and the excellent way in which he led the Assembly during its twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session.\n25.\tMy Government extends a hearty welcome to Bangladesh, Grenada and GuineaBissau as new Members of the United Nations, and we are quite happy and satisfied to see the representatives of those countries take their places among us here. Their presence here will undoubtedly add strength to the future steps to be undertaken by this international Organization. My delegation looks forward to full cooperation with the representatives of those countries. Meanwhile, we wish to take this opportunity as well to express to the Governments and peoples of the new independent countries all wishes for success and prosperity in the future.\n26.\tIn conformity with its firm foreign policy of supporting the rights of peoples to freedom and independence and the eradication of colonialism an d racial discrimination in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, Oman has actively participated in supporting the struggle waged by the peoples of Africa in Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. It is our earnest hope to see the peoples of those countries take their rightful places among us in the Organization in the very near future.\n27.\tThe free peoples of Africa have always resisted military invasions and colonial suppression. In their long struggle for freedom there are striking examples of sacrifice that call for our admiration. The Government of Oman has never failed to support the lawful and just struggle of all peoples for freedom, independence and self-determination. In so doing, Oman has lived up to its deep rooted respect for the dignity of the human being as evidenced by its noble and glorious civilization and its profound belief in man as the ultimate end of all endeavors.\n28.\tAs a country of the third world, committed to a policy of neutrality and nonalignment and of respect for and a deeply rooted belief in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Oman fully supports and favors the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We declare also our firm support for the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the region of the Middle East, the objective of which would be to eliminate the crisis prevailing in the area and to prevent it from reaching uncontrollable dimensions.\n29.\tEver since the creation of the State of Israel, the situation in the Middle Fast has been continually exploding in a series of crises, in many cases reaching a point where it threatened international peace and security. This can only be attributed to the obstinacy and arrogance of Israel, its policy of aggression in the area and its continuous barbaric and brutal crimes perpetrated against the peaceful inhabitants of the area.\n30.\tThe policy of terrorism and intimidation which has prevailed and upon which Zionist policy has been based ever since Israel was created has been made clear in a series of acts of aggression against the land and people of Palestine, beginning in 1948. That policy has now reached an unprecedented degree of violence and brutality. The aggression perpetrated in 1967 by Israeli forces against three Arab States, Members of the United Nations, led to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. We are still witnessing repeated bombings and military attacks against Lebanese territory, all aimed at the liquidation of the Palestinian people.\n31.\tIt is not surprising that the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories [AI98I7], established by virtue of General Assembly resolution 3005 (XXVII), emphasizes Israel's repeated refusal to comply with United Nations resolutions and its insistence upon and persistence in a policy which is in defiance of those resolutions. The report proves once again that Israel is continuing the policy of aggression which it has always followed since its creation in 1948. Israel still persists in activities which are in flagrant contradiction with the fundamental principles of international law. It continues to expropriate the land in the area and to expel citizens from their homes. The refusal of the Israeli authorities to cooperate with the Special Committee constitutes yet another defiance by Israel of the resolutions of the General Assembly.\n32.\tThe tragedy of Palestine and the agony and sufferings of its people compel us to demand that the Geneva talks be resumed immediately, so that lasting peace and security, based on justice and acceptable to the countries of the region, particularly Palestine as represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], may be restored.\n33.\tAs far as the problem of the Sahara is concerned, my Government fully supports the agreement reached by Morocco and Mauritania to refer that issue to the International Court of Justice. We appeal to the Spanish Government to accept that agreement and to cooperate in finding a solution to the problem through negotiations and within the framework of the friendly relations that exist between Spain and the Arab world.\n34.\tThe Middle East is now facing another serious crisis which has stirred and disturbed the international community. I refer to the problem of Cyprus. My country, as a member of the nonaligned group, firmly believes in the urgent need to protect the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus and to ensure full respect for its sovereignty, without any interference in that country's internal affairs.\n35.\tThe developing countries which are producers of raw materials are attempting, through unity, to reach an agreement and understanding with the developed countries. That, of course, necessitates their continual insistence on their right to own and exploit their own natural resources. That is why the countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] have affirmed their right to establish the prices of oil in the world. For years oil had been sold at very low prices, while the prices of all the commodities exported by the developed to the developing countries had been reaching astronomic levels. That is why the developing countries producing oil decided that it was fully within their right to raise the price of oil in order to meet the rising prices of the commodities they needed. The increase in the price of oil was not aimed against the economic interests of any country, developed or developing; it was aimed at reestablishing the situation on a basis of justice, where injustice had long prevailed.\n36.\tThe world is now facing a severe economic crisis such as it has never experienced before. Oman supports the principle of international economic cooperation and regards the resolutions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly as a basis for such cooperation between the industrialized and the developing countries. The economic interdependence of the international community makes international cooperation essential as the only means of averting the impending starvation and misery of all mankind. Oman firmly believes in the importance of the role of the United Nations in ensuring stability and security, which are the fundamental requirements for economic and social progress throughout the world.\n37.\tWe also believe in the importance of preserving the natural resources of land and sea, and, in conformity with that belief, my Government has concluded an agreement with the Government of Iran on the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Straits of Hormos and the neighboring waters, in accordance with the principles of international law and the aims and principles of the United Nations. We believe that the happiness of the people of the area and the achievement of a better standard of living for them will come about only through such joint efforts. Moreover, in an attempt to preserve our marine environment and in the furtherance of our public, social and economic interests, on 3 August 1974, my Government promulgated the Marine Pollution Control Act.\n38.\tAwareness of the importance of the sea and its role in the development of national economies prompted my Government to make a positive contribution in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held in Caracas from 20 June to 29 August 1974. The importance of that Conference is evidenced by the participation of some 150 countries in an effort to find solutions to various interrelated problems. The high percentage of participation in the Conference on the Law of the Sea is again evidence of the awareness of the international community of the importance of the sea and its resources in the development process of national economies and the ever increasing importance of reaching binding agreements on the use, exploration and exploitation of the sea and its resources. We followed with great interest the views presented at Caracas, and we declare here that, within our means, my country will assist and actively help and cooperate to bring about a definitive formula acceptable to all.\n39.\tBecause we believe in the collective responsibility of States in the efforts to achieve international peace and security, Oman joined the group of the nonaligned countries. We firmly believe in (the principles which guide the nonaligned countries and fully share the point of view of that group. Furthermore, we are fully convinced that no sacrifice on OUF part will be too great for the cause of peace and development and the well being of all humanity.\n40.\tThe steps being undertaken for an open and direct dialog between the Arab States and European countries for the purpose of defining a firm basis for cooperation also have our full support. Such cooperation indicates the awareness of all parties concerned of their mutual dependence. We hope that such cooperation when it does come about will also not only include economic and political aspects but also be a step forward for full ArabEuropean cooperation at every stage and in every field.\n41.\tI have tried to clarify my country's position as regards various issues facing the international community. Allow me to add here that the United Nations and the specialized agencies, in our view, have a greater role to play in resolving all these problems. I avail myself of this opportunity to reaffirm here our assurances that the Government of Oman will not hesitate or refrain from offering its help and from doing what is necessary to establish international peace and security in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic wishes sincerely to congratulate you, an outstanding Government leader of friendly Algeria, on your election as President of the General Assembly and to express the hope that the present session, under your skilled guidance, will make a new contribution to the cause of strengthening peace and co-operation.\n530. The delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic is deeply satisfied that justice has at last prevailed and the People's Republic of Bangladesh has taken its legitimate seat in the United Nations.\n131.\tWe are also happy to welcome among us the representatives of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, whose people have attained national independence through persistent and valiant struggle.\n132.\tWe extend our greetings to the new State of Grenada and congratulate it on admission to membership of the United Nations.\n133.\tAs we see it, the dominating feature of the present international situation is determined by the progressive deepening of the process of detente. As a consequence of the consolidation and extension of positive changes in the world arena, the principles of peaceful coexistence among States with differing social systems are increasingly gaining firm ground in international relations.\n134.\tA fundamental positive shift in the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, the two mightiest Powers, representing two differing socio-economic systems, has undoubtedly become an important factor leading to the improvement of the world situation as a whole. The positive outcome of the third Soviet-American summit meeting gave a new boost to the further relaxation of international tension and to the practical implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence and broadened the prospects of finding solutions to many of the burning contemporary issues. We submit that the agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States aimed at lessening the danger of war and curbing the arms race represent a constructive contribution to the cause of consolidating universal peace and security.\n135.\tThe ongoing process aimed at normalizing the situation in Europe holds a prominent place among efforts to improve the international atmosphere. A whole system of treaties and agreements concluded among the European States with differing social systems has already yielded fruitful results. This demonstrates that there always exist genuine possibilities of solving the most complex and thorny international problems. The holding of the final stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at the highest level, successful negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, and other measures, would undoubtedly represent an important step in the direction of turning Europe into a continent of lasting peace and mutually beneficial co-operation.\n136.\tThe development of events in other parts of the world is .promising, as a whole, despite existing attempts to aggravate the situation. As is well known, the termination of war and ,the restoration of peace in Viet Nam were a welcome start towards the removal of one of the most dangerous sources of international tension.. The Paris Agreement on Viet Nam and the Agreement on Restoration of Peace and National Accord in Laos have created favorable prerequisites for strengthening peace and stability, not only in Indochina but also on the Asian continent as a whole. Nevertheless, the complete normalization of the situation in IndoChina has not yet been achieved. The provisions of the Paris Agreement on Viet Nam have been violated systematically by the Saigon regime. The situation of conflict in Cambodia still persists. All this poses a serious obstacle to the attainment of true peace and security in the area.\n137.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic resolutely condemns the actions of the Saigon authorities and their patrons directed at sabotaging the Paris Agreement on Viet Nam. The political realities prevailing today in South Viet Nam should find a proper reflection in this Organization too. We therefore deem it necessary that the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam be granted permanent observer status at the United Nations and in its specialized agencies.\n138.\tCertain progress has been achieved in removing the roots of dangerous tension in the Middle East. However, the situation in that part of the world continues to give rise to serious concern because of the aggressive intentions and policies of the ruling circles of Israel, backed by imperialist and reactionary forces.\n139.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic holds the view that only complete withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Arab territories and full vindication of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine will pave the way to the settlement of the Middle East conflict. The interests of peace and good neighborliness in that region require the early resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all States directly concerned and the representatives of the Arab people of Palestine.\n140.\tAn important question concerning the withdrawal of all the foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the United Nations flag is on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly [item 104 (A)]. AS is well known, new opportunities for the constructive solution of the Korean problem are being created, thanks to the initiatives of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, aimed at the peaceful, democratic reunification of Korea. The united efforts of socialist countries and all peace-loving forces augment the possibility of that development.\n141.\tWe should note the positive fact that at the last session of the General Assembly a decision was adopted on the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification* and Rehabilitation of Korea.3 What the United Nations should do now is decide to withdraw immediately all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations so as to enable the Korean people to decide their own destiny by themselves without any outside interference.\n142.\tMy delegation considers that the tripartite meeting of representatives of .India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is one of the important recent initiatives. In our opinion, the agreement signed during the tripartite meeting has created favorable ground for the further normalization of the situation on the Indian subcontinent.\n143.\tAll those positive changes in international life have taken place thanks to the persistent struggle of the countries of the socialist community and all the progressive forces fighting to strengthen peace and security. At the same time, one cannot help but note that the opponents of peace and detente are trying, in particular, to create new hotbeds of international tension. Among others, the recent events in Cyprus testify to that. The crisis in Cyprus demands that we take urgent and effective measures to curb and root out the conspiracy of certain circles within the NATO bloc against the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, a State Member of the United Nations.\n144.\tThe criminal acts of the Fascist military junta in Chile, where fundamental human rights are being flagrantly violated, arouse profound indignation and protest around the world. The Mongolian people resolutely demands that the savage repression against Communists and other representatives of democratic and progressive forces of the country be halted.\n145.\tOur delegation would like to stress the importance of ensuring peace and security in Asia on a collective basis and the development of friendly co-operation among the States of the continent.\nIn that respect, the idea of creating a system of collective security in Asia which meets the vital interests of all peoples now assumes even greater significance.\n146.\tEnsuring security in Asia requires the patient and persistent efforts of all Asian States, their good will to consolidate and bolster friendly relations among themselves on the basis of the principles of respect for sovereignty, inviolability of frontiers, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force or threat of the use of force, equality and mutually advantageous co-operation. The creation of a system of collective security in Asia, the largest continent of the world, where more than half of the world's population lives, will undoubtedly promote the improvement of the international situation as a whole.\n147.\tThe appeal of the General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session for constant and urgent implementation of and adherence to all provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security and for an expansion of the area of detente so that it will spread all over the world [resolution 3185 (XXVIII)] sounds very timely.\n148.\tIn the present circumstances, when the nuclear and conventional arms race has not been checked, there is an especially pressing necessity for all States to pledge themselves not to use force in international relations and simultaneously to prohibit permanently the use of nuclear arms. The Mongolian delegation would like once again to emphasize that the Member States of the United Nations should strictly observe that principle and, furthermore, that the Security Council should as soon as possible elaborate the relevant provisions to make that a compulsory principle. That would represent an invaluable contribution towards the cause of strengthening world peace and international co-operation.\n149.\tDetente cannot be stable unless concrete and practical steps are taken in the field of arms limitation and disarmament. In the view of my delegation, the reduction of the military budgets of States is an effective means of limiting armaments. At its twenty-eighth session the General Assembly considered and adopted the proposal of the Soviet Union on the reduction- of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)]. The implementation of the decision of the General Assembly with the participation of all permanent members, of the Security Council would promote the efforts of States to limit armaments. That would make a real contribution towards the goal of accelerating the economic and social progress of developing countries.\n150.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that the time has become ripe to start practical preparation for the convening of a World Disarmament Conference. The conference would give a new impetus to international detente and would play an important role in solving one of today's pressing issues general and complete disarmament. In view of the useful work done by the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference, we deem it necessary to expand the mandate of the Committee so that it may undertake effective steps for the actual preparation of the conference.\n151.\tWe consider it abnormal that, in spite of the time that has elapsed since the adoption of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction, it has not yet come into force because of the halting pace of its ratification by Member States, In that connexion, we should like to recall the request of the last session of the General Assembly to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, which stressed the need to reach, as soon as possible, an agreement on* the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of all kinds of chemical weapons and their elimination from the arsenals of alt countries [resolution 3077 (XXVIII)].\n152.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic stands firmly for the complete prohibition of all means of chemical warfare and, together with other socialist countries, has proposed a draft resolution to that effect to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva.\n153.\tIn the present circumstances of international detente, the ratification of the Geneva Protocol of 1920s by those countries that have not yet ratified it assumes even greater importance. The Mongolian delegation, guided by the sincere desire to see that all States subscribe to the high principles of the Convention and strictly adhere to it, calls on all countries that have not yet done so to sign the Protocol and/or ratify it in 1975 in commemoration of the historic fiftieth anniversary of that important international agreement.\n154.\tIt is most regrettable that complete prohibition of all tests of nuclear weapons by all States has not been agreed upon despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of the countries of the world stand in favor of it. The provisions of the 1963 Moscow Treaty on the prohibition of tests of nuclear weapons in three environments continue to be violated. The people and Government of the Mongolian People's Republic resolutely protest the continuation of nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere and demand an immediate end to such tests.\n155.\tThe Mongolian delegation would like to stress the necessity of strict observance of all agreements that have been already concluded in the field of arms limitation and disarmament. We believe that the conference to be held in 1975 which will consider the progress of the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will play a positive part in further strengthening peace and international security. The success of the conference will be greatly facilitated if all countries, including nuclear Powers and those possessing considerable military potential, participate in it.\n156.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that the new proposal of the Soviet Union entitled \\\"Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well-being and health\\\" deserves serious attention and thorough consideration at the present session of the General\nAssembly. This Soviet initiative serves lofty humanitarian goals of precluding the use of achievements of modern science and technology for military purposes that have a harmful influence upon the natural environment, life and people's health. In this connexion we consider it necessary to elaborate and adopt a relevant international convention that would serve the lasting interests of all mankind.\n157.\tThe delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that the interests of further normalization of international relations dictate the elimination of all vestiges of colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination that continue to be one of the constant sources of tension and conflict in the world.\n158.\tSince the twenty-eighth session considerable changes have taken place in the process of decolonization. The recognition by the new Government of Portugal of the right of the Portuguese colonies to self-determination and independence; the admission of Guinea-Bissau to membership in the United Nations and other developments contribute to the acceleration of the process of the final liquidation of colonialism.\n159.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic adds its voice to the demands for scrupulous implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The international community must redouble its efforts towards the implementation of the comprehensive program for the struggle against vestiges of colonialism and racism adopted by the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 2621 (XXV)], and should render effective assistance to the liberation movements of Africa and to efforts to compel discontinuation of any outside support to colonial and racist regimes. Mongolia is one of the first States to have signed the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII), annex].\n160.\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations will be celebrated in 1975. That anniversary coincides with the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that our Organization should celebrate those significant anniversaries in a distinctive manner and take concrete and effective steps to secure the complete realization of the goals and principles of the above Declaration.\n161.\tThe political detente in the world creates favorable conditions for the positive solution of problems of international economic relations, particularly the problem of the economic development of the developing countries. The outcome of the sixth special session of the General Assembly, where the problems of raw materials and development were discussed, demonstrated once again the Close link that exists between economic and political problems. Our delegation has supported the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial spirit of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 320/ (S-Vl)] and the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)], which set out new and important principles of international economic relations.\n162.\tThe falling off in food supplies, the monetary and financial crisis and skyrocketing inflation in the capitalist world not only undermine the economy of the developing countries and exert a negative influence upon the terms of international trade, but also contaminate the international political atmosphere. That is why we believe that concern for the improvement of international economic relations should go hand in hand with concern for the further normalization of the international situation as a whole. The time has come to put an end to discriminatory practices in economic and trade relations imposed by imperialist and colonialist domination and to reshape the structure of international economic relations in the interests of promoting truly equal and mutually beneficial co-operation among States.\n163.\tMongolia, which this year celebrates its auspicious jubilee, the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic, has always pursued the policy of peace and friendship among nations. The people and Government of the Mongolian People's Republic will continue to exert tireless efforts for the consolidation of peace in the world. The Mongolian People's Republic welcomes the positive contribution of the United Nations to solving the acute international problems that threatened world peace and security.\n164.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic advocates enhancing the role of the United Nations in tackling international problems on the basis of the strict observance by all States of the provisions of its Charter. The United Nations, which in its activities reflects the ongoing positive changes in international life, should intensify its efforts to consolidate and promote the spirit of detente in order to make it global and irreversible.\n165.\tWe express our hope that the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will mark a new step towards the further strengthening of international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "I am very happy to extend my whole-hearted congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I take personal satisfaction in the honor that has been done to you and, through you, to your country, Algeria.\n3.\tI should also like to tell the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, how much we appreciate the intelligent and effective work he has been doing for years without respite.\n4.\tMy country welcomes the admission to the United Nations of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. The United Nations has thus taken a further step to-wards the ideal situation, which would be the presence of all the countries in the Organization.\n5.\tAs is clear from the statements already made here by heads of delegations during this general debate in which each year we draw up the balance-sheet of the world situation, there are really not very many grounds for general optimism, even if in some regions of the world for instance, the Middle East there has been a relaxation of international tension and a more favorable atmosphere for the quest for peace has been created.\n6.\tWe pay a tribute to all those who, displaying great realism, have during the past year contributed to the lessening of tension in the Middle East, to the point where today one can again hope for a peaceful settlement of the conflict which has been weighing on international relations for a quarter of a century. While only too often people seem to feel that they should criticize the role of the United Nations, I take pleasure today in emphasizing the fundamental contribution of the United Nations forces in the' disengagement of the belligerents, thereby making a decisive contribution to the maintenance of the cease-fire.\n7.\tThe United States Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, who has not spared himself in leading us step by step to this partial relaxation of the situation, realistically reminded us in his statement here on 23 September that progress can be made only in steps, but he said that \\\"Each step forward modifies old perceptions and brings about a new situation that improves the chances of a comprehensive settlement [2238th meeting, para. 55]. It is therefore only logical to draw the conclusion that we must not lose the momentum thus gained, for to do so would mean that the situation could again be aggravated and the temptation to use force could become stronger. I think I can say that there is a general desire to see the Organization play a paramount role in the next phase of the negotiations, whatever form they may take, and I am gratified to be able to note that fact.\n8.\tThe countries of the European Community, of which Luxembourg is a member, have been deeply concerned with the situation in the Middle East, a region to which they are bound by many ties woven by geography and history and with which they wish to maintain ever closer relations. Hence, they thus have been led to define their position on the conflict and have called, essentially, for the observance of the following fundamental principles: the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and the need to end the occupation of territory resulting from the 1967 conflict; respect for the sovereignty, the territorial integrity and independence of each State in the area and its right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; the necessity of taking into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinians in the establishment of a just and lasting peace.\n9.\tI am convinced that the observance of those principles will facilitate the search for a stable solution and thus will enable all the countries concerned to devote their best efforts to the economic development of the region rather than to the purchase and use of ever more costly and ever more lethal weapons.\nA/PV.2253\n10.\tOnly a few weeks ago we witnessed another tragic event, this time in the eastern Mediterranean. There was a coup d'etat in Cyprus, launched by irresponsible elements. It resulted in a series of murders and military actions, the displacement of thousands of persons and immense destruction in a country which had never been among the richest of the world. Despite prompt action by the competent bodies of the United Nations the Security Council, the Secretary-General and the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, and despite prompt diplomatic intervention, it was not possible to avoid the creation of this new hotbed of tension, not to say war. I think that a solution to this painful conflict must be found by negotiations between the parties directly concerned. There must not be a repetition of the mistakes which have made us lose so many years in the Middle East. Of course, it is permissible, and possibly even useful, for the parties to the conflict to make clear what they cannot accept, but they should not at this stage pose their requirements as pre-conditions. For there is the risk that, in placing certain conditions on the resumption of negotiations, one becomes locked in an impasse that can lead to the broadening of the forum of the discussion without necessarily increasing the chances of success.\n11.\tWith regard to the solution to this critical situation, I fully share the opinion expressed here a week ago by Mr. Callaghan, the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom [2245th meeting]. I, too, hope that the negotiations between the leaders of the two Cypriot communities will soon lead to positive results.\n12.\tIt should surprise no one that the head of Government of a small State linked, through the European Community, with both Greece and Turkey, and also with Cyprus, is much more concerned with the independence of Cyprus and the sovereign will of the Cypriots than with the desires and preoccupations demonstrated in other capitals, in Europe and else-where.\n13.\tOn the humanitarian level, the international community as a whole is invited, once again, to con-tribute generously to alleviating the suffering and repairing the damage. It goes without saying that we shall not be remiss in fulfilling our duty of international solidarity.\n14.\tIn my opinion, our Organization can learn several lessons from the events in Cyprus.\n15.\tIn the first place and Mr. Waldheim quite rightly highlights this important point in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the United Nations can effectively intervene in conflict situations only if it has the support of all its Members in the application of the decisions of its principal organs, and particularly the decisions of the Security Council concerning the maintenance of international peace and security [A I96011Add. I, sect. VII]. It goes without saying that in that respect the support of the permanent members of the Council is particularly vital.\n16.\tIn the second place, the two conflicts 1 have just mentioned show that mankind clearly remains more skilled in the art of war than in the art of restoring peace, as we can see if we compare the funds spent on. increasing war arsenals with those actually devoted to the quest for and the establishment of peaceful relations. The United Nations has a fundamental mission to perform here, one which is fully in accord with the primary objective of the Charter, namely, the maintenance of international peace and security.\n17.\tThe United Nations forces, in accomplishing their task in the Middle East and in Cyprus, have fulfilled with distinction the mission entrusted to them, and I bow my head in memory of the 40-odd members of the United Nations forces who made the supreme sacrifice, not as heroes of war, but as defenders of peace. These forces cannot, of course, be a substitute for real negotiations, which alone can create a new viable political situation.\n18.\tFor some time a great deal has been said about detente. Several speakers have already referred to the favorable development in the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, and this is obviously a source of satisfaction for all of us.\n19.\tFurthermore, let us recognize that for many years discussions concerning disarmament have nevertheless been carried out within the framework of our Organization and other international forums, and yet only modest progress has been achieved in this field.\n20.\tWe must regrettably note that, despite the existence of immense war arsenals which can eradicate all life on earth, the general arms race continues at a devastating pace and the budgets to this end increase regularly. Ever more sophisticated weapons are continually being produced and made available to an ever-growing number of countries.\n21.\tAt the report of all those armament policies there is a feeling of suspicion: none dares trust a potential adversary. Yet it is clear that this arms race cannot go on indefinitely, because it increasingly absorbs wealth which is essential for humanitarian purposes. Further-more, the risk of a fatal accident with incalculable consequences cannot be excluded.\n22.\tIn my view, the problem must be approached realistically. While complete disarmament must and should be considered as the ultimate goal, it is nevertheless more realistic on a short-term basis to consider an effective and controlled reduction of a given proportion of weapons. In this field as in others, the best is often the enemy of the good. It is in this spirit that my country participates in the Vienna talks on the reduction of arms in Central Europe.\n23.\tI referred earlier to the importance of trust and I remain convinced that without effective control it will be impossible to instill the trust that is needed to arrive at effective disarmament.\n24.\tWe believe that a general conference on disarmament might bring us closer to our desired objective, provided that it is preceded by an adequate preparation, bearing particularly on effective means of achieving that goal.\n25.\tThe rather poor record of this year nevertheless includes a most satisfying development, namely, the radical change in the policy of the new Portuguese Government in regard to its overseas territories. The distressing Guinea-Bissau affair has now had a happy outcome. Furthermore, Lisbon has accelerated its negotiations with the liberation movements in its other territories, and those negotiations have already produced agreements.\n26.\tFavorable developments of this kind are, unfortunately, not yet in prospect in South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia. These areas will doubtless be the last on the planet openly to suffer from a policy of racism. We must hope that the wisdom of all men will finally put an end to this suffering.\n27.\tTwo European countries, Portugal and Greece, are preparing to rejoin the family of truly democratic countries. For me, this is another positive factor of great importance which I cannot fail to welcome warmly from this rostrum.\n28.\tTogether with this, there is the very difficult evolution of the nine countries of the European Community towards economic and political .union. I shall not deny the complexity of this evolution, but it moves ahead relentlessly because of the determination of its sponsors, the originality of its approach and its very promising nature.\n29.\tAs was emphasized so eloquently the other day by the President of the Council of the Community, Mr. Sauvagnargues [2238th meeting], this Community will be both internally and externally a valuable guarantor of peace and justice and a powerful factor for progress and co-operation. Conscious of the dignity to which all peoples aspire, and aware above all of the needs of the least endowed, it feels that it must contribute substantially to the creation of a more just world order, one which is better balanced and able to meet the multiple challenges which face us all, taking realistically into account all of the factors and resources which condition our common survival beyond the short term.\n30.\tIt is with such an approach and with a view to a more effective universal co-operation that the nine members of the Community have requested the status of observer within this Organization.\n31.\tMore than a quarter of a century has gone by since the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the fundamental charter for safeguarding human dignity. In this respect I fully agree with the ideas expressed from this rostrum by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium [2244th meeting] and by other colleagues.\n32.\tWe are alarmed by the frequent reports which describe recent cases of the use of torture, arbitrary detention or other degrading treatment, and we fully support any action taken to condemn and abolish such reprehensible practices. It is in cases of armed conflict that human rights are most often disregarded and populations subjected to great risks. One notes with growing frequency, however, that similar injustices are perpetrated in times of peace as well, in defense of so-called \\\"higher interests or ideals\\\". May those in authority in every country realize that no ideological consideration can justify recourse to torture, and that those who resort to  dishonor themselves and deserve to be placed outside the pale of mankind. Seizing innocent hostages who are alien to any conflict can never be justified anywhere, and those who still indulge in such abominable and cowardly acts can no longer lay claim to an ideology or popular cause. They are simply common criminals. If our collaboration in the United Nations is to have any meaning, all Member States here should, without exception, agree to abolish, as swiftly as possible, international gangsterism.\n33.\tIn our times, economic and social problems have acquired a growing importance, both nationally and internationally, since economic difficulties, as we all know, frequently generate political tensions.\nIt is therefore natural that international organizations, and particularly the United Nations, should concern themselves more actively with these questions.\n34.\tThe world economic situation has deteriorated in the course of the last year because of increased inflation, a shortage of certain primary commodities, and because of important changes both in trade balances and in balances of payments. It is symptomatic that economic growth should be negative in several industrialized countries which have to meet very high deficits in their balance of payments. As a reaction , too many countries have had as a reflex action the protection of their immediate national interests, without taking into account the needs of their neighbors. What could follow is a large-scale economic crisis. International co-operation has never been as necessary as it is today because interdependence is such that no country, even the wealthiest, can be sheltered from a world crisis.\n35.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly shed new light on these major economic and social problems which have accumulated over several years. It has made it possible to see a little more clearly what are the renewable and non-renewable resources of the earth.\n36.\tThe last year has nevertheless shown that the world economic system is not able to absorb too many sudden shocks, such as the quadrupling of the price of one raw material, oil, within a year. If one goes too far or too fast in isolated sectors without taking into account the whole economic picture, there may be breakdowns or violent reactions harmful to all to all, I emphasize.\n37.\tDoubtless, in the past the industrialized countries have not given all the assistance which they could and should have given to poorer countries, and an additional effort can legitimately be demanded of them. But that entails the obvious need that their own economies should not be imperiled by ill-timed rises in indispensable primary commodities.\n38.\tFurthermore, it is essential that all countries concerned clearly realize that if the world were to have an economic and financial crisis because of new exaggerated rises on so essential a product as oil, for example, the super-Powers would be the first to come out of such a crisis, and even come out of it strengthened economically and politically, while the lesser industrialized countries, like the developing countries, would feel the full weight.\n39.\tAs for the Special Program, under the Pro-gramme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)], to give emergency assistance to the countries most seriously affected by recent movements in international prices, the European Community is going to make a concrete and substantial contribution. For that operation to be really successful, all potential donor countries, of both East and West, and the countries which have a wealth of raw materials, should agree as soon as possible to exceptional and universal aid.\n40.\tAmong the major problems, we must still, alas, include famine in certain African and Asian regions. One of the main tasks of the forthcoming World Food Conference in Rome in November 1974 will be to consider this problem in depth, and recommend medium- and long-term measures so as to prevent shortages of all kinds in the future, particularly of fertilizers. But we must not lose sight of short-term needs, and must provide sufficient food for countries in urgent need of it. Countries in the drought zone of Africa are among those suffering most.\n41.\tFurthermore, the World Population Conference held a few weeks ago in Bucharest drew world attention to the growing importance of the problems of population growth. It goes without saying that one cannot expect final conclusions in so vast and complex a field. The World Population Plan of Action which was adopted by the Conference could not, by the nature of things, go beyond certain general guide-lines.\n42.\tBearing in mind the considerable decline in the birth-rate in most industrialized countries, they may soon have to face a serious problem of depopulation. This is the case in my country, where a certain balance is maintained only because of migration. On the other hand, many developing countries have a high rate of population growth, together with a substantial economic and geographical potential. Such a situation certainly presents problems, but stimulating problems whose solution appears promising. But it would be absurd to claim that an over-populated country with meager resources can ensure its development despite a high birth-rate.\n43.\tIt follows that a world population plan of action cannot be uniform. It is not a question of reducing the number of human beings at all costs everywhere, or, on the contrary, of believing that the more people there are, the more power, and indeed wealth, there will be. The main purpose of that world plan of action should be to ensure a better proportion between available resources and their present and future users.\n44.\tNext year we shall celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. Our world Organization was the result of the aspirations of mankind, which had endured the agonies of a devastating war and which placed its hopes in the attainment of a peaceful world that would enable all States to co-operate fully in order to ensure a better life for all peoples. In the course of that period, the fundamental objectives enshrined in the Charter have successfully stood the test of time and all the pro-gramme of international co-operation which has resulted will continue to constitute an indispensable framework and an essential condition for genuine international co-operation to flourish.\n45.\tHowever, it is not enough to support the United Nations with words alone. We must learn to make better use of the vast possibilities offered by our Organization and to develop them further so as to enrich our common heritage as much as possible; as the representative of the Netherlands said this morning so eloquently [2252nd meeting], we must make use more fully than in the past, of the many channels of international co-operation within our Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of my delegation, I wish to begin by congratulating you most sincerely upon your election to the high office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is particularly gratified by your election not only because you represent that dynamic country, Algeria, but also because of your own personal talents and skill which are attested to by your distinguished record both as a revolutionary and as one of Africa's longest serving Foreign Ministers.\n\n161.\tMy delegation has every confidence that under your guidance, the noble goals of freedom and justice, peace and progress, will be further advanced, for after all, these are the lofty objectives of Algeria's foreign policy, which, as in the case of my own country Zambia finds expression in the policy of non alignment. In this connexion, I hardly need to refer to your country's role as current coordinator of the activities of the nonaligned countries. My delegation is confident that the group of nonaligned countries will, as in the past, make a positive contribution to the success of the work of this session of the General Assembly .\n162.\tIt is also my pleasant duty to pay a tribute to. your predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador, for the efficient and judicious manner in which he guided the work of the twenty-eighth session and the historic sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n163.\tOn behalf of the party, Government and people of Zambia, I should like to reiterate the expression of our deep sense of sorrow at the tragic death of President Juan Peron of Argentina, whose contribution to the wellbeing of his people and to international peace and security will be long remembered by all, and in particular by the nonaligned countries.\n164.\tMay I also reiterate the profound shock and grief felt by the party, Government* and people of Zambia at the tragic death of Prime Minister Norman Kirk of New Zealand. The new policy of the Labor Government of New Zealand in relation to the situation in southern Africa which was initiated under' his leadership will continue to be regarded as a positive contribution to international peace and security.\n165.\tI wish, on behalf of my delegation, to congratulate and extend a warm welcome to the delegations of Bangladesh, Grenada and GuineaBissau on the admission of these States to membership in the United Nations. Their admission is a further step towards the realization of the principle of universality of membership of the United Nations. My delegation is confident that these new Members will play their full part in the achievement of the objectives of the United Nations in accordance with its Charter.\n166.\tDuring the past year there have been a number of significant developments in various spheres of international relations. It is my delegation's wish to address itself to some of these developments.\n167.\tIn keeping with our well-known policy, Zambia continues to attach great importance to developments in the field of decolonization. In this connexion, my delegation welcomes developments in the Portuguese, colonies. We should like to commend the liberation movements in Angola, GuineaBissau, Mozambique and the Cape Verde Islands, for the recent victories which have crowned their heroic liberation struggle for self-determination and independence. The overthrow of the Caetano regime on 25 April 1974, was a direct consequence of the dynamic struggle waged by the African nationalists. It heralded new and welcome prospects for peace and democracy in Portugal and self-determination and independence for the colonies.\n168.\tWe welcome the recognition by the new Portuguese Government of the Republic of Guinea Bissau as an independent State. We equally welcome the agreement for the granting of independence to Mozambique recently signed by the Portuguese Government and the Frente de Liberta\u00e7ao de Mozambique [FRELIMO]. In the light of the good faith which has so far been demonstrated by the Portuguese Government, we look forward to an early commencement of negotiations for the independence of Angola between that Government and the African nationalists. In this connexion, we are gratified to learn that the nationalist movements of Angola, namely the Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7ao [MPLA] and the Frente Nacional para la Liberta\u00e7ao de Angola [FNLA] have realized the need to unite in order not only to facilitate their negotiations with Portugal, but also to guarantee thereafter a peaceful, stable and prosperous Angola; As is well known, the Organization of African Unity [OAU], acting through a committee comprising my own country Zambia  together with the Congo, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire, has spared no effort to assist the Angolan people in this respect.\n169.\tWe are aware of the maneuvers made by certain reactionary forces whatever their motives  calculated to undermine recent progressive changes tending towards the attainment of independence in Angola and Mozambique. We view with dismay, for example, the ill-fated attempts by a band of white reactionary settlers in Mozambique who resorted to disorder and violence in order to frustrate the popular course of events towards independence. However, we are at the same time confident that these shameful maneuvers by a band Of settler desperadoes will be completely quashed.\n170.\tIn this regard, we condemn the massing of troops by the racist and minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia along the border with Mozambique. This is a flagrant act of provocation and aggression against the territorial integrity of Mozambique. We equally condemn the malicious intention Of mercenaries to perpetrate criminal acts against the people of the emerging State of Mozambique. We urge all countries, in particular South Africa and the Western countries, to prevent the mobilization of their nationals for such deplorable acts.\n171.\tAs the people of Mozambique attain a new status of nationhood, they face real and acute problems in the economic and social fields, the effective solution of which necessitates urgent and generous assistance from the rest of the international community. To this end, Zambia, for its part, pledges the fullest assistance.\n172.\tZambia has had a long and beneficial association with the nationalist movements in southern Africa. We have profound admiration and respect for the leadership of these movements. Like us in Zambia, these movements are committed to the establishment of a nonracial society in their respective countries. They desire development, peace and security for all their people, regardless of race, color, religion or ethnic grouping.\n173.\tNotwithstanding the positive developments in African territories occupied by Portugal, the situation in the remaining territories under white racist regimes, in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa, continues to deteriorate.\n174.\tWe are aware that the illegal regime in Salisbury has intensified its oppression of the majority African population in the face of even more numerous victories by nationalist movements and the growing political consciousness among the oppressed masses. In utter desperation, the rebel regime in Zimbabwe has intensified its oppression. There has been an intensification of such absurdities as collective fines, the closure of African schools and businesses, the creation of prohibited areas along the border with Mozambique, the forced removal of thousands of Africans into concentration camps, the introduction of passes for Africans in the northeastern region and forced labor for Africans between the ages of 12 and 60 years. The panic stricken regime has even resorted to widespread detention and torture of the Africans including the destruction of their food crops.\n175.\tThe people of Zimbabwe will settle for nothing less than majority rule. That is the minimum guarantee for peace, security and stability in Zimbabwe. Continued intransigence by the illegal rebel regime would only cause untold loss of life and human sufferings and would only lead to a more resolute armed struggle by the liberation movements. That would be the inevitable consequence of the continued denial of a negotiated peace settlement. The liberation movements and other peace-loving forces have always preferred settlement by peaceful change, but that should not be mistaken for weakness. The liberation movements are not tired of war, and we are not tired of supporting the armed struggle, either.\n176.\tWe would therefore urge Ian Smith and his racist rebel clique to have the courage to talk to the authentic leaders of the indigenous people of Zimbabwe. In that connexion, it is the inescapable duty of the United Kingdom Government to live up to its responsibilities in respect of its rebel colony of Souths era Rhodesia, The United Kingdom should therefore create conditions propitious for the peaceful resolution of the Southern Rhodesian crisis on the basis of majority rule. My Government deplores the continued detention of Messrs. Joshua Nkomo and Ndabaningi Si thole, leaders of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union [ZAPU] and the Zimbabwe African National Union [ZANU], respectively, who are the authentic representatives of the people of Zimbabwe. In that regard, we deeply regret the professed inability of the United Kingdom Government to secure their release. It is essential that the leaders of the authentic liberation movements be released from detention in order that they may participate in any negotiations, including the constitutional conference we have repeatedly urged the Government of the United Kingdom to convene.\n177.\tNumerous decisions and resolutions have been adopted by the various bodies of the United Nations on the. important question of Southern Rhodesia. One of the significant actions taken by the United Nations was the imposition of economic sanctions against the Smith regime by the Security Council [resolution 253 (1968)]. It is, however, disheartening to note that there are still many Members of the United Nations which do not carry out their obligations in that respect. It is even more disappointing to note that States violating those economic sanctions are the ones best able to implement them. In that connexion, as the Assembly is aware, Zambia continues to make tremendous economic and other sacrifices in. the implementation of relevant resolutions in order to uphold the principles of justice, self-determination and independence.\n178.\tWe are gratified that there are, however, a number of States which uphold those principles in accordance with their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. We should like to reiterate our firm conviction that an isolated Southern Rhodesia without external assistance would not have survived an effective and sustained implementation of the sanctions policy . We call upon those States which have continued to violate the United Nations sanctions against Southern Rhodesia faithfully to live up to their obligations under the Charter.\n179.\tAs in Zimbabwe, the situation in Namibia continues to deteriorate. The racist and minority regime in South Africa persists in its illegal and repressive occupation of the international Territory of Namibia and thus remains a challenge to the will and authority of the United Nations. Over the past year the people of Namibia have seen an intensification of the reign of terror.\n180.\tIn pursuit of its policy of the Balkanization of Namibia, South Africa has resorted to the public flogging of men, women and children alike, arbitrary detention without charge or trial, and banishment. Clergymen and pressmen have been refused entry into the Bantustans in a desperate bid to conceal the extent of the bestiality of the South African regime. As an outward manifestation of the unbridled reign of terror, there has been a mass exodus of thousands of people who have had to flee as a consequence.\n181.\tAt this juncture, I should like to pay a tribute to the people of Namibia, who, under the gallant leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], continue to wage a determined armed struggle against the occupation of their country by the racist, Fascist and minority regime in Pretoria. My delegation wishes to reaffirm its conviction that their unrelenting struggle, coupled with the United Nations efforts to enforce its resolutions, will in no time culminate in South Africa's total withdrawal from that United Nations Territory. We hope that South Africa will take advantage of the present circumstances in southern Africa to announce a definite short term timetable to terminate the illegal occupation of Namibia and allow the United Nations to hand over the administration of that international Territory to the people of Namibia.\n182.\tMy statement to this Assembly in regard to the situation in southern Africa would be incomplete if I did not refer to the repugnant policy of apartheid pursued by the Fascist, racist and minority regime in South Africa. It is a matter of indomitable disgust to us that, despite numerous condemnations by the United Nations and the international community as a whole, South Africa, apart from intensifying this policy internally, has even dared to export it to such countries as Namibia, Southern Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonies in southern Africa.\n183.\tSouth Africa has long been aware that its policy of apartheid is doomed to failure. Conscious of that fact, it has resorted to militarism, the creation of buffer States and acts of downright blackmail. The South African regime is collaborating with the illegal rebel regime in Southern Rhodesia and pouring troops into Namibia, and has conspired with subversive elements to reverse positive developments in the Portuguese colonies.\n184.\tMy delegation has noted that for the first time individuals other than whites have been included in the South African delegation to the General Assembly. Needless to say, those persons are victims of circumstance. They are puppets of the regime and their presence here is intended to hoodwink the United Nations and the international community into believing that South Africa is changing its policy of apartheid. My delegation condemns that bluff, for it indicates only that South Africa does not take seriously the demands of the international community to bring about genuine change in its policy.\n185.\tMy Government urges the South African regime to abandon forthwith its evil policy of apartheid in the interests of peace and security in southern Africa. South Africa should emulate the example set by Portugal and accept the inevitability of majority rule. That is the only way it can end its international isolation. That is the only way it can cease being treated as a truly international outcast.\n186.\tThe situation in Cyprus is a matter of grave concern to us in Zambia. It was with shock and indignation that we received the news of the overthrow of President Makarios by a group of Greek officers. We immediately condemned the coup, for not knowing was it carried out against the legitimate Government of Cyprus, it was also outrageously dangerous in every respect. Our fears that such a disruption of the hitherto delicate status quo would open a new chapter of misery for the people of Cyprus have indeed been vindicated by subsequent events in that country. Today, what is also at stake is the very sovereignty and territorial integrity and, indeed, the independence of Cyprus.\n187.\tThe crisis in Cyprus has therefore reached dangerous proportions. It glaringly calls for urgent international action to reverse the trend. The sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Cyprus must be preserved at all costs. In that connexion, it is imperative that both Greece and Turkey immediately withdraw their military forces from the island. The presence of the forces of both those countries, in our view, only further complicates the search for a just and lasting peace in Cyprus. Moreover, those forces constitute a danger to the lives of the people of Cyprus. Genuine constitutional order must be restored, and that should, naturally, include the return to Cyprus of the elected President of that country, Archbishop Makarios.\n188.\tWe followed with interest the ill-fated Geneva negotiations among Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom, the three guarantors of the independence of Cyprus. Quite frankly, we were uncomfortable with the thought of that forum deciding on the destiny of the people of Cyprus without the full, direct and equal participation of the Government of that country. It is inadmissible, in our view, that even an attempt should be made to settle the problem of Cyprus behind the backs of its people.\n189.\tWe therefore wish to urge that the legitimate Government of Cyprus be invited as a full and active participant in any future negotiations concerning that country. In this connexion, we take note of the proposal of the Soviet Union for an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations in which Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, all the members of the Security Council and other countries, particularly the nonaligned countries, would participate. In the light of the failure of the Geneva negotiations, we feel that this proposal deserves serious consideration. We therefore support it in principle. We are nevertheless open-minded with regard.to other initiatives or indeed improvements on the Soviet proposal.\n190.\tThere can be no doubt that the nonaligned countries have an important role to play in the search for a just solution to the crisis in Cyprus. The situation must not be allowed to degenerate into a hotbed of bigPower rivalries. In this regard, we are painfully aware of the sensitivity of the Eastern Mediterranean region.\n191.\tIn the Middle East, genuine peace and security are still but a dream. The last war served to change certain attitudes which had hitherto impeded the search for a just and lasting solution of the problem of the Middle East. A more serious and realistic approach on the part of the big Powers has now led to some progress in this direction. Much, however, remains to be done. We look forward to the forthcoming Middle East peace talks at Geneva with great interest. We remain convinced that only, complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territory and the full restoration of the lawful rights of the Palestinian people can guarantee permanent peace in the Middle East. In this connexion, it is our view that the Palestinian people have a right, indeed a duty, to be represented at the Geneva talks.\n192.\tRecent reports from SouthEast Asia are far from encouraging. Many innocent lives continue to be lost in Viet Nam in spite of the Paris peace Agreement, which is constantly being violated. The situation therefore remains dangerous. The international community can ill afford to divert its attention from Viet Nam. A genuine political settlement must be found.\n193.\tWith regard to Cambodia, we note that the puppet regime of Lon Nol is still desperately struggling to cling to power. Foreign interference in Cambodia is still rampant. The continuing war in that country has caused tremendous loss of life and destruction of property. We shall continue to support the Royal Government of the National Union of Cambodia, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. We shall also continue to support the efforts aimed at the restoration of the lawful rights of that Government in the United Nations.\n194.\tWe note with concern that no progress has been made in the dialog between North and South Korea sanctioned by this Assembly at the 2181st meeting of its twenty eighth session. The foreign forces stationed in South Korea have continued to interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean people. Sadly, these foreign forces are in South Korea under the United Nations flag. Their presence in South Korea is inimical to the interests and aspirations of the Korean people and to international peace and security. It is an impediment to all efforts aimed at the peaceful reunification of Korea. Those forces cannot but be an embarrassment to the United Nations, under whose flag they operate, as they act contrary to the wishes of the Korean people and seek to promote the interests of a foreign Power. The General Assembly therefore has a duty to decide that they should be immediately withdrawn from South Korea so that the dialog we encouraged last year can go forward unimpeded. The United Nations must protect the interests of the Korean people and help to create an atmosphere conducive to the realization of their cherished goal of reunification.\n195.\tMy delegation also wishes to make it clear that we are strongly opposed to the preposterous suggestion, made in these halls last year, that North and South Korea be admitted into the United Nations as separate entities. We view this as a maneuver calculated to perpetuate the division of Korea. We therefore reject in advance any similar suggestions this year.\n196.\tWe in Zambia, along with other nonaligned countries, have always maintained that detente can become a permanent feature of international relations only if it does not remain limited in scope and if it does not ignore the legitimate interests of other countries. We have stressed the imperative and urgent need for solutions to all problems confronting mankind as a whole and for the establishment of an international order truly based on justice, security and progress for all.\n197.\tWho can deny that the process of detente has in recent months been put to a severe test? Contrary to the expectations and hopes of the international community, hardly any progress has been made in strengthening detente and making it irreversible. Because of its limited character, it Remains as precarious today as it was yesterday. It is no exaggeration to say that this whole process has in fact suffered stagnation.\n198.\tThe last war in the Middle East brought the world close to the brink of a direct superPower military confrontation. The crisis in Cyprus has more than demonstrated the vulnerability of small countries when the interests of more powerful countries and military blocs are involved.\n199.\tFor detente to be viable it must mean a new commitment to the principles of the United Nations. It should be recognized ^that genuine international peace and security cannot coexist with the concepts of spheres of influence and hegemony. It is such tendencies which provoke aggression, interference in internal affairs and acts of subversion against other countries. Consequently they are responsible for world crises. They therefore constitute the most serious threat to international peace and security.\n200.\tThe year 1974 has been a particularly bad one since the inception of detente. No progress has been made in limiting bigPower rivalries, whether in the arms race or in the pursuit of so called strategic interests. The arms race continues with even greater ferocity. Nuclear weapon tests have continued to be conducted both in the atmosphere and underground. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and the Strategic Arms Lintion Talks have not yet yielded any positive results in the field of disarmament. Yet the proposal for a world disarmament conference remains but a dream.\n201.\tIt is the opinion of my Government that the recent nuclear weapon tests, both in the atmosphere and underground, have once again highlighted the urgent need for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. They are also a grim reminder that halfhearted and even discriminatory measures on disarmament, such as the partial test ban and nonproliferation Treaties, cannot work. What the international community needs is not making nuclear weapons the preserve of a few countries but rather the total elimination of such weapons.\n202.\tThat a world disarmament conference should be convened as soon as possible is, in our opinion, all the more imperative in the light of the lack of progress in the existing disarmament forums. Our position in this regard remains that the conference should allow for the participation of all States on an equal basis. We deem the participation of all nuclear States in the conference to be particularly essential. In this connexion, nuclear disarmament cannot but be our number one priority. In our opinion, the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference has served a useful purpose. Guided by its report [A19628], we hope that the General Assembly will make another positive move aimed at reconciling the differences among. Member States concerning this proposal.\n203.\tIt has been three years since the General Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. Yet hardly any progress has been made in the implementation of the provisions of that Declaration. There have been a number of disturbing reports about the intensification of big Power rivalries in the Indian Ocean. We are particularly concerned at the agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom to expand the United States military base at Diego Garcia. We condemn this project and urge its immediate abandonment, for not only does it flagrantly disregard the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, but also it is likely to encourage eves greater bigPower rivalries in the Indian Ocean.\n204.\tIn our view, there is absolutely no justification for the intensification of the bigPower rivalries in the Indian Ocean in this so-called era of detente. We believe that, instead of promoting such rivalries under the label of so-called containment of one another, the big Powers should exercise mutual restraint at a conference table. We would hope that the big Powers would respect the wishes of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean and cooperate fully with the efforts of the international community to preserve the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.\n205.\tThe current session of the General Assembly is meeting in the aftermath of the historic sixth special session of the General Assembly, which was convened to consider exclusively and for the first time the vital subject relating to the problems of raw materials and development. The special session, as we are all aware, was a most significant event which culminated in the consensus adoption of two important documents, namely, the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n206.\tThe special session served to highlight the fact that, since the sordid and sad chapter of slavery came to a close and foundations were laid for a community of free nations, economic relations among nations have undergone only a cosmetic change. Instead, there has been a remarkable change in the sharpening and sophistication of instruments of exploitation of the weak and poor nations by their more powerful and privileged counterparts. This has contributed in no small measure and, not unexpectedly, to the widening and deepening of the present gulf between the poor and the rich. This sad state of affairs has been aggravated by the recent deterioration of the world economic situation, and constitutes a threat to the security and survival of many economies.\n207.\tProfound economic events over the past year have dramatically demonstrated the interdependence of the international community. One of the important results of the special session is the universal recognition of interdependence among nations and the interdependence of problems of trade, development, finance and the international monetary system.\n208.\tGlobal inflation has continued unabated, particularly in the industrialized world, resulting in increased costs of essential capital goods, fertilizers, food and other manufactured products imported by developing countries. We are equally familiar with the emergence of scarcities, particularly the acute problems of food, which is the most basic commodity. In addition, although the recent increase in petroleum prices has served to emphasize the need for equitable and fair returns for the export products of the developing countries, it is also a fact that serious adverse consequences continue to be experienced by the developing countries. A combination of these factors now poses the danger of imminent collapse and even disaster for a number of economies.\n209.\tThe current turbulent economic situation facing the international community presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities. All of us represented at this session know the exact limits of our capability to contribute to the necessary immediate and longterm measures to alleviate and forestall those problems which have befallen or might affect various countries, particularly those developing countries most adversely affected by the current world economic situation.\n210.\tIt is now, more than ever before, readily recognized that coordinated action, on the national and international level, is essential in order to resolve the closely interrelated problems confronting the international community. The series of important world conferences on such issues as population, food and industrial development, culminating in the special session on world development and international economic cooperation to be convened next year, clearly demonstrates the essential need for concrete action.\n211.\tIn this connexion, my delegation welcomed the timely adoption by the special session of the Special Program to provide emergency relief and development assistance to those developing countries most seriously affected by the recent economic events [see resolution 3202 (SVl), sect. A)]. We are confident that all countries in a position to contribute will respond favorably in order to meet the target set for the United Nations emergency operation as a matter of urgency. Urgent and positive action is essential, on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis. It is encouraging that a number of countries have indicated their willingness to contribute to the Special Program.\n212.\tAlthough we recognize and appreciate the significance of emergency relief and assistance, it is the view of my delegation that our preoccupation with emergency relief should not detract from the urgent solution of basic longterm commodity and payments problems as called for in the Program of Action adopted by the special session. Indeed, we hope that the solemn concern in the emergency field will create conditions conducive to the solution of basic problems, which would in the long run serve to lessen the need for emergency debt and similar relief.\n213.\tThere is already evidence of a downward trend in prices of those products that have gained in recent commodity increases. Urgent international action is therefore necessary to arrest any further decline in the price levels of those products, and to institute, as well as to encourage, appropriate programs, where necessary, designed to achieve and maintain just, stable and remunerative prices for the exports of developing countries. To this end my delegation looks forward to the possible uses of indexation, currently under study, as a means of dealing with the terms of trade situation of developing primary exporting countries.\n214.\tMy delegation believes that from the recent economic events there should have resulted a greater understanding of the mutual needs and interests of producers and consumers, both countries and companies. The time is now ripe for a dispassionate appreciation of the legitimate needs of consumers for assured supplies at reasonable prices, and of producers for greater real earnings, increased exports, stable markets and favorable terms of trade, particularly for the developing countries. It is also in the interests of both consumers and producers to ensure the rational exploitation and utilization of resources. We consider these to be the most important motives behind the formation of such producer associations as the Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, of which Zambia is a member together with Zaire, Peru and Chile.\n215.\tIn the vital area of commodities, every possible encouragement should be given to the promotion and strengthening of economic cooperation among developing countries. The need for such closer cooperation, especially among developing producers, acquires an important dimension in the light of the recent invaluable work by the Group of Eminent Persons appointed by the SecretaryGeneral in accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 1721 (LIII) to study the impact of transnational corporations on the development process and on international relations.\n216.\tIt is Zambia's earnest hope that the successful implementation of the acceptable recommendations of the Group of Eminent Persons will result in the maintenance and strengthening of cooperation between the host countries and their respective transnationals, with due regard for the exercise by the host countries of effective control in the management and operation of the various branches of their economies. In this connexion, we look forward to the work of the Special Inter-sessional Committee on transnational corporations.to be convened shortly.\n217.\tIn the field of commercial policy, justice could only be achieved by the implementation of the cardinal principles of non-reciprocity and preferential treatment in favor of developing countries.\n218.\tThe operation of the generalized system of preferences for approximately three years now has been of some benefit to developing countries. However, we are familiar with the limited character of the benefits that have so far accrued from the system and its need of improvements. Zambia also welcomed the Tokyo Declaration adopted last September, and it is my delegation's cherished hope that the multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT will soon get under way.\n219.\tConcerning the international monetary system it is disheartening to observe the limited progress, if any, towards its reform. The hopes that were generated at fast year's Ministerial Meeting of the Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues, of IMF, held in Nairobi, Kenya, have not yet been fulfilled.\n220.\tOther issues facing the international community relate to the recycling of surplus funds of the oil exporting countries accruing from their recent increases in petroleum prices. These are, undoubtedly, issues with important ramifications in the trade, financial, investment and other fields. My delegation would like to express the hope and there are already grounds for expressing confidence  that oil exporting Member States will genuinely play their part in the measures necessary for both the current and longterm situation.\n221.\tThe international community is now familiar with and agreed on the key problems confronting man and his environment. We have before us, for example, such important initiatives as the International Development Strategy for the United Nations Second Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, still under discussion, the concept of collective economic security also under consideration and, most recently, the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. In all these complementary initiatives the vital elements of equality and equity in international relations are at the center.\n222.\tWe therefore have before us instruments designed to achieve an equal and equitable partnership among all nations, rich and poor, big and small. For us to achieve a lasting and honorable partnership, we must fully recognize the pivotal role of justice and fair play in our relations. And, in the final analysis, the attainment of equality and equity in international relations is contingent upon the deliberate exercise of political will in degrees commensurate with the present requirements and future priorities.\n223.\tThe fact that the United Nations has convened three conferences on the law of the sea within a relatively short space of time demonstrates without question the importance that humanity attaches to an equitable solution to the problems that States experience in relation to the sea, the seabed and the subsoil thereof, and the resources of the area. The task before the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is a momentous one. There are many issues before it. Most of those issues reflect possible conflicts between the national interests of different States. Yet in all these, the Conference must surely strive to arrive at just solutions and to do so speedily.\n224.\tThe position of my delegation has clearly been stated on various occasions before, that is, at sessions of the now dissolved Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and the Ocean Floor Beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, at the first substantive session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and at previous sessions of this General Assembly. Apart from the subject of the right of access to and from the sea of landlocked States and that of adverse effects of seabed mining on the economies of developing States producers of similar minerals, my delegation attaches great importance to the need for a satisfactory solution to the problems of limits of national jurisdiction.\n225.\tThat being the central issue for the Conference, it does not only merit very careful consideration, but also needs to be examined with particular attention to the principle of the common heritage of mankind. Lack of suitable solutions to the foreseeable problems may lead, in the future, to boundary disputes such as the international community has through the years experienced with respect to landlocked countries. By convening the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the United Nations has provided an opportunity for exercising foresight and for finding lasting solutions.\n226.\tMy delegation is of the view that the recognition of the common heritage of mankind as defined in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) goes a long way towards reducing the likelihood of such disputes. Consequently, it is regretted that the Conference is still being asked by some States to recognize national claims of extraterritorial coastal jurisdiction which, if adopted, would significantly undermine the common heritage of mankind. Besides, the common heritage exists for the benefit of all States, whether they be landlocked or coastal.\n227.\tIt is the opinion of my delegation that it is necessary for the Conference to take fully into account the study of the SecretaryGeneral on the economic significance, in terms of seabed mineral resources, of the various limits proposed for national jurisdiction and contained in the records of the now dissolved Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and the Ocean Floor Beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction.\n228.\tIn order ,to arrive at a just and equitable solution to the problems raised by the question of extraterritorial jurisdiction in the adjacent seabed, ocean floor and subsoil thereof, the Conference might very well consider the possibility of establishing rights to resources of the area for all States belonging to a region or a subregion jointly. In our view, this would be one of the best ways of ensuring that all States, whether landlocked or coastal, derive benefits from ocean space resources which are rightly the common heritage of mankind.\n229.\tIt is generally gratifying to note that the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea has proceeded with dispatch to respond to its global responsibilities. It is noted, for instance, that it has invited representatives of liberation movements to participate as observers and has agreed to reach its decisions on matters of substance by way of consensus.\n230.\tFinally, and not least, my delegation would like to express our profound gratitude to the Government and people of Venezuela for their overwhelming hospitality and satisfactory facilities offered to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea during its second session held in their beautiful capital, Caracas, for 10 weeks during the months of June, July and August this year.\n231.\tIn this address my delegation has referred to a few of the many and complex issues facing the international community and of which the current session is seized, and to which it will no doubt pay the fullest attention. We are mindful of the fact that, under the auspices of the United Nations, Member States have individually and collectively achieved some, albeit limited, progress in finding solutions to a number of contemporary problems. This limited progress must be maintained and consolidated. The momentum generated by the process of negotiation, as, for example, in various world conferences intended to promote a peaceful, just and equitable settlement of international issues, should be maintained.\n232.\tA great deal, however, remains to be done. In view of the universal recognition of the interdependence of States, we should utilize the numerous opportunities available to face outstanding global challenges to international peace and security, and to the economic and social advancement of all peoples. In this and other areas, it has become obvious that the responsibilities devolving on the United Nations and its membership have acquired unprecedented dimensions.\n233.\tIt goes without saying that the quest for peace in international relations has acquired a broad appeal for a world whose history has been replete with violence, poverty and insecurity of increasing scope and magnitude. We have consistently advocated the restructuring of the United Nations system to allow it to cope better with the rapidly changing circumstances. In this regard, we have repeatedly pointed to the imperative need for, inter alia, the revision of the Charter of the United Nations, with particular regard to the democratization of the Security Council.\n234.\tDespite its shortcomings, we would like to reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and to express our earnest hope that the Organization will soon undertake appropriate changes in both its structure and orientation in order to enhance its ability to carry out its responsibilities with unprecedented vigor and determination. Zambia, for its part, will continue to render its modest but positive contribution to the Organization, in the fulfillment of the purposes and the principles enshrined in the Charter.\n235.\tI believe that all of us assembled here have the opportunity of a lifetime to change the face of the world for the better, given the political will to do so. Let us, therefore, recognize the imperative need to abandon old myths in the face of new realities. Let us not seek to adapt the solutions of yesterday to the problems of today. Let us not live in the past. Let us live in the present and look forward to a bright future for all with confidence and determination.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\tMr. President, first, it is my pleasure to welcome and to express my congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria, whose unanimous election enables us to count upon his abilities and long experience, which, though certainly not consonant with his youth, have been demonstrated in the exercise of high office since his noble country began its independent life.\n2.\tI should also like to welcome Mr. Leopoldo Benites, whose presidency has elicited widespread approval. During an especially difficult period he once again demonstrated his even-handedness and diplomacy in the effective guidance of our deliberations.\n3.\tDeparting from my text, I should like to express, on behalf of the Government and people of Uruguay, our profound condolences concerning the tragedy which has afflicted our sister republic of Honduras, a tragedy and a distress which we feel as our own. The support and solidarity of the whole international community, not only of the States of Latin America but of the whole of the membership of this Organization and of all its organs, are necessary in order to alleviate the damage and the distress from which the people of that country are suffering and will continue to suffer in the future.\n4.\tAgain departing from my text, I should also like to express the pleasure of my country at the admission to membership in this Organization of three new Member States: Guinea-Bissau, to which this membership represents the culmination of a long struggle for independence; Bangladesh, which\nhas also been the scene of so much suffering; and Grenada, which is also joining this Assembly and, in this way, the family of Latin American countries.\n5.\tAt the beginning of this new session of the General Assembly as is usual we are offered a new opportunity for reflection. However, this time the required reflection is more urgent, more stern and at the same time more profound.\n6.\tTo the matters normally occupying our attention are added others which were not previously unknown to us, to be sure, but which emerge today with particular force, revealing deep maladjustments in the very essence of coexistence. So above and beyond the peculiar features of each specific problem we discover a close and increasingly acute inter-connexion with other problems, a kind of common substance in the economic and political life of the world today. Hence, our efforts to solve specific problems frequently seem to be overwhelmed by the paucity of global solutions. There are no isolated questions, all questions are varying manifestations of the same problem, and we are compelled to seek the core of the problem underlying the different manifestations.\n7.\tThus, while immediate and evident conflicts occur and more tangible needs and problems arise, the disruption of the international economic system is already making itself felt. Simultaneously, the contours of the great questions of the future emerge intertwined with day-to-day business.\n8.\tUruguay therefore wishes to focus attention in this supreme world forum on this new perspective, so that the consideration of each specific item on our agenda will still be consistent with matters which are neither merely a backdrop nor an anticipation of the remote future, but are germane to the present problems of the international community.\n9.\tMy country advocates, therefore, that integrated perspective in which States Members of the United Nations can jointly formulate rules and co-ordinate courses of action for a new system of coexistence among nations to meet the current needs of most of our peoples. Otherwise solutions will deviate from their essential human objectives and may become mere dialectic exercises veering farther and farther away and never penetrating the core of the truly crucial questions.\n10.\tIt is with this idea of renewal that I mention the structure of the international economy. There is no doubt that the grave deficiencies and tensions of recent years, disguised at first, are now becoming manifest and turning into a vast crisis affecting currencies, trade, and production, and thereby the whole economy. The shock of the petroleum crisis now is spreading like an expanding shock wave within the general disruption of the established economic order.\n11.\tAt the sixth special session of the General Assembly [2211th meeting] I had occasion to indicate, on behalf of my country, the need for far-reaching reform to get to the true root of the matter, taking it not simply as a technical problem to be solved by merely rearranging economic factors, but more importantly, as a political and social problem involving everyone. Hence, if this reform is not founded upon justice, only limited and unstable results will ensue and peace will be constantly endangered.\n12.\tThis leads me to refer to what my Government considers to be the crux of the matter. Indisputably, the recognition of the political equality of nations is a fundamental achievement of international law. It is equally undeniable that the same concept of equality cannot be projected into the economic sphere, where the degree of potential or development differs, without any doubt, with regard to each nation.\n13.\tThis reality must be contemplated in the building of new international economic structures and also in the simple readjustment of those that already exist. Any system that applies identical patterns to societies with differently developed economies will not be just, nor should the resources of the international community be channeled in disregard of existing differences.\n14.\tEven when to a certain extent some of these concepts underlie rules now governing international co-operation for development, they are only marginal within the total context. The substance of economic relations remains intact, not corresponding to these realities. They must be acknowledged as guiding principles of the international economy as a whole, of its monetary, trade, finance and investment systems and in the conduct of large multinational corporations. The IMF, for example, must achieve the effective transfer of real resources to the developing countries. Until the rules treat societies which have already reached the post-industrial area and those which are struggling timidly to venture into the world of modern technology as equals, the international economy will be a source neither of development, nor of justice, nor of peace.\n15.\tSo true is this that today, although all countries are shaken by the same crisis, the strongest and most developed economies have within themselves the necessary reserves and resilience to respond to the threat, while the weaker nations suffer from the unabated onslaught of new events.\n16.\tEnergetic protest is called for when within the dramatic context of small and medium-sized countries such as Uruguay, the situation worsens because the more developed countries, in an attempt to safeguard their own prosperity, are imposing protectionist measures which drastically cut the exports of raw materials from the developing world, or use \\\"dumping\\\" to depress prices of these exports to intolerable levels.\n17.\tIt should be pointed out that such policies and practices, unjust and counter to recognized principles of international co-operation as they are, also run the risk of causing a dangerous trade confrontation which could bring the entire world economy to a state of collapse.\n18.\tUnfortunately, the solutions urgently demanded of the international community at the sixth special session last April have not been applied, as immediate, practical and workable machinery has not yet been put into operation. The entire effort of the General Assembly at that time and the acknowledged consensus that effective action should be taken have apparently become merely pious utterances on the part of our Organization and its agencies, without that obvious political decision having been translated into reality. I do understand the difficulties inherent in such broad action, but the magnitude and urgency of the task require an unprecedented effort. Similarly, my Government today reiterates its statement that the surplus resources generated by new prices must be channeled to the developing countries most deeply affected by the petroleum crisis, thus avoiding the paradoxical situation where these resources would primarily strengthen the more developed economies. I think that in keeping with the spirit demonstrated at that meeting, it will be possible to agree upon multilateral channels to guide this process without prejudice to direct support through trade and investment.\n19.\tBut it is not only purely material factors that motivate Uruguay to postulate the reform of the international economy as a central topic. Recently, in Bucharest, the World Population Conference dealt with an essentially human question touching upon rights intrinsic to our nature and our life. My country cannot accept the restriction, not to say the mutilation, of these rights and the moral and spiritual values they enshrine through the application of economic rules ensuring the prosperity only of some. As the delegation of Uruguay stated in Bucharest: \\\"It is inadmissible that the possibility of population growth should be the exclusive right of those nations possessing a high degree of development\\\". Instead, we have held that the physical basis for cultural and spiritual development must be established so that the sacred mission of transmitting life may be responsively exercised everywhere.\n20.\tWithout any doubt, this objective cannot be achieved as long as considerations such as those which doom large segments of mankind to hunger and a marginal existence persist, and while existing conditions denote the simultaneous presence of a crisis of excess and one of scarcity.\n21.\tThere is one fact more than any other that constitutes a serious indictment of the existing international order and our lack of the will to reform it: in order to safeguard the well-being of the few, the prices of staples as well as of luxury items must be so high that they elude the grasp of the many, and, inversely, an over-supply of these goods can ruin those that produce them.\n22.\tAll of that conspires to impede a rational and human organization of trade and production. Some years ago my country proposed in FAO the creation of a system with a real \\\"food bank\\\" in which the need for stable and remunerative prices as a fair return for productive effort would be reconciled with the needs of those who cannot buy such goods because they are so expensive but desperately require them in order to survive. I consider that it is an inescapable responsibility of the world economy to work in that direction, and my country now pledges its best efforts to that end.\n23.\tSince the historic United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in 1972, another topic has been attracting increasing attention: the environment and the fate of the biosphere, mankind's present and future home.\n24.\tApart from the undoubted need to safeguard and restore our environment and to use it in a rational and far-sighted way, surely the economic and financial burden that this entails cannot be shared equally among all nations. Rather, it should weigh more heavily on the most developed nations, which unwittingly have done the most to cause the environment to deteriorate.\n25.\tJust as access to life cannot be limited in order to protect the status of some, so the use and enjoyment of nature cannot be regulated to the almost exclusive benefit of an already developed segment of mankind.\n26.\tIn the same spirit, my country would like to refer to the new riches that are becoming increasingly available to the peoples.\n27.\tWe are pleased to note that an initial success was achieved in the long struggle of the Latin American countries to assert their rights over the seas adjacent to their coasts when the universal recognition of the maximum limitation of 200 miles emerged from the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, recently held at Caracas.\n28.\tWe also cherish the hope that soon the necessary agreements will be achieved in order to adapt the law of the sea to the realities of the contemporary world and to satisfy the requirements of the peoples, particularly in the developing countries.\n29.\tWe also wish to express our firm conviction that effective formulas can be agreed upon to implement the historic resolution in which it was solemnly declared that the sea-bed and ocean floor, and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind [resolution 2749 (XXV)].\n30.\tMy Government is well aware of the myriad difficulties to be overcome if far-reaching changes within such diverse fields are to be achieved, but we are also convinced that trying to effect these changes is the only way to deal with the very root of these problems. Only by such means can true solutions be found. Otherwise, we will be attacking only the superficial manifestations of the underlying problems. Therefore, although it seems mere speculation that, given the magnitude of the problem, it can be solved, this is the crucial task that faces us. If the challenge is to be met, imagination and daring must be mustered in this forum, whence political inspiration flows to others, and in all the other bodies of this great United Nations system.\n31.\tOne may well wonder if we will be able to devise -and even more important to implement- within a reasonably short period of time a new international economic order which will be both just and creative and which will have the basic features so well known to our peoples, and especially our youth: freedom from any attempt to destroy the basic tenets of the economy but, rather, a human and equitable use of those tenets; a pattern implying no holding back of the more advanced or regression to lower levels but, rather, promoting those who have been left behind by giving them a fair share of the benefits of the highest civilization; extension beyond material goods to reach horizons of culture and spirit; integration of problems of population, food, environment and culture within a comprehensive framework in which countries are treated in accordance with their particular degree of development so that the economy will render truly equivalent results for its participants.\n32.\tIn the world political arena, there is an atmosphere of detente and a universal desire for peace is spreading. My country, in accordance with a tradition it has unswervingly maintained since its very inception, adheres to that spirit, not only in the external conduct of international affairs but also as a reflection of the very deepest convictions of the nation.\n33.\tNevertheless, detente does not seem to be sufficient to clear the air entirely.\n34.\tThe IndoChina peninsula is still bitterly racked by varying degrees of open warfare. It is unfortunate that the Viet Nam peace agreement has not yet been fully complied with and that aggression in that Republic and in the Khmer Republic still persists. It is to be hoped that these circumstances will not be overlooked and that appropriate measures will be adopted to strengthen peace and bring an immediate end to the war which torments that region.\n35.\tCyprus has been shattered by a violent crisis, with painful consequences that my Government deplores. I believe that we the nations represented here without exception must unite solidly behind the people of the island and help to alleviate their suffering. We must also unite in support of the decisions of the Security Council and encourage international action to protect a Member State. The observance of United Nations agreements is essential for peace there and elsewhere, and Uruguay will always act in accordance with that principle.\n36.\tOnce again we have to refer to the tragic sufferings of the people of the Middle East. I should like to note with appreciation the bilateral action taken, the conversations initiated and the results achieved regarding extremely sensitive military and political aspects. None the less, I cannot pass over in silence the concern of my Government about the future of that long-suffering region. I think that the international community represented here could play a most important part if it were to create a world climate on the basis of principles widely acknowledged as workable. That is a way in which this complex question could be approached in all of its aspects.\n37.\tIt is clear that legally speaking military victory confers no rights, especially with regard to territory. Similarly, the community of nations recognizes the right of each nation in that region, and in all others, to live in peace within secure and recognized borders, enjoying sovereignty, integrity and independence.\n38.\tAll those directly concerned should, therefore, seek a way to ensure through negotiations and other peaceful means, the full observance and implementation of those fundamental concepts of international law, which my Government unreservedly supports. A comprehensive study of this topic in all of its dimensions must include an essential chapter, in view of both its political and its human significance. 1 am referring here to the fate of the Palestinian people. My Government has no doubt that until a just solution is found for what the Security Council in paragraph 2 of resolution 242 (1967) calls \\\"the refugee problem\\\", any settlements designed to ensure peace will be merely temporary. With due regard, of course, for the steps taken elsewhere towards peace and while supporting the immediate measures the United Nations is taking to alleviate this distressing situation, my Government advocates more deep-rooted solutions which should encompass the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and squarely confront the problem in its real political, social and, finally, human significance all, of course, within the framework of comprehensive peace negotiations.\n39.\tAs an expression of our sincere concern for peace in the Middle East, 1 should like to renew the commitment announced by my delegation at the twenty-third session [1686th meeting] to support, within the framework of the Charter, a negotiated solution to ensure lasting peace in this region in full accordance with international law and all the imperatives of the question,\n40.\tUnder the general topic of international peace, I should like to express Uruguay's appreciation of the success achieved by the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression. This represents a positive step towards the clarifying of an important concept and also demonstrates a promising of understanding which suggests that more progress may be made in this connexion.\n41.\t1 am pleased to announce that my country supports with satisfaction the efforts made to establish a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. This attitude is consonant with our position in Latin America, where we are a party to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco).\n42.\tFor the same reason we deplore atomic weapon tests and explosions performed since last year by the various Powers in different parts of the world. The signature and ratification of Additional Protocol I to the Treaty of Tlatelolco will signify a positive step towards rectifying the situation. These explosions, which cause ecological damage and which continue, moreover, to cause tension, are contrary to detente and entail the continued spending of huge sums in an endeavor of no importance to mankind.\n43.\tAt the same time my country favors renewed efforts to achieve general disarmament. The negotiations to reduce the possibility of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union fall within this context. My country will also resolutely support the careful preparation of the World Disarmament Conference and any reaffirmation of already enunciated recommendations on nuclear testing and, most importantly, their speedy implementation, which is so long overdue.\n44.\tAs is Uruguay's custom, 1 should like to refer exclusively to the topics of decolonization and racial discrimination. Recent events have sparked the hope that more African people will soon gain independence. The outlook now looks bright and we hope that the optimism will be consolidated into fact in the full exercise of self-determination and freedom from foreign influence, as in Latin America. With regard to racial discrimination I renew today the support of Uruguay for measures adopted within the framework of the Charter so that mankind may become truly united.\n45.\tThis brief examination of some of the items of the agenda clearly shows that the policy of detente must be expanded and deepened so that its positive influence may extend to matters which today remain outside its scope. Uruguay will do anything within its power to work resolutely in this direction.\n46.\tHowever, together with geographically localized political problems, the significance of other less well-defined problems of international peace and security must be recognized. I refer to terrorist acts and subversive movements, which are frequently interconnected. The entire world has been the witness of this phenomenon, which now respects no borders. The moment has perhaps come for the international community to realize what risks such activities entail. This motive does not derive from the diverse ideas frequently posited in an attempt to justify these acts, as ideological differences are quite normal in a world as diverse as ours. The fact is that civilization itself is threatened when a constant undercover war being waged by interrelated movements operating outside international law is provoked and tolerated. Paradoxically, as the risk of nuclear catastrophe, or even large-scale conventional war, diminishes, unease, tension and casualties of this new kind of warfare are on the increase. Thus, an unexpected situation may arise in which peace, so fervently sought in more conspicuous areas, may yet disappear.\n47.\tMy Government also considers that other steps should be taken to consolidate and strengthen peace. The atmosphere of detente, so fortunately apparent among the great Powers, must also create an atmosphere of security for other nations. Improved relations among these Powers is indeed not enough. It is imperative finally to eliminate distortions of international coexistence caused by power politics and ideological penetration. Only when non-intervention and self-determination become rules of conduct observed by all nations can peace be said to be truly at hand.\n48.\tUruguay once again pledges its commitment to this conduct as an indissoluble part of its national identity and reaffirms its will to co-operate with all international courses of action to ensure full respect for such conduct within the community of nations. Only in this way can peace and co-operation exist in our interdependent and pluralistic world.\n49.\tThroughout our work we review and discuss many topics which demonstrate the complex and multifaceted world of today. As each topic is examined separately because of its specific features we must all regard them as independent entities. Nevertheless, all pose essentially the same question. What will be the nature of international relations? Will law or force prevail? Will the world's economy serve justice or convenience? Will each nation freely develop its own identity or will this identity be imposed from without? Will the diversity of national solutions enhance international co-operation or hamper it? Will detente create a true respect for all? Once defenses have been reduced, will undercover warfare and penetration become the agent of power to penetrate the small nations? Will terrorism and subversive warfare be given free reign in the world or will the community of nations thwart violence?\n50.\tUruguay has chosen a clear-cut path in keeping with the character of its people and the nature of its history. We are resolutely in support of the principles of justice, law, liberty and independence, and the right of each country to choose and follow its own model. We are working for international coexistence, with peace and co-operation as its hallmark. We reject terrorism and subversive violence; we remain open to the other nations of the world.\n51.\tThis fundamental definition of principle in international order is consistent with the political process of my country, which, together with a strong sense of national pride, maintains its solidarity with other countries. It fully respects all nations and demands no less for itself, without foreign influence or interference, which it neither accepts nor tolerates nor practices. In this way its institutions have been substantially transformed in order to enshrine the values recognized by the Uruguayan community as its national and popular objectives: independence, development and peace for the benefit of the human being. It is a process aiming at peace, construction and justice, without hatred or violence. Imbued with the spirit of understanding and solidarity, Uruguay will work in world affairs to promote mutual understanding and conciliation and mutual respect.\n52.\tThe international community must bring these already recognized principles to life. Equally urgent is the task of devising new principles for new situations: population, the biosphere, the riches of the sea and other unexploited regions; outer space, energy, spiritual and cultural matters; man's place in the technological universe and a new economic order.\n53.\tMay our efforts now solve the problems of today. May they serve to build a better tomorrow. We bear this responsibility to youth throughout the world. By that shall we be assessed.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me to convey to you the sincere congratulations of the delegation of the Republic of Afghanistan on your election to the presidency of this twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly. It is a fitting tribute to your qualities as a statesman who has rendered distinguished service not only to your own country but also to the international community. Your election is also a well-deserved honor for your country, the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, with which our country enjoys the most cordial relations, and which has shown consistent support for the cause of the Movement of Non-aligned Countries and for the principles and aims of the Charter of the United Nations. We are confident that under your guidance this session of the General Assembly will be directed with distinction. We assure you of our full co-operation.\n46.\tI also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express my delegation's deep gratitude to Mr. Leo-poldo Benites for the skillful and objective manner in which he guided the proceedings of both the twenty-eighth and the sixth special sessions. We wish to pay a warm tribute to him for the statesmanship and wisdom which he demonstrated.\n47.\tI should like to extend to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General, our deep appreciation of his untiring efforts to explore the possibilities for solutions to current crises.\n48.\tOn behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Afghanistan, I take this opportunity to welcome into our midst the new Members, namely, the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. The emergence of these independent countries and their entry into the United Nations, which we hail, is a direct outcome of the continued struggle waged by oppressed people, backed by the support of this world body . We wish these new Members a successful future and look forward to constructive collaboration with them in the Organization. We are confident that their contribution will enrich our efforts towards world peace and progress.\n49.\tIt is a particular pleasure for my delegation to see our neighbor in the region, the People's Re-public of Bangladesh, take its rightful place in this international body. The people of Afghanistan have strong ties of cordial friendship and brotherhood with the heroic people of Bangladesh. The emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation reflects the long-expected recognition of the inherent rights of its people and the realities prevailing in the region.\n50.\tMy Government wishes to express its sympathy with the Government of Honduras, whose people have suffered so recently in the wake of the natural disaster which has struck that country. We laud efforts by the international community to aid the victims of the hurricane.\n51.\tThe cardinal duty of this world Organization is the maintenance of international peace and security. Twenty-nine years have elapsed since the end of the Second World War. Thus far, another global war has been avoided, although on a number of occasions calamity has been checked only at the last hour. None the less, fear of the outbreak of violence and world conflagration should be shared by us all as long as the basic requirements for lasting peace and security throughout the world have not been achieved. Moreover, the inalienable rights of peoples to independence and self-determination, to freedom from alien domination, foreign occupation and exploitation have not been fully realized. Therefore, international peace and security remain only an ideal towards which this Organization shall continue to strive in vain.\n52.\tWe had hoped that in the 1970s a new era of realization would dawn, but we have observed that, when the possibility of peace enters in one region, conflict erupts in another.\n53.\tIn the Middle East, despite some success achieved in the disengagement of the Egyptian, Syrian and Israeli troops, lasting peace has yet to be attained. We believe that objective of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East can be reached only with the total withdrawal of Israel from Arab territories, the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and the return of the Holy City of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty. The Arab cause has the support of all those who adhere to the principles of human rights and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The international community bears a grave responsibility to undo the wrongs done in the 1947 partition of Palestine. With regard to that unfortunate event, we all shoulder the same responsibility. We earnestly hope that diplomatic efforts, due to recommence in the near future, will produce solutions leading to a lasting peace in the Middle East. However, the restoration of the lawful rights of the Palestinian people, in any circumstances, is a prerequisite for the establishment of a just and durable peace in the Middle East.\n54.\tThe lawful and legitimate struggle of the courageous Palestinian people to regain their usurped homeland constitutes an integral part of the world-wide effort, by all peoples, against alien domination. The Afghan delegation has fully endorsed the inclusion of a new item in our agenda, \\\"The question of Palestine\\\" [item 108], and we thus whole-heartedly support the view that the representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) should participate fully in the deliberations on this item in the plenary Assembly.\n55.\tAs a consequence of the military intervention of the former military regime of Greece in the internal affairs of Cyprus, we have seen the eruption of a major crisis in the area. The independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus have been imperiled. The Government of the Republic of Afghanistan hopes that the problem of Cyprus will be resolved with due respect for the rights of the Turkish community and the preservation of the sovereignty of Cyprus. The Afghan delegation expresses the hope that, as a result of negotiations, a just and permanent solution, based on Security Council resolution 353 (1974), will be found.\n56.\tThe gradual improvement that has been taking place in relations between some big Powers has maintained its momentum. We welcome the process of detente which we hope will lead to the reduction of tension. However, this spirit of understanding and co-operation should not be limited merely to relations between the major Powers. We believe that the success of detente requires the participation of all States, big or small, in order to ensure their equal interests.\n57.\tThe foreign policy of Afghanistan is founded on our traditional policy of non-alignment, non-participation in military blocs, peaceful coexistence with mutual respect and, further, promotion of friendly relations with all countries regardless of different economic and social systems. Within our region, the good neighborly relations which we enjoy with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are unshakable. The atmosphere of cordial and warm relations has led to fruitful economic ties for our mutual benefit. We share a fraternal relationship with the Government of Iran. The friendly relations between the two countries have recently been further strengthened as a result of bilateral contacts which we are confident will lead to benefits for both countries and will serve the cause of regional peace and security.\n58.\tOur relations with our other great neighbor, the People's Republic of China, are, as far as we are concerned, to continue in a normal and very friendly manner.\n59.\tAfghanistan's relations with India have always been very cordial and friendly and we will continue to maintain and expand the co-operation which has marked, our long-standing friendly relations.\n60.\tWith reference to the statement delivered on 27 September 1974 [2247th meeting] by Mr. Aziz Ahmed, the Minister of State for Defense and Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, regarding the strained relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, it should be said that although he referred to the unsatisfactory relations between our two countries, he refrained from stating the reason for this. I am sure that in the minds of all the representatives gathered here, the question arises as to what it the real cause for the tense and strained relations. I should like to take this opportunity merely to clarify for the members of the General Assembly the factual cause of the problem and also the search for a possible solution for this, the only political difference existing between the two countries.\n61.\tDuring the course of the past century, the colonial Power not only gradually occupied the subcontinent of India, but also, on various pretexts such as creating secure boundaries for its colonial territories, began to occupy our land. At various periods, the colonial Power separated portions of our land and people from the fatherland. It was this issue which, for almost a century, kept relations between Afghanistan and the British Indian Government strained. Today, it is the same issue -an unfortunate remnant of the colonial era -which has so regrettably strained relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, both of which, I believe, are desirous of having friendly relations.\n62.\tAfter this brief explanation, the members of this Assembly will understand that, with the termination of the colonial rule on the Indian subcontinent, Afghanistan had the right to reclaim its usurped land. But Afghanistan refrained from doing so because, following the promulgation of the Charter of the United Nations and the recognition of the principle that peoples under colonial rule have the right to exercise freely their lawful and legitimate rights, Afghanistan thought it better that the problem be solved by peaceful means and in accordance with the will of the Pakhtun and Baluchi people. Therefore, since the creation of Pakistan, Afghanistan has always endeavored, and will continue to endeavor, to resolve this single political difference in a just and honorable manner through negotiations, peaceful understanding, and mutual goodwill, according to the wishes of the national leaders of the Pakhtun and Baluchi peoples.\n63.\tAfghanistan strongly believes that the use of force, the oppression and imprisonment of those who demand their human rights will , produce only pessimism and disaffection and will lead to further resistance. Furthermore, this course of action will adversely affect the maintenance of peace and stability in our region, which we so earnestly desire.\n64.\tWhile I confirm the reference made by Mr. Aziz Ahmed in which he stated that his Government wished \\\"the best possible relationship with Afghanistan\\\", as we have already expressed our readiness for negotiations on numerous occasions, I would like once again to state now that we are sincerely desirous, without any condition, anywhere and at any time, to negotiate in order to find a peaceful solution to the only political dispute which exists between Afghanistan and Pakistan and to enhance the atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence.\n65.\tI am certain that the representatives assembled here will share our view and agree with this proposal by Afghanistan, which reflects our real desire for peace and for a solution of this issue according to the principles established by the Charter of the United Nations.\n66.\tIf we really desire peace, co-operation, understanding and living together, let us leave aside resentment and pride. As responsible human beings, we should have the courage to acknowledge and assess issues and events with foresight, and bear in mind that our actions will be judged by history and by future generations. In facing and solving problems, we need foresight and courage. In our present world, where we live in a close, interrelated community, we must face the grave issues before us responsibly and realistically. Realism is essential to success in the search for the necessary solutions.\n67.\tIn the field of disarmament, the policy of the Republic of Afghanistan is well known. We have supported and will continue to support any measure aimed at the achievement of general and complete disarmament. We have supported the ban on nuclear tests in all environments. According to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex 1, all nuclear-power States are obliged to carry out the necessary consultations in order to reach agreement on the halting of all tests in all environments.\n68.\tThough this item, as a matter of priority, has been under consideration by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, no final agreement, unfortunately, has been reached to date. We believe that as a collateral measure of disarmament, an agreement should be reached extending the present nuclear test ban to all environments.\n69.\tDisarmament has been the subject of much debate within and without the United Nations. How-ever, the race for nuclear and conventional arms has not abated but has expanded to the point where it is a clear danger to world peace and security. Progress in the field of disarmament has been modest, while expenditures for arms are ever rising.\n70.\tSuccess in the field of disarmament depends on the political will of the members of the international community and in particular on the big Powers. Therefore, it is necessary that the United Nations be involved in all endeavors aiming at the achievement of general and complete disarmament. For these reasons, the Government of Afghanistan, as that of a non- aligned country, has, both at the non-aligned conferences which initiated this idea and in the United Nations, always supported the convening of a world disarmament conference. We are confident that with adequate preparation such a conference would serve the very useful purposes of reviewing the growth of the arms race and the moves towards disarmament.\nIn a conference of this nature, the participation of all nuclear Powers is an inevitable prerequisite.\n71.\tThis year, the Government of Iran has proposed [A19693 and Add.I and 2] a new item entitled \\\"Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East\\\". We welcome this timely initiative of the Government of Iran and believe that the proposal will further strengthen peace and security in the area, and that its acceptance and implementation will be a positive step towards nuclear disarmament. We earnestly hope that the General Assembly's debate on various aspects of this item will lead to the adoption of adequate measures for its speedy implementation.\n72.\tRegarding the elimination of colonialism and alien domination in all their forms and manifestations, the policy of the Government of Afghanistan remains as before. Although the United Nations has achieved significant success in this field over the past 29 years, vestiges of colonialism and alien domination nevertheless persist in certain parts of the world, where they present an immense barrier to the right of self-determination and impede development and progress.\n73.\tAs may be observed, in Southern Rhodesia the situation has deteriorated over the past year, mainly because of the intensely repressive measures taken by the illegal racist minority regime of Ian Smith against the indigenous people of Zimbabwe. The situation has been aggravated by the violation by some States, particularly South Africa, of the mandatory sanctions imposed by the Security Council. In view of the prevailing situation in Southern Rhodesia, my delegation fully supports the idea of widening the scope of the sanctions.\n74.\tIn the case of Namibia, South Africa has continued its flagrant defiance of the United Nations decisions and has violated its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations with respect to the Territory. South Africa has increasingly resorted to violence, torture and intimidation of the people of Namibia in order to advance its inhuman policies of \\\"bantustanization\\\" and apartheid.\n75.\tMy delegation appreciates the measures adopted by the United Nations Council for Namibia in the discharge of its mandate from the General Assembly. We hope that all Members of the United Nations will find it possible to co-operate fully with the Council as the de jure authority for Namibia and to comply with its decisions.\n76.\tThe Afghan delegation welcomes the statement by the distinguished Foreign Minister of Portugal in the general debate, in which he reaffirmed the policy of his Government in favor of decolonization. It is indeed a source of satisfaction to us that the new leadership in Portugal has acknowledged the inalienable rights of the people of the Portuguese colonies to self-determination and independence. We are encouraged by the agreement reached between FRELIMO and Portugal providing for the granting of independence to Mozambique in 1975. We earnestly hope that similar agreement is reached in the near future with regard to Angola, so that the people of that country, too, can attain their long-cherished and legitimate aspirations.\n77.\tAs a land-locked country, Afghanistan attaches great importance to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The conclusion of a just and comprehensive legal order of the sea which can ensure the rights and interests of all States, whether coastal or land-locked, developed or developing, large or small, is an urgent international necessity.\n78.\tA future convention on the law of the sea must ensure the right of free access to and from the sea for the land-locked countries and be based on the firmly established and legally binding principles of international law. The right of free transit for land-locked countries and their participation in the exploration and exploitation of both the living and non-living resources of the sea beyond the internationally agreed limits of the territorial seas of States must be reaffirmed and ensured.\n79.\tThe inadequacies of the world economic order and the existing economic machinery to deal with the problems of development in the developing countries and the need for the achievement of an even and balanced development for the members of the inter-national community were amply revealed and dis-cussed for the first time at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, convened for the study of the problems of raw materials and development. The value of the special session lies in the dialog it initiated based on understanding and consideration for the priorities of all countries at various levels of development. The session underscored the fact that the interests and the welfare of the developed and the developing countries can no longer be isolated from each other. Its decisions constituted a turning-point in the international economic relations of countries with differing levels of economic progress. We trust that they will lead to an era of interdependence, justice, progress and peace.\n80.\tAs all the members of this Assembly realize, Afghanistan is a land-locked developing country as well as one of the least developed among the developing countries. The problems and the urgent needs of such countries were comprehensively covered in the course of the special session. As a result, those countries were included among the countries most seriously affected by the international economic crisis. The implementation of urgent measures to mitigate their needs and problems were envisaged in the resolution adopted by the Assembly at the sixth special session [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)].\n81.\tTo our regret, the measures contained in the decisions of the Assembly at that session have not been implemented by the members of the international community thus far. The Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI), envisaging emergency measures to ameliorate the urgent problems of landlocked, least developed and other countries most seriously affected by the recent economic crisis, has not been effectively carried out. This failure is largely due to the lack of interest and understanding on the part of the developed countries, despite the decisions taken at the special session. My delegation does, however, wish to express its appreciation to the developed countries as well as to the potential contributors among the developing countries which have offered to extend assistance for the implementation of the resolution.\n82.\tSince the implementation of the decisions taken at the special session and other economic items of special interest to us will be discussed thoroughly in the Second Committee of the General Assembly, my delegation feels it sufficient to express its views in broad terms at this stage.\n83.\tIn conclusion, the delegation of the Republic of Afghanistan pledges its full co-operation with you, Mr. President, and with our fellow Members of the United Nations to exert every effort to bring about a new era of common action aimed at investigating all channels in order to improve the political, economic and social situation and conditions of people every-where. We are confident that, with the display and exercise of the necessary goodwill, this session will be marked by success.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to extend to Mr. Bouteflika my cordial greetings and warm congratulations upon his election as President of the General Assembly. This is an expression of the greatest esteem which the peoples of the world have for his country, the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria find for its representative. I am certain that under the guidance of that experienced statesman, this session of the General Assembly will contribute to the strengthening of peace and security and the settlement of yet unsolved problems.\n88.\tThe general debate of the Assembly is drawing to a close. This makes the situation of those taking the floor now much easier; we agree with a good many of the statements made during the debate and we feel that it is needless to speak of every question in detail.\n89.\tThe views of my Government regarding current problems of the international situation are plainly expressed in the Hungarian-Soviet joint communique following the recent highly successful visit to the\nSoviet Union by a Hungarian Party and Government delegation headed by Janos Kadar.\n90.\tIn the judgment of my Government, the inter-national atmosphere has considerably improved, and detente has become a main trend of international life. It cannot be overlooked at the same time that attempts are being made to slow down and even to stop this favorable development.\n91.\tThe General Assembly debate has so far demonstrated that in the process of detente a great part is being played by the improved bilateral relations between the. socialist and the developed capitalist countries, especially the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The meetings of the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States have been significant not merely from the point of view of relations between the two countries, but also because they have promoted the solution of highly important international problems. We note with satisfaction that Gerald Ford, the new President of the United States, has also come out in favor of the policy of peaceful co-existence. We hope that co-operation between socialist and capitalist countries will continue for the sake of detente and in order to bring about a solution of international problems.\n92.\tThe people of my country have been following with particular interest everything related to the strengthening of peace and security in Europe, because the development of the situation in Europe is of paramount importance to peace of the whole world. The improvement of the situation in Europe has been substantially advanced by the fact that countries of the capitalist world have acknowledged the situation established after the Second World War, by recognizing the German Democratic Republic in terms of international law, and also by the fact that it has become possible to normalize relationships between the European socialist countries and the Federal Republic of Germany. However, one cannot leave out of account the fact that some reactionary forces attack the practice of co-operation with the socialist countries and have been calling into question the equal rights of the German Democratic Republic and violating the four-Power Agreement on West Berlin. All of this is playing into the hands of the opponents of detente.\n93.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is still working in Geneva. The holding of the conference and the prospective results of its work can be appraised as a significant contribution to the strengthening of international security which, under the Charter, is the principal task of the United Nations.\n94.\tHowever, the Conference has had to cope with serious difficulties and still has difficulties ahead of it. Some delegations want to divert attention from the basic problems of security and co-operation to secondary issues. In our opinion, there is not a single problem before the Conference to which it would be impossible to find a solution acceptable to all participants. For that very reason we hope that the second stage of the Conference will very soon conclude its work and that the third stage can open at the highest level.\n95.\tThe favorable trend in the European situation is overshadowed by the events in Cyprus. The extremist circles of NATO have long been striving to bring Cyprus in one way or another under their influence and to establish military bases on that island. They are now trying to divide the island country. In contempt of the Security Council resolutions, they are seeking to impose a \\\"solution\\\" that will, essentially, exclude the people of Cyprus from any discussion concerning it.\n96.\tMy Government condemns the flagrant violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We have from the very beginning advocated the restoration of the right of the legitimate Government of Cyprus, the implementation of the Security Council resolutions on Cyprus, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. Respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the non-aligned State of Cyprus must be ensured.\n97.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic fully agrees with the proposal of the Soviet Union that an international conference be convened under the auspices of the United Nations to work out proposals for guaranteeing the independent existence of Cyprus. The United Nations should also do its utmost to make sure that the problem is resolved as soon as possible. It is in this spirit that my delegation has supported the inclusion of the question of Cyprus in the agenda and will take part in its discussion.\n98.\tFavorable events have been occurring in Europe also. According to all indications, the Portuguese Government is breaking with the shameful past and wishes to participate in international co-operation. In Greece, the military junta that had engineered the coup in Cyprus has collapsed. The first statements and acts of the new Greek Government indicate a positive change in the foreign policy of Greece. We welcome that trend.\n99.\tMore than a year and a half has elapsed since the signing of the document entitled \\\"Agreement on ending the war and restoring peace in Viet Nam\\\", signed in Paris on 27 January 1973. Certain auspicious steps have been taken in implementation of this historically important Agreement, but several provisions still remain unfulfilled. Since January 1973, because of the unceasing offensive operations of the Saigon army, the guns have been silent for hardly a minute in South Viet Nam; action follows upon action to seize new territories; the Saigon army burns down villages, compels thousands of people to abandon their homes, and keeps tens of thousands languishing in its jails.\n100.\tThe International Commission for Control and Supervision has for months been reduced to inaction. The Saigon Administration refuses to grant to the military delegation in Saigon of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam the immunities and privileges which are indispensable for normal work and which are defined in the Paris agreement and recognized in international diplomatic practice. In such circumstances, the Joint Military Commission of the two sides is incapable of working, and consequently the normal activity of the Inter-national Commission for Control and Supervision lacks juridical foundations and practical guarantees.\n101.\tOn the other hand, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam is taking initiatives in an effort to carry out fully the provisions of the Paris agreement, as is made clear in its six-point proposal made public on 22 March 1974.\n102.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic emphatically condemns the schemings of the Saigon Administration and the external forces backing it, and demands that all provisions of the Paris agreement be put into effect without delay. We think the United Nations should deal with the South Vietnamese signatories on a footing of equality. It should make sure that the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam is granted the status of observer at the United Nations.\n103.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic has been pleased at the progress made in the Laos settlement. As far as Cambodia is concerned, my Government supports the struggle of the patriots against the Lon Nol regime which has usurped power in that country. We are of the opinion that Cambodia can be lawfully represented in the United Nations only by a delegation of the Royal Government of National Union.\n104.\tAs regards the conflict in the Middle East, only initial steps have been taken towards a comprehensive and just settlement. We, for our part, highly appreciate all positive steps to bring about a settlement in the Middle East, regardless of which country may initiate them. But we condemn the attempts being made to freeze the present situation, to postpone any settlement and to maintain tension in the Middle East. We have good reason to suspect that there are some who are striving to torpedo the Geneva Peace Conference. We know from a statement by the Prime Minister of Israel that the Israeli Government is against any multilateral talks; that instead, in an effort to split the ranks of the Arab countries, it wishes to hold bilateral conversations. It seeks to enforce all this by continued arming and. even by armed provocations. In this they are playing with fire, which is a very dangerous game. If such machinations continue, a renewed outbreak of fighting in the Middle East cannot be ruled out. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic condemns the actions of Israel and its disregard of the resolutions of the Security Council.\n105.\tA major aspect of the Middle East problem is the safeguarding of the national rights of the Arab people of Palestine. My Government is one of those that have advocated discussion of the Palestine problem as a separate item of our agenda. We hope that this debate will bring us closer to a solution.\n106.\tA just settlement is also being impeded by the efforts of international reaction to drive a wedge be-tween the Arab countries and their sincere friends, the socialist countries. However, the Middle East crisis cannot be resolved without the participation of the socialist countries. Those who are against this really want to impede the achievement of any settlement. We think that the forces seeking a lasting and just peace in the Middle East must demand an immediate resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference, because that is the most appropriate forum, in the present circumstances, for working out the ways and means for achieving a solution.\n107.\tThe Hungarian Government has joined the sponsors of subitem (a) on the question of Korea entitled \\\"Withdrawal of all the foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations\\\". My Government supports the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea towards the peaceful unification of the country. It hopes that the United Nations will also do its share, that it will not tolerate any further abuse of its flag after a quarter of a century, and that it also will get all foreign troops withdrawn as soon as possible.\n108.\tTo judge from the example of efforts to establish a security system in Europe, it would be useful if action were taken also in other areas of the world to guarantee the security of peoples living there. It would be of particularly high importance in this respect for the proposal of the Soviet Union for a collective security system in Asia to be implemented.\n109.\tThe Hungarian people have a profound under-standing of the feelings of peoples fighting for their national independence. We are glad that after long struggles the colonies of Portugal are now winning their independence. However, we must not forget that there are still many peoples living in colonial situations and fighting for their freedom. Racial discrimination still prevails in many territories. It is the duty of the United Nations to assist those peoples in their struggle for liberation and in the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination.\n110.\tIt is heartening that the views of most Latin American countries on several important issues of our day coincide with or are close to the views of the socialist countries and the progressive non-aligned nations. A growing number of Latin American countries are normalizing their relations with socialist Cuba and taking an increasingly resolute stand for the repeal of discriminatory measures and in defense of their independence and sovereignty.\n111.\tA year ago, the lawful Government of Popular Unity in Chile was overthrown by a Fascist military junta. Although the military dictatorship has gone to every conceivable length to consolidate its position, it has been unsuccessful. A mass manhunt is still going on for followers of the lawful Government and for democratically minded Chileans; many innocent people are sent to prison, to concentration camps, or are brought before the firing squads, which carry out death sentences. Governments, organizations and movements all over the world and millions of ordinary people have raised their voices in protest against the brutality of the Chilean junta. My Government and the entire Hungarian people condemn the Chilean military junta and demand that it put a stop to this bloody terror and release imprisoned innocent patriots. There can be no doubt that the junta has not only caused irreparable damage to the Chilean people but has also been instrumental in hampering the process of international detente.\n112.\tThe events of international life have indicated that political detente has made considerable progress. But political detente must be completed by military detente, since only in this way can it be made durable and stable. It is of capital importance that the arms race should be slowed down and ultimately stopped altogether. A few important steps have been taken in this field as well. The agreements between the Governments of the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of strategic arms are an auspicious start. My Government is looking forward to further results from the relevant Soviet-United States talks.\n113.\tBoth the General Assembly and other inter-national forums have quite rightly paid particular attention to the subject of nuclear disarmament, including the definitive prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, as well as the renunciation of the use and threat of force. Strict compliance with the obligations assumed under resolution 2936 (XXVII) adopted by the General Assembly could be a significant contribution to the strengthening of peace.\n114.\tAt the sixth special session, the importance has yet again been confirmed of resolution 3093 (XXVIII), adopted at the last session on the initiative of the Soviet Union and calling for a 10 per cent reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council. With this recent initiative, the Soviet Government has directed the attention of the General Assembly and of world public opinion to a problem which, if left unsolved, could entail almost unimaginable consequences, threatening the human environment and even the sound development of mankind as a whole. We are confident that the good will and the active support of Member States will make it possible to work out without any delay an international convention on the prohibition of action to influence the human environment for military purposes.\n115.\tThe Hungarian Government continues to believe it necessary that the proposal for the convening of a world disarmament conference should *be implemented at the earliest possible date. The Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference has completed its work. Its report [A19628] has been drafted and submitted to the General Assembly. During the debate on the issue, the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations stated their opinions and only a few of them opposed the convening of the conference. We believe that the time has come to take concrete action in this respect.\n116.\tAt the Vienna negotiations on mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, certain NATO circles have been disregarding the principle of equal security, which they themselves accepted, and wish to gain unilateral advantages at the expense of States members of the Warsaw Pact. Of course, this delays the process of arriving at an agreement. An agreement on this question would be important, as it would contribute to the further improvement of the European political atmosphere and would open the way to the conclusion of similar agreements concerning other regions of Europe. '\n117.\tAt its sixth special session on raw materials and development, the General Assembly took a great step forward by trying to give a comprehensive picture of the problems of international economic relations and by working out measures designed to solve those problems. I wish to state here that the Hungarian Government is prepared to co-operate in the implementation of measures approved at the sixth special session.\n118.\tIn my statement, I have had to speak also about dangers threatening the spread of international detente. We are convinced, however, that the process of detente cannot now be obstructed for long. Powerful forces are in favor of peace, security and a closer co-operation among the peoples the socialist community, the national liberation movements, the developing countries which have followed the road of progress, the non-aligned countries and the peace-loving working people of developed capitalist countries. The policy of those leaders of developed capitalist States who have taken into account the realities of today's world is also very important. We have no doubt whatsoever that the combination of these social factors will make the process of detente irreversible. Consequently, we most certainly do not share the view that detente is a transitional phenomenon and that it has now come to an end. This kind of propaganda is meant to serve certain well-known negative aims.\n119.\tThe statement by the representative of the People's Republic of China in the general debate [2252nd meeting] is an indication that there has been no change in the Chinese position. The Chinese representative has again cast aspersions on the Soviet Union and on forces advocating progress and socialism, and he has no constructive proposal to make. It is today clear to all that this attitude plays into the hands of the enemies of international detente.\n120.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic fulfills the wishes of its people when, together with the other countries of the socialist community, it participates in efforts aimed at the strengthening of international peace and security. My Government lays great stress on the development of bilateral relations between the Hungarian People's Republic and countries with different social systems. We attach especially great importance to the development of economic ties, for it is precisely good economic co-operation that can serve as the most solid basis for sound relations in all other fields. My Government strives to ensure that the discriminatory obstacles impeding the development of economic relations will be removed.\n121.\tThe representatives of the Hungarian People's Republic have been displaying considerable activity at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, at the Vienna negotiations on mutual reduction of armed forces, at the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and elsewhere. Everywhere they have been active in a spirit of mutual understanding and have been working to reach agreement without delay.\n122.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic complied with a request from the parties directly involved in the Viet Nam conflict when it undertook to become a member of the International Commission for Control and Supervision. It was guided by a sincere desire to promote, in close co-operation with the three other members of the Commission, the implementation of the provisions of the Paris agreement, out of a desire to contribute to the restoration of peace in South Viet Nam. It is firmly determined to serve these aims and not to bow to any pressure applied to it to make it divert from this course.\n123.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic maintains friendly relations with the Arab States fighting for their just cause. We are their friends and stand by them in their struggle in defense of their freedom and independence, as well as in times of peaceful construction.\n124.\tMy Government takes a very favorable view of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries, and notes that it stands up ever more consistently against the enemies of the independence of developing countries, and of peace and progress, and against imperialism and its allies. Hungary supports the progressive efforts of the non-aligned movement.\n125.\tAs can be seen from my statement, in the recent past the role and importance of the United Nations have increased. This is essentially because the Organization has reached a stage of its development at which it can already play a positive role in promoting the political settlement of conflicts that threaten to lead to a crisis.\n126.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic supports those initiatives which are taken with a view to putting into effect the purposes defined in the Charter, but we are opposed to such proposals, for example, as the revision of the Charter, as it would entail a decline in the effectiveness of the United Nations.\n127.\tIn conclusion, I wish to extend, on behalf of my Government, our greetings of welcome to the de-legations of two new States Members of the United Nations, the People's Republic of Bangladesh and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. From the very outset, my Government has supported the claim to membership in the United Nations of those two States which were born in a struggle for liberation, and it has not hesitated to recognize them as independent sovereign States. We are certain that their participation in the work of the United Nations will be most useful.\n128.\tI also greet the representatives of the newest member of the Latin American group, Grenada, and I wish their country prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I wish him all success in that high office, and he can feel certain of the full confidence and support of my delegation.\n354.\tAllow me also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and his staff for their tireless efforts in promoting the cause of the United Nations and thus the cause of peace in the world.\n355.\tI would also take this opportunity to join my colleagues who have welcomed the new Members of the United Nations: Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. We look forward to their co-operation and contributions to the work of the Organization.\n356.\tA new Government was recently formed in Iceland. Participation in the United Nations is a basic element of the foreign policy of that new Government, as has been the case of all Icelandic Governments since we joined the United Nations in 1946. The Icelandic people fully realizes the necessity of global co-operation in all fields of human endeavor. We feel that the United Nations is the proper instrument to make that co-operation successful. We also realize, that that co-operation is possible only with the full and effective political backing of the United Nations by the international community.\n357.\tRecent events have again shown the necessity to make the United Nations more effective in times of crisis. It is indeed tragic that the problem of Cyprus is with us again. The solution of 15 years ago was found only after much bloodshed, and the recent fighting has added a new chapter to a story already sad enough. We hope that all parties concerned will scrupulously respect the cease-fire now established and wilL make it possible for the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations to carry out their important and difficult task.\n358.\tAllow me at this point to offer my sincere condolences to those Governments whose soldiers have been killed or wounded in carrying out their peace-keeping duties for the Organization.\n359.\tIt is our firm belief that a lasting solution of the Cyprus problem can be found only through peaceful means and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, and it is of utmost importance that in all further negotiations the resolutions of the Security Council be fully carried out. And, of course, any solution must be based on respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus itself.\n360.\tThe situation in the Middle East remains enormously complex and precarious. The wisdom and patience shown in the recent disengagement agreements indicate a welcome trend which we hope will lead towards a solution of a more permanent nature. Any solution should take into account all relevant considerations, including the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. Here again, in this area, the most useful role of the United Nations peace-keeping forces cannot be over-estimated.\n361.\tThe question of decolonization has been on the agenda of the United Nations for many years. At this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly we are in the happy position of being able to welcome Guinea-Bissau as a Member and to welcome the establishment Of a provisional Government in Mozambique. We have in the past in this forum heard severe criticism of the Portuguese Government for its colonial policy. Today it is most gratifying to be able to praise the new Portuguese leadership for the important steps that are being taken in conformity with the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations to grant independence to the populations of the Colonized Territories.\n362.\tUnfortunately, in other parts of southern Africa the African population is still being severely suppressed. All reasonable steps must be taken to bring to an early^ end the flagrant violation of human rights which is being committed in the area.\n363.\tThe Korean question was discussed at the last session of the .General Assembly more usefully, perhaps, than could have been expected. The conclusion, acceptable to both parties to the dispute, expressed the hope that further bilateral discussions aimed at peaceful reunification could take place. Regrettably, that has not been so. Whether discussions during this session will carry the question any further towards a solution remains to be seen. But, in any case, it is to be hoped that some further progress on this longstanding problem can be made in the nearest future, leading to a peaceful reunification of Korea.\n364.\tThe world situation demands that all efforts be made to enhance detente, to increase co-operation and to bring about effective disarmament. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has not yet -despite long discussions -produced satisfactory results. There is some uncertainty as to the outcome, but we feel it is of great importance that solutions be found to the weighty questions the Conference is now dealing with. \n365. The situation is similar as regards the even more complex talks in Vienna on mutual force reductions in Central Europe. Progress has been slow. But we hope that those discussions will at an early date have positive results as we consider the outcome of both those series of discussions as a significant test for future developments.\n366.\tLittle headway has been made in the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union since the last session of the General Assembly, but the resumption of the negotiations renews our hopes for an agreement.\n367.\tNuclear tests have been continued and expanded. This sounds a new warning and shows the urgency of reaching an international agreement on a comprehensive ban on the production and testing of nuclear armaments. It is of course essential that disarmament agreements also contain provisions for a ban on the production and possession of chemical weapons.\n368.\tWhile attempts are being made to solve all these armament problems, overwhelming as they sometimes seem, it is also important to look ahead and try to envisage what kinds of new problems in this field we might possibly be faced with in future years and then try, if possible, to avert them before they become acute. For this reason we look with favor upon the initiatives taken for the discussion of potential new threats in this field during this session of the Assembly.\n369.\tNever before in the history of the United Nations have economic matters been discussed at such a high level as they were in the sixth special session of the General Assembly. That special Session has helped deepen the awareness of the increasing economic interdependence of the whole world. It is our hope that we can speed up significantly the efforts aimed at reducing the economic gap Which exists between the industrialized and the developing countries, This is one of the most urgent questions that the international community faces.\n370.\tThe Special Program to provide emergency relief and development assistance to the developing countries most seriously affected [see resolution 3202 (S-Vl), sect; X] has got off to a slow start. A serious economic dislocation is now affecting most countries of the world, some to a disastrous degree, stifling their economic development and adding to the hunger and misery of millions of people. The Icelandic people are most sensitive to this human suffering and the Icelandic Government therefore in June this year contributed to the Special Program of emergency assistance.\n371.\tMy country has been severely hit by these recent economic developments. We are to a greater extent than most countries dependent on international trade, having to import all the oil products we use, much of the food, and practically all our requirements of raw materials. Our principal export item -fish and fish products has generally suffered a considerable reduction in price, This turn of events has led to serious economic difficulties in my country with tremendous inflationary pressures.\n372.\tIt is evident that an important aspect of these problems is. the question of a rational and just utilization of the world resources, which has.never been more urgent than now, given, on one hand, the technical means we possess and, on the other, the rapidly increasing world population.\n373.\tThe problem of energy resources has been highlighted lately by the greatly increased prices of petroleum products. The limitations in the potential supply of these products seem to make it imperative that other sources of energy. be developed. May I suggest that the United Nations has a role to play in this field by acting as a co-ordinator of research to this end. In this connexion, I wish to point to the tremendous latent geothermal potential, the utilization of which has only just commenced. \n374.\tMy country , which depends almost entirely on the resources of the sea for its economic survival, is, as many representatives know, especially interested in the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. In the view of my Government the recently concluded session in Caracas achieved its purpose in clarifying basic alternatives and reducing their number. We are all indebted to the Government of Venezuela for providing excellent facilities for the Conference and also for providing the services of Mr. Andreas Aguilar, who performed his functions as Chairman of the Second Committee of the Conference with great distinction.\t\n375.\tSixty States which had not been members of the preparatory committee for the Conference had the opportunity of explaining their views and being brought into the negotiating process and that objective was admirably accomplished. It was clear that no final solutions would emerge from the Caracas session, since the work proceeded on the basis of the consensus principles, and that further time would be required for the negotiating process. However, in all fields the basic issues are now reasonably well established and it is to be hoped that the forthcoming session in Geneva next spring will proceed to adopt a reasonable package solution.\n376.\tOn the basis of the discussions at Caracas it is now already possible to visualize the outlines of such a package solution. In our view it will consists of a territorial sea of 12 miles, an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 miles, a reasonable solution with regard to the continental shelf area beyond 200 miles, freedom of navigation in the economic zone, unimpeded passage through straits used for international navigation, a balanced solution for coastal State jurisdiction in connexion with pollution and scientific research, the recognition of equitable rights for land-locked States and a strong authority for the international sea-bed area which would safeguard the interests of developing countries in the proceeds from that area.\n377.\tTo my Government the most important issue is the formal adoption of an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 miles, which is now a firmly established concept that enjoys the support of the overwhelming majority of the Members of the international community. I want to use this opportunity to express the satisfaction of my Government with regard to the policy of many Governments that previously were opposed to this concept but have now given their support to it. We look forward to the continuation of the Conference on the Law of the Sea and we are confident that a solution of these matters is now well within reach. It is our hope that agreement will be reached next year with regard to an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 miles and other related otters at the Conference on the Law of the Sea, that Governments which plan to extend their coastal jurisdiction to that distance can proceed on the basis of an international convention.\n378.\tI am not saying that the alternative would be utter chaos, because there already exists sufficient support for unilateral action in this field, if the cooperative efforts should fail, an eventuality that we all should strive to prevent. A solution in the, near future along the lines now indicated through the work of the Conference on the Law of the Sea would be the logical and reasonable result of the tremendous work which has been devoted to the problems involved. In view of this fact I want to use this opportunity to express my Government's admiration for the leadership provided by Mr. Amerasinghe, President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The international community is greatly indebted to him for his endeavors which, I am sure, will culminate in the successful completion of the task of the Conference. Our thanks also go to the chairmen of the committees of the Conference and other officials of the Conference who have shown great devotion to duty. I wish them luck in the further exercise of their great responsibilities.\n379.\tThis is the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Twenty-nine years is indeed a very short period of time in the history of civilization. Admitting that, we ail realize how important a foundation the United Nations has created in this relatively short period of time to increase and strengthen co-operation between the nations of the world for the. benefit of mankind.\n380.\tIt is the most valuable recognition of the importance of the United Nations that none of us would like to see the world today without the Organization.\nAs long as we all have this firm belief in the necessity of the United Nations, we are indeed on the right path leading us to a better and more just world in spite of the fact that we have not been able to progress as fast as the more optimistic had hoped and therefore we have sometimes had considerable disappointments through the years.\n381.\tIn this connexion I think it is encouraging for all of us if we recall the world situation 29 years ago. Then, almost two thirds of the 138 Members now represented in this Hall were colonies and their peoples were without the freedom, sovereignty and independence they now fortunately enjoy. Then there was very &Ue international co-operation for the furthering of. human rights and very few efforts to avert hunger and poverty in the world. And then there was no international institution to mediate in armed conflicts between nations and act as a peace-keeping force.\n382.\tBecause of the existence of the United Nations we are now living in a much better world than existed 29 years ago. Therefore we all must continue to strengthen the Organization, in the firm belief that we are contributing to a better world of tomorrow. That belief can and will, if we let it guide us in our work here, bring us each day closer to our goals. That belief is of the utmost importance for us all, since it is equally acceptable to the developing and the developed States, to the poor nations and the rich, and therefore we can unite under its banner for the creation of a more peaceful and a more just world.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, I have the honor to congratulate you on your election to the high and responsible position of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. This gives me particular pleasure since you represent friendly, non-aligned Algeria, which, like my own country, through a national liberation war and revolution won independence and created the conditions for social progress and equal participation in international relations. Your election symbolizes the growing role in the world of the peoples and countries of Africa and their successful struggle for freedom, independence and equality, as well as the in-creasing role of the non-aligned countries and the policy of non-alignment in the contemporary development of international relations.\n1Q8. The untiring efforts and the competence with which Mr. Leopoldo Benites conducted the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly, last year, as well as the sixth special session of the General Assembly, merit our most profound thanks and recognition.\n109.\tMy delegation has already had the opportunity to welcome the admission of the three new Members in the Organization and, in that connexion, to express our great pleasure. Permit me to congratulate once more the delegations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the Republic of Guinea- Bissau and Grenada on their admission, which is one more important victory on the road to achieving the universality of the United Nations.\n110.\tOn behalf of my delegation, I should like to express to Secretary-General Mr. Kurt Waldheim our recognition of his great personal commitment to finding solutions to the crises in the Middle East and Cyprus, and of his efforts in that connexion, as well as in connexion with the carrying out of the program of emergency measures to mitigate the difficulties of the most seriously affected developing countries.\n111.\tIn the period between least year's General Assembly session and this one, many turbulent and important changes have occurred which have not by-passed a single area of international relations, and from which no region of the world has been exempt. Almost never before have so many problems, in so short & time and with such intensity, engaged the attention of the international community.\n112.\tThe basic characteristics of these changes are a profound social-economic ferment in many countries, and ever stronger and more organized demands for fundamental changes in international political and economic relations. The achievement of domestic progress is becoming increasingly tied to the struggle for complete political and economic independence and equality and for the elimination of the causes of tension and hotbeds of crisis.\n113.\tThe process of relaxation of tension between the big Powers and in Europe has led to certain achievements important to peace and security. This is reflected in the initial results obtained in the field of the limitation of strategic nuclear arms and the removal of the danger of a general nuclear war, as well as in the convening of the Conference on Security . and Co-operation in Europe. The successful conclusion of that Conference would be a new, important contribution to consolidating the process of relaxation of tension and the strengthening of peace, security and equal international co-operation in Europe and the world. Yugoslavia decisive favors and, together with other participating countries, is making a constructive contribution to the successful outcome of the Conference, There is no doubt that the continuation of the process of relaxation of tension is of the greatest importance for the preservation of peace in the world and the solution of international problems.\n114.\tThe relaxation of tension in the world is in the interests of all countries. It should become a world process and encompass the solution of the most serious international problems with the equal participation of all countries, especially those most directly interested. If such general relaxation is not achieved, or if it should remain limited in scope, content and participants, we would have no guarantee that we had really moved away from the danger to the peace and security of many countries, and not even from a confrontation of global proportions. The role of the United Nations is of the greatest significance in the further development of the relaxation of tension. The non-aligned countries particularly contribute to the development of this process, in which they see the expansion of active peaceful coexistence in the world and conditions for attaining their jointly established aims.\n115.\tIn the complex and uncertain development of the world situation, the policy of non-alignment, which at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers in September 1973, gained new strength and established the basic directions for common action by the non-aligned countries, has been, further confirmed as the lasting political orientation of an ever-increasing number of States and as a world policy. The non-aligned countries have become not only a powerful moral and political factor but a real material force, which has shown that it can influence international relations and make a real contribution to the solution of the most important international problems. It should be stressed in this connexion that the non-aligned countries have always been inspired by a desire for equitable and broad co-operation with other countries, and that confrontation has been imposed on them by the positions and conduct of certain Powers.\n116.\tThe challenge to the international community and the United Nations, and especially to the non- aligned Countries, is all the greater and more bold because of the frequency of cases of direct and indirect foreign interference in the internal affairs of other countries* often with the aim of overthrowing the legal government and changing the political orientation of a country. Furthermore, the internal social and economic difficulties?- encountered by certain developing countries are frequently used to the same end, whereas solidarity should be expressed and assistance extended to them in overcoming such difficulties. There is no hesitation even about attempting to legalize such interference as the right of the stronger. The United Nations must not permit any country, on whatever grounds, to secure the right to interference and intervention, for this would be the gravest blow to efforts for the relaxation of tension in the world and the establishment of equitable international relations; it would be a dangerous threat to peace and security, and even to the very existence of the United Nations.\n117.\tWhy do we have these and similar dangerous phenomena in international relations? We find the answer in the reality of the existing profound differences and contradictions in the development of international relations in our era. Acting contrary to the process of relaxation of tension, to the struggles of peoples for full political and economic emancipation, equal international co-operation and peace and security in the world, are the forces of imperialism, colonialism and other kinds of foreign domination, hegemony and exploitation, which often resort to interference in the internal affairs of other countries and to various forms of pressure and do not even shrink from the use of force. As a direct consequence of this practice there is today a whole chain of crises and tensions, from Viet Nam and Cambodia, through the Indian Ocean and the Middle East, to Cyprus and southern Africa, which directly threaten the freedom and independence of many countries and peoples as well as world peace and security. In other parts of the world, too, there are many latent crises and conflicts which could lead to new and dangerous tensions in international relations.\n118.\tFollowing the significant changes resulting from the successful liberation struggle of the Arab countries and copies in the October war against Israeli aggression, which we view as only the first step towards an overall solution of the Middle East crisis, I must express concern over the lack of further progress and the return to the state of \\\"no peace, no war\\\". Moreover, the trends towards a heightening of this dangerous international crisis are becoming stronger. Obviously, the responsibility for this situation lies with Israel, which continues to show reluctance to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, resorts to aggressive conduct and is threatening a new armed attach. It is a dangerous illusion to believe that the crisis can be kept under control or that it can be localized while the settlement of the problem is postponed.\n119.\tYugoslavia calls for the prompt and complete withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967 and subsequently. This is an essential prerequisite for achieving a comprehensive and just solution which would enable all the countries and peoples of the Middle East to live in peace and independence.\n120.\tWe have always believed that a settlement of the Middle East crisis is impossible without a solution at the same time of the Palestinian problem. Therefore my country is among those that have wholeheartedly supported the initiative to include this item in the agenda of the General. Assembly [AI9742 and Add.I-4]. This comes at a particularly timely moment in view of the frequent attempts to push this problem into the background and by various maneuvers make it impossible for the legitimate representatives of the Arab people of Palestine to take part, on an equal footing, in its solution.\n121.\tYugoslavia firmly supports the recognition and realization of the national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, and primarily its right to self- determination and free development, and considers the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] to be its sole legitimate representative. We are convinced that at this session appropriate decisions will be adopted in this direction and that the Palestinian representatives will be granted equal participation in all efforts to overcome the Middle East crisis and all phases of the negotiations.\n122.\tThe crisis in the Middle East and the new Cyprus crisis are interconnected, intensifying tensions and increasing the danger to peace and security in that part of the world and generally. It is therefore essential that these crises be settled without delay. It has again been confirmed that peace and security in Europe, in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East, which are of fundamental importance for peace and security in the world, are interlinked and that they cannot for long be strengthened or consolidated apart from each other. \n123.\tWithout going into the history of the Cyprus crisis I should like to set forth our views on its essence and the basic elements on which a settlement can be achieved. My Government believes that it is now most important to begin the process of settling this acute and dangerous situation. Provoked by interference on the part of imperialistic and reactionary forces in harness with the former Government of the Greek military junta, by means of the well-known putsch against the Government of the Republic of Cyprus headed by President Makarios, and in view of the unsettled relations between the two national communities in Cyprus, the crisis flared into an armed conflict and foreign military intervention, which despite the present cease-fire continues to entail great sacrifices and suffering of the population of the Republic of Cyprus.\n124.\tThe independent and non-aligned Republic of Cyprus is, after Chile, the second non-aligned country within a year to fall victim to inadmissible foreign interference in internal affairs and to the policy of force. We view these events as dangerous attacks on the policy of non-alignment as a whole following the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers which all non-aligned and other peace-loving countries must most resolutely resist.\n125.\tMy country, as a neighboring and non-aligned nation having friendly relations with the Republic of Cyprus, with Greece and with Turkey, has endeavored from the beginning, within the limits of its capacity, to contribute to overcoming the crisis. The President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito, sent messages to the leading statesmen o.f the Republic of Cyprus, of Greece and of Turkey. Believing this to be a crisis of the broadest international significance, President Tito then sent messages also to the chiefs of State of the permanent members of the Security Council and to a number of non-aligned and other countries, as well as to the Secretary-General.\n126.\tIn these messages, and on many other occasions, my Government pointed out the principles which it considers to be the basis for a just and lasting solution. These are: full respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non- alignment of the Republic of Cyprus; the withdrawal of foreign armed forces and bases from Cyprus; and the establishment of relations of equality between the Greek and Turkish national communities within the framework Of a State organization which they themselves will work out together. Not only must the legitimate representatives of the Republic of Cyprus, in the person of representatives of both national communities, participate in finding a just and lasting solution, but their role in the search for such a solution is of primary importance. Along these lines, the contacts between the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus, which have produced initial positive results, are encouraging.\n127.\tYugoslavia regards as indispensable the full commitment of the United Nations to the finding of ways and means for a political settlement of the Cyprus crisis. In this connexion, we think that the presence and activities of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus are important and my Government extends its recognition to that Force. We deeply regret the casualties it has suffered.\n128.\tOn the basis of these positions, Yugoslavia along with other non-aligned countries, especially those in the group established by the co-ordinating bureau of the non-aligned countries to follow the development of the Cyprus crisis and to offer good offices to the parties to the dispute is ready to continue to do everything in its power to open up prospects for a just and permanent solution of this crisis, in the interest of peace and security and in the spirit of the United Nations Charter, that is, the universally accepted principles upon which international relations should be based. Yugoslavia also supports all further initiatives and efforts for a peaceful solution of the Cyprus crisis that is acceptable to the parties to the depute.\n129.\tWe note with pleasure that the successful struggles of the liberation movements in Africa and the positive changes in Portugal have made possible progress towards the final liberation of the peoples from Portuguese colonial domination. The independence of Guinea-Bissau and the agreement on the attainment of independence by Mozambique are very significant achievements which we believe will soon be followed by the liberation of Angola, the Cape Verde Islands and other colonies.\n130.\tBy consistently supporting and assisting from the very beginning liberation and anti-colonial movements, Yugoslavia has actively endeavored to contribute to this development. Guided by that consideration, we resumed diplomatic relations with Portugal immediately following the removal of the Portuguese Fascist, colonialist regime. We approached this in the conviction that the democratic forces of the Portuguese people will consistently carry out the historic task of decolonization and with a profound belief in the unity of interests of the struggle of the democratic forces of Portugal, and the national liberation movements in the Portuguese colonies. We are happy to see that the democratic forces of Portugal are successfully carrying out this task in co-operation and agreement with the liberation movements. At the same time, we consider it essential that the United Nations engage in preventing any attempt by colonialist and racist regimes to restrict or halt this process.\n131.\tSouth Africa, however, remains a bastion of imperialism, neo-colonialism and foreign exploitation. Not only does the racist regime oppress the African majority of its population but it is also a constant source of threat and danger to the independence of its African neighbors. Without assistance from South Africa and international capital, the white racists in Southern Rhodesia would be unable to maintain their illegal minority regime, which defies all the sanctions of the United Nations. The people of Namibia are still exposed to cruel exploitation by the South African racists. We believe that the time has come for the United Nations to consider in more concrete terms what should be done to put an end to South Africa's constant violation of the fundamental principles and decisions of the United Nations.\n132.\tIn our opinion, there are now favorable conditions for accelerating the liberation of all the remaining colonial strongholds or enclaves in various parts of the world and we should. therefore come closer to the complete realization of decolonization one of the most important goals of the United Nations and of the entire international community.\n133.\tIn South Viet Nam the Saigon regime, with support from abroad, is brazenly violating the Paris Agreement and, by resuming military operations, endangering the freedom, independence and right to self-determination of the people of Viet Nam. The people and Government of Yugoslavia fully support the right of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam - the only legitimate representative of the people of South Viet Nam to observer status and the right to participate in the work of our Organization.\n134.\tAs we know, through procedural maneuvers, last year a discussion of the question of establishing in the United Nations the legitimate rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, led by Prince Sihanouk, was postponed, but the acuteness of this problem has not diminished. In fact, the postponement has proved to be completely unjustified. The Lon Nol regime is, as it always has been, an instrument of foreign intervention and interference. The liberation struggle of the people of Cambodia has registered new successes, while their legitimate Government actually controls most of the national territory. It is therefore essential for this session of the General Assembly to adopt a resolution in favor of recognizing the legitimate Government of Prince Sihanouk to represent Cambodia in the United Nations.\n135.\tThe problem of Korea continues to occupy our attention. Important steps have been taken to overcome this heritage of the cold war. The duty of the United Nations, as we conceive it, is to induce the peaceful reunification of the Korean people. We therefore, together with a group of non-aligned and socialist countries, requested the inclusion of an item on the withdrawal of foreign military forces from South Korea under the United Nations flag [AI9703 and Add.1-3] and we favor the adoption of a resolution by the General Assembly in this regard, which is also in the spirit of the consensus achieved at the twenty-eighth session. \n136.\tThe efforts and struggles of the peoples of Latin America to change the existing inequitable relations, for sovereignty over their natural resources and for political and economic independence enjoy the support of a wide circle of non-aligned countries, including my own. The adoption by an ever greater number of Latin American and Caribbean countries of the policy of non-alignment is of tremendous international importance, because it strengthens the power and role of the non-aligned countries, in international relations and in solving acute and' long-term international problems, while at the same time it is a further guarantee of the success of their struggle for emancipation and equality.\n137.\tIn recent months we have witnessed the further deepening of theT crisis Of the world economy. The world trade and monetary systems are in a state of profound crisis. Inflation is rampant and, like a relentless tidal wave, is sweeping from one country to another, and the greatest sufferers from this are the broad working classes of the population and the countries at the lowest level of economic and social development.\n138.\tThe so-called energy crisis and the crisis of the system of international economic relations, which most directly affect the development of political relations, have again confirmed that in today's world of increasing interdependence of countries and peoples no area can be isolated in either prosperity or crisis.\n139.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development, provided a comprehensive analysis of contemporary economic problems. On the initiative of the non-aligned and other developing countries it reached a historic decision on the establishment of a new international economic order and adopted a Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)]. This offers a basis and framework which make it possible, by common effort and respect for the interests of both the developing and the developed countries, to seek solutions to the most serious economic problems confronting us. For that reason, in our opinion, our actions should be directed towards the most rapid and complete implementation of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-F/)] and the Program of Action. We are convinced that a search for some other solutions and resistance to the inevitable process of establishing a new economic order could only worsen the already critical situation in which we find ourselves today.\n140.\tI should especially like to stress the importance of the most urgent and complete implementation of the Special Program contained in the Program of Action. Despite the fact that the General Assembly at the special session achieved a high degree of agreement on the need to extend urgent and adequate assistance to developing countries which are most seriously affected by the current economic trends in the world, the implementation of the Special Program as a whole is going slowly, so that there is a danger of its losing its basic purpose. The extremely difficult position of the most seriously affected developing countries places a great obligation on all countries to heed the appeal launched at the special session, in the name of solidarity, interdependence and common progress. We feel that at this session the General Assembly should give decisive support to the implementation of the Special Program.\n141.\tIn this connexion, I particularly wish to emphasize the extraordinarily difficult position of the\nPeople's Republic of Bangladesh, which is fighting the terrible consequences of inherited backwardness, war destruction, natural catastrophes and extremely unfavorable world economic trends. In addition, a matter occupying our close attention is the grave consequences of famine affecting many African countries, particularly in the Sudano-Sahelian region, and in some other countries in other parts of the world. It is of vital necessity for the international community and our Organization to approach more decisively the solving of these acute problems.\n142.\tAware of the situation in the most seriously affected developing countries, the Government of Yugoslavia has decided, within the confines of its capacities, to contribute to the emergency measures provided for in the Special Program, despite the fact that my country, also, seriously feels the results of these unfavorable trends in the world economy that include restrictions imposed on its traditional export markets.\n143.\tThe developing countries will continue to rely on their own capabilities and to utilize their own resources. They are determined to speed up their economic development by joining forces and through mutual co-operation and assistance. We feel sure that the meeting of representatives of the co-ordinating countries, which has just ended in Belgrade, and which prepared a number of proposals for the implementation of the Action Program for Economic Co-operation among Non-Aligned Countries, will contribute to this.\n144.\tIn achieving the aims and performing the tasks laid down at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, the role of the United Nations is irreplaceable. We have often witnessed a lack of orientation on the part of certain organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations towards carrying out the resolutions and recommendations of the General Assembly, while today there is a growing tendency to bypass the system of the United Nations, and to seek solutions to outstanding economic problems in closed, privileged circles. What is essential today is to have ever more concentrated actions by the organs and agencies of the United Nations.\n145.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, and the World Population Conference, contributed to the solution of the problem of development, and thus also to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations. To those same goals should contribute such important actions in the coming period as the adoption of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, the World Food Conference, the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and, as the climax of a period of exceptional all-round activity by the United Nations, the special session of the General Assembly to be held in September of next year, in the preparation of which we should even now begin to pay the greatest care. \n146.\tPresent developments in the world are accompanied, and to a great extent conditioned, by the strengthening of the influence of the military factor on the policy and actions of some Governments. This also leads to an acceleration of the arms race which is acquiring disturbing proportions, and to an increase in the role of the military-industrial complex in certain developed countries.\n147.\tThe greatest danger threatening humanity is the possible use of weapons of mass destruction. For this reason, Yugoslavia, together with other non-aligned countries, and in the spirit of the resolutions adopted at their conferences, has always most resolutely favored the undertaking of urgent measures for the complete prohibition of the use, development, production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons, and for the destruction of existing stockpiles. In this context, we also support the prohibition of all nuclear and thermonuclear weapons tests for military purposes, in all areas and by all countries. For the same reason, we firmly support the efforts for the earliest possible prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of all chemical weapons and the destruction of existing supplies.\n148.\tWhile the development and production of nuclear weapons continues, we cannot refrain from pointing out that very modest results have been achieved so far in the field of the transfer of nuclear technology to the developing countries. This leads the developing countries to rely on their own resources and, by uniting their capabilities, to seek solutions in this area, also, which would enable them to emerge more quickly from the economic difficulties confronting them. It is high time for the world Organization to find a proper answer to this problem too.\n149.\tNegotiations on disarmament being held bilaterally or within broader frameworks, have yielded some results, which my country supports, but we feel it is essential to give a new powerful stimulus to these efforts. We believe that a world conference on disarmament could open new paths and perspectives for the abandonment of the armaments race, and for disarmament, in conditions of a strengthening of trust among peoples and States.\n150.\tWe welcome with satisfaction the success of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression, of which Yugoslavia is a member, in submitting to the Assembly at this session an agreed draft definition [fee A19619 and Corr.l]. Although the draft definition is a result of compromise, it defines the most important characteristics of the act of aggression, a definition that can assist the United Nations in identifying an aggressor, preventing and arresting aggression, or checking a potential aggressor. To this end, my delegation is in favor of the General Assembly's adopting, by consensus, the proposed definition of aggression.\n151.\tThis decisive turning-point in international relations, makes it essential for us to combine our efforts on the broadest possible basis so that the search may continue for the solution of outstanding questions by peaceful means and in the spirit of the principles to which we, so often, as Members of the Organization, have declared our attachment.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the Greek Government, and on my own behalf, I should like to express our deep feelings of satisfaction at your election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. These feelings are even more profound because the work of this Assembly will be conducted by one of the outstanding pioneers of the non-aligned countries and movement and, at the same time, by an inspired promoter of the idea of a sincere and close political co-operation among the Mediterranean countries.\n179.\tIn view of the traditionally friendly relations between our two countries, Mr. President, I hardly need to assure you that the Greek delegation will spare no effort in order to assist you in the fulfillment of your difficult task.\n180.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Benites of Ecuador, for the efficient manner in which he carried out his duties. Mr. Benites not only showed an exceptional diplomatic skill throughout a year marked by many complex international problems but also presided with great success over the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n181.\tMy delegation would like also to pay a special tribute to the unremitting efforts of the Secretary- General to attain the objectives of the Organization and to ensure the maintenance of peace and security in the world.\n182.\tFurthermore, I should like to welcome, on behalf of my Government, the admission of three new Member States to the Organization. Greece wants to extend to the Governments of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau its sincere congratulations and its best wishes for their progress and prosperity.\n183.\tI shall now proceed to express the views of my Government with respect to some of the main items on our agenda. It is obvious that the new Government of Greece, which enjoys the widest possible popular support and expresses the democratic aspirations of our people, will have to reassess some fundamental aspects of our foreign policy in the light of developments which have taken place within and outside our country. The Greek Government is convinced that differences in the political and social systems among countries constitute no obstacle to the promotion and development of friendly relations among States. We consider that these relations can be easily extended to a wide range of co-operation in various, fields of activity within or outside the context of multilateral relations in the United Nations and other international bodies.\n184.\tWe believe in the principles which are the foundation of this Organization and the only source of hope for the maintenance of peace and security in the world. These principles are: respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States; non-interference in the domestic affairs of others; and condemnation of every kind of imperialism, expansionism and colonialism, especially in their most recent forms, and most particularly of economic imperialism, chauvinistic expansionism or disguised colonialism.\n185.\tWe now wish to turn to another item which has been on the agenda since the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security adopted at the twenty-fifth session [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. This text could by itself prove if proof were needed that the Organization is short neither of good ideas nor of noble ideals. What the Organization is short of is the will of some of its 'Members to implement the ideals and the political courage to avoid the use or threat of force in international disputes.\n186.\tParagraph 1 of the Declaration solemnly reaffirms:\n\\\"the universal and unconditional validity of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as the basis of relations among States irrespective of their size, geographical location, level of development or political, economic and social systems and declares that the breach of these principles cannot be justified in any circumstances whatsoever\\\".\n187.\tParagraph 2 calls upon all States to refrain \\\"from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State\\\".\n188.\tParagraph 3 solemnly reaffirms:\n\\\"that, in the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the Charter and their obligations under any other international agreement, their obligations under the Charter shall prevail\\\".\n189.\tParagraph 5 solemnly reaffirms, among other things:\n\\\"that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal . . .\\\".\n190.\tI have quoted a small part of the Declaration only to stress from this rostrum that there is no need to adopt any new texts for many decades to come if we are all prepared to abide by those already existing. That is why my delegation is in favor of emphasizing the need for every Member State to apply strictly the principles of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security in every respect and in all cases.\n191.\tWe think that the same remarks should be repeated in connexion with another item on the agenda, the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in contemporary international relations. To try to find ways and procedures for enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations resolutions is tantamount to searching for the \\\"golden mean\\\" between obsolete extreme nationalism and the still non-accessible ideal of a central international authority.\n192.\tGreece has supported the initiative of the Romanian Government in respect of this item of the agenda since its inception. We now more than ever think that the role of the United Nations should be reinforced, especially in the highly sensitive region of Cyprus and in the Middle East. I shall deal later in this intervention with the present situation in Cyprus and in the neighboring region, a situation entailing serious risks for international peace and security.\n193.\tMy delegation was gratified to read in the introduction to the Secretary-general's report on the work of the Organization [see Al960IlAdd.l, sect. VIII] that some progress had been made in the work of the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations, despite the complexity of the issues involved. We also noted with satisfaction that the same Committee and its Working Group continued their efforts to work out agreed guidelines for the purpose of carrying out peace-keeping operations.\n194.\tIn the opinion of my delegation, supported by the recent experience of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus [UNFICYP], any peacekeeping operation, in order to be successful, should be predicated on the following conditions and guarantees. First, there should be powerful enough and efficient peace-keeping forces. Second, it should be strictly forbidden for any national military force to attack or to exert pressure against the peace-keeping forces. A system should be set up permitting the issuance of an immediate and automatic international sanction whenever such an attack takes place. Third, no impediment or obstruction should prevent peacekeeping forces from implementing the relevant Security Council resolutions.\n195.\tWe fear that, if our Organization does not take measures according to these general guidelines, very soon the peace-keeping operations will become ineffective, the contributing countries will be unwilling to send their troops into troubled areas and the whole peace-keeping task of the Organization will totally collapse.\n196.\tThe Secretary-General, as well as other speakers, expressed these same apprehensions at the 1793rd meeting of the Security Council on 15 August last, when, after resumption of their aggression in Cyprus, Turkish troops deliberately attacked some units of UNFICYP and killed and wounded several of its members.\n197.\tIn this connexion, we feel obliged to state that the \\\"credibility of the United Nations . . . and the respect of its Members for the decisions of its main organs -to use the words of the Secretary- General- cannot be saved by resolutions such as Security Council resolution 359 (1974), by which the Council \\\"Deeply deplores the fact that members of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus have been killed and wounded\\\". This shyness on the part of the Council in regard to naming the aggressor cannot but entail in the long run an encouragement to other potential aggressors towards perpetrating such crimes and violating the Security Council resolutions.\n198.\tThe arms race and matters related to disarmament continue to be an important part of the General Assembly's agenda. A world disarmament conference would undoubtedly stimulate efforts towards disarmament and infuse a sense of urgency in this field. It would facilitate the exchange of views on this subject of paramount importance and allow a useful summing up of the progress achieved in this field hitherto. It is to be hoped that some concrete steps will also be taken to expedite future international action in this area. In order to achieve these aims, the Conference should be adequately prepared, and all States\u2014and in particular the nuclear Powers\u2014should participate.\n199.\tThe review conference convened under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation .of Nuclear Weapons which is to take place next year will, we hope, have the results expected by all peace-loving countries and peoples.\n200.\tWe are also fully aware of the capital importance of the present phase of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks for the future of international peace. Moreover, the Greek Government is determined to assume an active role in the present phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The individual or joint action undertaken by the smaller States participating in that Conference is an important corollary to the negotiations being carried out by the United States and the Soviet Union. Although the great Powers have a special responsibility for the maintenance of peace, a truly peaceful international order cannot be established if the smaller States do not fully assume their own obligations and responsibilities. That is all the more true following the events we have witnessed recently in Cyprus.\n201.\tAnother question related to the problem of disarmament and arms control is that of the prohibition of weapons which might cause unnecessary suffering or have indiscriminate effects, such as napalm or other incendiary weapons. We all know the results of the work done in Geneva in this connexion by the Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts. However, we all know also that one of the countries which voted in favor of General Assembly resolution 3076 (XXVIII) last year used napalm bombs this year in Cyprus even against civilians, hospitals, forests and the units of UNFICYP.\n202.\tThe new Greek Government has aimed at the full restoration of human rights and civil liberties in Greece. We are gratified to be able to state here that, upon the new Greek Government's assumption of power, all political prisoners were liberated, exiles were permitted to return to Greece, freedom of opinion and freedom of the press were re-established, and a rapid process towards the reactivation of all democratic institutions was initiated. Tragically enough, that happy evolution coincided with the suppression of human rights in Cyprus as a result of the Turkish invasion of the island. Human rights concerning residence, freedom, ownership and the lives of men and women are being violated at this very moment.\n203.\tDuring the past seven and a half years the Greek people had experienced an unprecedented suppression of their human rights and civil liberties. In the struggle to regain their freedom, the Greek people turned for support to the international institutions responsible for the implementation of the law governing the international protection of human rights. Questions relating to the situation in Greece were unsuccessfully brought to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights and its subsidiary bodies. I am citing this example because it reflects a fundamental weakness of the United Nations system for the protection of human rights. My Government strongly urges that the implementation of the instruments concerning the international protection of human rights be strengthened, and will support any initiatives in that direction.\n204.\tToday, when the colonialist Powers have abandoned or are in the process of abandoning their colonies, we are witnessing here in the United Nations the astonishing event of one Member of the Organization trying to colonize another. I am, of course, referring to the Turkish performance in Cyprus.\n205.\tAs far as Greece is concerned, its struggles against colonialism, fascism and imperialism are well known and proved by its attitude during the two World Wars. Today, that struggle continues by peaceful means. We are at the side of the oppressed peoples, and we offer our unreserved support to the nations of Africa still under the colonial yoke.\n206.\tOur position concerning racial discrimination is also clear-cut and unequivocal. It is not by accident that Greece, which has in its 3,000 years of history experienced all possible social and political phenomena, has never known racial discrimination.\n207.\tMy delegation is particularly happy to state that in all questions that matter, Greece stands at the side of our African friends not only because their aspirations are legitimate, but also because the Greek people has worked its way, and continues to do so, through every single stage of the struggle the African peoples are waging today towards the attainment of freedom, economic independence and development.\n208.\tTurning now to international economic conditions, I must express the increasing concern of my delegation at the present disarray in world economic affairs and the unprecedented nature of the problems to be solved.\n209.\tThe post-war system of international economic co-operation is disintegrating under the pressures of inflation and monetary disorder. Poverty and hunger continue to afflict most of mankind, and the disparity in living standards and economic and social achievements between developing and developed countries continues to grow.\n210.\tContrary to earlier expectations, the so-called internationalization of consumer societies did not benefit the poor masses in the developing world. As the continuing deterioration of the world economic situation demonstrates, unless new principles are accepted and emergency measures are taken by the international community we shall have to face a bleak future indeed.\n211.\tThe conclusions of the recent special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and development in particular, the Assembly's Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order will be reviewed at the current session. It is regrettable that the Economic and Social Council has not been able to reach a decision on action regarding the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New\nInternational Economic Order. It is up to the Second Committee of this Assembly to maintain the momentum that has been engendered by the special session. The Second Committee is offered a unique opportunity to initiate fundamental changes in the system, as the present crisis has already given rise to new perceptions of economic relationships and to recognition of the need for the less developed countries fully and effectively to participate in international decision-making on economic issues. Fortunately, there is growing evidence that new development policies are being designed to raise the well-being of the poor by increasing their ability to participate in the development process. Such policies can actually promote rather than hinder economic growth.\n212.\tWe believe that the Declaration and the Pro-gramme of Action adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly are the foundations upon which to build and redress the present economic imbalances in the world economy. We also believe that it is within the framework of the United Nations that those problems could be solved and a new economic order could emerge. It may be that the present institutional set-up of the United Nations is inadequate to deal with all the complex issues involved. If so, then one should proceed with the necessary changes in order to implement the emergency program.\n213.\tI may add that the delegation of Greece attaches particular importance to the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States as approved in principle last June in Mexico City. In our view, the draft Charter which will be considered in the Second Committee under agenda item 483 constitutes a well-balanced document that would certainly strengthen the new international economic order and help the most disadvantaged countries of the third world.\n214.\tAfter dealing effectively with the short-term problems, one should accept a new economic strategy which is now reaching policy-making circles in both industrial and developing countries shifting attention from the high abstractions and generalities of economic growth to the immediate and critical needs of our societies.\n215.\tI think we have to praise the World Bank for having taken important' steps in this direction by supporting a strategy stimulating a new and more humane order of priorities, and also IMF for its efforts to deal with the immediate and urgent question of balance of payment difficulties and recycling of surpluses.\n216.\tIt would be wrong to believe that the oil price explosion was the only, or perhaps even the major, cause of the present instability/ However, at the present juncture of the world economy one cannot exclude economic or financial disintegration, national isolation and a search for more self-sufficiency in many countries, thereby enlarging the pathetic contrasts that exist between the industrialized and the developing countries. A chain reaction of destructive forces may be set in motion should we not live up to the expectations for a new international economic order.\n217.\tConcerted international efforts, coupling a long-term program with an immediate emergency action, would help us to move away from the present threatening phase of great instability and grave dangers.\n218.\tGreece, as a major seafaring nation and at the same time as a country almost surrounded by the sea, attaches particular importance to the development of the law of the sea which has been taken in hand under the auspices of the United Nations. It should be our common endeavor to arrive at agreed principles governing the sea spaces and to prevent arbitrary unilateral actions. The new concepts of the ocean bed as a common heritage of mankind and of an exclusive economic zone should be harmoniously developed along with the maintaining of the basic concept of the freedom of the seas for peaceful navigation, which is the lifeline linking the nations in the exchange of goods and persons. The protection of the marine environment and the rational use of the resources of the seas should find adequate expression in this new law. It goes without saying that in this framework the continental and the insular territory of States should be accorded equal treatment, thus securing the indivisibility of State sovereignty and non-discrimination between continental and insular populations.\n219.\tWe firmly believe that the law should strive to establish clear-cut and objective rules, avoid vague or ambiguous provisions, leave little room for arbitrary or unilateral action by States and thus prevent disputes which might arise in a legal vacuum. We shall continue in the next session or sessions of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to make our contribution in this spirit.\n220.\tI now turn to one of the most difficult problems the Organization has ever faced that of the Middle East. Since the beginning of the conflict Greece has stated that this problem cannot be solved by force. Once more this position was vindicated by the October war.\n221.\tGreece has had the opportunity to stress time and again the principle, repeatedly confirmed by Security Council resolutions, that acquisition of territory through military conquest is inadmissible. No war can solve political problems.\n222.\tTurning to the treatment of civilian populations in occupied areas, the Greek Government is of the opinion that a strict application of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War should be a minimum standard to be applied in every occupied area of the world, under any circumstances.\n223.\tGenerally speaking, we believe that no problem can find a peaceful and lasting solution if the relevant resolutions of the Security Council are not implemented by all parties involved and if there is no willingness on the part of those concerned to apply strictly the principles of the Charter.\n224.\tThe inclusion of the question of Palestine in the agenda of the present session is considered by the Greek delegation as proof that the.General Assembly is not Unwilling to deal with present realities. Problems like the Palestinian question cannot be solved by looking away from them. On the contrary, a serene and democratic exchange of views in this supreme international forum is always likely to make a possible solution more attainable.\n225.\tThe already tense situation in the Middle East has been further aggravated in recent months by the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. On 15 July a coup, condemned by all of us, was staged to overthrow Archbishop Makarios, the legitimate, elected President of the Republic. This coup was not directed against the Turkish Cypriot community of the island. That fact was recognized by both the leader of the Turkish community in Cyprus and the Turkish Prime Minister, who both issued public statements to that effect. During the fighting while the coup was in progress, not a single Turkish Cypriot was killed or injured. Yet five days later, large Turkish invasion forces were landing in Cyprus and the Turkish Air Force was launching indiscriminate attacks against unarmed civilians, under the flimsy pretext of protecting the Turkish Cypriot minority on the island, which, I repeat, had not been harmed in any way.\n226.\tThe situation we are faced with today is as follows. The territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, an independent and non-aligned State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Commonwealth, has been seriously imperiled. Its very identity is jeopardized. A substantial part of its territory is under occupation by a foreign invasion force, which has openly stated its intention to Stay on the island, having expelled the indigenous population of the area.\n227.\tAt the Geneva Conference, convened at the request of the Secretary-General to seek ways and means to implement Security Council resolution 353 (1974), of 20 July 1974, we were presented with an ultimatum to accept either of two plans, which had certain features in common. Both provided for a physical separation of the two communities, with a forced exchange of population.\n228.\tIn effect, the territory claimed for the Turkish Cypriot minority, representing 18 per cent of the total population, was to be 34 per cent of the island. What is more, it was to include the most fertile lands, which yield 70 per cent of the agricultural produce of the country, which represent 60 per cent of the industry, 80 per cent of the tourist business, 100 per cent of the mining industry, the main fresh-water reserves and the only deep-water port of the island all that on the pretext of protecting a small minority. When the Acting President of Cyprus, Mr. Clerides, asked for a 36-hour recess, in view, of the-outrageous Turkish demands which were tantamount to partition and to condemning the vast majority of the people of the island to a life of want and misery, Turkey refused to grant the 36-hour recess. Two hours later, the Turkish troops were on the move again, sowing death and destruction, killing United Nations troops, bombing hospitals and schools. Repeated cease-fire calls by the Security Council went unheeded. Turkey even ignored the ceasefire proclaimed by its own Prime Minister on 16 August 1974. Turkish troops finally came to a halt two days later, after having occupied 40 per cent of Cyprus, and caused an appalling refugee problem reminiscent of similar problems in the area, by uprooting 200,000 people from their homes.\n229.\tAll this was sanctimoniously dubbed by the Turkish Prime Minister and by the Turkish press as. a \\\"peace-keeping intervention\\\". The military leaders, however, who four years earlier had elaborated the plan for this operation, had another name for it. They called it \\\"Attila\\\" unconsciously or perhaps unwittingly identifying it with the chieftain of the Huns, known to history as the scourge of God.\n230.\tIt is publicly claimed that Turkey was entitled to take action in Cyprus by the provisions of the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee signed by Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom.\n231.\tThe Treaty does indeed mention \\\"unilateral action\\\" to be taken by all the guarantor Powers after consultations with the other parties have failed. However, it does not, and could not, mention military action, which would be in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Yet Cyprus was invaded by overwhelming military forces without any prior consultations between the guarantor Powers.\n232.\tThe Treaty of Guarantee, as its title implies, specifically guaranteed the constitutional order of Cyprus, and such action as it contemplated was to be directed towards the re-establishment of that constitutional order if ever it came to grief. Yet we were asked at Geneva, and we are still being asked today, to accept an entirely new constitutional framework for the island, a framework never discussed with and much less accepted by its people.\n233.\tThe Treaty guarantees the territorial unity of the Republic. Yet we are asked to agree to its partitioning.\n234.\tThe Treaty guarantees the independence of the Republic. Yet the substance of the Turkish plan, if accepted, would lead either to the complete abolition of that independence through the annexation of the two parts of Cyprus to Turkey and to Greece respectively or to the establishment of a Turkish protectorate over the island. For how can anyone doubt that with the northern part of the Republic under Turkish Cypriot control, and with the geographical proximity of Turkey, the central federal government envisaged by the Turkish scheme could be anything else but submissive to the slightest whim of Turkey ?\n235.\tThe Treaty guarantees the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus. But can a State any State, be truly sovereign without being independent?\n236.\tInternational treaties are being invoked only to be openly violated. For weeks, for months, we have been watching the rape of a small non-aligned country by its far stronger neighbor. Repeated injunctions of the Security Council of our Organization have been either flouted or ignored. A new and enormous refugee problem is in the process of creation, and human suffering is being used again without much prudence, as a lever for political advantage.\n237.\tGreece has repeatedly declared, and I am glad to be given the opportunity to solemnly reiterate from this rostrum, that Greece has no ulterior aims in Cyprus. As a signatory of the Nicosia agreements, it is committed against enosis and against partition. It has taken the position that the Republic of Cyprus is and must remain an independent and sovereign State and that its territorial integrity must be respected by all; that as an independent and sovereign State, the Republic of Cyprus is and should be free to follow the foreign policy of non-alignment or any other policy that best suits its interests.\n238.\tFinally, Greece has stated on several occasions that no foreign Power, including the guarantor Powers under the 1960 Treaty, has any right whatever to impose upon the people of Cyprus constitutional arrangements of its own choosing. This is a matter of the exclusive I repeat: exclusive - domain of the people living on the island and  it is up to the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots to determine freely by common agreement the institutions under which they want to live, and the emphases is on the word \\\"freely\\\" -not in the shadow of 40,000 foreign troops and over 200 tanks, nor under the pressure of the ordeal of 200,000 refugees.\n239.\tLet me say in this respect that phased reduction of troops and armaments, in view of the latest developments, is not the answer to this particular problem. Whether 40,000 or 20,000 Turkish troops remain on the island is really immaterial when the other party is totally disarmed.\n240.\tThe issues are now clearly drawn. The question is, what is the United Nations going to do about it? As far as Greece is concerned, the United Nations must either act in accordance with She Charter or admit failure.\n241.\tOur Organization is based on the rule of law. It embodies the hopes and aspirations of the great majority of nations for their advancement in peace and security. Its executive organ, the Security Council, was charged with the enforcement of its principles and was endowed with appropriate powers to do so. Again, within the Security Council the five permanent members have been entrusted by the Charter with special responsibilities. Yet most of them have not risen to the challenge of their duties and of their prominence.\n242.\tThe tools are there. Is there a will, or are we going to sit idly by and complacently watch the enforcement of another kind of rule that of the law of force and of conquest? If we do, we shall revert to \\\"square one\\\". If we do, every small nation, and especially the non-aligned ones, will live in fear of its larger and stronger neighbor. If we do, we shall flounder in the morass of our own moral weakness and go the way of the late League of Nations.\n243.\tWhat is needed at this critical moment is courage and determination, for not only does the future of the United Nations as a guarantor of peace hinge upon a solution of the Cyprus problem but the international order in general is also at stake.\n244.\tIt is inconceivable that after the massacre of the two World Wars the whole world, represented in this Hall, should watch, as a mere spectator, the drama of the destruction of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of a small non-aligned and unarmed State by the military forces of a strong neighbor. It is a stigma on our civilization and a shame to the whole world that more than 200,000\nCypriot refugees should have been driven from their homes and compelled to live in the open, with winter knocking at the door. The whole world must move swiftly to put an end to this aggression that sets civilized mankind several centuries back.\n245.\tAny attempt to solve the Cyprus problem by the force of arms would open a permanent source of trouble in the sensitive area of the Middle East and would lead to unforeseeable complications. The United Nations must act with courage and determination. The tragedy of timidity has already led to two world conflagrations. Let us draw the necessary lesson in order to prevent a major international disaster.\n246.\tThe people of Greece and the Greek Government have faith in the moral and political values enshrined in the Charter. They believe in the will of the vast majority of mankind to live in an orderly and safe international society. They are confident that right will prevail over might and that our Organization will once again prove its strength, its vitality and its usefulness.\n247.\tI pray that this faith, this belief and this confidence shall not be disappointed."

        "file_text": "Before beginning my statement may I express on behalf of Venezuela our condolences and our grief on hearing the sad news of the passing of Mr. Paul Hoffman. He was more than a United States citizen: he was a citizen of the world. His devotion and activity not only in the cause of freedom but also in that of helping the poor will be a lasting example to all Governments and peoples of the world.\n130.\tI should like to begin with a most cordial and friendly message of solidarity from the people and Government of Venezuela for the noble efforts of co-operation which this great Organization is making for development, good understanding and peace among its Members. Despite the diversity of the economic systems and the degrees of development of its Members, the United Nations provides all of them with the most favorable atmosphere for the presentation, analysis and solution of their individual and collective problems, thus giving a clear example of what can and must be achieved through dialog for the benefit of mankind as a whole in all the diverse aspects of present day life, beset as we are by the most complex circumstances.\n131.\tThe United Nations undoubtedly represents the best effort that the mind and soul of man have been able to devise in this century for the realization and strengthening of man's oldest and most constant dream: freedom and peace. It was thus that our own liberator, Simon Bolivar, saw it, and to that end he struggled to the day of his death, he who was the Father of our Venezuelan homeland and of five other nations of the Western hemisphere. It was thus that he anticipated by more than a century the very conception of an organization for which he drew the guidelines and which is similar to this Organization to which we have the honor of belonging.\n132.\tVenezuela shares in full solidarity the pain and anguish of its sister Republic of Honduras at the vast material damage and loss of life which it suffered as a result of the recent hurricane which devastated that country. The people and Government of Venezuela have been co-operating from the very first moments of the catastrophe, mobilizing available resources to assist the affected townships.\n133.\tWe wish also to extend to the Government and people of Peru our sympathy and sorrow in the natural calamities that have recently befallen that brother nation.\n134.\tWithout disguising my own personal pleasure at this first opportunity given to me to enjoy the honor of addressing this world parliament, it is with satisfaction and pride that I discharge the pleasant duty entrusted to me by the Government of Venezuela of paying public tribute to the eminent Latin American who preceded you, Mr. President, in your high office. Mr. Leopoldo Benites carried out with talent and skill the delicate tasks entrusted to him by the General Assembly, not only at the twenty-eighth session but also at the sixth special session and later on his visits of goodwill and understanding to a number of Member States of the Organization. Among them, my own country enjoyed the privilege of welcoming him as a distinguished guest, as befitted his high office. We Latin Americans in particular are justifiably proud at having been so ably represented by this experienced and invaluable statesman, who fulfilled the highest and noblest task that the Organization can require of any person.\n135.\tMr. President, I wish to extend to you the warmest and most sincere congratulations of the Government of Venezuela on your well-deserved election to preside over the present session of the General Assembly. I am sure that under your efficient guidance we shall successfully complete the delicate tasks entrusted to us. For Venezuela and the Venezuelan people it cannot but be a source of satisfaction to see a distinguished son of Algeria elevated to occupy such a high post, for Algeria is a country linked to our own by close ties of friendship which date back to the days when the valiant people of Algeria were struggling for their independence. Today, Algeria and Venezuela stand together in the just struggle which is being fought so that the peoples that are still oppressed may achieve the recognition of their inalienable right to both political and economic freedom and independence.\n136.\tWe stand together also in the effort to achieve an international society where a mere just social and economic order prevails, and therefore an order that will be more equitable. We stand together\u2014Venezuela and Algeria, united as we are with all the peoples of Africa, Asia, Latin America and, in general, the third world in the constant and unremitting struggle to bring about an international society which will lead to a more equitable distribution of the wealth of our planet, in order to benefit all mankind and put an end to the odious differences between great and small countries, between weak and powerful nations, between rich and poor peoples. We in Venezuela believe the time has come to refine and combine our efforts to make a reality of the much advocated but as yet theoretical principle of the legal equality of States. For this to become an actual fact and be reflected in genuine conquests of contemporary mankind, we must put an end to the privileges enjoyed by the few to the detriment of the many. It is imperative that we at long last effectively assist the peoples who have up to now been dominated selfishly by the hegemony of certain countries in a system in which great masses of men, women and children have been kept in intolerable material and spiritual wretchedness. That reality has sometimes been covered over with the mask of apparent aid that in some cases has resulted in the creation of a new form of economic dependency.\n137.\tI am particularly pleased, too, to express to the Secretary-General our gratitude and support for his constant dedication to the United Nations and for the invaluable services he has always rendered to the Organization, and for his political, economic and social endeavors.\n138.\tOn the occasion of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, we enjoyed the honor of a visit of the Secretary-General, to whom the Government and people of Venezuela extended the hospitality which is due to so exalted a personality.\n139.\tWe in Venezuela are convinced that the time has come to encourage and to carry out jointly among all States the adjustment and transformation required by the new international economic order that was proclaimed by the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n140.\tThe United Nations has many accomplishments to its credit; but when decisions have to be made, hesitations arise and vested interests tend to take over and in many cases the pressure of the strong over the weak becomes manifest. This proves the need for a thorough and genuine restructuring of the Organization, which is rapidly progressing towards universality.\n141.\tMy country has always asserted the need to transform the Organization into a true international forum, a place where pressing problems of all kinds that beset the international community can be aired and studied freely and objectively. That is why it is a matter of particular gratification for my country to welcome the three new States that have just joined the United Nations, namely, Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau.\n142.\tTwo )f those new States emerge into independent life after a lengthy period of colonial domination, and, as far as Venezuela is concerned, we cannot hide the fact that in the specify case of Grenada we are especially pleased. Not only is Grenada our close neighbor, located in the Caribbean, but also, we are linked by ties of friendship and co-operation based on the search for a real and honest Latin American integration for the mutual benefit of our peoples, so closely linked by history and a promising common destiny.\n143.\tThe admission to the United Nations of each new State that emerges into independent life highlights once again the invaluable work done by the United Nations in this field.\n144.\tThe phenomenon of decolonization is an irreversible historical process. The latest events in Africa prove if proof is still necessary that no Power can hope to keep under the colonial yoke those peoples that aspire to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, freedom and independence.\n145.\tRegardless of whatever form colonial domination may adopt, it is a fallacy to perpetuate the subjection of a people that sooner or later must end by liberating itself, as had just been done by the former so-called Overseas Provinces of Portugal. I avail myself of this opportunity to offer to the Government of Portugal our most heartfelt congratulations on its change of stand regarding the colonial question, an action which ennobles Portugal in the eyes of the peoples of the entire world.\n146.\tAlong this same line of thinking, we are pleased to take note of the fact that Spain has clearly expressed its intention to comply with and implement General Assembly resolution 3162 (XXVIII), so as to terminate the colonial regime in the Spanish Sahara. It will thus be implementing the principles contained in resolution 1514 (XV), in defense of the interests of the population of that Territory. Also, by inviting the United Nations to be present during the process of self-determination, Spain is complying with the relevant United Nations decisions and reaffirming its support for the principles of decolonization that have been advocated and championed by the Organization.\n147.\tIn the twenty-ninth year of its existence, the United Nations will have to face the collapse of one system and direct its efforts to the creation of a new one, one more in keeping with the reality of a rapidly changing world.\n148.\tThus far, our system of coexistence has been characterized by the existence of independent and dependent States. The development, wealth and welfare of the former were nourished by the subordination and submission of the latter and the exploitation of their natural resources. At present, thanks largely to the work done by the United Nations, that relationship of dependency has changed and given way to a relationship of interdependence. The crisis threatens to display features more marked than those that are beginning to emerge in those countries that developed their industry according to their own exclusive needs and desires. The present period of transition and expectation is unprecedented in the history of mankind. For the first time mankind is becoming aware of the fact that it is, in fact, one and indivisible. Well-being and the benefits of culture and civilization, in general, must be shared more far more if they are to be genuinely lasting. All States should have access to markets and to technology. Each must contribute its share, but not for the excessive benefit of some and to the detriment of others.\n149.\tThe developing countries are now sovereign States, aware of their rights, of their duties and of their potential and ready at all times to defend their permanent sovereignty over their natural resources. The developed nations achieved their positions through the purchase of raw materials and sources of energy at unjustifiably low prices.\n150.\tThe well-being of one third of the world has hitherto been achieved at the expense of the other two thirds: a single industrialized country, with only 6 per cent of the world's population, uses for its own benefit more than half the mineral resources of the world. The emergency situation the world is experiencing calls for concentrated efforts to seek and apply corrective measures urgently and promptly. The need has become obvious for rational management of renewable and non-renewable resources that would take into account the interests of all countries.\n151.\tA confrontation on a world scale to effect a redistribution of markets and raw materials will not have to happen if we, the States Members of the United Nations, as consumers and producers, are reasonable enough to hold an open dialog, with the aim of seeking equitable formulas for understanding on the basis of new definitions of the terms of trade that will redress the long-standing and unfair treatment by the developed countries of those on the road to development. To reconstruct the system along lines consonant with the new international dynamics and requirements will require bold and vigorous efforts that may at last make possible a world based on equality, justice and equity the only viable conditions for the achievement of that cooperation which is the basic source of well-being and peace.\n152.\tAs we see it, the Assembly is the appropriate forum for that purpose. It was created for that end and not as an arena for the uttering of threats by those who possess the dubious privilege of controlling the means of international intimidation and force. Here we can and must find new formulas for peace, cooperation and understanding.\n153.\tWe hope that during the present session the work in regard to the happy initiative of President Echeverria of Mexico will be crowned with success and that we may be able to adopt the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, a project to which Venezuela has at all times given its wholehearted backing.\n154.\tThe developing countries, aware of their responsibility, advocated the convening of the sixth special session of the Genera) Assembly in order to discuss openly and plainly the bases for new mechanisms for the harmonious conduct of international relations, in accordance with the present world situation.\n155.\tThe initiative of the developing countries has led to one of the most important steps ever taken by the United Nations. I am referring, of course, to the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and the corresponding Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] which were adopted in May of this year. Thus the developing countries wished to anticipate the emergency situation which has arisen lately, to the real or potential detriment of the entire international community and particularly to the detriment of those countries whose economies are especially vulnerable.\n156.\tWe are bound to recognize that, despite the great efforts made by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, the emergency operation that the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to launch as part of the Special Program of the Program of Action has not got under way as successfully as it should have. The majority of the developed countries have adopted a \\\"wait and see\\\" attitude as though the onus of the financial burden of such an operation should fall on the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). These countries in defense of their common interests have after many years of effort managed to attain their rightful position in a world where their main, and at times only natural, resource is squandered a resource which is as vital for them as it is for the rest of the international community.\n157.\tWe believe it imperative to insist that neither Venezuela nor the other petroleum-exporting countries will in any way shirk their responsibilities in the present situation a situation that is undeniably financially favorable to them but certainly not one where there is real wealth and no grave problems. We, the petroleum-exporting countries, have tried to tackle the difficulties created by the new situation, in which, besides oil, many other factors of equal, if not greater, importance have had a powerful effect, factors such as the inflation that affects the whole world and that has been generated primarily by the industrialized States.\n158.\tIn keeping with this vie w, Venezuela has pledged contributions to help in facing the difficulties of the present situation that amount to a considerable sum, according to the financial structure and capacity of our country. I must of necessity draw attention to this matter, even if only in generic terms not immodestly, but as an objective demonstration of the position adopted by my country in this field of international economic co-operation.\n159.\tThe financial contributions made by Venezuela are equivalent to 1.2 per cent of its gross national product, and it is relevant to point out that the pledges made by the industrialized countries to assist the developing nations along these lines in most cases do not even reach one percent of their gross national product.\n160.\tThe financial contributions pledged by Venezuela include $100 million for the Special Program; $500 million for a trust fund to be operated by the Inter- American Development Bank, $150 million for the Trust Funds of the Andean Development Corporation, the Central American Development Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank; and for the latter we have set up a special fund of $10 million. We have also made a contribution of $450 million for Special Drawing Rights which are the equivalent of $540 million for the so-called oil facilities of IMF. Venezuela is also ready to contribute to the Fund of OPEC, and intends to help encourage agricultural and industrial development projects in the countries of the third world. We are thus ensuring the fulfillment of one of the targets of the recently created Venezuelan Investment Fund, which is to strengthen international co-operation.\n161.\tThe foregoing is simple, but I think appropriate and a clear demonstration of the stand of the President of Venezuela, Carlos Andres Perez, and his Government in this respect, but I feel that it is also appropriate to supplement the information by mentioning the position taken by my country in the preparatory session of the World Food Conference, that is, that there should be no acceptance of discussion that assessment of contributions to international organizations can be specifically based on oil income, for we contend that such contributions must be based on national per capita income with special consideration given to those developing nations which are going through difficult economic situations.\n162.\tIn line with this argument, let me refer to the Declaration and Program of Action that proclaimed the new international economic order. As might have been expected, the reasons that led the General Assembly to take such action at that time are still valid, so the process of implementation must be speeded up vigorously. If that holds true regarding the emergency situation, which continues to deteriorate with all its real or potential risks to the entire international community and particularly to those countries whose economies have been most severely affected, it is also true in regard to the medium- and long-range programs that are intended to set the new international economic order in motion. Both aspects are indissolubly linked. For all efforts to be tightly and coherently co-ordinated on a world-wide scale, the totality of measures making up the Program of Action must be fully implemented.\n163.\tAs an immediate step, as the Secretary-General has pointed out, it is necessary that the United Nations possess sufficient resources to be able to attend expeditiously to urgent needs and to ensure a certain balance in the distribution of the total resources of the emergency operation. Furthermore, the Government of Venezuela attaches special importance to the prompt beginning of the activities of the Special Fund, failing which the Special Program provided for in the Pro-gramme of Action will not be fully realized, as was so cogently pointed out by the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Leopoldo Benites, at the beginning of this session [2233rd meeting].\n164.\tThe present critical situation which the world is going through will not be resolved without a convergence of all efforts at the international level which will also take in the overall problem of raw materials. In the measure that correlation and balance is struck between the prices of raw materials and manufactures, we shall strengthen the possibility of putting a brake on the inflation which has been unleashed in the industrialized countries, the damaging effects of which no one has escaped and which might lead to a profound crisis with unforeseeable effects on all mankind.\n165.\tFurthermore, the delegation of Venezuela considers it necessary to reaffirm before this great Assembly, where representatives of almost all the States of the present international community are represented, some of the ideas expressed by the President of Venezuela, Carlos Andres Perez to the President of the United States of America, Gerald Ford, a few days ago in an important document which is already on public record [see AI9784]. This defines the position of our head of State in the light of the address made to this very same General Assembly [2234th meeting] by the head of State of the most highly industrialized country of all the already developed nations. The President of Venezuela felt bound to define quite clearly and firmly w he and his Government feel regarding issues as vital and crucial for the present and future of our developing nations, as was the statement made by the Head of the Government of the United States, the host country to the United Nations.\n166.\tThe categorical statements made by our President not only have enjoyed unanimous support among all the political sectors which make up public opinion in our country, but have also received solid endorsement by highly authorized spokesmen and great personalities of many nations. We obviously consider this to be a signal honor, and it also proves how accurate are the ideas contained in that weighty document. In substance, it is clear and simple but it is also eloquent since as our Head of State has averred truth is always clear and simple:\n\\\"The raw materials produced by our countries were purchased year after year at prices which were never in proportion to or in equilibrium with the prices of the manufactured goods which our countries require for their development and which have been purchased largely in the United States, not only for geographical reasons but also because of the credits tied to the United States economy that have traditionally been made available to us.\\\"\nParticularly as regards Latin America, our President's letter adds:\n\\\"For many decades, we in Latin America have persistently demanded just and equitable treatment by the developed countries and primarily, of course, by our neighbor and traditional friend, the United States of America. We have repeatedly pointed to the impoverishment of our countries .\n\\\"Each year we, the countries which produce coffee, meat, tin, copper, iron or petroleum, have been handing over a larger amount of our products in order to obtain imports of machinery and other manufactured goods, and this has resulted in a constant and growing outflow of capital and impoverishment of our countries.\n\\\"In Latin America, as in the other developing countries, we can assert that the developed countries have been taking advantage of the fundamental needs of the Latin American, Asian or African man. To cite the particular case of Venezuela, petroleum prices showed a steady decline for many years, while our country was obliged to purchase manufactured goods from the United States at ever- higher prices, which, day after day, restricted even further the possibilities of development and well- being for Venezuelans.\n\\\"The establishment of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was a direct consequence of the developed countries' use of a policy of outrageously low prices for our raw materials . . .\n\\\"The world food crisis is a consequence, inter alia, of the high prices at which the developed nations sell us agricultural and industrial machinery and other inputs essential to agriculture and the growth of our economies.\\\"\nThe President of Venezuela also maintains in his letter to the President of the United States of America that the Government of Venezuela agrees with the view expressed by him in the United Nations to the effect that \\\"a world of economic confrontation cannot be a world of political co-operation\\\" but our President goes on to say:\n\\\"The economic Confrontation has been created by the major Powers, which refuse to allow the developing countries equal participation in the search for an indispensable balance in the terms of trade. Within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Venezuela has not used no r will it use its energy resources as a political weapon because that is not and never has been the purpose for which that organization was established; rather, its purpose was to protect the basic wealth extracted from our subsoil at prices that have never compensated for the costs of our imports and of the technology needed for our development.\n\\\"We see no other way to confront the economic totalitarianism that has been coming to the fore in business and world trade\\\" said our Head of State \\\"and portends as much evil for the world as was threatened by political totalitarianism in the form of Nazi fascism, against which your great country fought, rendering the world a heroic and splendid service that earned the gratitude of all mankind.\n\\\"The World Food Conference which FAO is preparing to hold in November will not be able to achieve its lofty objectives if we in the developing countries do not succeed in guaranteeing remunerative prices for the raw materials we produce, prices that are in the necessary and fitting balance with the prices of the manufactured goods we import.\\\"\nAnd President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela concludes with the following telling remarks:\n\\\"In view of your important statement in the United Nations, I wish to place on public record this statement of Venezuela's position and the willingness of my Government to work in an international forum to establish a balanced relationship between the raw materials produced by our countries, on the one hand, and the manufactured goods and technology, on the other, which are possessed by the developed countries and are in essence the source of economic marginality and growing poverty in which over half of mankind continues to live. Venezuela perforce takes a sympathetic view of any attempt at finding solutions to the great problems of our time in global terms, but only if a global perspective does not mean that the large countries will prevail over the small countries. It would be dangerous, ineffective and harmful for global and universal solutions to lose sight of the fact that the world includes us as well. It cannot be supposed, Mr. President, that consumers are limited to one part of the world.\\\"\n167.\tThe ideas quoted above are equally applicable or similarly apposite to the nature of bilateral or multilateral relations which, in the economic field, have been applied in terms of trade between the few industrialized countries of the world and the many that are painfully embarked on the road to their own economic and social development.\n168.\tThe phenomenon is not characteristic nor exclusively that of a few countries but is common to all, both developed and developing, the only differences being those of degree and form. But, as I pointed out at the beginning of my address, what is at the root of the matter and I want to emphasize this is that while political independence has slowly but progressively been achieved over the centuries by the members of the international community, their economic independence, as well as the economic interdependence among them, will brook no further delays. The political values of the international community have, almost perceived, been replaced by economic values; a skillful manipulation of incalculable magnitude has taken place whereby the clumsy hegemony of the powerful over the weak which was genetically referred to as \\\"colonialism\\\" has given way to an equally imperialistic but less obvious attitude that has been called \\\" neocolonialism\\\".\n169.\tPermit me, without unduly prolonging this speech, to make a few remarks concerning some of the items on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly. We are all aware that the main problems in the Middle East still await solution. We believe that perhaps the best forum in which to seek such solutions is that provided by the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East if, that is, that Conference is given the determined support of the Organization and if, within the framework of the United Nations, the great Powers co-operate frankly and fully. Venezuela, as an eminently peace-loving nation, is mindful of the law and advocates international co-operation, and will always support any action aimed at achieving a truly just settlement which will respect the rights of ail the parties involved in the conflict.\n170.\tAnother case that must be settled within a wide political consensus of the parties involved is that of Cyprus. In that matter the United Nations must play the role assigned to it by the Charter. The interference of third parties in the evolution of domestic policies must be totally barred and the principles of self-determination and non-intervention enshrined in the Charter must be fully and effectively ensured. As the Secretary-General points out in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, it is obvious that the effectiveness of the United Nations in the solution of the Cyprus problem hinges basically on the support which the Member States may'.give to the decisions of its organs, as prescribed in the Charter.\n171.\tIn these situations of conflict, Venezuela fervently hopes that the decisions of the Security Council will be complied with and that the parties concerned will abide fully by the peace-keeping measures adopted.\n172.\tWith regard to general disarmament in all its aspects, I should like to stress the special interest of Venezuela in this matter. We adopt a practical approach to the subject from the point of view of international security, and therefore in the hope of achieving world peace, for peace that rests on fear is always precarious.\n173.\tThe total prohibition of the use of chemical weapons is the least that the Assembly should achieve at the current session. The manufacture and use of such weapons conflict with the elementary principles of humanity and the fundamental values of mankind, as well as the spirit of the texts and instruments which the international community has drafted and pledged itself to respect and ensure respect for. We would go so far as to say that, even if the Charter of the United Nations did not exist, we should still be justified in protesting against the use of weapons which represent scientific progress only in relation to mass destruction and which highlight the most primitive and bestial instincts of destruction. If world wars and their tragic lessons do not provide arguments capable of dissuading nations from procuring even greater powers of collective destruction and devastation, we can hardly be optimistic about the achievement of harmonious progress for mankind.\n174.\tIn speaking of this tragic and negative aspect of weapons of mass destruction, the peace-loving nations hope that a total ban on nuclear-weapon tests, including underground tests, will soon be implemented. Venezuela is especially gratified to note that on 31 March 1976 a test ban will come into force.\n175.\tIt might seem that we, the smaller nations, can adopt this attitude because we do not have the \\\"commitments\\\" of the nuclear Powers, but we believe that nothing could be further from the truth. It is those \\\"commitments\\\" that may make victims of the weak because they amount to admitting as a yardstick of the greatness of a State its power to destroy, including even the danger of annihilating all mankind.\n176.\tThere can be no doubt and herein lies the root of the problem that disarmament will be broad, complete and viable only when the moral values of our civilization change. It would seem at times that most of the leaders of the great Powers are themselves possessed by a series of doubts, suspicions and reservations which do not reflect the grandeur of their nations. We have no doubt that everybody will agree that it is precisely the great Powers which must set the example, since on them depend the manufacture, distribution and use of nuclear weapons. It is they which in some cases solve their balance-of- payments problem by the sale of weapons; they stimulate conflicts, sponsor wars, dismember nations and withhold vast resources from the solution of the great economic and social problems which confront mankind.\n177.\tVenezuela is by tradition among those States which support the total prohibition of chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons and nuclear tests. We also support negotiations aimed at creating nuclear-free zones all over the world, as has been done already in Latin America. In this connexion, Venezuela is also in favor of holding a world disarmament conference at the earliest possible moment.\n178.\tAs was rightly stated in this same forum in 1962 by the then Foreign Minister of Venezuela, Marc Falcon Briceno:\n\\\"Nations which have no powerful army and which use no language other than that of principle\\\" as in the case of Venezuela \\\"firmly maintain that the problems plaguing this world in crisis can be solved by peaceful means\\\" recognized by international law. \\\" ... In keeping with the ideal of peace which is the very basis of our world Organization the Charter of the United Nations tells us 'to practice tolerance* and 'to live together in peace'. That is an ideal which cannot be achieved overnight. The history of mankind has been different, but its long and dramatic past has given rise to the conviction that war is not a solution, that it is always better to negotiate than to fight. It is in order to negotiate that we who constitute the United Nations have come together here. If only the great Powers, too, might be guided in their deliberations here by that spirit of understanding and faith in principles. If only those great Powers might forget that they possessed the most destructive weapons hitherto known, and might, like the small Powers, the unarmed Powers, rely on a surer and more human arsenal in their international disputes: on international law and the procedures laid down in our Charter, which are the only civilized means of solving any kind of problem between the States Members of our Organization.\\\"\n179.\tIn matters of human rights, our position is, has been, and will be consistent and unchanging. We shall defend them wherever they may be in jeopardy. We advocate their strengthening wherever they are not practiced with sufficient determination, we support the institutions that protect them, and will raise our voice to call for their full implementation. Many of the subjects to be discussed by the Assembly are, in one way or another, connected with human rights. Injustice, inequality, discrimination, breaches of the peace all these are violations of human rights, and these very violations are a contradiction of the very essence of our nation.\n180.\tI wish to repeat that Venezuela is ready as always to support any proposal, any measure, calling for an investigation of the facts whenever there may exist a presumption that human rights have been violated, whether directly or indirectly. We advocate that jointly we should draw up a realistic balance-sheet of the social and economic situation of the world, as we are convinced that the inevitable relationship between underdevelopment and respect for human rights will be made manifest by us. The United Nations must continue its struggle to bring us ever closer to the ideal of social justice, the goal to which we all so earnestly aspire.\n181.\tThe policy of detente which, as has been said, is indivisible and is being applied among the great Powers with' promising results, should be extended to the countries of the third world for the solution of their problems. Venezuela has advocated and will continue to support ways and means that will also bring about detente in our hemisphere. In this connexion, I wish to thank the Minister for External Relations of Cuba for his expression of support for Venezuela and its Government during his statement in the general debate [2258th meeting] when referring to the stand taken by President Carlos Andres Perez in defense of the interests of the Venezuelan people and of the developing nations. Those expressions reflect the desire of our Governments to normalize relations between two Caribbean neighbors, whose past history has more than once found them united in the defense of the interests of Latin America.\n182.\tFurthermore, and still speaking specifically of Latin America, including all the nations of the Caribbean, of which mine is one, President Carlos Andres Perez has, since he assumed office, been encouraging the holding in Caracas of a meeting of Latin American Heads of State or Government. The purpose of such a meeting would be to adopt practical measures to help solve our common concerns and meet our joint needs, thus taking advantage of the singular historic opportunity presented to our peoples. This initiative has been warmly welcomed by the majority of the Governments consulted.\n183.\tVenezuela is always ready to contribute, to the extent of its abilities, to building a new international order, and in this task it offers its co-operation as a country which, though small, has profound democratic and liberal convictions, is a convinced lover of peace and freedom, and a conscientious observer of the principles of non-intervention and self-determination of peoples.\n184.\tIn the present picture in the main discouraging and sombre there is nevertheless one positive and encouraging aspect in that we can meet here, with our different points of view, and at times our conflicting interests, and still leave no doubt as to our firm determination to avoid the kind of confrontations in the world that have thus far proved ineffective as a means of solving problems.\n185.\tThose of us whose responsibility it is to govern must strive with all our strength and intelligence to combat the state of fear and of constant uncertainty facing the common man of today. We must not forget that partly because of that very state of fear and concern over a future that threatens us not only with wars, but also with misery and want, there can be no other possible alternative but that of a constructive dialog for peace, for security, and for economic and social justice.\n186.\tIn closing, may I be allowed to make a firm declaration. Venezuela is fully aware of and accepts its responsibilities within the unstable scenario of our time. We will fulfill them, and we will do so with the unshaken determination to contribute to a fruitful and united co-operation among all the peoples of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, in the name of my delegation and on my own behalf, I should like to extend to you my warm congratulations on your brilliant election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. In the current world context, during this period of decolonization, it is of particular significance that the session is being presided over by a great son of Africa. Indeed, Africa is extremely proud to see that Guinea-Bissau has now joined the United Nations and that the decolonization process as far as Portugal is concerned, at least is accelerating and intensifying and is in the process of transforming our continent into a completely liberated one.\n241.\tMoreover, your election, Sir, falls within the historical context of a process which is leading the world inexorably towards the total liberation of every form of shackles, enslavement, inequalities, injustice, discrimination, hunger and poverty. I am therefore convinced that your long and vast experience in international affairs, your valuable contribution to the African cause, your lucidity, modesty and firmness, not to mention the great services you have rendered to your own country, will all be of vital use to the Assembly in this crucial period for the international community and at a time when the word \\\"crisis\\\" is mentioned all around the world with alarming persistence.\n242.\tIn addition, your election follows the holding, last April, of the sixth special session, which dealt with the pressing issues of raw materials and development.\n243.\tYou are indeed the worthy representative of a sister State whose courage and determination were able to overcome a decaying colonialism. The blood shed by the Algerian people serves as an example and a symbol for all of Africa and for all those struggling for their liberation.\n244.\tThe presence in this Hall of the delegation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to whom, on behalf of my delegation, I extend a hearty welcome is the tangible result of the armed struggle of the PAIGC against the forces of evil. It is also proof of goodwill on the part of the new Portugal since its change of Government on 25 April 1974, and gives the international community grounds for hope. The United Nations, which has always recognized the legitimacy of the struggle of the Guinean nationalists, is thus reaping the fruits of that victory.\n245.\tThe Republic of Zaire, which made its full contribution to the struggle of the African liberation movements, is particularly gratified over this stunning success, all the more so since it was one of the first countries to recognize Guinea-Bissau's independence. We therefore welcome with open arms, to both the African group of States and the international community, this young sister State with which we shall be maintaining close relations of friendship, and developing intense co-operation in all fields.\n246.\tMay I also take this occasion to extend a warm and cordial welcome to the other new States just admitted to the Organization, namely, Bangladesh and Grenada.\n247.\tOn behalf of the Founding President of the Popular Movement of the Revolution and President of the Republic of Zaire, and on behalf of the Executive Council and in the name of my delegation, I sincerely congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his courageous efforts to hasten the liberation of territories still under colonial and racist domination. A great pilgrim for peace, the Secretary-General traveled to Portugal, where he made arrangements with the new Government of that country to advance the cause of those territories.\n248.\tAlthough his mandate in regard to certain territories remains unimplemented, my delegation feels that the new steps taken by the Secretary-General should be encouraged,; and supported by all States Members of the Organization, because, as was stated from this rostrum on 4 October 1973, during the twenty- eighth session, by the Founding President of the Popular Movement of the Revolution and President of the Republic of Zaire, Citizen Mobutu Sese Seko: \\\"Africa today remains the only continent where colonization, racial segregation, apartheid and contempt of man because of the pigmentation of his skin persist.\\\" [.2140th meeting, para. 103.] Both for the honor of the Organization and for international peace and security, it is high time that this situation changed. Fortunately, the new Portugal has given us grounds for hope.\n249.\tIndeed, we are impatient to see the former Portuguese colonies rapidly achieve complete independence, but we should also pay all due tribute to the new Portugal, which, itself emerging from the shadows and from fascism, has already begun the process of complete decolonization, at least for Guinea- Bissau and Mozambique, and we earnestly hope that this will be the case also with Angola.\n250.\tTo be sure, although we cannot overlook the particular situation in that territory in relation to the other Portuguese colonies, we have noted with satisfaction the repeatedly stated determination of the new Portuguese authorities to initiate negotiations as soon as there is unity among the various liberation movements representing the fighters in Angola. The international community can but encourage and spur Portugal on to assume all its responsibilities towards that end.\n251.\tWhile congratulating the new Portugal on the action it has undertaken, the Republic of Zaire nevertheless considers it premature to enter into diplomatic relations with Lisbon until it has carried out its decolonization task to the full.\n252.\tDespite these bright promises, however, it must be noted that in many cases the world is still in total darkness. Such is the situation in Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania.\n253.\tPortugal, which was formerly accused of obscurantism, is today carrying out a struggle on two fronts: on the one, to vanquish domestic fascism, and on the other, to liberate the territories still under its domination. To this end, it has not hesitated to crush the revolt of the minority settlers who were longing for the bygone era of colonialism; whereas the United Kingdom, under the same conditions, has sacrificed the interests of the Africans for those of a minority of colonists, for the most part, British.\n254.\tThe worst of it is that that country, acting wickedly and in very bad faith, has succeeded in hoodwinking international opinion, rocking it to sleep with lullabies about trumped-up sanctions, when in reality it has betrayed our black brothers into the hands of the minority in Zimbabwe. That country bears full responsibility for its defeatism and I hope it realizes it. Taking refuge behind these trumped-up sanctions, the United Kingdom has the cynical presumption to go so far as to act as the policeman with regard to these measures and to accuse certain brother countries, mine among them, of violating the sanctions against Rhodesia.\n255.\tAs far as my country is concerned, this accusation is based on the fact that Zaire permitted an aircraft registered in Africa and trading with Rhodesia to land on its soil. But I ask you whether my country should have allowed an aircraft in distress and, what is more, of African registration to crash. If to come to the aid of an aircraft in distress is tantamount to trading with Rhodesia, we must frankly admit that we have here some rather curious reckoning which it can only be assumed is typically British.\n256.\tAll countries represented here are aware of Zaire's determination in the struggle for African liberation and none of them can doubt our will or determination to achieve the total liberation of Africa.\n257.\tBy those defamatory allegations, the United Kingdom Government is deliberately trying to mislead international opinion. The United Kingdom, curiously disguised in the cloak of virtue, pretends to forget that it is the cause of the daily tragedy of life for the black majority, oppressed by a white minority clique. Let it rather assume its responsibilities by following the example of the new Portugal and restoring order in its rebel colony instead of spreading servile and shameless lies. Zaire, for its part, will assume all its responsibilities and will not rest until peace and justice are established in Zimbabwe. The United Kingdom must intervene effectively to restore to the majority Zimbabwe people their rights, which have been usurped by a minority of racist colonizers.\n258.\tWhatever may be the attitude of the racist minorities in southern Africa, we believe that the era of regimes of occupation, enslavement and domination has passed, because the international community is ever more aware of the absurdity of these regimes. They in turn, although they are now at bay, should still try to cure themselves of the political blindness that afflicts them and learn from the present situation.\n259.\tMy statement would be incomplete if I did not also speak of the situation of the Sahara still under Spanish domination, of Djibouti and of the Comoro Islands which France and Spain continue to keep under their yoke.\n260.\tSo far as the so-called Spanish Sahara is concerned, we are particularly gratified by the agreement reached between Morocco and Mauritania to submit the question to the judgment of the International Court of Justice. All the States Members of the United Nations should praise the wisdom of these countries and encourage them to pursue the peaceful road they have taken. In consequence, Spain must abandon the fallacious pretence of holding a referendum, because a referendum) is not synonymous with decolonization and, in any case, as far as we know, Spain did not organize a referendum when it seized that part of Africa. The decolonization of Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau was not accomplished by means of a referendum. And, incidentally, we may ask why Spain has not applied the same principle of holding a referendum in the case of Gibraltar.\n261.\tDespite the comparative relaxation of tension that can be observed in international relations and at which my country rejoices, new causes of tension are being added to the discontent, the frustration and the spirit of revolt that are the habitual source of the crises that continually threaten international peace and security. The rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union, on the one hand, and the United States and China, on the other, is an important step towards the achievement of peaceful coexistence.\n262.\tWe have noted with satisfaction the efforts of the United States to find a solution to the Middle East problem, and we hope that more substantial results will follow the first steps that have been taken towards the achievement of a just and lasting peace in that part of the world. In any case, the Palestinian people is entitled to an existence worthy of that name and to a homeland. No definitive settlement of the Middle East problem can ignore the rights of that people. If the Israelis have a homeland, then it is essential to put an immediate end to the kind of Diaspora to which the Palestinian people seem to be condemned.\n263.\tThe forthcoming reopening of the Suez Canal will strengthen economic co-operation and trade be-tween the countries of that region and of other regions. It should also create an atmosphere of confidence and make the Indian Ocean a true zone of peace.\n264.\tThe Korean problem must also be solved in a just and satisfactory manner. The Republic of Zaire recognizes both Koreas and maintains good relations with both. We consider that it is for the Koreans themselves first of all to find a peaceful solution to their problem. Consequently, my country is at once in favor of accelerating the process of unification and opposed to anything that can hamper the achievement of the will of the Korean people.\n265.\tThe Paris Agreement of January 1973 has unfortunately not settled all the problems in Viet Nam. The parties concerned in the conflict must, therefore, continue their efforts to re-establish peace once and for all by eliminating all ambiguous situations.\n266.\tWith reference to Cambodia, Zaire denounces all foreign intervention. We believe that the efforts undertaken by the Government of Prince Sihanouk will achieve the complete reunification of the country.\n267.\tAnother conflagration has unfortunately erupted, this time in Cyprus. Zaire pronounces itself in favor of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and against all foreign intervention. The Cypriot problem must be solved by the Cypriots themselves, without any foreign intervention, within the framework of existing agreements and with respect for the rights of the communities involved.\n268.\tPeace is one of the objectives sought by the Republic of Zaire in its relations with other States. Immediately after gaining its independence, my country suffered years of tragic civil war provoked by intervention on the part of foreign interests. We therefore attach great importance to the question of peace. The United Nations, whose main purpose is to maintain peace amongst nations, will find our country a steadfast ally: The people of Zaire are grateful to the United Nations for its contribution to the restoration of peace in Zaire.\n269.\tPeace throughout the world that is the objective of the United Nations. Unfortunately, however, we are compelled to recognize that since the inception of the Organization peace has not generally prevailed throughout the world; conflicts have erupted almost everywhere in the Middle East, in Viet Nam, in Cambodia and, recently, in Cyprus.\n270.\tThe Organization has often been powerless to safeguard peace. This impotence is chiefly due to the fact that States Members and those not the least among them are very often in disagreement with the fundamental principles of the Charter. Various reasons have been advanced to explain the weakness of the Organization, whose structure, established in San Francisco after the Second World War, no longer suits the needs of the time.\n271.\tThe principles which govern decision-making in the Security Council, for example, by according certain States primacy over others, seem to us to contradict the principle of the equality of States. Those same States, moreover, have the right of the veto. Experience has shown that those privileged States in the Security Council have always used their right of veto whenever their own particular selfish interests were at stake.\n272.\tThe permanent members of the Security Council have an excessive advantage and they act accordingly by safeguarding their own prerogatives while preaching, of course, in their own cause. We can understand that these States are opposed to any revision of the Charter. But are we ready to make this forum the Disunited Nations or the United Nations?\n273.\tWe feel that the veto right belongs to another period, a period of the past, and should disappear from the text of the Charter. The Organization would thereby gain in prestige, and confidence in it would be renewed, because the maintenance of peace is no longer the monopoly of a few privileged States but, rather, a task incumbent on each Member State. It was on this basis that, in 1971, our country initiated the idea of revising the Charter. On 4 October 1973, before this very Assembly, the President of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, confirmed this suggestion [ibid., para. 202].\n274.\tActing on the basis of the non-representation of the African continent at the time of the elaboration of the Charter at San Francisco in 1945, we can state that this is the time to revise the Charter. For indeed, out of 51 signatory States, only three represented Africa, whereas now, out of 138 Member States, 42 are African, almost a third of the entire membership. It seems to us that this important African presence in the Organization cannot continue to be ignored.\n275.\tLack of respect for the fundamental principles of the United Nations and the non-application of its recommendations and resolutions by certain States weaken the role of the Organization.\n276.\tIn violation of the principles of the -Charter, the United Kingdom refuses to fulfill its obligations towards the black majority in Rhodesia, while South Africa persists in the implementation of its policy of apartheid and seeks to extend that ignoble policy to Namibia. Finally, certain States become the accomplices of those others by supporting the enemies of the Organization, thus sapping its authority.\n277.\tDespite certain weaknesses. of the Organization, Zaire is very gratified over its progress in safeguarding the cultural independence of Member States. Indeed, the recovery of their cultural heritage, which had been pillaged by the former colonial Powers, has made it possible for the third-world States to give effect to resolution 3187 (XXVIII), which deals with the restitution of works of art to countries victims of expropriation.\n278.\tWe are very pleased to pay tribute to the perspicacity of the United Nations and to the wisdom of certain countries which have begun to implement this resolution. This applies notably to Belgium, which, although it did not always have extremely cordial relations with Zaire, nevertheless has given a useful example. Even before the adoption of that resolution, Belgium recognized the legitimacy of our action and promised to restore our works of art. We believe that this example should be followed by countries which have expropriated the cultural heritage of other countries.\n279.\tIn April of this year, on the initiative of the President of Algeria, the sixth special session of the Assembly was held in this very room. That session dealt solely with the problems of raw materials and development, which arc the main concern of all countries.\n280.\tThis awareness of world economic interdependence gave to the debates in this Hall an unequaled scope and depth. The special session was important both for the high level of representation at it and for the quality and tenor of the statements made. The debates presented a striking picture of the world economic situation. The majority of the countries, after having recognized the fundamental injustice of the present international economic system, formulated an extraordinary number of constructive proposals which the Ad Hoc Committee on the Special Programme, established by resolution 3202 (S-VI), must harmonize in order to transform them into policies and plans of concerted action to govern the new international economic order. That new order, based on equity, equality, independence, the common interest and co-operation among all States, will correct inequalities and remedy injustices so as to ensure, for present and future generations, harmonious economic and social development.\n281.\tAt the sixth special session, the Assembly prepared directives in the form of a general Declaration of principles and a Programme of Action. By laying down a line of action to be followed, the Assembly made an enduring contribution, because, from now on, economic relations will be viewed in an entirely new light.\n282.\tThe Programme of Action has provisions relating to the difficulties encountered in the field of raw materials and the field of commerce, development and financing, as well as in the monetary system, the transfer of technology, industrialization, and the permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources.\n283.\tRegardless of the results achieved, we can state that the session provided an opportunity to all States Members of the United Nations to realize the inter-dependence and complementarity of their respective economies, and demonstrated that each Member State has a voice in and a contribution to make to the development of the world economy.\n284.\tThere is a tendency to attribute the present economic difficulties solely to the energy crisis, whereas that crisis is the result of Inflation which has been manifest for some years now. Naturally, the oil problem has aggravated the situation, particularly as regards the poor countries, but we must not forget that inflation preceded the oil crisis. Furthermore, owing to the fact that it has affected all the countries of the world, this crisis which then seemed to be a necessary evil is, in the last analysis, a good thing. Because it affected exclusively the under-equipped countries, the rich countries were pleased and they chanted the hymn of prosperity and invoked the laws of the market and other magic principles. However, it now appears that everybody is concerned, and we can only hope that more lasting solutions can be found, not based on intimidation or sorcery but within a large framework, with the good faith of everyone.\n285 As to the oil-exporting countries, in view of the decisive role that oil plays in the world economy, these countries must bear their share of the responsibility in achieving a satisfactory settlement of the present crisis. We would therefore suggest that, at this session, the General Assembly give serious attention to this question and decide on the practical modalities for the application of the two important resolutions the Declaration and the Program of Action adopted at the sixth special session.\n286.\tThe Republic of Zaire, under the leadership of President Mobutu Sese Seko, did not await recognition of the right of all countries to their own resources, because for some years now our people has been master of its own soil apd subsoil. On 30 November 1973, nationalization measures were taken in order to complete our economic action programme so as to ensure for our r^ople full enjoyment of its sovereignty over its natural resources and effective and complete control of its entire national production. Thus, after achieving political independence, Zaire has attained full economic independence.\n287.\tAs we can see, economy problems are of concern to most States, particul&ciy the under-equipped countries. What we are demanding is greater justice in the field of economic co-operation with the developed countries, for any assistance given to the under-developed countries should contribute to their de-velopment and should not return in one form or another to the donor countries.\n288.\tThis well-known assistance for development is mostly a myth that is used to assuage the conscience of the rich countries. Not only is this assistance much too small to safeguard the standard of living of the recipient countries, but the instability of prices of raw materials and the scarcity of investments, together with the effects of inflation and the ever-rising prices for finished products, has kept the underdeveloped countries in a precarious situation, forever receiving assistance and up to their ears in debt. In these conditions, escape from underdevelopment is hopeless, and the haunting specter of colonization or recolonization retrains.\n289.\tZaire fully supported the proposal of the President of Mexico on the adoption of a Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. Such a document would be a very important and historic contribution. In order to obtain the support of all concerned, the economic rights and duties of States must take into account the principles of equity and international economic justice.\n290.\tThe world community must call on science and technology in the service of all. The transfer of technology constitutes, for the underdeveloped countries, the point of departure for real and harmonious development.\n291.\tThe sea-bed and ocean floor contain vast riches and resources which could be put at the service of all mankind. The sea increasingly appears to be a source of food, energy and minerals which could make up for the exhaustion of the earth's resources. According to data issued by the United Nations, 15 per cent of oil resources is already being obtained from offshore exploitation, and that figure will reach 33 per cent in 1980. Sixty-five million tons of fish were harvested from the high seas in 1972. Furthermore, it has been estimated that certain mineral resources of the seabed are far more plentiful than those of the earth.\n292.\tAll that wealth must be shared, and to that end maritime frontiers. must be defined. That has been done only imperfectly in the four conventions signed in Geneva in 1958, conventions which are today largely discredited. More than half of the countries of the world have refused to ratify them, considering them too much a reflection of the interests of the main maritime Powers.\n293.\tThat is why the controversy on the law of the sea has finally been seen as an essential element of the problems upon which depend the fate of humanity, and of the struggle against underdevelopment and against the hegemony of certain Powers which would like to see the sovereignty and jurisdiction of States strictly limited, so that they can freely exploit the natural resources of seas other than their own.\n294.\tThe Third United Nations Conference oh the Law of the Sea, which met in Caracas from 20 June to 29 August 1974, strikingly confirmed the antagonism existing between the developed and the poor countries, since no text was adopted by that Conference. However, Caracas provided an opportunity for the third world to make its voice heard and to clarify its position.\n295.\tThe exploitation of the mineral resources of the sea and the sea-bed must be carried out in an organized, rational manner, from the point of view of well-applied international justice and with the object of preserving and conserving those resources for future generations. It should not serve to provide advantages for some to the detriment of others, particularly by prejudicing the interests of the underdeveloped countries whose prosperity depends essentially on the exploitation and exportation of raw materials. In order to avoid wasteful exploitation of those resources, control measures must be adopted, with the firm application of the principle of complementarity between the resources of the earth and those extracted from the st\n296.\tWe hope that the Conference at its third session, which is to be held in Geneva from 17 March to 10 May 1975, will find equitable solutions so that the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction may indeed constitute the common heritage of mankind, as was stated in the Declaration of Principles on this matter unanimously adopted by the General Assembly [resolution 2749 (XXV)].\n297.\tThe new conventions on the law of the sea should not enshrine as a principle the right of the strongest nation or of the nation which can best exploit the resources. All countries, whatever their size or degree of development, are equally entitled to exploit the resources of the sea.\n298.\tA few weeks ago, the World Population Conference concluded its work in Bucharest. Several tendencies were revealed during the debates, particularly concerning the delicate problem of the birth rate. It is the view of my country that priority should be given to economic development and to the fairest redistribution of wealth rather than to the reduction of the birth rate.\n299.\tAlthough we recognize the relevance of a realistic and responsible policy on population, Zaire cannot support the Malthusian theses which make the limitation of the birth rate a goal and an end in itself. That seems to us a policy of expediency designed to divert attention from the real problem, that of the inequality and injustice of the present international situation. The problem of poverty cannot be solved by killing off the poor.\n300.\tIn our view, the population density per square kilometer is one of the determining elements in deciding on any limitation of births. Countries with a population density of 200-300 per square kilometer are faced with the problem of birth control, while those with a population density of less than 50 per square kilometer have no need to concern themselves with it.\n301.\tPropaganda would have us believe that there is a \\\"yellow peril\\\", whereas the true peril is the \\\"white peril\\\". The demographic statistics of China, for example, show that that country has not yet reached the critical threshold of over-population. In absolute numbers, with a population in China of 800 million, in a country of 9.8 million square kilometers, the population density is only 80 per square kilometer, whereas certain Western European countries have a population density twice, or even three or four, times as high.\n302.\tIn the final analysis, economic development and the raising of the standard of living are the primary objectives, while control of the birth rate is a matter of principle whose application must be left to each country in the light of its own capacity to feed its population and of its economic perspectives.\n303.\tThe present international situation, characterized as it is by coexistence and harmony between the great Powers, as well as by the appearance of many centers of power in the world, is not simply the result of rapprochement between the super-Powers but rather is the result of a long historic struggle of forces, and of new social values that have appeared in the contemporary world. Those new social forces have put the established order in question and imposed as a necessity world coexistence and ideological pluralism.\n304.\tThe center of gravity of international relations and conflicts, because of the joint struggle of the oppressed peoples to overcome their poverty, has shifted to the third world, which now carries real weight on the international scene, enabling the countries of the third world to play a new role in contemporary history.\n305.\tThe new historic stage in which we find our-selves calls for a new approach on the part of the industrialized countries, which must realize that relations between developed and underdeveloped countries can no longer be what they were in the past, with the dependence of the latter upon the former. They must rather be those of interdependence and a rich and dynamic complementarity.\n306.\tOnce again, the Republic of Zaire wishes to express its confidence in the United Nations, which seems to us, in spite of everything, to be the most appropriate organization for dealing with problems relating to international peace, security and co-operation, and the most appropriate framework for finding just and equitable solutions to the various disputes which arise between States.\n307.\tI should like to conclude by expressing the most sincere congratulations to the President of the twenty-eighth session and of the sixth special session of the General Assembly, Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador. The successful outcome of those two sessions was, in our view, the result of his ability and his great sense of duty.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I in the first place express to you my warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We feel confident that under your wise guidance the deliberations of this Assembly will bring a constructive contribution to the solution of the various international problems. In your person we also greet your country, with which Cyprus maintains close links of friendship based on common ideals and purposes within non-alignment. I would likewise wish to express our deep appreciation to your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, for the excellent way in which he guided the deliberations of the previous session.\n3.\tI have had the privilege of addressing the General Assembly on previous occasions, but never before in circumstances such as now prevail, never before in an international situation so ominously removed from the fundamental principles upon which this Organization is based. And what is particularly odd is that we are now supposed to be in a period of detente.\n4.\tThe world has over the years been eagerly looking forward to a period of detente. The expectation has been that reducing antagonism and tension would lead to a more effective implementation of Security Council resolutions in the vital interest of international peace and security rather than in the opposite direction, as the world has silently but sadly witnessed in recent days. By saying this I do not in the least purport to make any criticism whatsoever. I am merely placing on record a melancholy reality that should not, and cannot, be glossed over in the United Nations or ignored by the international community without dire consequences for the further course of world developments at times so critical as the present. For we are in a period of delicate balance between the prevalence of the concept of the use of force and domination an outdated relic of the past and that of reason and peace so necessary for survival in our interdependent world of a nuclear age.\n5.\tThis is a trying period of transition. International events of major significance in their implications and message to the world should be carefully scrutinized by this Assembly. The United Nations is essentially a political institution, but there are times in history when human institutions, in confronting critical problems, have to give prominence to decisions of ethical quality. That ethical quality is but the gist of the principles of the Charter. Ignoring them through the pursuit of short-term parochial interests, in a return to outdated policies of obscurantism, would be an unrealistic pursuit of interest. It can ultimately only lead humanity through a downward course of moral degradation to its physical doom.\n6.\tUpon Cyprus has fallen the sad lot to be a signal and a symbol in the course of mankind. Its treatment by the international community at the present cross-roads in history would be a decisive landmark in that course, whether upwards or downwards. Beyond the tragic fate of Cyprus, what is of wider significance and import is its intrinsic meaning to the world and the inevitable repercussions resulting from it. Thus the problem of Cyprus far transcends the limits and confines of Cyprus. It poses a major international problem and a challenge to the world.\n7.\tAn effort to cover up the international crime involving outworn political tactics of pressure to achieve unjust and ignominious compromises is far below the level of the present challenge, and will not serve any good purpose for Cyprus and its people as a whole; least of all will it serve the interest of peace.\n8.\tIt is customary, in addressing the General Assembly, to deal with the various international problems and issues. I hope I shall be excused if I deviate from this practice and confine myself to the problem of Cyprus, which has suddenly reached dimensions so ominous as to make it a grave and threatening problem in the area and beyond.\n9.\tMy country, a small non-aligned State Member of the United Nations, is at this moment mutilated and practically destroyed by an armed attack and invasion by Turkey, unprecedented in its ferocity and inhumanity.\n10.\tIt was about two months ago that I came to the Security Council to denounce the coup, engineered \nand staged against the legitimate Government of Cyprus by the military junta then ruling Greece. Officers from Greece serving with the Cyprus National Guard, acting on instructions from the military junta in Athens, on 15 July attacked and destroyed the Presidential Palace with heavy weapons, seeking my death. There is no doubt that I was the target of that criminal action. The coup d'etat by the Greek junta failed, inasmuch as it did not reach its target. I am gratified because that military regime, which for seven years oppressed the people of Greece and brought that State to international isolation and disrespect, is no longer in power. Thus Greece is again finding its way to democracy and national dignity.\n11.\tThe coup d'etat of the Greek junta was the prelude to the present tragedy in Cyprus. That evil was followed by another evil, and a much worse one. Turkey, using the coup as a pretext, and purportedly acting under the Treaty of Guarantee of 1960, intervened militarily in Cyprus in contravention of the Treaty itself by invading the island on 20 July. The Treaty did not and could not give such rights of military intervention as alleged by Turkey. Furthermore, the very nature and conduct of this military operation in Cyprus has been in direct violation of the declared purposes of the Treaty. For, instead of protecting the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus, as a guarantor Power, Turkey has been destroying both. It has embarked upon destroying what it itself guaranteed. Turkey alleged that the action it was taking was for the purpose of restoring the constitutional order that had been disturbed by the coup. I am under the impression that some countries did not raise their voice against the Turkish invasion at first because they were deceived by Turkey as to its real intentions. Turkey falsely stated that the action it was taking was of a limited nature. It spoke of a policing and even of a peace operation aiming solely at the restoration of the constitutional order. But what Turkey was in fact doing and continues to do in Cyprus has nothing to do with the restoration of constitutional order.\n12.\tAs a result of the Turkish invasion, Cyprus, a flourishing and happy island, has been turned into a place of ruins, tears and death. The Turkish invasion forces have occupied almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus and have uprooted from their homes over 200,000 people, constituting one third of the population of the country, who, having been forced to abandon their lands, have become refugees living in appalling conditions. The world has witnessed the ruthless showering of napalm bombs on undefended towns and villages, which has indiscriminately killed the civilian population in a fury of destruction. Even hospitals, churches and priceless ancient monuments were attacked and turned into ashes. Murder in cold blood, raping, looting and plunder were the daily practice during the advance of the Turkish troops. To find parallel examples of invasion with similar acts of brutality and destruction one has to go back to the fifth century A.D., to the time of Attila, whose name has been aptly given to this invading operation by the aggressor itself. Festivities and demonstrations were organized in Turkey to mark and celebrate the victory of the Turkish forces against Cyprus and decorations and medals have been distributed to the chiefs of the air force and the navy for their victory against a small and defenseless island. Victory it is indeed but a victory against the international legal order, against the United Nations and its Charter and against every norm of decency in a civilized society.\n13.\tTurkey has violated every accepted norm of international law and every accepted standard of international conduct. Its contemptuous behavior and complete disregard of the basic principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations is perhaps unprecedented.\n14.\tThe Security Council, by its resolution 353 (1974) of 20 July provided the framework for a peaceful solution to the problem and called upon the parties concerned to enter into negotiations. This resolution was also accepted by Turkey, which has, however, shown no respect for it. At the Geneva Conference attended by the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey, as the guarantor Powers, and by the representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, the Security Council resolution was completely ignored by Turkey. In Geneva, Turkey was not in fact negotiating but clearly trying to impose its terms at gun-point. With its troops in occupation of a great part of Cypriot territory, and relying on its overwhelming military superiority, Turkey was exercising blackmail to dictate its terms; and when a recess of 36 hours was proposed for consultations, it was refused by Turkey, which hastened within a few hours to embark upon the already prepared second and intensified phase of aggression against Cyprus, vastly increasing the occupied area. Turkey was thus violating even the cease-fire agreement it had signed on 30 July at Geneva.\n15.\tIt is very difficult to describe even in general terms the tragedy and the destruction caused by the Turkish aggression against Cyprus. The number of victims of that aggression was in proportionate terms greater than that of the victims of the many years of war in Viet Nam.\n16.\tI cannot foresee where the drama of Cyprus may lead, if the international community finally fails to put an end to this aggression and if the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus are not effectively ensured. In no circumstances should the acquisition of territories by force be tolerated, nor can it confer upon the invader any vantage point, in negotiations or otherwise. Neither can fails accomplish resulting from military operations be accepted or condoned. If they were to be accepted or tolerated in the case of Cyprus, a most dangerous precedent would be set for other small countries, whose independence would be at the mercy of their more powerful neighbors. \n17.\tI have come here to seek the support of the international community in our struggle to save the independence, unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus. I am here for the cause of justice and the freedom of a small country, a Member of the United Nations. I bring to this Assembly the agony of the people of Cyprus for the survival of their country in freedom and dignity. We fully recognize the importance of greater understanding between the big Powers as improving the prospects of solution of world problems in accordance with the Charter, yet we feel we have to be skeptical regarding the fate of small countries within the sphere of power politics. We need to be convinced that detente does not imply compromising the interests and even the existence of smaller countries.\n18.\tI shall not attempt to give interpretations of the underlying causes which led to the recent events in Cyprus. But what I have to emphasize is that, what-ever the cause and whatever the reason, there can be no justification for the Turkish aggression. The question before us is simple: Should the fate and the very existence of small countries be decided by gunboat diplomacy, by the use of force, by destruction, by uprooting people from their ancestral homes, without the United Nations being in a position to act? That is the problem of Cyprus today, and it is only natural for the people who suffer to wonder why we have placed our hopes in the United Nations and in the rules of international law and the precepts of international morality which the United Nations represents.\n19.\tMy position as to the solution of the problem of Cyprus is that such a solution must be based on the application of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations. In that connexion, I wish to stress that any negotiations on the problem will have to take place in a wider international conference than that of Geneva. We consider the proposal for an international conference within the framework of the United Nations as constructive and therefore acceptable to us. Certain prerequisites are, however, essential and will have to be fulfilled before negotiations are started. It is not possible to have free negotiations for a reasonable solution of the problem while Cypriot territory continues to be under foreign military occupation and while a third of the population are still refugees who have been forcibly expelled from their homes and lands. The return of the refugees is, from a humanitarian no less than a political point of view, a basic prerequisite.\n20.\tTurkey has repeatedly declared that it is not its intention to abolish the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus; but while expressing that in words, it is by its acts doing just that, unless Turkey's interpretation of terms and concepts is different from that generally accepted. Turkey invaded Cyprus allegedly to restore constitutional order, that is, for the implementation of the Constitution of 1960. It is that Constitution which Turkey has guaranteed, together with Greece and the United Kingdom. Although the Constitution gives many privileges to the Turkish Cypriot community in such a way that some of its provisions impede the smooth functioning of the State yet it is still accepted by us as it stands. Any changes must be made with the consent of all concerned. What is peculiar is that Turkey is violating the very Constitution which, as it claims, has given it the right to intervene. It is obvious that the Turkish invasion was not intended to restore the constitutional order, as established by the Constitution of 3960, but to enforce Turkey's partitionist plans in violation of that Constitution.\n21.\tAt the Geneva Conference, Turkey made it clear that its aim was a federation based on geographical separation. It has tried for that purpose to create, through its devastating military operation, the geographical prerequisites for such a federation, which never existed in Cyprus. To that end, it has uprooted from the occupied area the Greek Cypriot population so that it may transfer and establish there Turkish populations, removing them from their homes in various parts of the island. Such a federation is not only artificial but also inhuman. It entails the transfer of about half of the population of Cyprus. About 200,000 Greek Cypriots and nearly 70,000 Turkish Cypriots will be removed from their homes and land. I am sure that not only the Greek Cypriots but also the great majority of the Turkish Cypriots would not be happy to abandon their homes and be transferred to other areas. What purpose is to be served by such an inhuman exercise to achieve the autonomy and security of the Turkish Cypriot community, as claimed by Turkey? These protestations and claims are nothing but pretexts for the expansionist designs of Turkey, closely reminiscent of the protestations and claims made by Hitler in order to invade Czechoslovakia. They also remind us of the methods employed by Turkey to annex Alexandretta. The autonomy and security of the small Turkish Cypriot minority of 18 per cent can in no way justify a geographical federation which ;n practice will mean the partition of Cyprus.\n22.\tTurkey has declared that its purpose is not partition and that its military intervention was not to that end. Yet that partitionist aim of long standing has been repeatedly revealed over the years. On a previous occasion when Turkey was about to invade Cyprus, President Johnson, in a letter to Prime Minister Inonu of 5 June 1964, stated:\n\\\"... I must call your attention, however, to our understanding that the proposed intervention by Turkey would be for the purpose of effecting a form of partition of the island, a solution which is specifically excluded by the Treaty of Guarantee.\\\"\n23.\tThe attitude of Turkey on this subject can also be seen from the statement made to the Turkish National Assembly on 8 September of the same year by Prime Minister Inonu, who said, \\\"Officially, we promoted the federation concept, rather than the partition thesis, so as to remain within the provisions of the Treaty.\\\"\n24.\tThose quotations further confirm the tactical nature of the use of the word federation as an official camouflage of the intended partition.\n25.\tThere can hardly be any doubt that the geographical federation is intended and will inevitably lead to the partition of the island and consequently to double annexation that is, ore part to Turkey and the other to Greece. That will be the end of Cyprus as an independent State. Such a development may perhaps be favored by certain Powers in their own interests. Cyprus, because of the importance of its strategic position, has unfortunately frequently been the victim of foreign interests. \n26.\tNo argument can justify the demand of Turkey for geographical federation, which would not only be inhuman but would also mean changing the identity of Cyprus. But what should be the answer if Turkey were to insist on geographical federation and by its military superiority were to impose it by force? Some who appear to be realists may advise that we should negotiate on the basis of geographical federation, indicating that in such a case, Turkey may show some flexibility as to the size of the area to be under Turkish control. There is some talk that the occupied area of 40 per cent might be reduced to something below 30 per cent. I do not think 1 should express any gratitude for such generosity by Turkey. Under no circumstances shall we negotiate so as to legalize the violation of the most basic principles of international law and human rights. Under no circumstances shall we agree to legalize any faits accomplis. Some may argue that if we do not accept geographical federation there is a danger that Turkey might attempt to occupy the rest of the island. It is, indeed, very easy for Turkey to conquer Cyprus. That danger will not, however, make us agree to legalize faits accomplis. What is unjust and immoral, such as the uprooting of populations, cannot be legalized. What is unjust and immoral cannot become just and moral by signing an agreement.\n27.\tThe problem of Cyprus may perhaps appear complicated but is in fact very simple. It is the case of a small country, a Member of the United Nations, whose very survival and existence are at stake. This in turn makes it a test case for the United Nations. It is not only we who are anxious to see what the Organization can do and how it can become effective in protecting one of its small Members. I am certain that many other countries will also be anxiously awaiting the answer. It is inconceivable that the United Nations, which represents the conscience of humanity, should tolerate an aggressor applying the rule of the jungle and by brute force creating faits accomplis. If the faits accomplis resulting from the Turkish aggression are to be accepted or condoned, the consequences will not be limited to Cyprus. The future of Cyprus is closely linked with future developments in the sensitive area of the Middle East and the whole of the Mediterranean. If Cyprus were not a non-aligned country, we perhaps might have allies to come to our defense. But the fact that we do not should not render us a victim of a Power, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO], which has illegally used the arms supplied to it for its defense to attack Cyprus.\n28.\tThe case of Cyprus is a test case for non-alignment, and beyond that a test case for the United Nations. If the United Nations fails to make Turkey respect the Charter and its resolutions, the faith of the small countries in the United Nations will seriously be shaken. It is imperative that the Turkish troops and, indeed, all foreign troops, be withdrawn from Cyprus. This is the time for the United Nations to act. It is absolutely necessary not only for Cyprus but also for the United Nations and for mankind as a whole for the Organization to step in decisively and effectively, so that the territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus as a sovereign and independent State, Member of the United Nations, may be ensured and safeguarded.\n29.\tBefore concluding, I wish to avail myself of this occasion to express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our gratitude for his abiding concern over the problem of Cyprus, his untiring efforts to bring about conditions of peace in the island, and his contribution towards a just solution within the principles of the Charter. I would also like to express our deep appreciation to his Special Representative in Cyprus, Mr. Weckmann-Munoz, as well his predecessor, Mr. Osorio-Tafall, for their constructive and patient work in the island. Our thanks are also extended to the collaborators and assistants of the Secretary-General, Mr. Guyer and Mr. Urquhart.\n30.\tI would be remiss if I did not say how greatly we value and appreciate the exemplary manner in which the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus [UNFICYP] is discharging its responsibilities in the face of the great obstacles placed in its way and we pay tribute to its most able commander, General Chand, and to the officers and men under his command. At this moment, our thoughts go in deep sympathy and grief to those men of UNFICYP who, in the service of peace, lost their lives in Cyprus. And of course our appreciatijbn and warm thanks go to those countries whose Valuable contribution in military contingents and voluntary funds have made it possible for UNFICYP to operate in Cyprus.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, at the outset I should like to associate myself with the speakers who have preceded me at this rostrum and tell you how pleased the delegation of the Congo is to see you guiding the work of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. In so doing, I am certainly following a tradition, but I am above all carrying out a very pleasant duty in expressing the deep joy felt by the people of the Congo on hearing the news of your unanimous election. The trust placed in you thus marks a new milestone in the career of a talented statesman and an experienced and wise diplomat, whom Africa is privileged to count among its sons a militant, a fighter for freedom with unshakable faith and determination forged in the Algerian resistance.\n30.\tYour election is also above all a tribute to the heroic Algerian people who, under the wise and enlightened leadership of President Houari Boumediene, are striving for the liberation of the third world and the assertion of its character. The resounding success of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries, held at Algiers 13 months ago, and the historic sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly on raw materials and development, convened on the initiative of President Boumediene, are further proof of the ever-stronger attachment of your beautiful country to the cause of the third world.\n31.\tBut for the Congo your country has done much more, Mr. President: here I must try your modesty, known to all of us, and say that for more than a decade the Algerian people and the people of the Congo have extended their hands to one another in the grip of brothers and fellow fighters that has grown firmer as the years went by.\n32.\tThe heroic struggle of the Algerian people to regain their sovereignty serves as a symbol and an example to all oppressed peoples. The firm support which your country affords to all just causes, particularly the struggle for liberation of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America, has made Algiers the universal capital of freedom and human dignity.\n33.\tThe current session is being held at a particularly important moment in our history, a moment when areas of light and shade are strangely intermingled, and nascent hopes die, and then reemerge, so that mankind can never have a full sense of reassurance. I cite as an example the case of Viet Nam. It had been hoped that the lesson which the valiant Vietnamese people taught the army of aggression of the United States of America would have stripped away the last shred of illusion from all those who had not yet understood that all the peoples of the world, whoever they may be, have the right to choose their own path, that which best reflects their own ethos, and that they believe most likely to ensure the achievement of their deepest hopes and their happiness. We must note, unfortunately, that United States imperialism continues, and constantly violates the Paris agreements, agreements that gave rise to so many hopes which have now vanished, one after another, plunging both Viet Nam and the world back into increasing insecurity.\n34.\tThe Organization must act, and act promptly, to ensure that the Paris agreement is applied scrupulously and in full, because that is the only way in which lasting peace can be established in that part of the world, which has suffered so much from atrocities and wars of aggression.\n35.\tNot far from Viet Nam, in neighboring Cambodia, the Khmer people also are being subjected to an unjust war, which they are repulsing with courage and determination, daily winning important victories over the aggressor which are recognized by the entire world. Today the National United Front of Kampuchea controls virtually nine tenths of the country. What is the Organization waiting for, before assuming the historic responsibility incumbent upon it by expelling from the international community the traitors to the Khmer nation, and restoring the rights of the only legitimate Government of Cambodia, that of Prince Norodom Sihanouk?\n36.\tIt is also urgent to put an end to the imperialist aggression in Korea. While we welcome the decision reached during the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to dissolve the famous United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, the consensus reached in the General Assembly on 28 November 19732 serves the Seoul regime as yet another pretext to nullify the praiseworthy efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful and independent reunification of their torn country. But that vigilant people, overwhelmed by a series of acts of treason by the Government of Seoul, and despite an extremely ferocious machinery of repression, is increasingly insistent that all foreign troops be ejected, as an obstacle to peaceful reunification, free of all foreign interference, of the two parts of that beautiful country. The Organization can no longer be shackled by a consensus which serves as a pretext to prevent the realization of the deep hopes of the Korean people.\n37.\tNearer to here, in the Middle East, the same aggressors are attempting to subjugate peoples whose fighting tradition goes back for thousands of years. Everything has already been said about the Middle East, and the vain pretensions of the Zionist State have been revealed in this forum by outstanding speakers from all corners of the world. I, for my part, would merely invite the international community to be increasingly wary of allowing Israel and those who support it from distorting the nature of this problem by presenting it as a conflict between the Arabs and the Jews, whereas the substance of the question was, and still is, the right of the uprooted and despoiled people of Palestine to return to their country. We are pleased that an item permitting us to consider the tragedy of the martyred Palestinian people has been included in. our agenda.\n38.\tIn the eastern Mediterranean the same international firebrands have sown war, mourning and misery in the island of Cyprus. We cannot remain indifferent to the crisis which has afflicted that country, a member of the movement of non-aligned countries. The Government of the People's Republic of the Congo believes that the United Nations has the duty of guaranteeing the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.\n39.\tIn Africa the struggle for liberation is spreading and has achieved decisive victories. The heroic struggle of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea- Bissau, which is a part of the war being waged by all oppressed peoples of the world, has made a decisive contribution as Comrade Marien N'Gouabi, President of the People's Republic of the Congo said, a little more than a month ago at the Summit Conference of the Central and Eastern African States at Brazzaville to liberating the Portuguese people from the Fascist yoke under which they had lived for more than half a century. This solidarity means that the new leaders in Lisbon will better understand the aspirations of the peoples of Africa who demand the unconditional and immediate independence of Angola and other territories under Portuguese domination.\n40.\tAmilcar Cabral, one of the most valiant and incorruptible sons of Africa, wrote with his own blood one of the most beautiful pages of its history . A point of no return has been reached in the process of liberating Territories which remain under the colonial yoke. We must pay our respects to the memory of\nAmilcar Cabral and give thanks for the lessons he has taught us all. And particularly, we must pay our respects to his country which we are pleased and proud to welcome to the Organization. May the representatives of Guinea-Bissau accept the congratulations of the people of the Congo which, on behalf of President Marien N'Gouabi, I have the pleasant duty of extending to them from this rostrum.\n41.\tI should also like, on behalf of my delegation, to congratulate the representatives of Grenada and Bangladesh upon their admission as Members of the United Nations.\n42.\tTo return to Africa, Mozambique, which has just banished from memory an irrevocably condemned past, is merely a few months away from attaining inter-national sovereignty. The United Nations must ensure that the Lusaka agreements are properly implemented. Africa itself must do everything to thwart the maneuvers of the outdated colonists who are attempting to place in jeopardy the victories achieved in the struggle for liberation in Mozambique and Angola, where they are creating and encouraging divisions within liberation movements. This is a well-known method designed to delay independence in Angola, and to plunge the country into a civil war which would serve as a pretext for the neo-colonialists who do not wish to renounce their dream of conquest in Africa. All of this neo-colonialist agitation occurs against the background of the well-known wealth found in Angola. This is wealth which imperialism contemptuously wishes to continue to exploit to the detriment of the interests of the Angolan people.\n43.\tThe march of the Portuguese colonies towards independence must not make us lose sight of Namibia, Azania, the Comoro Islands, Djibouti, and all other territories under colonial domination aspiring to independence and sovereignty.\n44.\tWe think that the United Kingdom should accept its role and assume its responsibilities in Zimbabwe. Also, the NATO Powers, which are supporting the racist regime of South Africa now extending its policy of apartheid in Namibia, must make the white colonists understand that it is in their own interests to return forthwith to the path of reason. The Africans can take pride in the fact that they have thwarted the most recent maneuvers of the Government of Pretoria which attempted to include puppets in a delegation which itself only represents a condemned policy. The General Assembly, by rejecting the credentials of this delegation [resolution 3206 (XXIX)), once again demonstrated its indignation at the criminal policy of apartheid. My delegation is pleased that a decision has been taken to stop the talks between the Secretary-General and the Government of Pretoria on Namibia, talks which the racists in South Africa were exploiting for propaganda purposes.\n45.\tFinally, while on the subject of colonization, I should like to indicate another absurd subtlety in this criminal enterprise which would wish to have us accept the principle of the referendum. I don't know, and I should like to know, whether within this Hall there is a representative of a former colony who could tell me that the inhabitants of his country have been consulted by a referendum and, by so doing, had accepted foreign occupation. History teaches us that treaties prepared by colonizers were imposed upon our peoples through traditional chiefs to whom the terms of the treaties were not even explained.\n46.\tSimple logic and rules which have always governed societies would have required that permission be asked to come to a country, and not to leave it. Moreover, this is the method which has been imposed upon us by investors in our economic relations with them when they demand adequate guarantees that they will be allowed to repatriate their capital. Here we are touching upon one of the problems which will predominate during this session.\n47.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General said that he had witnessed some signs \\\"of a new determination to face up to the enormous challenges of a global society\\\" [A/96011Add.I, sect. XIII].\n48.\tNeed I stress the fact that my delegation heard with great interest this report. Its conviction, objectivity and thoughtfulness are a very important factor in our work. Unfortunately, as regards economic problems which the Organization must confront, some statements made from this rostrum dispel this optimistic vision. As we are going through irreversible changes it is rather disappointing to see that some great Powers still hope to practice the policy of the big stick and of invective. The development of proletarian nations is the greatest problem confronting our generation.\n49.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly, convened, as I said earlier, upon the initiative of the great leader of Algeria, President Boumediene, made it possible as regards raw materials and development to discern a new policy and to commit the international community to changing the asymmetrical features of international economic relations today. It is true that we cannot expect everything to change immediately, but these rearguard actions cannot make any less valid the lessons learned by the international community from the sixth special session, during which the third world, seeing its very survival threatened, was able to become fully aware of the fact that the fundamental reasons for its backwardness were not something it was predestined to put up with, but, rather, that its underdevelopment was organized and maintained by international imperialism which uses the poverty of the third world as a method of increasing its progress and wealth. This special session was an opportunity for the third world countries to reject the logic of the system of the division of labor which forced poor nations to supply raw materials at low prices, while the prices for capital goods were maintained at high levels.\n50.\tMany international forums have heard and condemned the disproportionate profits achieved by exploiting the peripheral regions. It is no longer possible merely to take note of the fact that one third of the population of the world holds seven eighths of the world's income, whereas third world countries, re-presenting two thirds of mankind, must be satisfied with one eighth of that income. Despite the tragedy of this situation, the third world did not wish to choose confrontation as a means of dealing with the dramatic consequences of this system. We ourselves are convinced that dialog on a strictly equal footing is the most appropriate democratic means by which to uproot the ancient system and replace it by a new order that could give a vigorous impetus to fruitful cooperation among all peoples.\n51.\tOne of the primary tasks during the Second United Nations Development Decade it to open the eyes of the wasteful consumer societies of the West to the meaning of the phenomenon of underdevelopment. For, in fact, the basic causes of this scourge are to be found in the industrialized societies that are contributing to the economic backwardness of the developing countries. Today, through the joint efforts of all Members of our Organization, the international community possesses two documents of historic importance: the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and3202 (S-VI)], which indicate specific guidelines for new international economic relations and invite the Organization, in a spirit of much-needed solidarity, to contribute to the Special Fund established by the Program of Action, for the least favored Members. Thus we are at a crossroads. Are our efforts to bog down in sterile confrontation, or shall we rather, all of us, by demonstrating courage and daring, cross the bridge and take the path that leads to progress for all with fraternal cooperation among all peoples?\n52.\tToday, there are certain principles that no one can uproot and that are the normal corollary of the independence and sovereignty of States: first, the permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources, with, as a consequence, control by them of the mechanisms that enable the countries producing raw materials to establish the prices of their produce, and also the right of each country, if necessary,, to resort to nationalization and, secondly, the legitimacy of the struggle that the developing countries are compelled to wage against multinational companies, whose often disastrously harmful activities are well known to all.\n53.\tMy country has already had an opportunity to indicate its solidarity with raw-material producing countries. Their struggle is the struggle of all of us. The seizure by the oil-exporting countries of the controls of the pricing mechanisms for their raw materials opens great vistas of hope for other third-world producers of raw materials. Our working masses are always ready to produce, but we cannot produce at any price. We must sell our raw materials at prices which make it possible to raise the standard of living of our workers and to meet the needs of our countries. That is why we can no longer let ourselves be abused by the campaign of hatred that has led the wealthy countries to establish \\\"holy alliances\\\" dedicated to exorcising the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries [OPEC] and to dividing the ranks of the third world.\n54.\tLeaving aside such activities as doomed to failure, let us set our sights towards the quest for effective remedies to the grave crisis gripping the world, first by abandoning our selfish, wasteful ways and then by inaugurating an era of justice and peace in international relations for, as several speakers have emphasized, the inflation that is eating away at the world like a cancer is a phenomenon generated by the industrialized countries, the brunt of which has been borne by the third world, countries in their capacity both of seller* of raw under-priced materials and of buyers of the manufactured products of the wealthy countries. The energy crisis is an easy alibi all too frequently used by some developed countries as an excuse for raising the export prices of their merchandise. The spiraling inflation that is putting the world in a panic must therefore be more seriously and more objectively studied.\n55.\tIn view of its constant concern with the search for justice and peace in international relations, my country viewed with pleasure the convening of the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the Second Session of which took place recently at Caracas. The international community has thereby shown its recognition of the absolute necessity of making a fundamental change in international maritime law. Despite the attitudes of bygone times, we wish to express our hope of seeing these negotiations lead to a convention that will promote international cooperation on a basis of equal rights for States, of justice and of peace in this important field. For the time being, what is important is that discussions have begun on new terms that are full of promise for all the peoples of the earth.\n56.\tThe People's Republic of the Congo has participated and will continue to participate in the work of that important Conference, on the basis of proposals made jointly by the member States of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]. Here, once again, it is up to the wealthy countries to renounce those privileges that help to accentuate the structural dependence of under-developed countries on the industrialized countries. That is the only way our work can be successful. For the attainment of that aim we need more than the material and financial means which are, of course, necessary for the Organization to function well we need to infuse greater authority into that Organization. That can be done only if we are courageous and impartial enough to make a resolute attempt to modify its structure one which certainly responded to the needs of one era but does not correspond with those of today.\n57.\tAn undertaking of this nature is indispensable if we wish to speak seriously of disarmament, if we wish such destructive calamities as drought no longer to be used by some countries for propaganda purposes, and if we wish to put an end to the interference of great Powers in the political lives of small States, so that countries such as Cyprus can reach their own national concord according to the wishes of their inhabitants, so that peoples such as the heroic people of Chile, with whom we stand in full solidarity, may no longer be massacred for merely wishing to live for and by themselves.\n58.\tI am thus reaching the conclusion of my statement. I know I have only repeated topics that so many outstanding speakers have enlarged on here, some with rarely equaled eloquence. But in so doing it has been my wish, with deep humility, and on behalf of President Marien N'Gouabi, to make this modest contribution of the People's Republic of the Congo to the work of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, it is more than a mere custom, and for me it is more than an agreeable task it is a real pleasure to request you to transmit to the President of the General Assembly, on behalf of the delegation of Austria, our most sincere congratulations on his election as President Of the twenty-ninth session 6f the General Assembly. In him we welcome the representative of a country with which Austria maintains cordial relations.\n71.\tJust as the new Algeria understands the permanent neutrality of Austria, which is the foundation of its foreign policy, so Austria understands the policy of non-alignment which is characteristic of the foreign policy of modern Algeria.\n72.\tAllow me, too, to join to the congratulations I extend to the President of the Assembly our expression of gratitude towards his predecessor, Mr. Leo- poldo Benites of Ecuador, who, guided by the wealth of his experience in the work of international organizations, was able to direct the work of the twenty- eighth session with so much perspicacity, skill and, indeed, devotion.\n73.\tOne of the first acts of this General Assembly was to admit to membership in our Organization three States from three great continents, Asia, Africa and Latin America, namely: Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. The entry to the United Nations of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau as an independent State symbolizes \\\"in a particularly striking manner the new progress being made in the decolonization process in Africa, which Austria has always supported. I cannot fail to rejoice at the opportunity given me to welcome these three new Member States and to assure them that we are looking forward to close and friendly co-operation.\n74.\tI should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to express the most heartfelt condolences of Austria to the people of Honduras who have been struck so hard by a severe catastrophe.\n75.\tIn this month of September it is more difficult than it was on the eve of the last General Assembly to have a clear-cut view of international developments because of the events of the last year.\n76.\tWe have in fact lived through two crises that had global repercussions, and on two occasions our Organization has had to make every endeavor to stop these crises from expanding, to control their potential consequences and, above all, to prevent them from evolving into even greater catastrophes.\n77.\tIn October 1973 there was a new outbreak of war in the Middle East, which was more violent than any of the previous military confrontations in that region. On both sides the number of victims was larger, human suffering more harsh.\n78.\tThe peace efforts made at that time finally enabled Egypt and Israel, on the one hand, and Syria and Israel, on the other, to reach agreements on the disengagement of their forces and on the reduction of their military potential in the strategically significant zones. Because of the goodwill and the tireless efforts of all, and also because of the diplomatic skill patience and tenacity of the negotiators, these agreements came into being. These are facts which history will take into account.\n79.\tAllow me to say that my country, as a non- permanent member of the Security Council, feels a very special satisfaction at having been able to contribute to the first successes achieved in this struggle for peace in the Middle East, in particular, by sending contingents within the framework of the United Nations peace-keeping operations. Nevertheless, a long stretch of road lies ahead on the way to peace and understanding in the Middle East.\n80.\tIn the spirit of friendship that links us here with all the peoples and States in that region, my country profoundly hopes that this struggle for peace in the Middle East will no longer be hampered, in the future, by insurmountable obstacles. However, no satisfactory solution to this difficult problem can be found without taking into account the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and without the existence of all States in the region receiving a firm guarantee.\n81.\tQuite recently another crisis has upset the inter-national order, and this in a particularly sensitive area.\n82.\tThe Cyprus crisis has aroused grave concern in my country, first, because the Republic of Cyprus is, like Austria, a European country, and secondly, again like Austria, it is a small country that is not a member of any military alliance. Our concern, our uneasiness which are shared by so many other countries are also due to the fact that, by both the coup d'etat of 15 July and the military invasion that followed it, a small State, a Member of the United Nations, has been the victim of a recourse to force from abroad for the purpose of bringing about changes in its internal situation.\n83.\tGiven these events, which seem to reflect a dangerous erosion oi international morality, Austria has never ceased to affirm the principles of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity for the Republic of Cyprus, and the non-use of force in international relations.\n84.\tFaithful to these principles, Austria has likewise held to the point of view that the problem of Cyprus must be settled, first and foremost, by the Cypriots themselves, and that only a dialog between the two communities on the island assisted, of course, by all those who bear special responsibilities in this regard, and by the United Nations can lead to the restoration of peace in Cyprus.\n85.\tIn this connexion, we hope that the dialog that has been started between representatives of the two communities thanks to the good offices of the Secretary-General will progress and will succeed in laying the basis for a settlement of the crisis. We wish to insist on the importance of such a settlement's being reached as soon as possible, for what is at stake is the credibility of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n86.\tThe United Nations, when faced with these two great crises that have erupted in the last year the scope and intensity of which constituted a threat to the process of detente was able, through its competent organs, to discharge the role assigned to it under the Charter.\n87.\tIn this context, the peace-keeping operations decided upon by the Security Council are of particular importance. Scrupulous respect for such peacekeeping operations, in particular the obligation of not hindering the members in the execution of their mandate, constitutes an essential condition for their success. Such respect is likewise indispensable for safeguarding the authority of the United Nations.\n88.\tIn the economic and social fields, too, the inter-national community has been gravely put to the test. Recent manifestations of economic crisis, particularly the persistence of inflationary pressures and the gravity of the situation as regards energy and food, have made us even more aware of the need for concerted action among all countries.\n89.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development, drew attention to the vastness of these problems and, accordingly, advocated the establishment of a new international economic order. Now, the main characteristic of such a new economic order must be its capacity to place sound economic growth at the service of universally accepted objectives, that is to say, the elimination of the hunger and destitution and poverty that exist in many regions of the world; the struggle against pollution and the preservation of the environment rightly regarded as preconditions for the existence in human dignity of any people; a general rise in standards of living; and acceleration of the process of industrialization in the developing countries Such a new economic order must, however; also seek to avoid all forms of waste: in the field of energy, in that of raw materials and, above all, in that of armaments.\n90.\tIt is therefore to be hoped that all efforts directed at slowing down the arms race will soon produce positive and tangible results. On the basis of the latest estimates, more than $207,000 million were spent last year for armaments purposes. This sum represents more than 6 per cent of the world total of gross national products. A reduction in this enormous expenditure could assist in rendering more effective the aid given to the developing countries.\n91.\tAssistance to the developing countries that are most afflicted by economic difficulties is a paramount obligation. Austria has not failed to support the efforts of the United Nations for the benefit of those countries. We earnestly hope that the measures provided for within the framework of that program will enjoy the support of all those States which, because of their economic situation, are in a position to manifest their solidarity with the countries hardest hit.\n92.\tNevertheless, however great the speed and energy with which assistance is brought to the countries most affected, it cannot in the long run prove effective unless the causes of their destitution are likewise eliminated. In this connexion, the delegation of Austria considers that the initiatives taken within the United Nations system to convene a series of major international conferences have made it possible to analyze the problems faced by all States and to find solutions with a view to creating a better balance in the world economy. Yet ascertaining all the facts and adopting all kinds of resolutions, if not followed by effective action on the part of all members of the international community, will not be enough to improve a situation which runs the risk of becoming chaotic.\n93. The draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States prepared by UNCTAD on the initiative of the President of Mexico, Mr. Echeverria, could serve as a guideline and point the way towards a renewal in international economic co-operation. It is our earnest hope that the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly may be able to reach a consensus on that Charter. Thus we shall have placed an essential corner-stone in building a system of collective economic security. However, this system can be achieved only in so ,far as we are prepared to assume collective economic, responsibility. In this context, the delegation of Austria is very pleased with the suggestion made by the Foreign Minister of Norway the day before yesterday in this Assembly [2241st meeting] to transform the Economic and Social Council into a body in permanent session, and we consider that this idea deserves to be adopted.\n94.\tEconomic and social justice cannot be attained without respect for the dignity and freedom of man. It follows that all forms of racial or religious oppression must be abolished in the world of today. Colonial domination has no future. The evolution in Portugal and the efforts of -the Portuguese Government towards a solution of the complex problems of its African colonies deserve special attention in this regard. We hope that the arduous struggle waged at the cost of great sacrifices by the liberation movements in southern Africa will, in the near future, and by peaceful means, lead to the attainment of the objectives of freedom and independence.\n95.\tThe Austrian delegation notes, furthermore, not without grave anxiety, that the policy of apartheid persists in South Africa. No sign of change is to be seen in the South African policy towards Namibia either, despite the unequivocal opinion of the International Court of Justice and the clear stand repeatedly taken by competent United Nations organs.\n96.\tMy country has. consistently affirmed its respect for human rights and firmly supported any action intended to promote them, particularly within the United Nations framework. Austria has once again demonstrated its convictions on this matter, by signing the International Covenants on Human Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annexJ on the twenty- fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n97.\tIt is deeply disquieting to have to note that even today there are numerous flagrant cases of violations of human rights. Torture and every kind of penalty employed with the aim of degrading a human being are the most abject treatments one can inflict on man, very particularly when these methods are used against political prisoners. Austria lends its firmest support to all efforts undertaken within the United Nations for the purpose of eliminating torture.\n98.\tAllow me also to speak of another major humanitarian problem which, unhappily, has been on our agenda for years and has never ceased to preoccupy international opinion: the problem of refugees.\n99.\tEvery new crisis, every upheaval in the international order, has resulted in an increase in the number of those who find themselves homeless and are plunged into the greatest misery. The events in Cyprus provide us with a painfully eloquent example, since we know that at present one-third of the population of the island have the status of refugees. It is, therefore, urgent to intensify international action for. the benefit of refugees throughout the world and to strive to do away with the underlying, mostly political, causes of their deplorable state.\n100.\tAustria has consistently supported and contributed to the process of detente. The Federal Government has concentrated its efforts in particular in the framework of Europe, by participating actively in the consultations of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at Geneva. We hope that the second stage of the Conference will soon arrive at satisfactory solutions which will enable it to set up the final stage at the highest level.\n101.\tIt is with very special satisfaction that I can report to this General Assembly on the positive developments regarding the question of South Tyrol, which was the subject of General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI).\n102.\tFour years ago at the twenty-fifth session, my predecessor was able to inform the General Assembly [1855th meeting] that Austria and Italy had agreed on a proposal which made provision for an extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol according to a timetable agreed to by both States.\n103.\tI am happy to be able to inform you today that further progress has been achieved in that matter since the last General Assembly session and that most of the measures for broadening the autonomy of South Tyrol have been expressed in corresponding laws and administrative arrangements. However, a certain number of measures remain to be taken. I wish to express the hope that the settlement of this question will proceed satisfactorily and that it will be completed in the near future.\n104.\tThe desire of my country to contribute to the work of the United Nations, not only politically but also materially, is evidenced by the building of new headquarters for IAEA and UNIDO in Vienna. The \\\"United Nations City\\\", construction of which is well under way and will be completed in 1978, according to estimates, is financed entirely by Austria. We hope that this tangible contribution will be. recognized internationally by integrating the city of Vienna in the \\\"pattern of conferences\\\" of the United Nations. We hope also that our offer to welcome to Vienna other units of the United Nations Secretariat and other organizations will be favorably received.\n105.\tThe attainment of the purposes and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations requires an extraordinary effort from all Members. Naturally, the contribution expected from each Member State must be in accordance with the reality of its specific situation and its material means. Yet we cannot expect to move forward on the course we have set ourselves unless each Member of the Organization is prepared to shoulder the responsibilities incumbent on it, and unless the distribution of such responsibilities and burdens is equitable and consonant with the possibilities of each Member.\n106.\tAustria, for its part, is prepared to assume its share of responsibility and, as in the past, to contribute to fulfilling the tasks defined in the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, for reasons beyond his control, the Secretary of State for External Relations of my country who would have been very happy to be here publicly to thank you for your hospitable welcome during the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries has been compelled this time to postpone his annual visit to United Nations Headquarters. On that account the honor falls to me to bring the voice of Mexico to the general debate of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In so doing, I should like to start my statement by repeating to you the sincere congratulations of the Government and people of Mexico on the distinction which, with unusual unanimity, you have been honored by all Member States. We interpret this as a well-deserved tribute both to your eminent personal qualities and to the outstanding role which your country, Algeria, has played in the development and strengthening of non-alignment among the countries of the third world.\n4.\tI should likewise pay a tribute of admiration and appreciation to Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who so skilfully and impartially presided over the debates of the twenty-eighth regular session and the sixth special session of the Assembly in a manner which was to the great honor of all the countries of Latin America.\n5.\tImmediately after having discharged such pleasant duties, I am compelled to deal with something that is far from pleasant. I refer to the disaster which recently cast the Republic of Honduras into mourning, a Republic linked to Mexico by so many ties of affection and history. We have grieved at this unexpected catastrophe as though it had been our own, and the highest Mexican authorities, headed by the President of the Republic, have helped by every means within their power to mitigate its tragic effects. However, the scope of the disaster is such as to render imperative the solidarity and co-operative action of the entire international community.\n6.\tWe welcome the advent of a new Portugal, whose dedication to the principles of the United Nations and total commitment to the task of decolonization were described from this very rostrum some days ago [2239th meeting] in persuasive and eloquent terms by its Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n7.\tIn expressing our boundless welcome to Guinea- Bissau as a Member of the United Nations, the first territory to benefit from the praiseworthy Portuguese policy of liberation and independence, we also wish to voice our confidence that Mozambique, Angola, and Cape Verde will also soon enlarge the ranks of the membership of the Organization of sovereign States, taking it yet another step towards universality.\n8.\tFor similar reasons we are pleased to express our most cordial welcome to Bangladesh and to Grenada.\n9.\tIt would be impossible to try to review here even an adequate selection of the 110 items or, rather, since a few minutes ago, 111 items, on the agenda of this twenty-ninth session, the highest number of items ever submitted to the General Assembly in the annals of the United Nations. Accordingly, I shall limit myself to a synopsis of the essential aspects of my country's position on those items to which we attribute special importance. This general survey will serve as an introduction to the rather more thorough analysis I intend to make of three questions which at this point in history seem to us of fundamental importance: detente, disarmament and the economic rights and duties of States.\n10.\tWe deplore the tragic events that provoked the recent crisis in Cyprus, and we wish publicly to express our gratitude and high esteem to the Secretary-General for his valuable and tireless efforts to prevent an aggravation of the conflict and to contribute to its lasting solution. We share his opinion that such a solution is possible only on the basis of formulas that are in keeping with the Charter, that are freely agreed to by the two Cypriot communities, and that take due account of their vital interests and aspirations. Likewise, we agree with the Secretary-General that it is an essential factor in this matter, as in any other matter of this sort, that \\\"Governments become accustomed to respecting the decisions of the Security Council and to co-operating with the instruments which it may set up\\\" [A/96011Add. I, sect. VII]which in this case means, above all, strict respect for the \\\"sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus\\\". It is equally essential that what are called the peacekeeping operations, which by their very nature must be temporary, should not serve as a pretext \\\"for slackening the momentum of the search for a settlement of underlying problems\\\" [ibid., sect VI].\n11.\tAs regards the items on our agenda entitled \\\"The question of Palestine\\\" [item 108] and \\\"The situation in the Middle East\\\" [item 109], Mexico's position has been clear and consistent: in keeping with the traditional principles of our foreign policy, we repudiate the use of force in international relations and, accordingly, refuse to concede any validity to the occupation of territories and, a fortiori, any attempt at territorial conquest which implies the necessity of withdrawal from all territories occupied as a result of the 1967 war.\n12.\tWe also consider that the parties to the conflict should put an end to the state of warfare and strive to establish a form of coexistence based on respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all States of the Area. Moreover, we are convinced that there can be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East unless those States take the appropriate measures to guarantee the Palestinian people a future of freedom and dignity.\n13.\tAmong the resolutions adopted by the United Nations-on these items I would single out Security Council resolution 242 (1967), adopted on 22 November 1967 nearly seven years ago which, in our opinion, contains the essential elements for a just solution. Mexico also viewed with satisfaction the adoption by the Security Council, on 22 October last, of resolution 338 (1973), in which it decided that concurrently with the cease-fire in the last armed conflict, negotiations should start between the parties concerned aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.\n14.\tWe would express the hope that the debates that will be taking place now in the plenary Assembly, to which both items have be.en allocated, will be held in an atmosphere and in a spirit that will facilitate the attainment of substantial progress towards a peaceful solution in accordance with justice and the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n15.\tMy country was honored by the recent visit of a mission from the United Nations Council for Namibia. We regard it as a token of appreciation for our active participation in the struggle against colonialism in general, and for our modest but determined contribution to the praiseworthy efforts of that Council, of which Mexico has been a member for two years. We hope that it will go from strength to strength and finally put an end to South Africa's intolerable occupation of Namibia, which is in violation of so many General Assembly and Security Council decisions and has been expressly declared illegal by the highest tribunal, the International Court of Justice.1 Given South Africa's attitude of open defiance of the principal organs of the United Nations, and its repeated failure to comply with basic obligations contracted by Member States under the Charter, it seems to us the duty of the Security Council, a duty that can neither be shirked nor postponed as we stated last week from this very rostrum [2248th meeting] in recalling a suggestion Mexico had made more than five years ago to recommend to the General Assembly, in conformity with Article 5 of the Charter, the immediate suspension of South Africa from the exercise of the rights and privileges inherent in United Nations membership.\n16.\tThe results of the World Population Conference held at Bucharest in July and August of this year under United Nations auspices, represent considerable progress on this vital subject. In the World Population Plan of Action that the Conference approved by consensus, the various theses presented were harmonized. This was done in a way essentially in keeping with the basic aspirations of the countries of the third world. It was made quite clear that the framework of international co-operation that was recommended should be one of strict respect for the sovereignty of each country, and it was emphasized that population problems are closely linked to a balanced development, and therefore that their solution will largely depend on what can be done to raise the standard of living of two thirds of mankind.\n17.\tThe Government of Mexico, which seeks at all times to align its conduct with international decisions, has already sent to my country's Congress an initiative intended to reform the Mexican Constitution with a view to incorporating in it some of the specific recommendations contained in the Bucharest Plan. One of the provisions to be included in the Constitution in accordance with this initiative states the following:\n\\\"Man and woman are equal before the law. The law will protect the organization and development of the family. Every person has the right freely to decide, being responsible and informed, on the number and spacing of his or her children.\\\"\n18.\tAnother international gathering, which we also consider deserves a positive assessment by this Assembly, is the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was held at Caracas in July and August of this year. Even though the Conference did not succeed in completing the difficult and complex task entrusted to it this was obvious from the beginning to States called upon to participate in it and thus it will continue its efforts at a second session to be held next year, there is no doubt that important progress was made on some far-reaching aspects.\n19.\tThe proposal for a 12-nautical-mile-wide territorial sea to be supplemented by an additional economic zone, for which Mexico has suggested the name of \\\"Patrimonial Sea\\\", where in the matter of the exploration and exploitation of all the resources of the sea and of its soil and subsoil thereof, the coastal State would have the same rights that it has in its territorial sea although this would in no way, of course, affect freedom of navigation and overflight has already met with the approval of the vast majority of States.\n20.\tLikewise, the principle that the zone and the re-sources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind, and the con-sequent need to establish an international authority that would guarantee an equitable distribution of the resources derived from exploitation of a zone, continued to gain ground in the work done in Venezuela's capital.\n21.\tWe venture to hope that the continuation of this task, which will be carried out in Geneva, will make it possible in 1975 to sign an instrument that will find general acceptance and lead to the codification of the many facets of the law of the sea, efforts which in so far as the United Nations is concerned were started in 1958. We believe that this would be to the benefit of properly understood self-interest, as much to the coastal and land-locked countries as to the maritime Powers.\n22.\tNow I shall go on, as I had announced at the beginning, to make some comments on detente, as it is called, between the two principal nuclear Powers commonly known as the \\\"super-Powers\\\".\n23.\tMexico enthusiastically supports the idea of that detente. But, of course, we consider that it should not be viewed as an end to itself but only as a means to consolidate a peace that will guarantee justice and equity for all, a peace that is faithfully and strictly in keeping with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as these have been defined in the Declaration on Principles of International Law, Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)), a declaration that was solemnly adopted in the course of the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization.\n24.\tDetente must therefore mean a complete break with certain practices of the cold-war era that tended to divide the world into bipolar spheres of influence. It must imply a radical change in attitude such as the one that inspired the title of the well-known work that analyzed the arrogance of power. It must never serve to try to justify violations whether open or concealed, clandestine or shouted to the four winds as a means of intimidation or coercion of the basic principles of self-determination, non-intervention and sovereign equality, which are the cornerstone of organized international existence. Fundamental rules of international law which, like those I have just mentioned, have been expressly recognized and reaffirmed with the active participation of all Members of the United Nations, are not to be capriciously invoked or ignored depending on how they suit the selfish interests of a given State, however powerful it may be. We must say \\\"thus far and no further\\\" to all procedures which violate these principles, recalling in this respect what Hugo Grotius said three centuries ago:\n\\\"Just as the citizen who violates civil law in order to serve the interest of the moment destroys that which is the foundation of the permanent interests of himself and his posterity, so too a people that violates natural law and international law destroys the defenses of its future tranquility.\\\"\n25.\tWe are furthermore convinced that for detente to acquire the scope and significance which I venture to believe we would all desire so that it can serve as an effective instrument to strengthen and consolidate international peace and security, it must impress itself on the world by clear and palpable results in two main fields: in disarmament, and in the economic rights and duties of States.\n26.\tWith respect to the first of these, detente must not become an instrument to institutionalize the so- called balance of terror by legalizing the maintenance in perpetuity however balanced it may be of a deadly supersaturation in nuclear weapons which entails a potential threat to the very survival of mankind.\n27.\tThe modest collateral measures which have been adopted in the course of the last decade apply, in the main only to zones in outer space or the ocean depths, or are intended to eliminate weapons such as the biological weapons which, for reasons of self-preservation, nobody would have dared to use. Such measures should not lead us to forget the nightmarish situation now existing. No attempt should be made to use them as a smokescreen concealing the constant increase in the destructive power of nuclear arsenals, which for more than Ave years has been estimated as representing between 15 and 30 tons of dynamite for every person on the face of the earth. Nor should such measures make us lose sight of the fact that world military expenditures for the present year are estimated at the astronomical sum of $220,000 million, of which approximately $160,000 million is accounted for by the two super-Powers alone. Finally, we should not lose sight of the terrible discoveries which we learn about every day regarding new possible apocalyptic effects of a nuclear conflagration, such as those which were made public last month in statements made by one of the most authoritative sources in the United States, according to which a nuclear war could destroy the layer of ozone in the stratosphere which makes life on our planet possible by protecting it from the ultraviolet rays of the sun.\n28.\tThe many items on disarmament included in the agenda of this session of the Assembly offer the nuclear Powers, and in particular the super-Powers, broad scope in proving that detente can really bring about fruitful results. It would be fitting, for example, to restore general and complete disarmament under effective international control to its proper place as the final goal towards which all negotiations on this subject should be directed. The United States and the Soviet Union would render a valuable contribution to that end by bringing up to date the drafts they submitted to the Disarmament Committee more than 12 years ago, or by presenting new proposals.\n29.\tThe nuclear test held on 18 May this year by a State not listed among those that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] defines as nuclear-weapon States has emphasized the urgent need, for the nuclear States Parties to the Treaty, if they wish to prevent horizontal proliferation, to comply without delay with the commitments they entered into concerning vertical proliferation.\n30.\tCompliance with these commitments would principally mean that the two nuclear super-Powers would put an end without further delay to underground nuclear tests, by means of a permanent agreement, or through unilateral or negotiated moratoria, as the General Assembly has requested in so many of its resolutions.\n31.\tSuch compliance would also require that the armaments race should cease and that nuclear dis-armament should be carried out in accordance with the specific requirements of article VI of the Treaty. Appropriate methods of starting to implement those provisions have been repeatedly put forward by the General Assembly when it emphasized the urgent need for the super-Powers to reach an agreement on \\\"important qualitative limitations and substantial reductions of their strategic nuclear-weapons systems as a positive step towards nuclear disarmament\\\".\n32.\tThe fact that the agenda for this session includes items relating to the establishment of three separate nuclear-free zones [items 30, 31 and 101] one in Latin America, which covers a territory of more than eight million square kilometers with a population of approximately 150 million inhabitants, and the other two proposed zones respectively for the Middle East and southern Asia is in itself most significant. It is a clear indication of the position of those States which do not possess these terrible instruments of mass destruction.\n33.\tBecause of the reluctance of the nuclear Powers to adopt effective disarmament measures, non-aligned States seem to be prepared to resort to procedures similar to those which apply in the case of an epidemic: to seek gradually to broaden the zones of the world in which nuclear weapons are prohibited for all time so that the territories of the nuclear Powers will constitute something like contaminated islands, subject to quarantine.\n34.\tThe nuclear Powers could there make again a contribution to the strengthening of detente. The Soviet Union, the only one not to have done so of the five nuclear Powers to which the General Assembly has addressed so many appeals, can do so by signing and ratifying Additional Protocol II to the Treaty of Tlatelolco the United States and France can do so by signing and ratifying Additional Protocol I to that Treaty, to which the United Kingdom and the Nether-lands are already parties; and all of the nuclear Powers can do so by offering their unreserved co-operation so that the two proposals submitted to the General\nAssembly will become a reality, like the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace adopted three years ago [resolution 2832 (XXVI)].\n35.\tThis year the General Assembly will also have to deal with the report to be prepared by the Secretary- General, with the assistance of expert consultants, on the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council and of other States with major economic and military potential. The report was requested by the General Assembly in resolution 3093 B (XXVIII), in connexion with which the delegation of Mexico had the privilege of taking the initiative. Consideration of that report, which we are sure will contain a well-documented and objective study of the subject, will provide yet another occasion for all States, in particular the nuclear Powers, to demonstrate by deeds their political will to assist in achieving disarmament. That is all the more desirable since the Assembly proposed in paragraph 1 of its resolution something which would constitute an invaluable contribution towards alleviating the economic crisis which afflicts the world, that is to say, \\\"the utilization of a part of the funds thus saved to provide international assistance to developing countries\\\".\n36.\tLastly, the preparation and convening of a world disarmament conference which would be open to all States, a question which the Assembly has been studying since 1971 and in regard to which it has repeatedly expressed the conviction that it would promote and facilitate the adoption of effective disarmament measures, in particular measures of nuclear disarmament, is something which undoubtedly could give us conclusive proof of a real will for international detente. In that connexion, it is mainly China and the United States which will have to overcome the reluctance they have shown hitherto and offer their co-operation, as we have repeatedly asked them to do.\n37.\tThe other field, also very broad in scope, in which, as I have already pointed out, detente should be felt tangibly so as to win credibility among all the peoples of the third world, is that of establishing a new international economic order which would become a reality within a system that includes an instrument defining the economic rights and duties of States.\n38.\tWe are undoubtedly at a decisive moment in the destiny of man. It is urgent that the detente among the great Powers should' contribute to &n objective interpretation of the origins of the crisis which threatens the world.\n39.\tThe energy problem, which has recently become particularly acute, is doubtless analogous to, though of infinitely smaller proportions, that which the developing countries who are producers of raw materials have been feeling in reverse. Those countries have for decades been the victims of systematic and growing impoverishment because of the imposition of unfair terms of trade amounting to thousands of millions of dollars. However, since in the present case the most highly developed countries are also affected by the so- called energy crisis, the latter, along with its harmful consequences, may have a beneficial result that of inflicting a shock similar to the shock treatment some-times used in the medical treatment of psychiatric ailments.\n40.\tIn fact, the industrial Powers, which could view with equanimity and, why not say it, with the ill-con-cealed complacency of their gigantic importing companies, the collapse in the price of coffee, sugar, cocoa, iron, tin and oil itself, are today experiencing the same effects as those so often felt by the developing countries. We hope that this shock will open their eyes to the urgent need for just and equitable terms of trade between the raw materials which constitute the main source of income of the third world countries and the technology and industrial and agricultural machinery which, in effect, are the virtual monopoly of the developed countries.\n41.\tIf we consider the question of energy in that perspective, and even within the broadest framework of trade relations of which it is a part, it must be concluded at least this is our fervent hope that, as in the case of various other developments of similar gravity, both are but inseparable symptoms of the profound maladjustments in the international economy. Inflation, food shortages, the tragic possibilities of unemployment, the absence of an orderly monetary system, problems of population, pollution of the human environment and the relative depletion of natural resources are reasons for grave concern for any observer of the contemporary scene.\n42.\tMexico maintains that, taken in isolation, none of these phenomena is controllable. They make sense only within a global context that at one and the same time encompasses and conditions them. What we must transform is the system itself of international co-existence, not the individual contradictions to which it gives rise. It is an age-old stratification of relationships based on domination that maintains the world of abundance and enlarges the boundaries of the world of poverty. Consequently, it is a question of finding basic answers, new structures capable of subordinating the irrational forces of history to the demands of security, well-being and the survival of the human race. The necessity can no longer be postponed for discovering a real remedy for the alarming situation that confronts the world, instead of resorting to mere palliatives that produce illusory and transient effects.\n43.\tWhen at the end of the first United Nations Development Decade we realized that hundreds of millions of men, women and children not only were suffering poverty but were still fighting to live in the degrading anguish of poverty, it became obvious, indeed axiomatic, that the international system of exploitation unrestrained by any ethical controls and having as its only incentive the selfish gain of a consumer society, was powerless to solve the problems resulting from growth.\n44.\tAt the same time, we learned that, during the first Development Decade, gross world production had risen to $1,100,000 million. But we also learned that only 6 per cent of that fantastic sum applied to countries having 60 per cent of the world's population, with a per capita income averaging $200 or less. On the other hand, 80 per cent of that incredible increase had gone to countries with populations barely amounting to one fourth of the world's population, countries that furthermore enjoyed a per capita income of more than $1,000.\n45.\tIt was no doubt because of reasons and facts such as those I have just cited that the President of Mexico, Luis Echeverria Alvarez, was moved to pro-pose, at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the drafting and adoption of a Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, to serve as an instrument which, through mandatory rules of economic conduct, will encourage the development of a framework of co-operation for balanced development. On that occasion, 19 April 1972, the Mexican Head of State spoke words which, in the light of what has since occurred, have today acquired a prophetic sense. It therefore seems to me timely to recall them:\n\\\"The solidarity that we are calling for is a condition for survival . . .\n\\\"The task to be carried out is one for the present generation; there is no alternative of postponement. We are at the threshold of a structural change in human society that can be brought about only if all nations work together to achieve it.\n\\\"If the experience of the decade now ending is repeated in the coming decade, perhaps nothing further can be done to prevent an irreparable deterioration in the relations of the third world with the great industrial nations.\n\\\"No balance can be based upon a lack of common consent among the greater part of the world's in-habitants. Our peoples are aware that their poverty produces wealth for others. The hatred accumulated against political colonialism is now rising anew against economic colonialism.\n\\\"To construct an economy for peace is, at this hour, the primary duty of the international community. On the other hand, a refusal to co-operate in reducing the disparities among peoples means preventing the principles of the United Nations from acquiring any real content.\\\"\n46.\tTo build an economy for peace, an economy from which all nations may benefit equally is the primary objective of the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States which, as is well known, the Working Group established by UNCTAD in 1972 and entrusted by the United Nations with the task of working out the text of the final draft, has been carefully preparing since February 1973. The General Assembly, in the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] after emphasizing the necessity and urgency of establishing that new order, proclaimed a matter of vital importance that the Charter should be approved at the present session.\n47.\tIt is our hope that it will be so and that the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, the first step in the work of codifying and developing the subject, will constitute, as the Assembly itself affirms in the Program of Action to which I have referred, \\\"an effective instrument towards the establishment of a new system of international economic relations based on equity, sovereign equality and interdependence of the interests of developed and developing countries\\\".\n48.\tThe conflicting speeches we have heard in this Hall during the past two weeks and the terrifying facts reported in the course of the deliberations of the joint meeting of the World Bank and IMF which has just ended in Washington, in which the turbulence of the world economy and the sombre outlook for all countries were endlessly referred to, while at the same time it was affirmed with undeniable authority that hundreds of millions of inhabitants of the third world would die of hunger unless the industrialized nations immediately came to their aid all these facts make clear that we can no longer postpone using co-operation as the antidote to a possible confrontation, so that the concept of interdependence tempered to accord with equity and the sovereign equality of States mentioned in the Program of Action I have referred to may acquire its full force, and to contribute to this we should without delay adopt the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. We hope that the General Assembly will interpret the facts in this way and that it will prove equal to the responsibilities that the present historic moment brings.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me at the outset to add my voice to the many that have preceded me, in most heartily congratulating you on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My delegation rejoices to see you in the Chair. We know you well for your accomplishments as foreign Minister of Algeria, a great nation with which my country has close and friendly ties. We have come to respect you as well for the prominent role and positive contributions you have made to the non-aligned movement and the conferences of Islamic nations, movements whose aspirations and objectives my Government fully shares and firmly supports. We have every confidence that you will deploy all the wit and wisdom that we have so often witnessed from you, and exercise the infinite patience and perseverance that we know you to possess, to ensure the success of this session. For our part let me say, Mr. President, that my delegation stands ready to extend to you our fullest co-operation.\n310.\tIn welcoming you, Mr. President, may I also take the opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador, who as President, not only of the twenty-eighth session but also of the historic sixth special session of the General Assembly , contributed immensely to the fruitful deliberations of the sessions. May I, therefore, express my delegation's gratitude and admiration to Mr. Benites for the skillful guidance he had given us, the leadership he had provided and the wisdom he had shown which enabled us to bring the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session to their successful conclusions\n311.\tMy delegation too, both on its behalf and on behalf of the Malaysian Government, would like to extend at the outset its warm welcome to the delegations and Governments of the Republic of Bangladesh, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and Grenada to this great assembly of nations. Their membership will bring us nearer to the attainment of the universality of the United Nations.\n312.\tPartly because of our geographical proximity but primarily because of our common interest and pursuits, my country was one of the earliest to stretch out its hand of friendship to the people and Government of Bangladesh upon its emergence. We are therefore happy at the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations. Indeed as a country that bears nothing but good will and friendship to all the countries on the Indian subcontinent, we are even happier at the unanimous support that has been given to her admission.\n313.\tIt is in the same spirit and with a similar sense of familiarity that we welcome the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to membership in the United Nations. My Government had no hesitation in recognizing the declaration of independence that the people of Guinea-Bissau proudly proclaimed last year. The tenacity, the courage and the conviction demonstrated by the people of Guinea-Bissau in their long and just struggle for independence will surely stand as an example for the colonized peoples of the world to follow and as a reminder to the world that the self-determination of peoples cannot forever be denied, much less delayed.\n314.\tMy delegation looks forward to working together with the delegation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau within this forum, as indeed we have been doing outside it, in various movements to which both our countries subscribe.\n315.\tIf I left Grenada to the last, let me hasten to assure the members of the delegation of Grenada that we welcome them no less warmly to the United Nations, that we no less look forward to working with them. The admission, of Grenada to full membership in the United Nations is surely another important step in the continuing process of decolonization.\n316.\tWe meet today in a climate less clouded by the threat of a global conflagration. This climate, although only slightly improved, is none the less comforting. As one of the many countries that had no part in creating the monstrous threat of a global conflagration and had no choice but to live in constant fear alongside it, we not unnaturally welcome the new relationship at the major-Power level that has contributed, as those Powers alone can, towards its reduction. Detente, if it is to remain welcomed, however, cannot merely mean an increased remoteness of a direct and total conflict at the major-Power level. Nor, if detente is to contribute to the making of cosmic changes, should it merely herald the beginning of cooperation between the major Powers on all issues in aU areas of the world, to the exclusion and at the expense of others less powerful. All nations, be they big or small, fortunately endowed or unfortunately deprived, have the right to contribute to, indeed the responsibility to participate in, the creation of a more secure world order. Respect and restraint should form the relations between all nations regardless of their size or situation.\n317.\tIt is therefore encouraging for my delegation to see that what the major Powers have set in motion had led to major and important initiatives taken by smaller and medium-sized Powers to accept this new challenge and seize this opportunity to work towards\nthe solution of their own problems. And it is indeed heartening that, as a result, events that had taken place in the past year, and as recently as early this year, had on balance greatly contributed to the relaxation of international tension and increased the scope for peaceful coexistence and constructive relations. It remains our hope, and indeed our determination, to ensure that this will develop into a durable pattern of relations that would diminish the need to confront and increase the will to co-operate among all.\n318.\tIt is in this light that my delegation would like to welcome the salutary initiatives taken by all concerned to devote their best efforts and energies towards finding a just solution to the Middle East problem. We are even more encouraged to hear that the process of finding a just solution is continuing and will continue until the whole Middle East problem is resolved. We welcome the disengagement agreements and the separation of forces in the Middle East but, as is universally acknowledged, and rightly so, disengagement is only a point of departure. A just and durable peace in the Middle East will emerge only with the return of the illegally occupied territories, territories acquired by force, to the countries to which they legally belong, the return of the Palestinian people to their homeland, and, equally important, the end of Israeli occupation of the holy city of Jerusalem.\n319.\tMy delegation has always maintained that the crux of the Middle East problem is the question of Palestine. Today the Palestinians still continue to endure the existence of camp-living and enforced exile. Today the Palestinians are still denied their inalienable rights to self-determination. It is in an effort to redress this situation, to see that justice is done, that my delegation whole-heartedly supports the inclusion of the item entitled \\\"Question of Palestine\\\" on the agenda. It is also my delegation's hope that the item will be deliberated in the plenary meeting of the General Assembly, and that it will be brought up at the earliest possible opportunity , in order that the problem may be given the greater hearing and greater attention which it deserves. But above all it is my delegation's hope that it will remind us of the urgent task facing the international community and lead us to take speedy action to hasten the process of finding a just solution to the problem.\n320.\tIn many areas of the world the process of decolonization has yet to run its full course. In this regard we welcome the new and positive attitude adopted by the new Portuguese Government. Its willingness to recognize the independence of Guinea-Bissau and to concede the right of self-determination and independence of the peoples of Mozambique and Angola is an important contribution to the cause of decolonization in Africa and the world.\n321.\tWhile my delegation welcomes the constructive and positive attitude of the new Portuguese Government, the action already taken by it in regard to the independence of Guinea-Bissau and the action which it promised to take in the future in regard to the self-determination and independence of Mozambique and Angola all salutary action which, we are confident, will contribute greatly to global peace and security my delegation is, however, constantly reminded that in South Africa and in Southern Rhodesia white minority regimes representing nothing but their own selfish interests and pursuing policies that are inhuman and abhorrent continue to remain in power. The brutality and injustice that are being committed in South Africa and in Southern Rhodesia, the systematic denial of human rights to the vast majority of Africans, permit no ambiguity of attitude towards apartheid. There can be no shade of grey in regard to a policy designed solely for the purpose of perpetuating domination of and discrimination against peoples whose skins happen to be black by those whose skins happen to be white. To refuse to condemn the regimes in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia is to condone their evil policies. To allow them to persist in maintaining their evil policies and to continue with their repressive actions is to allow them to erode the foundation of peace and security in that continent. And so long as South Africa remains in Namibia, so long as these racist regimes are allowed to exist, so long will peace remain but a promise. We would like to urge, therefore, that those who have it in their power to assist in removing these institutions of injustice should not claim powerlessness to do anything.\n322.\tEvents that have recently taken place on the Indian subcontinent gave us reason to rejoice. Within the improved climate and in the spirit of detente we see the fruition of continuing dialog and constructive relations. And we earnestly hope that what has already been set in motion will continue and pave the way for greater co-operation among all the countries in that region e id in the process will lead to the resolution of all the remaining problems.\n323.\tIt is in the same spirit that my delegation views the Korean question. We continue to urge that the constructive dialog already begun, but regrettably interrupted, will be resumed at the earliest opportunity. We acknowledge again the many difficulties that have to be faced by both sides, but we who enjoy friendly relations with both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea strongly believe that while there is dialog there is hope for the reconciliation of their differences that may finally lead to the reunification of the two Koreas. Any progress in this area will contribute further to the already improved climate in the international political scene.\n324.\tBut, while we recognize the improvement so far achieved, we also realize this is no time to be complacent, to be lulled by the new sense of reduced insecurity. If the dangerous antagonism of the major Powers has been reduced, the pursuit of aggression and confrontation and conflict is still very much a painful part of the present in many areas of the world.\n325.\tIn Viet Nam, despite the agreement to end the war, a war is still in progress. Although it is now less devastating, it is no less tragic. We continue to consider the agreement to be a realistic basis for the settlement of the problem and, more importantly, a basis for the building of peace in our part of the world. We continue, therefore, to urge its strict implementation and the adherence to it of all concerned. And we stress again that the people of Viet Nam themselves must be allowed to determine their own future without any interference from outside.\n326.\tIt is in this same spirit .that we view the problems confronting the people of the Khmer Republic. My delegation's dearest wish for the people of the Khmer Republic is the speedy return of peace to their country . The problem of the Khmer Republic, as my country sees it from close proximity- both Malaysia and the Khmer Republic being in the South-East Asian region- is basically a problem of contending leaderships and is, in my delegation's view, a problem that only the people of the Khmer Republic may determine. Herein lies a fundamental principle which throughout the length and breadth of our deliberations on this issue must never be lost sight of. The United Nations, whose principal mandate is the fostering and preservation of peace, should never allow itself to take positions that would be incompatible with this high ideal. This august body, in its anxious pursuit of peace, should not allow itself to disregard the very fine lines that are drawn between positions that are permissible and positions that are not.\n327.\tIt is my delegation's view that the Assembly should remind itself that, should it not tread with the utmost caution in the matter of the Khmer Republic's representation in this body, it stands in grave danger of compromising a sacrosanct principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign, independent State. The United Nations can best contribute to the well-being of the Khmer people and nation by expressing its genuine anxiety for the return of peace to that country and by affording every assistance within its power to the Khmer people to resolve their problem themselves.\n328.\tAlthough tension and insecurity in old areas of conflict have been reduced, new ones have arisen. Recently, death and destruction have descended upon the island, of Cyprus. This conflict is no less tragic and no less a threat to world peace. It is clear that a satisfactory solution in this instance must be left to the decision of the parties immediately involved. We are therefore encouraged by the fact that the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus have met and, as a result, the humanitarian aspects of the problem have to a certain extent, been negotiated and agreed upon, much to the relief of those directly involved. My delegation in this regard would like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the timely initiatives he has taken, initiatives which, in a sense, represent the continuing role that the United Nations plays and must play. But the prospect for peace in Cyprus remains dim. My delegation therefore urges that all parties concerned direct their efforts most urgently towards the early resolution of this problem in a just manner.\n329.\tIf I now turn to the subject of disarmament* it is because my delegation attaches great importance to it. I would once again like to reiterate my Government's support for a World disarmament conference under the auspices of the United Nations and Would welcome positive efforts towards the convening of such a world conference. It may be fanciful now to speak of fear of a nuclear war. But let us not lose sight of the fact that nuclear weapons are Still with us, that their capabilities are being constantly improved upon, that their possession is within the reach of an ever-increasing number of nations. The existence of nuclear weapons ensures that their use remains a possibility, however remote. The continuing development of such weapons of mass destruction and their acquisition by more countries increases the possibility of their utilization. Even if the threat of a nuclear fall-out that would destroy us all has lessened, the threat to the environment as a result of a fall-out from the \\\"limited\\\" nuclear tests has not. We must urgently seek an end to. the suicidal course that we seem to have embarked upon; to fail to work towards disarmament now is to agree to face destruction in the future.\n330.\tWe welcome, in particular, the initiatives designed to create nuclear-free zones and zones of peace in various regions of the world, similar to our own aspirations to make South-East Asia a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, for they reflect the real desire and represent one of the many efforts by nations to contribute towards a more stable international order.\n331.\t.We believe that the primary responsibility for contributing towards peace and stability in one region of the world should rest with those countries that belong to the region. Moved by such considerations, Malaysia, together with its immediate neighbors which are also members of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations, has embarked upon a program of study and consultation to establish a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia.\n332.\tOur own proposal, which is embodied in the Declaration of Kuala Lumpur, as the Assembly has been informed on previous occasions, seeks within the context of the prevailing improved international political climate to prevent South-East Asia from being an arena for major-Power conflict. It seeks also to enhance co-operation among States in.the region, and further seeks to develop a sense of regionalism, so that all who belong to the region need not fee! nor find themselves in a hostile environment. We hope to evolve from this a solidarity that will prevent our differences assuming proportions which, in the past, have resulted in their exploitation by others outside the region, to our terrible cost.\n333.\tWhile we continue to support proposals for the establishment of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace, and while we continue to be sympathetic to such proposals, it is also my delegation's view that such proposals and initiatives should first have the support of countries in the proposed zone. Convinced of our belief that the creation of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace will contribute greatly to global peace and security, Malaysia stands ready to give support and encouragement to similar initiatives and proposals by others.\n334.\tWe would expect also that the major Powers, which are equally convinced and equally concerned with global peace and security, would likewise support and encourage any such proposals and contribute positively towards their implementation. My Government, therefore, views with grave concern and deeply deplores the increasing military and naval activities of the major Powers in the Indian Ocean. Adherence to and respect for the United Nations declaration of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean [resolution 2832 (XXVI) by the major Powers is imperative.\n335.\tWhile efforts have been made to reduce the risks of war in the pursuit of peace, no comparable effort has been made to solve the economic and social problems facing the world. On the one hand, there\nis the problem of spiraling inflation which continues to pose a serious threat to world economic and financial stability as each nation tries its own method of coping with it. On the other, there are the problems posed by the realignment and floating of exchange rates, the rise in the price of fuel, shortages of food grains and fertilisers, and a slow-down in the growth rates of the industrial countries. For the developing countries, these problems have been compounded by a drop in prices of many of their primary commodities. When the prices of these commodities had been high, they had helped to cushion the effects of inflation. But now, as the prices haye come down, and the prices of capital goods imported from developed countries remain high, the burden imposed upon the developing countries has become intolerable.\n336.\tThe problem of how to cope with inflation is indeed a complex one, especially as there is no single agreed method of arresting it. Wage and price costs and their effects on employment make it an acute political problem for all nations. Furthermore, the problem cannot be treated in isolation, for whatever measures are taken by the industrialized countries in particular, developing countries will be invariably affected. Never before has the world community been faced with a problem of such magnitude during peace-time.\n337.\tWe in the developing countries are most concerned that while the developed countries grapple with the immediate problems posed by inflation, they will relegate to the background the more basic issues that have concerned us for well over two decades. Issues such as the attainment of the level of official development assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by 1975 by the developed countries; the reform of the international monetary system with greater participation by the developing countries; trade liberalization measures; remunerative prices; access for our primary commodities, semi-manufactures and manufactures to the markets of the developed countries, and a greater share in world trade are in need of urgent attention, in addition to the ever-present problems of hunger, disease, illiteracy and mass unemployment.\n338.\tAll these problems were given an airing once again at the sixth special session held here in April this year, on the initiative of the President of Algeria. This session was a landmark in the efforts of the developing countries to redress the imbalance in the economic relations between the developed and the developing world. At the meeting, the\\\" General Assembly unanimously agreed, by resolution 3201 (S-VI), to establish a new international economic cfrder based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interests and co-operation among all States. In doing so, the Assembly clearly recognized that the old system, which had been established long before developing countries had become independent, was not adequate to meet the new challenges facing the world, especially the developing countries. The Assembly, therefore, proclaimed its united determination to work urgently for the establishment of a new economic order. This implied greater co-operation between developed and developing countries.\n339.\tIncreased co-operation is, in fact, imperative because the problems that we face are interrelated and their effects are world-wide. Any solution to them must be found in the global context. If there is to be genuine co-operation, then there is no doubt that it must be based on partnership and mutual advantage. It cannot be otherwise. However, it must be recognized that, according to the rules of the game, the developing countries are the handicapped ones and therefore deserving of preferential treatment and special consideration. If this is not recognized, then terms such as \\\"interdependence\\\" and \\\"mutuality of interests\\\" are merely euphemisms for the exploitation of the poor and the weak by the rich and the strong.\n340.\tWe have also very often heard that political will is necessary if developed countries are to fulfill their obligations and commitments under the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade and help create a truly new economic order. Indeed, the problem, in essence, is a political one, and the time has come for the developed countries to show greater statesmanship so as to translate the various resolutions, strategies, declarations and programs into actions. The problem is also a moral one, for the developed countries owe it to the developing countries, as their former colonial masters who exploited their human and natural resources, and thus built the foundations of their own prosperity, to bring about economic and social stability. As you, Mr. President, so eloquently put it in your address to us, \\\"However decisive the distribution of power may be, moral considerations also have their weight, and this weight can be decisive\\\" [2233rd meeting, para. 31].\n341.\tOne issue on which it is necessary to bring the political will to bear is the level of official development assistance. It has been known, for instance, that instead of reaching the prescribed target of 0.7 per cent, official development assistance has fallen to about 0.35 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries. In asking that that level be maintained or even increased, we are not asking the developed countries to give up their prosperity. What is asked of them, as Mr. McNamara, President of the World Bank, pointed out, is that they just dedicate a tiny fraction of their incremental income, that is, income over and above that which they enjoy that will accrue to them in the 1970s. The present problems that developed countries face should not be used as an argument against foreign aid, as these countries are in a stronger position to weather the storms they experience.\n342.\tDeveloping countries, on the other hand, with a weak resistance, will only sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire of difficulties. Then even a salvage operation on a global scale will be too little, too late. Developed countries should consider that instead of giving millions for disaster assistance it would be more beneficial if the developing countries were instead granted fair and remunerative prices for their exports. This would have a greater salutary effect on the economies of developing countries. On the other hand, the rise in price of an essential import item or a decline in the price of their primary export can erase all the benefits they would get from foreign aid.\n343.\tAnother example of the \\\"aid fatigue\\\" is the response to the emergency operation launched by the Secretary-General in response to resolution\n3202 (S-Vl) to meet the immediate and urgent needs of the countries most seriously affected by the current crisis. To say the least, the response has been poor. It has been estimated that economic assistance to these countries would amount to US $3,000 to $4,000 million for the first 12 months. Yet bilateral and multilateral assistance already announced by Governments only amounts to $1,000 million.\n344.\tOn the question of external assistance for agriculture in developing countries to help alleviate the food crisis, it has been estimated that assistance in the years ahead would have to be increased to $5,000 million from the $1,500 million that is currently available. It has been mentioned that more than 460 million people are \\\"permanently hungry\\\" and their capacity for living a normal life cannot be realized. At least 40 per cent of them are children. The question we ask is, what sort of a world are we building for these children?\n345.\tThe World Bank carries an even more ominous warning in its report for 1974, in which it forecasts that many developing countries will experience a decline in their gross national product growth rates below the 6 per cent target set for the International Development Strategy and that for the poorest countries the growth rates will be so low that per capita incomes will either be stagnant or rise very little between now and 1980. For these countries, especially those with high population growth rates, the prospects look terrifying indeed. The report also talks about the bleak prospects of mobilizing additional capital and says:\n\\\"It appears almost inevitable that at least in the short run, the flow of concessionary aid will decline even further in real terms. This will happen at a time when the needs of countries which depend heavily upon such aid will be greater than ever.\\\"\nWhat prospects do these countries have for social and economic development?\n346.\tPresident Ford of the United States of America said in his address before the Assembly that \\\"we need new approaches to international co-operation to respond effectively to the problems we face\\\" [2234th meeting, para. 22].\n347.\tYet the Secretary-General in his press conference given on the eve of this session said, \\\"there was not a trend towards better international co-operation, but rather a trend back again to nationalism . . .\\\".\n348.\tIt is clear therefore that What we really need is a firm commitment from the developed countries that they will negotiate in earnest and genuinely have the interests and the welfare of the developing countries at heart. Nowhere is this more applicable than in the multilateral trade negotiations, where the whole question of an improvement in the trade position of the developing countries is being discussed. Progress on these negotiations has been slow. We in Malaysia set great store by these negotiations because our export trade constitutes more than 40 per cent of our gross national product. Yet the multilateral trade negotiations, for example, have barely got off the ground, though they are to be concluded by 1975. Further delays in the negotiations are expected while developed countries preoccupy themselves with their own problems. Such delays, as our Prime Minister pointed out when he addressed the special session of ILO in Geneva in June this year, are \\\"morally untenable. He called on the developed countries to negotiate in earnest with the developing countries.\n349.\tProgress in bringing about reforms of the international monetary system has also been slow. In calling for an early reform of the monetary system we, together with the other developing countries, have called for greater participation by the developing countries in the decision-making process, the establishment of a link between special drawing rights and additional development finance and the transfer of real resources from the developed to the developing countries. These issues, important as they are, seem to be overshadowed by the current developments on the financial scene. Yet the need for these reforms could not have been greater.\n350.\tThe negotiations on the charter of economic rights and duties of states have also been stalled because of the lack of agreement on such key questions as the permanent sovereignty over natural resources, foreign investments, transnational corporations, nationalizations and compensation. The charter will be an important document governing, the economic relations between States. iSuccess in settling the outstanding issues depends on whether a political decision has been reached by some of the countries concerned to proceed with finalizing the charter. Otherwise the discussion of this item at this session could turn out to be another long drawn-out affair with little progress to report at the end.\n351.\tWe seem to have reached a stalemate in our efforts to establish a more just and equitable socio-economic order. We all know how this is to be achieved. It only remains for the developed countries to change their attitudes so that we can break this stalemate. We are encouraged by the fact that a few of these countries have come out in support of the aspirations and hopes of the developing counties and have taken concrete steps to fulfill their commitments and obligations. The efforts of such countries are worthy of our praise. This leads us to believe that all is not yet lost.\n352.\tIf we are to build a durable structure of peace, it is imperative not only to improve the political climate but, along with it, to make a genuine attempt to achieve economic and social justice for the developing countries. Otherwise, as the Secretary-General pointed out in his introduction to the report on the work of the Organization, We will risk destroying even the very gains made on the political front and usher in a new period of desperation, chaos and confrontation. We believe that there is too much at stake to allow this to happen. Malaysia pledges to do all it can within its means, and asks that others do the same.\n"

        "file_text": "Today as I stand before this Assembly I share with you profound satisfaction that the 75 million people of Bangladesh are now represented in this Parliament of Man. For the Bangalee nation this is a historic moment, marking the consummation of the struggle to vindicate its right of self-determination. The Bangalee people have fought over the centuries so that they may secure for themselves the right to live in freedom and with dignity as free citizens of a free country. They have aspired to live in peace and friendship with all the nations of the world. The noble ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are the very ideals for which millions of our people have made the supreme sacrifice. I know that the souls of our martyrs join us in pledging that the Bangalee nation fully commits itself to the building of a world order in which the aspiration of all men for peace and justice will be realized.\n3.\tIt is particularly gratifying that Bangladesh has been admitted to this Assembly when its presidency has been assumed by one who has been active in the fight for freedom. I recall, Mr. President, the valuable contribution made by you to the success of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers in September of last year.\n4.\tI should like to avail myself of this opportunity to salute all those whose sacrifices have earned for Bangladesh a place in the comity of nations. I express our deep sense of gratitude to all those nations and peoples that supported Bangladesh in its struggle. We should also like to thank all those who have been rendering valuable assistance to Bangladesh in consolidating our independence, in reconstructing our war-ravaged land and in meeting the formidable challenge of building a better future for our people. To all those who have welcomed us into the United Nations, I offer the most sincere thanks of the people of Bangladesh.\n5.\tThe very struggle of Bangladesh symbolized the universal struggle for peace and justice. It was, therefore, only natural that Bangladesh, from its very inception, should stand firmly by the side of the oppressed people of the world. The experience of a quarter of a century since the United Nations was established has shown how a relentless struggle in pursuit of these ideals has had to be waged against daunting odds. The right of self-determination which the Charter of the United Nations promised could be redeemed only through the supreme sacrifice of millions of valiant freedom fighters in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The struggle still continues against the illegal occupation of territory by aggression, against the use of force to negate the legitimate rights of peoples, and against the practice of racial discrimination and apartheid. Great victories have been won in Algeria, in Viet Nam, in Bangladesh and in Guinea-Bissau. Such victories prove that history is on the side of the people and that justice ultimately triumphs.\n6.\tBut injustice and oppression persist in many parts of the world. Our Arab brethren are still fighting for the complete liberation of all illegally occupied territories, and the legitimate national rights of the people of Palestine have yet to be restored. The process of decolonization, though greatly advanced, has yet to reach its ultimate goal. This is particularly true in Africa, where the heroic peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia are still engaged in a grim struggle for freedom and national liberation. Apartheid, which this Assembly has repeatedly declared to be a crime against humanity, continues to outrage the conscience of man.\n7.\tWhile the legacy of injustice from the past has to be liquidated, we are confronted by the challenges of the future. Today the nations of the world are faced with critical choices. Upon the wisdom of our choice will depend whether we will move towards a world haunted by the fear of total destruction, threatened by nuclear war, faced with the aggravation of human suffering on a horrendous scale, and marked by mass starvation, unemployment and the wretchedness of deepening poverty, or whether we can look forward to a world where human creativity and the great achievements of our age in science and \ntechnology will be able lo shape a better future free from the threat of nuclear war and based upon a sharing of technology and resources on a global scale, so that men everywhere can begin to enjoy the minimal conditions of a decent life.\n8.\tThe great economic upheavals that have recently shaken the entire world should generate a sense of urgency for building a just international economic order. The sixth special session of the General Assembly earlier this year took note of the grave implications of the present international economic situation. Speaking for a country which heads the list of those described as being most severely affected by the current economic situation, I can only underline how grievous those effects are. Bangladesh, which was born on the ruins of a devastating war, has, ever since liberation, been plagued by a series of natural disasters, the latest one being the unprecedented floods we have experienced this year. We are grateful to the United Nations and its agencies and to the Secretary-General for their active interest in helping Bangladesh to meet the situation. President Boumediene and Foreign Minister Bouteflika of Algeria have appealed to the non- aligned countries to come forward to help Bangladesh. Friendly countries and humanitarian organizations all over the world have been responding positively. These natural calamities not only have impeded the march of Bangladesh towards economic progress, but have also left the country in a state of near-famine conditions. At the same time global inflation has meant, for a country such as ours, a balance-of-payments gap in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. Translated into terms of human suffering, this means that people with a meagre annual per capita income of less than $100 are now faced with the prospect of a severe reduction in even their current subsistence level of living. People who are consuming less than the minimum considered by WHO to be necessary for mere survival now face starvation. The forecast for the future of the poorer countries is even more gloomy. Food grains, of which the developed industrial nations are the main exporters, are gradually getting out of the reach of the poorer countries as a result of steadily increasing prices. Efforts to attain self-sufficiency in food production are also being severely affected because of rising costs and the growing scarcity of vital agricultural inputs. Side by side with this, as a result of the global inflation which not only has increased by many times the cost of development projects but has also adversely reduced their ability to mobilize their own resources, countries already faced with grinding poverty and massive unemployment are threatened with dire possibilities of cutbacks in their modest development plans envisaging growth rates of 5 to 6 per cent per annum,\n9.\tUnless the nations of the world can concert their action to meet this situation, human misery will be aggravated on a scale unknown in history. Indeed, there would be no recorded parallel of such human misery having to be endured by so many side by side with such unprecedented levels of affluence and prosperity enjoyed by so few. Only a regeneration of the feeling of human solidarity and brotherhood and an acknowledgment of interdependence can bring about a rational solution and the urgent action needed to avoid this catastrophe.\n10.\tNo greater challenge has been faced by the United Nations than that of marshalling the forces of reason to bring about a just international economic order. That order not only must ensure the sovereignty of each State over its natural resources, but also should seek to establish a framework of international co-operation based upon recognition of the overriding common interest of the countries of the world in a stable and just economic system. This is the moment when we must reaffirm in unequivocal terms that there is an international responsibility to ensure that everyone everywhere should enjoy the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality, as guaranteed to him by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This responsibility, according to the Universal Declaration, should extend to ensuring to everyone the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of him-self and his family.\n11.\tWe are fully conscious that the current economic crisis can be dealt with only in an environment of peace, international amity and understanding. In this context, urgent measures to control the present arms race assume special importance not only for the creation of such an environment but also for releasing for the common good of mankind the massive resources currently being wasted on armaments.\n12.\tBangladesh, from its very inception, has adopted a non-aligned foreign policy based upon the principles of peaceful coexistence and of friendship towards all. Our total commitment to peace is born of the realization that only an environment of peace would enable us to enjoy the fruits of our hard-won national independence and to mobilize and concentrate all our energies and resources in combating the scourges of poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and unemployment.\n13.\tWe therefore welcome every effort aimed at advancing the process of detente, relaxation of tension, limitation of armaments and the promotion of peaceful coexistence in every part of the world, whether in Asia, Africa, Europe or Latin America. In pursuance of this policy we have consistently supported the concept of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean area, which has received the powerful endorsement of this Assembly [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We have also supported the concept of South-East Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality.\n14.\tWe believe that the nations of the emerging world assembled in the non-aligned conferences provide powerful support for the cause of peace. These nations have reaffirmed the common determination of the overwhelming majority of the people of the world to preserve national independence and to promote peace and justice.\n15.\tPeace is an imperative for the survival of mankind; it represents the deepest aspirations of men and women throughout the world. Peace to endure must, however, be peace based upon justice.\n16.\tConsistent with our own total commitment to peace, we have striven to promote the process of reconciliation in our own subcontinent. It was our firm belief that the emergence of Bangladesh would materially contribute towards the creation of a structure of peace and stability in our subcontinent and that the confrontation and strife of the past could be replaced by relations of friendship and co-opera- lion for the welfare of all our peoples. Not only have we developed good-neighbourly relations with our immediate neighbours, India, Burma and Nepal, but we have also striven to turn away from the past and to open a new chapter in our relations with Pakistan.\n17.\tWe have spared no effort to liquidate the legacies of the past, and made our ultimate contribution by granting clemency even to those 195 prisoners of war against whom there was overwhelming evidence of their having committed grave crimes, including crimes against humanity. This was our investment towards the opening of a new chapter and towards the building of a future of peace and stability in our tormented subcontinent. In doing this we insisted on no preconditions, nor did we seek to strike any bargain, for we were influenced only by the vision of a better future for all our peoples.\n18.\tWe look forward to the solution of other outstanding problems in a spirit of fair play and mutual accommodation. The plight of the 63,000 Pakistani families who have reaffirmed their allegiance to Pakistan and have registered themselves with the International Committee of the Red Cross for repatriation to their country remains a pressing humanitarian problem. Not only is their right to be repatriated to the country to which they retain allegiance based on the strongest foundations of law and inter-national agreement, but the dictates of humanity call for an urgent solution of their problem.\n19.\tThe just division of the assets of former Pakistan is the other problem which awaits urgent solution. Bangladesh for its part was, and remains, ready to move forward towards reconciliation. We expect that, in the overriding interest of the welfare of the peoples of the subcontinent, Pakistan will reciprocate by coming forward to solve these outstanding problems in a spirit of fair play and mutual accommodation so that the process of normalization can be carried to a successful conclusion.\n20.\tBangladesh will continue to strive for good-neighbourly relations with all of its neighbours on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in one another's internal affairs. We will continue to support every move that seeks to promote peace in our region and in the world.\n21.\tIn a world that is marked by strife and human misery, the United Nations remains the focus of man's hope for the future. Despite the many difficulties and obstacles placed in its way, the United Nations, during the more than quarter-century of its existence, has significantly contributed to human progress in the political, economic, social and cultural fields. There are few countries in the world that have a better realization than Bangladesh of the concrete achievements and potential for good of the Organization. It was under the inspired leadership of Mr, Kurt Waldheim and his able and dedicated colleagues that the United Nations mounted a major relief and reconstruction programme in our country to heal the wounds of war, to restore the productive capacity of our war-ravaged economy and to rehabilitate millions of returning refugees from India, who had had to take shelter there during our struggle for liberation. To the Secretary-General, the members of his staff and the various humanitarian agencies that contributed to the success of that gigantic operation, I should like to express the sincere gratitude of the Government and people of Bangladesh. We are confident that the same constructive leadership will be forthcoming from the United Nations in the solution of the remaining humanitarian problems in the subcontinent.\n22.\tAs I mentioned earlier, we are grateful to the United Nations for its efforts in mobilizing assistance in aid of the victims of the current catastrophic floods in Bangladesh. As a country which has repeatedly been exposed to the ravages of natural calamities, Bangladesh has a special stake in the creation of an institutional arrangement by which the international community can move effectively to meet and prevent such calamities. Indeed a beginning, though modest, has already been made in this respect by the establishment of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator. However, in order that it can effectively play the role assigned to it, there is an imperative need to strengthen the organization. The Members of the United Nations have a special responsibility to concert their efforts for the achievement of this objective.\n23.\tI should like to conclude by reaffirming my faith in the indomitable spirit of man - in the capacity of the people to achieve the impossible and to overcome insurmountable odds. This is the faith that sustains nations like us that have emerged through struggle and sacrifice. Our nations may suffer, but they can never die. In facing the challenge of survival, the resilience and determination of the people is an ultimate strength, our goal is self-reliance; our chosen path is the united and collective efforts of our people. International co-operation and the sharing of resources and technology could, no doubt, make our task less onerous and reduce the cost in human suffering. But for us in the emerging world, ultimately we must have faith in ourselves and in our capacity, through the united and concerted efforts of our peoples, to fulfil our destiny and to build for ourselves a better future."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me to reiterate be fore this forum my congratulations to the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria on his election to the high office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly and to state in the name of the German Democratic Republic that this is a tribute to the high prestige of the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria in the world. We wish him much success in his responsible function.\n137.\tComplex are the events which bear on the international situation and. the destinies of entire peoples. But the essential thing is that it has been possible, despite powerful counter-efforts, to advance international detente. This has not happened of its own accord. The efforts for the elimination and prevention of international conflicts, the cessation of the arms race, the liquidation of all forms of oppression of peoples, and the development of relations of peaceful coexistence need to be resolutely promoted.\n138.\tThe German Democratic Republic joined the United Nations one year ago. As a Member of the United Nations and as a State of the socialist community, it has been making every effort, in its bilateral relations, at the regional level and also in multi lateral organizations, to help carry out the peace program of the socialist States, which also is in harmony with the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and takes account of the interests of all peoples.\n139.\tThe foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic is aimed at safeguarding international peace and security, practicing solidarity with the peoples fighting for their national and social liberation, and making peaceful coexistence prevail between States with different social orders.\n140.\tIn conjunction with its allies, the German Democratic Republic works for the fruits of detente to be shared by all peoples. Therefore we support all efforts channeling conflicts towards a political settlement. The peoples desire the attainment of durable settlements of those problems which are poisoning the international climate and threatening peace and security. Hence one should not be content with what has been achieved. On the contrary, detente must be consolidated and extended to all regions of the world. This is, in the view of the Government of the German Democratic Republic, an extremely important and equally pressing task for the United Nations and one which the German Democratic Republic will help to carry out. \n141.\tIn May 1975 it will be 30 years since the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition, and primarily of the Soviet Union, liberated the peoples from the cruel terrorist rule of German fascism. In those days of 1945 began the longest period of European peace in the history of this century. This fact corroborates the reality of a policy aimed at maintaining peace. To enable future generations also to live in peace, it will be necessary to further the detente initiated with the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin and with the treaties concluded by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Polish People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic with the Federal Republic of Germany. Inviolability of the territorial status quo and of existing borders, respect for the sovereignty of States, renunciation of the use of force and prohibition of interference in the internal affairs of other States should be normal and self-evident standards of conduct among States with different social systems in Europe. In this context it is imperative to implement this set of treaties and to defend it against those forces which tried to prevent the conclusion of the treaties and are now obstructing their implementation in letter and spirit. With the expansion ;of bilateral relations between States, the foundations\\\" that have been laid for detente can be broadened and reinforced. I need not emphasize that the German Democratic Republic is ready, now as before, to play its part.\n142.\tFrom their experiences in the Second World War, the peoples have learned the lesson that it is only by way of equal and growing co-operation among all peace-loving nations that mankind will be able to achieve its loftiest aspiration: to maintain a secure and lasting peace. A post-war settlement along anti-Fascist and democratic lines was the hard core of the decisions and agreements reached by the principal Powers of the anti-Hitler coalition. On behalf of the German Democratic Republic, I can state here our view that with the great system of treaties that has come into being since 1970, a post-war settlement has been agreed which makes possible good co operation among the States and peoples. The decisive precondition of the progress which was reached on the road to detente in Europe and hailed by the peoples of the world was the definite recognition in terms of international law of the results of the Second World War and of post-war developments. Therefore, demands based on wishful thinking and reflecting outlived and yet dangerous ideas for changing the map of Europe are not at all helpful to European and international security.\n143.\tAs far as the national question on German soil is concerned, history settled it long ago. Freely exercising their right to self-determination, the people of the German Democratic Republic have once and for all chosen the socialist system of society. Today there are on German soil a socialist State, the German Democratic Republic, in which the socialist nation is developing, and the capitalist Federal Republic of Germany, in which the capitalist nation exists. Between socialist and capitalist States there can only be relations of peaceful coexistence, the principles of which can safely be assumed to be known everywhere.\n144.\tThe historic chance of living in peace is be coming more real with the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. An early and good conclusion of that Conference would therefore be in full harmony with the legacy of those who fought against fascism. In the light of present-day realities this would be the best contribution all European States could make, as the Charter of the United Nations says \\\"... to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind . . .\\\"\n145.\tDespite artificial obstacles, detente is being advanced also in other parts of the world. The Ger man Democratic Republic pays a particular tribute to the growing role the non-aligned countries have played, both inside and outside the United Nations, in removing international conflicts, strengthening international security and enforcing the right of peoples to self-determination. We are very happy to note that our traditionally friendly relations with those States are growing in strength.\n146.\tDetente creates more favorable conditions for the just struggle of the Asian, African and Latin American peoples to gain national freedom, strength en their political independence and achieve their economic independence. This is borne out by developments.\n147.\tThe admission to the United Nations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, a country with which we maintain friendly ties, is a clear indication that the situation on the subcontinent has improved.\n148.\tThe withdrawal of the foreign troops from South Korea as urged by the Democratic People's Re public of Korea is in the interest of the korean people and would have a favorable impact on security in Asia.\n149.\tWe are resolutely opposed to the permanent violations of the Paris Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet Nam by the Saigon Administration and its foreign backers, and demand that it be strictly observed. The Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam is an equal party to the Paris negotiations and therefore has the incontestable right to participate without any discrimination in international co-operation, and this also within the framework of the United Nations.\n150.\tThe national liberation movement, supported by the solidarity of the socialist States and democratic forces all over the world, has achieved great success in liquidating the remnants of colonialism. It is in this sense that we view Grenada's admission to the world Organization. Another case in point is the admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations. Bonds of friendship and active solidarity link us with the people of Guinea-Bissau. The overthrow of the Fascist regime in Portugal and the new Government's commitment to the right of peoples to self- determination should make it easier for this session of the General Assembly to adopt effective measures aimed at eliminating all forms of colonial and racist oppression.\n151.\tDuring the session of the Special Committee against Apartheid held in Berlin, capital of the German Democratic Republic, last May, the States of the socialist community, their citizens and mass organizations convincingly manifested their firm determination to strengthen their solidarity with the peoples of southern Africa. An end must be put to racist terrorism in all its forms. Acting in this spirit, the German Democratic Republic signed and ratified the Inter national Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII), annex] immediately after it was adopted.\n152.\tIt is gratifying to point to the substantial progress in creating a more healthy international climate. But the opponents of detente are far from laying down their arms. While they could not reverse the trend, their incessant attempts to create new hotbeds of international tension and maintain existing ones, to fuel the arms race and defend colonialist and neo-colonialist oppression require not just close attention but resolute resistance on the part of the United Nations also.\n153.\tIs not the attempt to abolish the sovereignty of Cyprus a very striking example?\n154.\tTogether with the other socialist States and the non-aligned countries, the German Democratic Republic stands for vigorous action by the United Nation's, to maintain the non-aligned status of Cyprus, to restore constitutional order, to have all foreign troops withdrawn and to establish an effective system of guarantees.\n155.\tIf effect were given to the proposal of the Soviet Government to convene an international conference within the framework of the United Nations, in which Cyprus, Greece, Turkey and all States members of the Security Council would participate, and in which other countries, specifically non-aligned countries, could also be involved, this would be the best way of achieving a settlement satisfactory to the vital interests of the Greek and Turkish population of Cyprus and the security requirements of all peoples. In accordance with the primary responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council under the Charter for the maintenance and safeguarding of international peace, these States should as contained in the Soviet proposal to convene the conference provide the required guarantees of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and of compliance with the decisions the planned conference on Cyprus will be taking.\n156.\tDespite growing protests by world public opinion, the military junta in Chile is carrying on with the cruel suppression, tortures and assassination of upright patriots, in brutal violation of human rights. It has so far ignored the appeals of the Secretary-General and the President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Its actions create a dangerous source of tension in Latin America and challenge international public opinion as a whole. This twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly should vigorously demand the restoration of human rights and democratic freedoms in Chile.\n157.\tThe settlement of the Middle East conflict is now sought by political means. The German Democratic Republic welcomes this. But, unfortunately, a durable peace settlement is still outstanding. The delegation of the German Democratic Republic is in favor of the immediate reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East so that a stable settlement of this issue on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) can be achieved. The German Democratic Republic has always supported the Arab peoples in their struggle against the permanent Israeli aggression and its consequences and will do so in future.\n158.\tThe German Democratic Republic comes out in support of securing the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine. My Government supports the demand of the Palestine Liberation Organization and of the Arab States that the question of Palestine should be considered at this year's session of the General Assembly.\n159.\tThe relations between the Soviet Union and the United States are of particular weight in inter national affairs. The Soviet Union has set in motion the reshaping of the Soviet-American relationship, and has thereby made the decisive contribution to ending the era of \\\"cold war\\\" and confrontation.\n160.\tThose who invented the theory of the so- called super-Powers have, from generally known selfish motives of great-Power chauvinism, given the Soviet Union's relations with the United States an arbitrary interpretation of their own. But nobody can deny the plain truth that the evolution of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States on the basis of peaceful coexistence is essential to the maintenance of world peace and hence serves the interests of all peoples. The period of the \\\"cold war\\\" and the imperialist strategy of \\\"war brink man-ship\\\" have not fallen into oblivion. It is the fundamental improvement in international relations which highlights the specific weight of the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n161.\tConditions have improved for the United Nations to work in the interest of international security, disarmament, the liquidation of colonialism and racism, of international co-operation among States on a basis of equality. At the same time, the activities of the opponents of detente underscore the need for the United Nations to make a greater contribution to the normalization of the international situation.\n162.\tIs it not a proved practice to make regular reviews of how decisions that have been taken are carried out? The delegation of the German Democratic Republic would therefore be in favor of a thorough analysis of how the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, adopted in 1970 [resolution 2734 (XXV)}, is being implemented. This would also meet the demand for the increased effectiveness of the work of the United Nations.\n163.\tIt is the policy of the German Democratic Republic, just as it is of many other States, to pro mote detente in Europe, to urge that it should be extended to the whole world and be complemented by military detente, and to demand the implementation of the right of peoples to self-determination and of the principles of peaceful coexistence in the relations among States with different social orders. Should it not be a paramount aim for this General Assembly to adopt further measures to fulfill the Declaration of 1970? As is known, the socialist States proceed from the fact that effective measures towards military detente, armaments limitation and dis armament are indispensable to promoting political detente, and vice versa. Arms expenditures are an unbearable burden on the working people. In many countries the corporations producing arms exacerbate the effects of the objective crisis. Vast human and material resources in science and technology are withheld from peaceful, productive work for the benefit of the people. Scientists in the German Democratic Republic have estimated that almost 50 per cent of the scientific and technological intelligentsia in the principal countries of NATO are directly or indirectly engaged in the development of weapon systems. The arms race, that material preparation of war, is threatening international detente.\n164.\tThere is still time to halt that disastrous development. There are constructive proposals to this end. We second the initiative of the Soviet Union to request the inclusion in the agenda of the item entitled \\\"Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well-being and health\\\". The draft resolution^ submitted by the Soviet Union on this item [AlO.l/L.675] has the undivided support of the German Democratic Republic. It is of great importance in both its current and future relevance. We must not allow the achievements of science and technology ever to be used again for the physical destruction of human beings and material resources. We hold that the Soviet proposal is realistic and directly combines measures for international security with action to protect man and his environment.\n165.\tFor a long time there has been an urgent need to convene a world disarmament conference. This twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly could very well proceed from the results so far reached and begin speedy preparations for the conference. We cannot agree with the unsubstantiated argument repeatedly put forward by some States that the time is not ripe for such a conference.\n166.\tProgress in the fields of disarmament and arms limitation is indispensable to remove the sword of Damocles of a nuclear world war, to strengthen the mutual confidence of States in declared peaceful intentions, and to give all States the opportunity to participate in the solution of a fundamental question of international development affecting their vital interests. In this connexion, the delegation of the German Democratic Republic wishes to recall the urgent need to implement the resolution adopted at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)].\n167.\tIt is in the very nature of things that the ever greater expenditures for military purposes stand in the way of solutions to pressing economic and social problems and also affect economic, scientific and technological assistance to the developing countries.\n168.\tAs we did at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, we point once more to the resolution on the reduction of military expenditures of the permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent which was proposed by the Soviet Union and adopted at the past session of the General Assembly [resolution 3098 (XXVIII)]. We reaffirm our opinion that the resolution should be speedily carried out. The position of certain forces which refuse or delay the implementation of that United Nations resolution is, to say the least, highly regret table.\n169.\tThe lofty aims of the Charter of the United Nations are international law. The Charter constitutes a stable foundation for developing peaceful, good-neighborly relations between States. It has stood the test, not least as an instrument of the peoples' struggle against imperialist and colonial oppression.\n170.\tImportant social changes have taken place in the world in the 30 years since the Charter came into force. International relations have been reorganized for the better. Yet the purposes of the Charter are far from being fulfilled. From all this we believe one can draw but one conclusion: that it is necessary to ensure that the principles of the Charter become fully effective in international affairs. In particular, the fundamental principle of the unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council has proved to be an instrument of the necessary constructive co-operation of the States concerned in the interest of peace. Do we have a right to do away with reliable instruments? The growing normalization of the international situation and a closer co operation among States of necessity increases the interlacing of political, military, economic, cultural and scientific problems of an international character. From this angle, too, proved instruments of inter national co-operation are indispensable.\n171.\tTo develop fully and intensify such co-operation is possible only on a solid political foundation. That conditions of international detente are propitious for tackling burning questions of global interest has been demonstrated by the sixth special session of the General Assembly, the Third United Na tions Conference on the Law of the Sea at Caracas and the World Population Conference at Bucharest. In this connexion, we believe the power of the United Nations lies, above all, in its contributions towards a strict implementation of the Charter in all spheres of inter-State relations.\n172.\tThe Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order makes clear the close interrelation between the strengthening of inter national security and the development of economic relations between States on a basis of equality. We welcome the fact that the Declaration has reaffirmed the obligation to respect strictly the principle of the sovereign equality of States and their right to dispose of their own natural resources without external interference as much as we are pleased that it has endorsed the right to nationalize such resources. We think it is fully justified and appropriate that the activities of transnational corporations should be brought more into the limelight, since they not only make enormous profits by exploiting other peoples but also interfere in the internal affairs of States and consequently create international conflicts.\n173.\tThe German Democratic Republic has always conducted its relations with the developing countries on the basis of the principles specified in the aforementioned Declaration. It has been a guiding rule of its foreign relations to have regard to the developing countries' needs as widely as possible. Therefore, the German Democratic Republic is orienting its growing trade with these countries towards encouraging imports of raw materials and finished and semi-finished products from them.\n174.\tAs far as its exports to those countries are concerned, the German Democratic Republic gives priority to the delivery of complete plants, efficient machines and agricultural equipment which aid the process of industrialization and raise the efficiency of agricultural production. It seeks a rapid and continuous growth of its trade turnover with developing countries. And, by delegating experts, advisers, specialists and instructors, we want to contribute towards the implementation of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n175.\tIf we take a look at international economic relations as a whole, the alarming developments which were also emphasized in the recent World Economic Survey, 1973 are only too evident. The trend toWards a deepening structural crisis in the capitalist countries which the survey has noted affects, above all, the developing countries. This is why the delegation of the German Democratic Re public is in favor of effective measures to combat this crisis.\n]76. By contrast, economic integration within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is developing expeditiously and becoming increasingly effective for the individual members of the Council. This evolution has a bearing on high increases in labor productivity and continuously high rates of growth of production and secures price stability. This is what makes the external economic relations of these countries so dependable and stable.\n177.\tIn a few days' time, the people of the German Democratic Republic will be celebrating the twenty- fifth anniversary of the founding of their socialist State. The viability of the German Democratic Re public was frequently questioned. However, thanks to its close co-operation with the Soviet Union and the other States of the socialist community, and thanks to the industrious and creative work of its people, the German Democratic Republic has been and is successful in building socialism.\n178.\tThese 25 years have, at the same time, been the contribution of a quarter of a century to the struggle for the strengthening of international security, solidarity with the peoples fighting for their national and social liberation, and active support for peaceful coexistence between States with different social systems.\n179.\tThe First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Erich Ho- necker, recently stated that our foreign policy has always been and will remain a policy in support of all those who strive to strengthen peace and of all peoples fighting for their freedom and independence.\n180.\tIn this spirit the delegation of the German Democratic Republic is going to contribute to the successful course of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, after so many voices which have been heard from this rostrum expressing to you in different terms and in different languages congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly it would seem gratuitous at this stage of our work to reflect another sentiment which has already been expressed. However, in associating myself humbly with the compliments that have been paid you I am convinced that I am not simply discharging a traditional duty or making a gesture of international courtesy, but am, in fact, lauding with pride the exceptional merits of my brother, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, to whom I am bound by so many positive ties, which I would not like to go into now if only to avoid offending his legendary modesty and exposing myself to disapproval.\n73.\tYou are a worthy and valiant son of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, which maintained special relations of fraternal co-operation with my own country, the Central African Republic. The Algerian Republic is undeniably in the forefront of the nations which truly deserve to be called revolutionary. It is precisely this well-thought-out, practical, effective and proud revolution, that in their acts my own head of State, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, President for Life, Marshal of the Central African Republic, and his Government, have been carrying out since 1966, following the example of Algeria, for the benefit of the hard-working people of the Central African Republic.\n74.\tYour election is a three-fold victory: a victory for the policy of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, to which our two countries are both happy and proud to belong and which reached its apogee at the historic Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers in September 1973; a victory of the oppressed peoples, particularly of the African peoples, over colonialism, imperialism and racial discrimination, and also of the struggle for freedom and independence; and a personal victory because of your great statesmanlike qualities and your vast experience of international problems. This in my view constitutes a sure guarantee of the success of our work. In the discharge of your heavy responsibilities, I should like to assure you, Mr. President, of the unreserved support and the effective cooperation of the Central African delegation.\n75.\tI should also like to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Benites of Ecuador, for the devotion and competence with which he discharged the delicate task of conducting so successfully the proceedings of the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n76.\tThe praiseworthy efforts so ceaselessly deployed with courage and determination by the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, ever since he took up the office, both for the sake of the total liberation of the territories still under foreign domination and for the maintenance and restoration of peace throughout the world, compel our admiration. May he find here an expression of our deep gratitude and our most sincere wishes for success in the performance of his noble task.\n77.\tMy delegation was very much distressed to hear of the catastrophe which has plunged Honduras into mourning and we would request the delegation of that friendly country to be good enough to accept and convey to its Government and people our deepest condolences.\n78.\tThe opening of this session has been, marked by the admission of three new States Members to the Organization. We are happy to welcome to this hall the representatives of Bangladesh, Grenada and our sister Republic of Guinea-Bissau, to which we would convey our warm and fraternal congratulations, accompanied by our best wishes for happiness and prosperity for their peoples.\n79.\tThe twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is taking place against a background of important international events and changes. Indeed, in spite of tireless efforts to bring about detente, the number of conflicts involving a resort to force has not been reduced. We are witnessing helplessly an unbridled arms race, constantly accompanied by assurances of detente and false promises of disarmament.\n80.\tThe already disastrous economic situation in parts of the world, particularly in developing countries, continues to worsen at a dizzying rate under the pernicious influence of galloping inflation, provoked by monetary disorder.\n81.\tthe distance between the proclamation of human rights and the actual implementation of those rights continues to increase in a way that is intolerable for southern Africa.\n82.\tIn accordance with its peace-loving policy, its attachment to the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the Central African Republic attaches primary importance to problems relating to decolonization in Africa. In this regard, my delegation takes pleasure in the current developments in the colonies under Portuguese domination. We should like to take this opportunity warmly to congratulate the liberation movements of Guinea-Bissau, the Cape Verde Islands, Angola and Mozambique on their recent victories, which have crowned their heroic struggles for self-determination and independence. The overturn of the Fascist regime of Caetano was the decisive event in the dynamic struggle being waged by African nationalists. This struggle first made possible the liberation of Portugal itself from dictatorship and thus opened up the prospects and new horizons for the self-determination and independence of the colonies.\n83.\tMy delegation is convinced that the political acumen which the representatives of the new Lisbon Government have so far displayed will be consistently maintained and that the application of the principles of independence will be extended soon to Mozambique, Angola, the Cape Verde Islands and other Territories still under Portuguese domination. In this regard, we have followed most attentively the profession of faith made here, from this very rostrum, on 23 September 1974 [2239th meeting] by Mr. Soares, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \\\"new\\\" Portugal, and also the program of action of the new Portuguese Government.\n84.\tConvinced that these promises will be honored, and aware of the efforts which have been undertaken since last April to put this program into effect, the Central African Government is ready to establish diplomatic relations with the new Portugal.\n85.\tWith regard to the decolonization of the so- called Spanish Sahara, which is of concern primarily to the African continent, as is indeed the case of the other Territories still under foreign domination, the question arises of the attitude of the Spanish Government and the future of those Territories. The Spanish Government has refused and still refuses to apply strictly and scrupulously the principles of decolonization. In spite of the numerous relevant resolutions of our distinguished General Assembly, calling upon Spain to accelerate the process of decolonization, particularly by withdrawing the occupation troops and allowing the refugees to return to their homes, by permitting the visit of an inspection mission from the United Nations and the opening of negotiations on the problem of the sovereignty of the Territories in question, Spain persists in doing everything in its power to perpetuate its colonial domination in this region.\n86.\tThe future of those Territories has always posed the problem of sovereignty, and our august Assembly has always wished to provide for consultations between the two countries concerned; Morocco and Mauritania. My delegation is gratified by the fact that those two fraternal countries, relying on the wisdom and authority of the higher instances of our Organization, should have decided, in the conflict between them and Spain, to submit the problem to the International Court of Justice.\n87.\tThe Central African Government unreservedly supports this prudent position adopted by Morocco and Mauritania, countries with which my country enjoys fraternal relations, and hopes that the General Assembly will do everything in its power to bring about the implementation of this procedure so as to give, the principles of the Charter a true interpretation.\n88.\tWe have also noted with genuine satisfaction the statement made a few days ago from this rostrum by the Foreign Minister of the French Republic, Mr. Sauvagnargues [2238th meeting], expressing the willingness of his Government to grant independence to the Comoro Archipelago. This action, which is no surprise to us, is in perfect conformity with the political policy of France ever since the time of General de Gaulle, and we can only share our pleasure with the people of the Comoros.\n89.\tThe example of the recent developments in Portugal should serve as a lesson to the minority and racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia, where the dignity of the colored man is still constantly trampled underfoot. The Central African Republic would like to reaffirm here its complete disapproval of the outrageous policy of apartheid, and considers that the obstinate refusals of the Pretoria and Salisbury regimes to heed the international appeals that have been made are a challenge to the international community.\n90.\tIt is clear that the wind of liberty which is blowing through Africa will not spare southern Africa. We are firmly convinced that it is imperative that effective measures should be taken to enable the United Nations to play a more active role in the elimination of racial discrimination in southern Africa. That is why we are gratified at the decision taken by an overwhelming majority by the General Assembly on 30 September 1974 [resolution 3207 (XXIX)} calling upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa in the light of the constant violation by South Africa of the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n91.\tOn the subject of the environment, Mr. Maurice Strong said in Addis Ababa on 23 August 1971, when\nhe was Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment:\n\\\"The United Nations can be only as successful as its Members permit it to be; it can be effective only to the extent that its Members wish it to be; it can be strong only if the political will of Governments grant it strength. I am convinced that in facing the challenge of the environment the United Nations will also be sowing the seeds of its future greatness and that those seeds will take root and flower in soil which must be saved for the good of the human family.\\\"\n92.\tIndeed, the Government of the Central African Republic, aware that from a global standpoint there is a definite interdependence between the environment and development, aware also that any approach to the environment problem must necessarily embrace all the aspects of human life, nourishes the hope that the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, proclaimed in resolution 3223 (XXIX), will rid southern Africa for ever of the substances primarily responsible for polluting human dignity -that is, apartheid or racial discrimination, Vorster or Ian Smith.\n93.\tFor more than a quarter of a century the Middle East conflict has constantly been on the General Assembly's agenda. In the Central African Republic we take some satisfaction to see the disengagement agreements signed concerning Sinai and the Golan Heights. We should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the leaders of the countries directly concerned on their wisdom and their spirit of conciliation. In our opinion, those agreements are only a first step towards a withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and a recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. In that respect we are gratified that the Palestine question has been included in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We place great hopes in the results of the discussions to be held on that question.\n94.\tHardly had the first steps been taken towards a solution of the Middle East problem than the Cyprus conflict broke out, once again making the eastern Mediterranean a theater of strife. The tragedy we are witnessing in Cyprus is that of two communities which are obliged to live together but cannot manage to agree on the way to do that in peace and harmony. Once again, the most serious danger in that conflict lies in the intervention of foreign Powers in the internal affairs of the island. Indeed, these events endanger the independence and territorial integrity of that country and hence pose a great threat to international peace and security. We hope that all the parties concerned in this conflict will soon reach a negotiated settlement, thereby ensuring the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus.\n95.\tTwo years have passed since the Paris agreements on Viet Nam were signed, but peace has not been restored to IndoChina. The delegation of the Central African Republic notes with bitterness the lack of will on the part of the countries concerned in that conflict to put into effect the provisions of the Paris agreements for a peaceful settlement. We remain convinced that peace in Viet Nam can result only from respect for and strict implementation of the Paris agreements.\n96.\tWith regard to Cambodia, the Central African Republic continues to support the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. We continue also to support the efforts to restore that Government's legitimate rights in the United Nations.\n97.\tWe note with concern that no progress has been made in the talks between North and South Korea. We still believe that the most realistic way to solve the Korean problem peacefully is and remains a continuation of the talks and a widening of the exchanges and co-operation between the two Koreas, with the aim of accelerating the independent and peaceful unification of the country, in accordance with the consensus unanimously adopted at the General Assembly's twenty-eighth session.\n98.\tInternational co-operation between the industrialized countries and those of the third world is far from satisfactory. As we stated from this very rostrum three years ago:\n\\\"For us, in a low income country, the most important objective is and remains the economic and social progress of our people. That is the top priority.\\\"2\nThat is why Mr. Jean-Bedel Bokassa, President of the Central African Republic, said on 1 January 1966, when he became head of State: \\\"People can't eat politics\\\".\n99.\tSince then the Central African Republic sometimes called \\\"African Switzerland\\\" -has been constantly cultivating peace, in the first place with its immediate neighbors and then with the entire world. We believe that His Holiness Pope Paul VI was quite right when he conferred on the head of State of the Central African Republic the title of \\\"Pilgrim of Peace\\\" during an audience granted to our head of State by the Pope at his summer residence in Castel- gondolfo in August 1970. All the nations of the world, large, middle-sized or small, need that peace to develop harmoniously and to ensure the welfare and prosperity of their peoples.\n100.\tThat is why all intelligent and objective observers agree that our foreign and domestic policy is based essentially on economic movement and the Bokassa Operation, a truly original strategy for the economic, social and cultural development of our country, resulting from the new breath of life and the new mentality in the Central African Republic and its people, determined to set to work to defend the idea of each nation's sovereignty over its own natural resources, of its right to retrieve them and use them freely.\n101.\tBut the efforts which we constantly exert within the framework of the Bokassa Operation, whose good effects have already spread beyond our frontiers, are unfortunately being counteracted by natural phenomena resulting from the fact that we are a landlocked country, more than 1,500 kilometers away from the Atlantic Ocean on the one hand and the Red Sea on the other. That is why, in his message to the nation on 1 January 1974, the head of State of the Central African Republic proclaimed 1974 as the year in which the Central African Republic would come out of its enclave. All our efforts are directed towards the achievement of that objective, and we are sure they will succeed, thanks to the help of countries friendly to the Central African Republic.\n102.\tTo those major difficulties resulting from our geographical position we must unfortunately add the malicious though skillful attempts to stifle our country, the Central African Republic, despite the relevant resolutions of the Organization, and particularly General Assembly resolution 3169 (XXVIII) on special measures related to the particular needs of the landlocked developing countries.\n103.\tIn that connexion, we are entitled to ask: Did we choose to be situated where we are, to be a landlocked country? What has happened to this duty of solidarity which we constantly clamor for in all the bodies' of international and regional organizations?\n104.\tWe in the Central African Republic believe that the United Nations must use all its influence in the specialized agencies dealing with loans and development to encourage greater assistance to the less endowed countries, particularly those that are landlocked and, as I have said, that includes the Central African Republic.\n105.\tIt is along this line of thinking that we attach great importance to the rapid completion of the Trans- African road, which will service the Central African Republic and will constitute one of the essential elements in strengthening African unity. But completion of the railroad to link Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, to the Trans-Cameroonian line is and remains a vital element for our national economy.\n106.\tWe are happy because after much hesitation, vacillation and manoeuvring, the only reasons for which are the schemes and bad faith of those responsible, certain international financial organizations and certain friendly countries have accepted the justice of our view and have become interested in building this railroad.\n107.\tIndeed, how can one fail to be interested in the development of a country such as the Central African Republic, which not only abounds with natural resources of all kinds, but opens wide its doors to all investors, public or private, from wherever they may come.\n108.\tFinally, we wish to denounce once again a regrettable tendency of certain countries, which claim to be friendly, and which often in bad faith cannot or will not meet their obligation of international solidarity, to resort to empty excuses, saying that they cannot grant assistance to our country without obtaining the prior agreement of a certain great Power which, moreover, is our friend, and which has excellent relations with us in every field. By such action we consider that those countries show contempt for us, and ignore the fact that the Central African Republic is a sovereign, free and independent country with sole responsibility for its own destiny.\n109.\tMay I explain our profound disappointment with regard to certain brother and friendly countries which, far from understanding the gesture of solidarity which they demanded of us at a difficult time in their history, have done nothing in return, although they could give us a simple acknowledgment of their appreciation, even by a symbolic gesture, which we really need, instead of flooding European and American banks with unproductive capital.\n110.\tOn 3 October 1972, we made the following statement from this rostrum:\n\\\"Today the ideas of peace and security, of development and wide-scale multilateral co-operation are supported and appreciated by an ever-growing number of countries. Real conditions exist, such as trade and international economic relations that, we are sure, can become important factors in the maintenance and strengthening of peace and economic and social progress.\\\"3\n111.\tWe also expressed the fervent hope that the United Nations would be able to bring together the developed and the developing countries into a network of co-operation in the economic, commercial, technical and other fields. In so doing, it would greatly contribute to the transformation of the human condition in an ever-changing world full of inequalities. For one of those inequalities -and this is no secret to anyone -is the constant deterioration in the terms of trade for under-developed countries which have vast resources and which are conducting a determined fight for the well-being of their peoples.\n112.\tThe Assembly will understand our pleasure in reiterating our satisfaction at the welcome initiative taken by Mr. Houari Boumediene, President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, in convening the historic sixth special session devoted for the first time solely to .consideration of the problems concerning raw materials and development. As we all know, the special session of the General Assembly was an event of great impact, crowned by the adoption of two documents whose importance is recognized by all: the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n113.\tThe special session laid the foundations, in the interests of the whole international community, for free economic co-operation among independent and sovereign nations. In so doing, it helped to put an end to the deplorable post-war economic situation, characterized by a deterioration in the terms of trade and the broadening and deepening of the existing gap between the rich and poor countries, a gap which in the long run threatens the security and the survival of our economy.\n114.\tAlthough major results were obtained during the sixth special session, today our world must wonder about the viability of the economic system on which it has always relied. Is it likely to promote social justice and progress for all, and at the same time prevent major upheavals in the political balance of the world?\n115.\tThe continuing misgivings of public opinion are due to the inability of the international community to meet the most elementary needs of the peoples on our planet.\n116.\tThe Special Program of emergency assistance, adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly, and the multilateral and bilateral initiatives, are encouraging evidence of international solidarity. Let us all hope that those programs will develop fully and will be supported so that an acceptable rate of development can be maintained everywhere in the forthcoming years.\n117.\tIt is absurd that certain large countries, instead of wanting to or trying to control inflation -the ill- effects of which never cease to plague the poor countries -and rapidly to rebuild an international monetary system with the assistance of all the Members of our Organization, now claim that the price of the oil is the fundamental cause of the crisis looming over us.\n118.\tBut we sincerely believe that this crisis cannot be dealt with or overcome without a world economic plan. Such a plan is of concern to the whole international community, particularly the third world, already poor, , which is the most severely affected by the present economic situation.\n119.\tIn closing this chapter, I would say that what is being challenged is a political economy rather than an economic policy. The legitimate hope of a new order is spreading among all the nations of our planet. The old world is breaking up and disappearing; the new world that we desire with all our hearts is struggling to emerge.\n120.\tBut for that change to take place, the United Nations must be more effective. Our Organization is not functioning as we would have wished. Hence the need to revise the Charter, which is even more justified today because of a current democratization now prevailing in international relations. The sole fact that many States which in 1945 were colonies have been able to accede to the Charter since their attainment of independence militates in favor of the revision of the Charter.\n121.\tIn an international community such as ours, made up of such diverse States, with legal systems and political institutions that reflect their economic and social conditions, one cannot impose an international order which no longer represents mankind as a whole.\n122.\tThe Central African delegation does not consider that the Charter is a sacrosanct document which cannot be changed. The course of events since the entry into force of the Charter requires its revision. Thus the delegation of the Central African Republic is pleased to see that item on the agenda of this session [item 95], and we are prepared, to study it carefully and give constructive consideration to proposals to revise the Charter.\n123.\tI have drawn the attention of this Assembly to the serious problems of the hour which concern us all and which threaten world peace. Their solution depends on the devotion of each of us to strict compliance with the principles of the Charter in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect. Although I cannot hope to see those problems solved at this session, may I at least hope that a new spirit will emerge, a gleam of hope for a better world, and say, with the poet Vercors, \\\"Tomorrow will be a beautiful day\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, to congratulate you on your election to the post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We are pleased that the election to that high and responsible post has fallen to the representative of the friendly Algerian people, with whom the Bulgarian people have been closely linked since the years of their heroic struggle for freedom and national independence.\n39.\tWe cannot fail to note with satisfaction that in the period following the twenty-eighth session the process of detente has continued to develop and that the ice which gripped international relations has begun to thaw. The principles of independence, equality and peaceful coexistence are increasingly asserting themselves as a norm of international life. Arbitrariness and diktat in relations among States are being rejected by the peoples as a political anachronism. Political consultations between the leaders of States, international negotiations and meetings and conferences aimed at resolving urgent issues of our times are being used more widely and efficiently. There exist red possibilities for the world to enter a new era, one of a stable peace and the reconstruction of present-day international relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n40.\tIn Europe the foundations of a promising system of security and co-operation are being laid down. Favorable conditions have been created for the successful completion of the work of the second stage of the Conference on Security and Coroperation in Europe and for the third, concluding, phase to be held at the highest level as soon possible. That Conference, which is in itself an unprecedented event in the history of the old continent, has been rendered possible thanks to the new political and moral-psychological atmosphere in Europe. There can be no doubt that the strengthening of security and the development of comprehensive co-operation in the region are among the main trends in the process of detente in the world.\n41.\tThe results of the third meeting between the leaders of the, Soviet Union and the United States represent a significant new contribution to the further improvement of the. international climate. The Bulgarian Government and people have welcomed with deep satisfaction the signature by those two States of agreements on a number of important contemporary matters. The agreements aimed at preventing a world thermonuclear catastrophe are of special significance. We are profoundly convinced that the positive changes in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union are in the interests of all States and peoples, as well as in the interest of universal peace.\n42.\tThe breaking of the so-called sanitary cordon around Cuba is yet another of the striking facts which characterize a turning away from cold war towards an ever wider affirmation of the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n43.\tOne of the first and last bastions of fascism and colonialism in Europe has collapsed. The long heroic struggle of the peoples of Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and Angola and of the revolutionary and democratic forces in Portugal has been crowned with success., Against the background of that victory, it is increasingly evident that the military junta in Chile, which is trying to prevent the social development of that country by Fascist methods condemned by history, is doomed. History has also condemned those reactionary circles which are trying today here and there, with the help of neo-fascism and neo-nazism, to stifle the struggle for freedom, democracy and social progress.\n44.\tEvents in Portugal have also shown that our planet is ridding itself of the last vestiges of centuries of colonial oppression. However, we have no right to forget that there are still peoples who are under the colonial yoke. Our organization can and must continue to play an active role in the final elimination of colonialism, racism and apartheid. The delegation Of the People's Republic of Bulgaria expresses the hope that the Assembly at its present session will not lose the opportunity to adopt appropriate measures to implement definitively and as early as possible the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, adopted at the fifteenth session of the General Assembly [resolution 1514 (XV)] on the initiative of the Soviet Union.\n45.\tThe relaxation of tension also provides favorable conditions for the further intensification of the struggle of the non-aligned countries against neo-colonialism and for their national and social development free from imperialist bondage. The countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America are no longer parts of the world which imperialism used\n. to consider as its own backyard. They now constitute, a world of independent sovereign States, representing a new dynamic factor in international relations. \n46.\tI have dwelt on these well-known facts in order to stress once more that the process of detente in the international political climate continues. However, in order that that process may be further strengthened and deepened and that it may be made all-embracing and irreversible, the efforts of all States are needed. Those efforts should be aimed first and foremost at eliminating the still-existing hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world.\n47.\tThe position of the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria with respect to the situation in the Middle East, in Viet Nam and in Korea is well known. I shall therefore confine myself to describing briefly how, in our opinion, the issues that are as yet unresolved should be settled.'\n48.\tIn the Middle East, it is necessary to put an end to the provocation by Israeli militaristic circles of the neighboring Arab countries and to resume without delay the work of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. Israel must withdraw its troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967. The legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine must be respected. The security, territorial integrity and sovereignty of all States in that part of the world must be guaranteed.\n49.\tIn Viet Nam, it is essential strictly to implement the Paris Agreement of 1973 on Viet Nam, to halt the provocative military actions of the Saigon regime, and to remove the discrimination against the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam.\n50.\tIn Korea, it is necessary to dissolve the so- called United Nations Command in Korea and to withdraw all foreign troops from South Korea. The General Assembly should adopt an appropriate resolution to that effect.\n51.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria, situated at the heart of the Balkan peninsula, has always attached and will continue to attach prime importance to the problems of peace, security and cooperation in that part of Europe. Our Government has made and is making a good many efforts to create an atmosphere of confidence and neighborly relations among the Balkan States and peoples. That is not a short-term policy. We have been pursuing that very policy consistently and unwaveringly for 30 years now. We are deeply convinced that it is in keeping with the interests and aspirations not only of the Bulgarian peQple but also of all the peoples living in the Balkan peninsula.\n52.\tIn this period a number of mutually advantageous agreements between Bulgaria and its neighbors have been signed, agreements aimed at closer cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, culture, science, sport and tourism. The prerequisites for a lasting political detente in the Balkans have gradually been created. However, a dangerous military conflict flared up in our region recently. The interference of certain NATO circles in Cyprus has created a situation which seriously threatens not only the territorial integrity and independence of that country but also peace and security in the Balkans and the world over. \n53.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria is following with attention and alarm the development of events in Cyprus. In accordance with its peaceful policy, the Bulgarian Government, immediately after the coup against the legitimate Government of Cyprus, reaffirmed its position: it advocates the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the island, to preserve the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and to allow the people the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots the right to settle their problems by themselves.\n54.\tThat position of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has also determined our support for the resolutions of the Security Council calling for a cease-fire in Cyprus, the withdrawal of foreign troops, the preservation of the island's independence and territorial integrity, and the restoration of constitutional order in the Republic of Cyprus. As is known, however, tension still persists in Cyprus and in the surrounding area. The threat of new complications and military conflicts, of overt or covert partition of the island, has not been removed. The attempts to resolve the Cyprus question within the narrow framework of the existing \\\"system of guarantees\\\" provided under the London-Zurich Agreements have met with failure.\n55.\tThat is why we support the proposal of the Soviet Union for the convening of an international conference within the framework of the United Nations to discuss the Cyprus problem.1 That proposal is in keeping with the spirit of the goals and principles of the Organization. It is precisely such a conference, with the participation of Greece, Turkey, Cyprus and the members of the Security Council and possibly,( some other States as well, that can perhaps find a solution that will ensure, on a genuine and lasting basis, the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus, which could best be guaranteed by the permanent members of the Security Council.\n56.\tOur position on the Cyprus question and also on relations among the Balkan States was again\n. stated clearly and unambiguously by the President of the State Council of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Todor Zhivkov, in his report on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the victory of the socialist revolution in our country. He stated:\n\\\"We insist that the sovereignty and independence of the friendly State of Cyprus be respected and most sincerely desire our neighbors Greece and Turkey to live in peace and understanding with each other and with independent Cyprus. More than once the peoples of the Balkan peninsula have served as cannon fodder for the interests of the imperialist States. Socialist Bulgaria is doing its best and will continue to do its best to achieve new relations in the Balkans and good-neighborly relations and co-operation in the interests of peace in the world.\\\"\n57.\tThe efforts of the Bulgarian Government concerning the correct settlement of the Cyprus question are prompted also by our desire to establish a lasting peace in the region of the eastern Mediterranean. As a Black Sea country, Bulgaria is naturally linked with that region. That explains our interest in all that is happening there. We are concerned about the existing network of NATO bases in the eastern Mediterranean, the carrying out of naval maneuvers by the Western States in immediate proximity to our frontiers, the existence of nuclear ammunition and so on. In accordance with our consistently peaceful policy, we want to see the Mediterranean turned into a sea of peace and international co-operation. That is why we welcome the proposal of the Soviet Union for the withdrawal from the Mediterranean of all United States and Soviet vessels and submarines equipped with nuclear weapons. The adoption of that proposal would be in the interest of peace in that part of the* world.\n58.\tIt has become urgent to use political detente for the practical solution of the problems of disarmament. Both processes, detente and disarmament alike, can and should be mutually complementary.\n59.\tGuided by that understanding, the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria attaches exclusive importance to the consideration of disarmament questions in all forums, particularly within the framework of the United Nations. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is prepared, within its means, to continue to contribute to their practical solution.\n60.\tIt is an indisputable fact that it is the Soviet Union which has been doing the most in this respect. The Soviet Government has introduced a number of proposals on the questions of disarmament in the United Nations. On its initiative a number of important international agreements have been worked out and concluded, such as the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex), the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction mi the Sea-Bed and the .Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof [resolution 2660 (XXV)}, and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI), annex],\n61.\tOn the proposal of the Soviet Union a new item, aimed at curbing the arms race, was included in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, namely, the item entitled \\\"Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well-being and health\\\" [item 103]. The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria supports this important initiative and considers that the conclusion of an international convention on this question will help to prevent the manufacturing of new means of warfare and will help to preserve the environment as well. \n62.\tIt was also on the initiative of the Soviet Union that a number of resolutions on questions related to disarmament have been adopted at previous sessions of the General Assembly, such as those on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)], the convening of a World Disarmament Conference [resolution 2833 (XXVI)], the reduction of military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)], and others. The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria unreservedly supports these initiatives and insists on their practical implementation as soon as possible.\n63.\tThe agreements signed between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States in the past three years have provided favorable conditions for reaching new concrete agreements within the United Nations in the field of disarmament. We are confident that, if efforts are made by all States in this direction, new and more significant successes can be achieved soon in the sphere of effective disarmament.\n64.\tWe are aware that the problems of disarmament are among the most complicated ones of the present day and that their practical solution runs into the stubborn resistance of the military-industrial complex and of other forces which are not interested in detente. But experience shows that if there is goodwill on the part of the Governments concerned, a solution of these problems also can be \\\"found. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that the lack of concrete results in the field of disarmament can undermine the advancing political detente and can lead to a new sharpening of the international situation, with many and more dangerous repercussions. That is why it is imperative for our Organization to keep these questions in the focus of its attention and to assist actively in the taking of steps aimed at curbing and halting the arms race and at achieving general and complete disarmament.\n65.\tThe positive changes in political relations among States create exclusively favorable conditions for expanding and furthering economic ties, for solving a number of economic problems of great importance to the whole world/ For its part, economic co-operation furnishes that material foundation which can strengthen confidence and understanding among peoples and can consolidate peace and security in the world. Life itself shows that raising and discussing the questions of development in isolation from the issues of ensuring lasting peace and co-operation is profitable only to those who try to preserve their privileged position in the present international division of labor.\n66.\tOne of the positive results of the sixth special session of the General Assembly is undoubtedly the recognition by the international community of the necessity to create a new structure of international economic relations which is to take into account the interests of all countries and particularly those of the developing countries. These problems affect the entire international community. Solving them cannot be the privilege of a group of States or of individual international organizations. That has to be done through - the equal participation of all countries.\n67.\tJust two weeks ago our people celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the victory of the socialist revolution in Bulgaria. In the course of three decades our homeland, which before that had been a classical example of a backward country, has turned into an all-round developed, prosperous socialist State with a rapidly developing economy, scientific capacity, technology and culture. In the past thirty years radical structural changes have been carried out in the economy, such as an agrarian reform and collectivization of the land, and nationalization of the means of production and of all natural resources, as well as of foreign capital. The country's internal resources have been harnessed. The working class, co-operative farmers and the people's intelligentsia have worked self-denyingly to build the new life. The Bulgarian Communist Party, which is the leading force in our society, has carried out immense organizational and political activities. These achievements are also the result of fraternal mutual assistance and close co-operation with the other countries of the socialist community, and first of all with the Soviet Union.\n68.\tThe victory of the, socialist revolution radically changed both the placQ and the role of our country in international relations. The People's Republic of Bulgaria has established itself as an inseparable part of the socialist community. Its foreign policy is inspired by the ideas of peace and friendship among nations. Its task is to assist the development of all- round co-operation among all countries and nations.\n69.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria notes with satisfaction that the United Nations is making its significant contribution to the development of positive changes in the world, that its prestige is growing and that the part which this Organization, and the Security Council in particular, can play in ensuring lasting peace and security is becoming a tangible one.\n70.\tAn analysis of the events of the past few years shows unequivocally that the efforts aimed at achieving a solution of the major problems of the present-day world can be successful and can lead to lasting results only when the search for a solution in conducted on the basis of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Any departure from these principles has always led to complications and has seriously hampered the efforts of peace-loving forces to achieve a just settlement of the disputes and conflicts that have arisen. All this eloquently shows once more the vital force of the principles of the Charter as well as the necessity to step up the efforts of the Organization to create conditions for their strict observance.\n71.\tWe are profoundly convinced that the present twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will be able to adopt such decisions on the main items of the agenda, decisions that will represent a new contribution to the strengthening and expansion of the positive changes that are now taking place in contemporary international life.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I thank you for calling upon me at this late hour when the prospect of lunch must be so much more alluring than the thought of another indigestible speech. I can only undertake that I shall not be over-long or take too much of your time.\n203.\tI must, however, begin by offering the congratulations of the United Kingdom to you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the Assembly, especially as your country has played such a large and important role in the work of the Organization, and we are all looking forward to a period of constructive work under your guidance.\n204.\tLike others who have spoken, we also welcome two new Members from the Commonwealth \u2014Bangladesh and Grenada as well as Guinea- Bissau, the latest country to achieve its independence.\n205.\tThis is the first time I have had the honor of addressing the Assembly and I regret it will not be possible for me to stay after lunchtime. I must invoke the newcomer's privilege of making some remarks, with your permission, about our hopes and aspirations for this Organization.\n206.\tI start by giving an assurance that it is the firm policy of my Government to give all possible support to the United Nations. We do so because we believe that this body is the best forum in which to come to grips with many of the daunting problems that face mankind.\n207.\tIt should not need an energy crisis, a population crisis, a raw-material crisis, to tell us that the world is shrinking and making us more interdependent. These are by now the cliches of our perorations; we no longer need to prove the point. Yet when action is needed we still do not behave as though we believe it. To say this implies no criticism of this Organization itself.\n208.\tToo often we use the United Nations as a whipping-boy for our own inability to act in concert in response to a common problem. The weaknesses in international co-operation which exist today are not United Nations weaknesses. The responsibility rests with us, the Member nations, that have willed that the United Nations should work on the basis of the lowest common denominator of agreement between the Member States. This negative consensus for that is what it is sometimes means little more than a wafer-thin formula to paper over our differences without any real meeting of minds. Such a consensus cannot be construed as universal approval. Indeed, because it happens in this way, there are occasions when the words in which we express this negative consensus have no chance of being translated into action because the action proposed does not correspond with realities. \n209.\tWhat we need in order to be able to act together is positive consensus: a determined effort to reach common ground and an equal determination to work together to overcome the political and economic threats to our peoples.\n210.\tI do not underestimate the difficulties. Our interests are as varied as the nations we represent. But in the past, diverse nations have successfully sunk their differences and combined to face a common enemy. We face common enemies today: inflation, recession and poverty. Let us unite to defeat them.\n211.\tBut if we are to achieve this positive consensus for which I ask, we need not only sound policies; we need the attitude of mind expressed by the then Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Willy Brandt, when he spoke to this Assembly at the twenty-eighth session and said:\n\\\".. .we have not come here to use the United Nations as a wailing-wall ... or to make claims we know cannot be met here in any case, Rather have we come to assume our share in the responsibility for world affairs on the basis of our convictions and within the framework of our possibilities\\\" [2128th meeting, para. 6],\nIt is in that spirit that the United Kingdom Government is determined to bring to this Assembly the political will to make a responsible contribution to solving the problems before us. This will be the evidence of our pledge of support.\n212.\tBefore I came here I took the precaution of reading the deliberations of the preceding session of the General Assembly. In many speeches then as indeed is the case of speeches on this occasion the recurring theme was the progress of detente. Mr. Kissinger referred then [2124th meeting] to a commonality of interests between the United States and the Soviet Union in establishing a broad, web of constructive relationships. Mr. Gromyko said [2126th meeting] and he referred to it again today that we had achieved a shift from an extended period of tension in the world to business-like co-operation. He knows and the Soviet Union knows that since I assumed my present office it has been my firm desire that the United Kingdom should play a full and positive part in fostering such \\\"business-like co-operation\\\" in our bilateral contacts.\n213.\tOn the level of multilateral negotiations, the talks in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and about mutual and balanced force reductions have been moving, to put it politely, at a very slow pace. I hope we can shift both sets of talks into a higher gear so that we can report some positive results before this Assembly meets next.\n214.\tThe talks in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in particular are given sufficient good will and understanding for the concerns and interests of all the participants ripe for an early conclusion. We have always recognized that the talks on mutual and balanced force reductions would be much more complex and long-term. But our aim in both sets of negotiations should be the same, to achieve in Europe an order which would allow our people to live in security and co-operation and at the same time reduce the crippling burden of arms spending.\n215.\tIt would be a triumph indeed if Europe, which too often in this century has been the center of inhumanity and senseless conflict, could set the pattern for a new order of international relations free of war and the threat of war. Fortunately, it is some years since the threat of war between East and West was a major preoccupation of the United Nations; but the complex of new and interrelated problems are in their different ways as serious a threat to us all.\n216.\tThis transfer of our attention has, of course, been brought about by massive and unprecedented increases in the price of oil. On the surface but only on the surface it might appear that there is a. natural difference of interest between those countries which would like to see oil prices reduced and those which wish to keep them at their present levels or indeed to increase them. That is not so. It is in the interests of both producer and consumer alike that the prices of commodities and of manufactured goods should not chase each other upwards in a never ending spiral.\n217.\tIn the meantime, even if, as we hope, prices will not remain at their present peak, we have to face the problem of how to adapt the world's monetary and economic systems to accommodate the vast oil revenues now accruing to certain countries some of which cannot immediately absorb them.\n218.\tThe objective is clear and quite straightforward. It is to marry the revenue of the oil-producing countries with the' technology of the developed countries, so that the increased production and world trade which would result from such a marriage would be used primarily to benefit the developing countries of the world which need them most. Our knowledge of international monetary mechanisms is sufficiently advanced to enable us to do this and to do it in a way that would be fair both to the oil-producing countries themselves and to those that need the resources. New techniques will be required, but it is by no means impossible to create them if there is the political will and an understanding of the problem.\n219.\tThe unprecedented world-wide economic boom of recent years led to higher commodity prices prior to the recent increases in world oil prices. In turn these higher prices for raw materials found their way into the price of manufactured goods, and the resulting inflation coincided with a period in which the Bretton Woods system for controlling international monetary relationships fell into disarray. Collective action is now urgent if we are to ensure that the large surplus oil funds are used constructively to maintain demand and the level of world trade, because inevitably the surpluses of the oil producers are matched by deficits on the part of the consumers.\n220.\tIn our view it will be an error which will have global consequences if the oil consumers try individually to eliminate their oil-induced deficits in advance of international agreement on the disposal and investment of the oil producers. That way lies general recession, increasing poverty and social unrest The surplus must be taken into account. \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, first of all, I should like to congratulate you on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly and I am confident that you will preside well and make positive contributions to the current session.\n86.\tNew and important victories have been won by the people of all countries in their struggle against colonialism, imperialism and hegemonism since the start of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly last year. The numerous third world countries have become the main force in the revolutionary struggle against the two hegemonic Powers. More and more people have seen through the so called detente played up by the superPowers. All the basic contradictions in the world are further sharpening, particularly the contradiction between the two superPowers on the one hand and the people of all countries on the other and the contradiction between, the two superPowers themselves. It is now evident to all that the world today is amidst more intense turbulence and unrest.\n87.\tWhat should be noted here first is the great October war in the Middle East. The heroic people of Egypt, Syria, Palestine and other Arab countries, in defiance of superPower obstruction and disruption, boldly took up arms and successfully rebuffed Israeli Zionist aggression. This fight exploded the myth of Israeli \\\"invincibility\\\", upset the state of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" imposed by the superPowers and demonstrated the might of the united struggle of the Arab people.\n88.\tIn this Middle East war, the Arab countries used oil as a weapon to deal a heavy blow at Zionism and hegemonism. This was a historic, pioneering action. Its impact far exceeds the scope of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle. It has opened up a new dimension for the third world's struggle in defense of national resources against imperialist plunder and exploitation.\n89.\tThe African people's struggle for national liberation has made great progress. Portugal is one of the oldest colonial empires. The downfall of the former Fascist regime in Portugal is a victory for the African people, who have persevered in a long armed struggle, as well as for the Portuguese people, who have persistently opposed the reactionary colonial war.\n90.\tThe peoples of IndoChina have steadily achieved new successes in their struggle against United States aggression and for national liberation. The VietNamese people have carried on an unremitting struggle for the strict implementation of the Paris Agreement of 27 January 1973 and against the Nguyen Van Thieu clique's violations of the Agreement. In Laos, the Provisional Government of National Union has been formed. The Cambodian people have grown ever stronger in their fight against the traitorous Lon Nol clique. The struggle of the Korean people for the independent and peaceful reunification of their fatherland has won ever wider support. There is a growing tendency among the SouthEast Asian countries to free themselves from superPower interference and contention.\n91.\tThe struggle of the Latin American peoples against hegemonism and in defense of their State sovereignty, independence and national economic rights and interests has continued to surge forward. Those peoples initiated the struggle fair the zone of exercise of their maritime rights of 200 nautical miles, which has become the common demand of the great majority of nations.\n92.\tThe Asian, African and Latin American peoples have supported each other in struggle, and they have become ever more keenly aware that unity is strength. At various conferences, they have strongly denounced colonialism, racism, Zionism, imperialism and hegemonism. Their just struggles and those of the people of other countries, supporting and complementing each other, are pounding away at the old international order, which the superPowers vainly attempt to maintain.\n93.\tIn the past year, the contention between the two superPowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, for spheres of influence and world hegemony has become more intense. This is a fact which no agree menu between them can cover up. The Soviet leadership has lauded these agreements to the skies, as if the mere conclusion of agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union would bring detente to the whole world and usher in a \\\"new stage of history\\\", namely, a \\\"world without war\\\". \\\"Detente\\\" has become a kind of quack medicine hawked by the Soviet leadership everywhere. But none of us will forget that it was after the reaching of a stack of agreements at the second United StatesSoviet talks that the Middle East war broke out, and that it was after the reaching of more agreements at the third United StatesSoviet talks that the Cyprus events occurred.\nSo then, where is the \\\"detente\\\"? Has not there been ample manifestation of the contention between the two superPowers during the Middle East war and the Cyprus events?\n94.\tTo keep a \\\"balance of power\\\" the United States and the Soviet Union reached certain agreements on \\\"strategic arms limitation\\\". But is has become more evident since their third summit talks that, at bottom, these agreements serve the purpose of bigger and more intensified contention. As far as balance is concerned, it has always been relative and temporary whether in nature or in human society, while imbalance is absolute and constant. In the real life of today, there is in fact no \\\"balance of power\\\" between the two superPowers. Instead, each side is desperately trying to outstrip and overwhelm the other, and the wildest arms race is on. No wonder the superPower with the label of \\\"socialism\\\" has, of late, arrogantly boasted that it is \\\"on a historic offensive along the entire front of the global confrontation\\\", and that the pace of its advance is \\\"rapid\\\".\n95.\tLenin pointed out: \\\"The content of imperialist politics is 'world domination' and the continuation of this politics is imperialist war.\\\" So long as imperialism and social imperialism exist, there will be the danger of war, and genuine detente or \\\"lasting peace\\\" will be impossible. Today, the danger of war comes from the superPowers. One superPower is trying by hook or by crook to carry out infiltration and expansion abroad and squeeze into the other superPower's spheres of influence in Europe and other parts of the world in order to supersede that superPower and realize its own wild ambition of world domination. With this fierce contention between the superPowers going on as it is, eventually either the superPowers will go to war against each other or the people will rise in revolution; either the war will give rise to revolution, or revolution will prevent the war. As Chairman Mao Tsetung has said: \\\"The danger of a new world war still exists, and the people of all countries must get prepared. But revolution is the main trend in the world today.\\\"\n96.\tBy stepping up their contention for world hegemony, the two superPowers are bound to hasten the process of their turning into their own opposites. Nowadays, not only have the third world countries risen one after another in revolt against them, but the second world countries in between the superPowers and the third world have also stood up to resist in various ways control and bullying by the superPowers. Beset by troubles at home and abroad, both superPowers are having a very tough' time. One superPower has already overstretched itself and is in a dilemma, unable to attend to all its troubles at the same time. The other superPower is in an even worse predicament. It has wild ambitions but lacks strength, and its difficulties abound. They are both in the plight described by the Chinese verse: \\\"Flowers fall off, do what one may.\\\" Overestimation of the strength of the superPowers does not square with the facts. In the final analysis, it is not the one or two superPowers but the people of the world in their thousands of millions who determine the destiny of the world.\n97.\tThe Chinese delegation would now like to state its views on a number of questions confronting the General Assembly at its current session. First, we\nwould like to state our views on Africa's fight against colonialism.\n98.\tChina consistently supports the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples and considers this to be her bounden internationalist duty. In Africa, we firmly support the peoples of Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Azania and other regions in their just struggle against colonialism and racism. We hail the birth of the Republic of GuineaBissau and warmly welcome its admission to the United Nations. We firmly demand that Spain terminate its colonial domination in Spanish Sahara and sincerely hope that the Arab countries concerned will work together with the people of Spanish Sahara to seek a reasonable solution to the existing questions of this region through friendly consultations on the basis of unity against colonialism.\n99.\tWe hold that the colonial peoples can win national liberation only by relying mainly on their own efforts to wage a tit for tat struggle against colonialism. Moribund colonialism relies on armed force to carry on its deathbed struggle, and it will never step down from the stage of history unless it is defeated by the armed struggle of the colonial peoples. Both the birth of the Republic of GuineaBissau and the more recent agreement on the independence of Mozambique are in essence the result of the long and persistent armed struggle of the people of GuineaBissau and Mozambique, and are by no means favors bestowed by colonialism.\n100.\tThe downfall of the former Fascist regime in Portugal, which persisted in the colonial war, is, of course, an important event. But this development in no way implies that Portugal will bring independence to the colonial peoples on a silver platter. Recently, under the pressure of the people, the new Portuguese Government had to recognize the right to independence of the peoples in the Portuguese colonies. This is a manifestation of the general trend. But it is yet to be seen whether the new Portuguese Government will suit its actions to its words. Even when that Government has reached an agreement with a colony, it remains to be seen whether the agreement will truly by implemented. The declaration of the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] adopted at the eleventh ordinary session points out that, if Portugal does not take a clear position on the right to total independence of its colonies in Africa, there will be no other way but pursuit and intensification of the struggle for national liberation.\n101.\tWe warmly endorse this correct stand. According to our experience in China, all reactionaries habitually use counterrevolutionary dual tactics, and we must use revolutionary dual tactics to deal with them. Armed struggle is fundamental, but negotiations are not excluded. Sometimes negotiating is tit for tat; and sometimes not negotiating is also tit for tat. Even in negotiations one must base oneself on fighting. In the course of negotiations, the fundamental interests of the people must be protected. The armed forces of the people must be strengthened, and not weakened.\n102.\tMoreover, it must be pointed out that while old line colonialisms have not died out, neo colonial isms of various descriptions, including the neo colonialism flaunting the banner of socialism are stepping up their infiltration. These neocolonialisms are sowing discord among African countries and within the national liberation movements to split and demoralize them in a vain attempt to supplant old line colonialisms and control the regions concerned. Sharp vigilance should be maintained against this. The future of the African liberation struggle is bright, but the road ahead remains tortuous. We believe that the great and increasingly awakening African people, strengthening their unity and persevering in a long struggle, will certainly surmount all difficulties and triumph in the end.\n103.\tSecond, on the Mi 'die East question, we wish to say the following.\n104.\tThe Arab people brought about an excellent situation through fighting the October war. This war has strengthened the confidence of the Arab people in victory over the Israeli aggressor and broken the stalemate that was deliberately created by the superPowers. Now, a disengagement has been effected between Egypt and Israel and between Syria and Israel, but the Middle East question is still far from being settled.\n105.\tThe essence of the Middle East question lies in Israeli Zionist aggression and the contention between the two superPowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, for hegemony in the Middle East versus the struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples against aggression and hegemony.\n106.\tThe Chinese Government and people always support the just struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples. From the very beginning, we have refused to have any contact with the Israeli Zionists, who persist in aggression. We have firmly opposed the contention between the two superPowers in the Middle East and opposed their support of and connivance with Israel, and we have constantly exposed the truth that social imperialism is giving sham support while actually attempting to control the Palestinian and other Arab peoples.\n107.\tIt is well known that the United Nations has held innumerable discussions on the Palestine question and adopted countless resolutions thereon, of which the one referred to most often is Security Council resolution 242 (1967). All these resolutions have the common feature of twisting the question of the restoration of the Palestinian.people's national rights into a so called \\\"question of refugees\\\". This is a gross injustice. We have always opposed it and will continue to oppose it.\n108.\tNow, the Arab countries have proposed the discussion of the question of Palestinian national rights at the General Assembly session, so that all countries may hear directly the voices of the millions of Palestinian people and the 100 million Arab people and so that more countries may understand and support their just position. This is entirely necessary.\n109.\tThe restoration of Palestinian national rights and the recovery of the lost Arab territories form a struggle that is an integral whole. There can be no settlement of the Middle East question so long as the lost Arab territories are not recovered and Palestinian national rights are not restored. Whatever maneuvers they may engage in, the two superPowers will never succeed in their attempt to sacrifice the Palestinian national rights and undermine the militant unity of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples.\n110.\tWe hope that the United Nations will rectify its longstanding unjust attitude on the Palestine question, recognize the Palestinian people's national rights and support their restoration. But historical experience merits attention. No unrealistic hopes should be pinned on United Nations resolutions. In the final analysis, the Arab countries can recover their lost territories and the Palestinian people can regain their national rights only by relying on their own close unity and unremitting struggle, with the support of the peoples of the whole world.\n111.\tThird, our views on the question of Cyprus are as follows.\n112.\tThe question of Cyprus is a legacy of imperialist colonial rule. The internal cause of the recent eruption in Cyprus is the lack of a satisfactory solution to the question between the two communities on the island; and its external cause is the attempt of each of the two superPowers to put this island of strategic importance under its own influence and control.\n113.\tOne superPower stirred up trouble by pulling wires behind the scenes. The other superPower, pretending to \\\"uphold\\\" the independence of Cyprus and feeling anxious, like an ant on a hot pan, issued one government statement after another, supporting one side one day and the other side the other, sowing discord and fanning the flames of trouble. Racking its brains for ingenious devices, it turned up with proposals, first for the sending of a \\\"United Nations special mission\\\" and then for the convening of an international conference with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Anyone with a discerning eye will see that its \\\"mischievous\\\" actions serve neither the interests of the independence of Cyprus nor the interests of the Greek and Turkish communities or the countries directly related to these communities, but are aimed at meddling in the Cyprus question and further squeezing into the eastern Mediterranean. In quest of hegemony in the Mediterranean, it has redoubled its efforts to threaten, cajole, subvert and undermine the Balkan countries, causing their grave uneasiness and aggravating tension in this region.\n114.\tWe hold that the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus must be respected. We hope that a reasonable solution will be found so that the Greek and Turkish communities can live together in equality and harmony. Cyprus, Turkey and Greece are all friends of China. We have all suffered from imperialist tactics of sowing discord and divide and rule. As for the questions left over from history, we believe that they will not be difficult to resolve so long as the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus and the countries concerned seek to do so by peaceful means and through patient consultations. We should be constantly on guard against superPower meddling and intervention.\n115.\tFourth, on the questions of the South Asian subcontinent and nuclear free zones, we hold the following views.\n116.\tThe dismemberment of Pakistan by India with the backing of the Soviet Union gave rise to turbulence and unrest on the South Asian subcontinent. Great efforts have been made by the Government of Pakistan to promote a normalization of relations between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. By April this year, the Indian Government had finally implemented in full the resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council of 1971 on the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the withdrawal of troops and the repatriation of prisoners. This ought to have created favorable conditions for the relaxation of the situation on the South Asian subcontinent. But a new wave arose when the previous one had barely subsided. In May, India exploded a nuclear device allegedly for peaceful purposes. In June, the Indian Government imposed on the people of Sikkim the so called \\\"Government of Sikkim Bill\\\", which it had concocted singlehandedly. And, more recently, the Indian Parliament adopted a constitutional amendment, making Sikkim a so called \\\"associate state\\\" of India. To put it bluntly, this is the annexation of Sikkim. It is another naked act of expansionism perpetrated by the Indian Government after dismembering Pakistan by armed force.\n117.\tThe Indian Government's annexation of Sikkim has aroused the opposition of the Sikkimese people as well as the Indian people and met with condemnation by India's neighbors and world public opinion. The Soviet propaganda organs, alone, sing the praises of India. This shows that Soviet revisionist social imperialism is the boss behind the scenes of Indian expansionism.\n118.\tThe Soviet Union is unscrupulous in its efforts to interfere in, subvert, divide and control the South Asian countries. It is conspiring to engineer another dismemberment of Pakistan. It dreams of opening a corridor to the Indian Ocean to serve its interests in its contention with the other superPower for hegemony in the South Asian subcontinent and the Indian Ocean. The two superPowers are competing with each other in setting up military bases in the Indian Ocean, some of which are overt bases while others are covert ones, nominally for civilian, but actually for military, use. The turbulent situation in South Asia and the Indian Ocean calls for vigilance.\n119.\tThe turbulence and unrest in South Asia totally contradict the desire for peace of the peoples of all countries in this region. The proposal put forward by Pakistan for the establishment of a nuclear free zone in South Asia [AI9706] is entirely, reasonable. China gives it her firm support. We also firmly support the proposal of Iran and Egypt for the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East [AI9693 and Add./J]. China is a nuclear country, although her nuclear weapons are still in the experimental stage. We are developing nuclear weapons for defense and for breaking the nuclear monopoly and ultimately destroying the .nuclear weapons. The Chinese Government has solemnly declared on many occasions that at no time and in no circumstances will China be the first to use nuclear weapons. It consistently holds that the nuclear countries should undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear countries or nuclear free zones. We are ready to make such an undertaking in regard to the proposed nuclear free zones in South Asia and the Middle East. We hope that all the other nuclear countries will do the same.\n120.\tFifth, I turn to the questions of Cambodia and IndoChina.\n121.\tIn the past year, the Cambodian people have continued to win new victories in their war against United States aggression and for national salvation. The People's Armed Forces of National Liberation of Cambodia launched sustained offensives on all fronts and kept annihilating the effective strength of the enemy. The liberated zone is expanding and becoming ever more consolidated. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, head of State of Cambodia, is the Cambodian people's sole lawful Government. It has been recognized by more than 60 countries, and its friendly relations with third world countries are developing steadily. It enjoys a high international prestige. After the tour of Prince Sihanouk, Deputy Prime Minister Khieu Samphan visited many countries in Asia, Africa and Europe this year. They were both accorded a warm welcome in the countries they visited. The just struggle of the Cambodian people has won support on an ever wider scale from people all over the world.\n122.\tThe traitorous Lon Nol clique is a handful of national scum repudiated by the people of Cambodia. This clique is rent by disunity and beset with numerous contradictions. In the areas under its rule, the economic situation is deteriorating and mass movements are raging like a storm. It is in a dire plight. Of late, it has advanced a proposal for socalled \\\"peace negotiations\\\", attempting to achieve a demagogic effect. We all know that the key to restoring peace in Cambodia lies :n the cessation of United States aggression and interference in Cambodia. So, the purpose of that socalled proposal is simply to cover up the fact of United States aggression and interference in Cambodia and prolong the moribund life of the Lon Nol clique. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia has already opposed and rejected that proposal. The Chinese Government resolutely supports the solemn and just stand of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia.\n123.\tIt is utterly illegal for the Lon Nol clique to usurp Cambodia's seat in the United Nations. Last year, some people used procedural tactics to postpone for a year the discussion on the question of restoring the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia. That was wholly unjustifiable. The Chinese Government firmly maintains that this session of the General Assembly should adopt a resolution to immediately expel the representatives of the traitorous Lon Nol clique and restore to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia its rightful seat.\n124.\tMore than one year has elapsed since the signing of the Agreement on ending the war in Viet Nam, but peace has not yet been restored in South Viet Nam. The Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam has worked tirelessly for the strict implementation of the Paris Agreement. But its efforts have met with obstruction and sabotage from the Saigon administration. Relying on massive United States military aid, the Saigon administration refuses to implement important provisions of the Paris Agreement, with the result that the situation in South Viet Nam has thus far remained tense. We demand that the United States Government strictly comply with the Paris Agreement and stop its involvement and interference in South Viet Nam, so that peace can really be restored in Viet Nam.\n125.\tThe Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam is the authentic representative of the South Viet-Namese people. The Paris Agreement recognizes the fact that there exist two administrations in South Viet Nam, namely, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam and the Saigon administration. It is unreasonable that the United Nations should accept only the observer of one side, that is, the Saigon administration. To rectify this irrationality, we hold that the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam should be invited to send its observer to the United Nations.\n126.\tSixth, with regard to the Korean question, our views are as follows.\n127.\tThe General Assembly at its last session reached a consensus on the Korean question, confirmed the three principles of Korea's independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity and decided to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea.1 This was a welcome development.\n128.\tThe facts over the past year show that the United Nations should not rest content with the progress made but should continue to go forward. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made many efforts to push ahead the north south dialog and promote the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. But all these efforts have been unreasonably rejected by the South Korean authorities. The proposals on minor issues advanced by the South Korean authorities are wholly aimed at covering up their unwillingness to conduct negotiations on the fundamental question of reunifying the north and the south. What they really want is division, not reunification. On the pretext of a so called threat from the north, the South Korean authorities have taken a series of \\\"emergency measures\\\", depriving the South Korean people of all basic democratic rights. They have arrested, tried, imprisoned or murdered large numbers of people of various strata who call for democracy, freedom and peaceful reunification, ranging from young students and professors to political figures. Even people like former President Yoon Bo Sun and Catholic Bishop Chi Hak Soun have not escaped such persecution. Before the case of kidnapping Kim Dae Jung is closed, the South Korean authorities have already gone ahead with more sinister actions. Today, South Korea is in fact under the reign of terror of a Fascist dictator. It is mainly because they have the backing of United States troops that the South Korean authorities dare so feverishly to repress the people and sabotage the north south dialog. In order to eliminate outside interference in Korea and promote the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, the withdrawal of foreign forces from South Korea is entirely necessary.\n129.\tIn paragraph 2 (c) of the explanatory memorandum attached to the request for the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty ninth session of an additional item on the question of Korea, which was submitted by the United States and other countries [see A/9741 and Add. 15], it is asserted that the United States troops under the United Nations flag have not interfered in the internal affairs of the host country. This makes a mockery of common sense. Does not the presence of tens of thousands of United States troops serve to embolden the South Korean rulers, to say the least? The consensus of the last session of the General Assembly affirmed that the reunification of North and South Korea should be achieved by peaceful means without interference by outside force. As a logical consequence of affirming this principle, the foreign troops under the United Nations flag should be withdrawn from South Korea. As for the statement contained in the draft resolution annexed to the explanatory memorandum that \\\"tension in Korea has not been totally eliminated\\\", well, to put it bluntly, this is another way of referring to the so called threat from the north, which is a myth that has long been exploded. By now even that neighboring country which has all along supported South Korea no longer believes in this myth. The assertion that the \\\"United Nations Command\\\" cannot be withdrawn because of the existence of this \\\"threat\\\" is sheer deception.\n130.\tThe Chinese delegation is firmly against that draft resolution. It strongly maintains that the current session of the General Assembly should discuss and adopt the draft resolution submitted by Algeria and other countries for the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations [see Al9703/Add.3].\n131.\tSeventh, the Chinese delegation's views on the question of disarmament are the following.\n132.\tIt is quite understandable that disarmament is a matter of concern to people when the arms race, and especially the nuclear arms race, between the two superPowers has become more intense and glaring. But hopes are one thing, reality another. For instance, we all talked about disarmament here a year ago. Now, after a year has passed, have the armaments accumulated by the two superPowers decreased, or have they increased? In our view, they have increased. Is the danger of war greater or less than last year? In our view, at least one cannot say it is less.\n133.\tWhy is this so? First, because the two superPowers are fiercely contending with each other on a global scale. And their arms expansion and war preparations serve their policy of hegemonism. Secondly, because the superPowers, when faced with increasingly acute economic troubles, inevitably turn to the further militarization of the national economy as the way out. In this regard, the present situation resembles that of the 1930s in many ways.\n134.\tDisarmament is an old issue, and China's views on it are well known. We are in favor of disarmament. But we favor genuine and not sham disarmament, still less empty talk about disarmament coupled with actual arms expansion year after year. Some say that to hold a disarmament conference is better than none. We understand this well intentioned desire. But we consider that, when the arms race between the two superPowers, which directly threatens the people of the world, is being stepped up, and when the superPower with the label of \\\"socialism\\\" is actually bent on using empty talk at a disarmament conference as a cover for its arms expansion and war preparations, the convening of a nominal disarmament conference or its preparatory meeting will only pro* duce the effect of lulling the people of the world.\n135.\tThe Chinese Government is in favor of holding a genuine world disarmament conference. But the conference must have a clear aim and the necessary preconditions. The clear aim is the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and absolutely not the so called limitation of strategic arms. The necessary preconditions are: all nuclear countries, and particularly the two nuclear superPowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, must first of all undertake the unequivocal obligation that at no time and in no circumstances will they be the first to use nuclear weapons, particularly against nonnuclear countries and nuclear free zones for example, the Soviet Union should, first of all, undertake obligations in respect of the nuclear free zone in Latin America and they must withdraw from abroad alt their armed forces, including nuclear missile forces, and dismantle all their military bases, including nuclear bases, on the territories of other countries. Only thus will it be possible for all countries, big and small, on an equal footing, to discuss with equanimity and resolve the question of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and other questions, free from any threat of force.\n136.\tIn the absence of a reduction of the armaments of the two superPowers, what should the numerous small and medium countries do in the face of their threat? In our opinion, the small and medium countries should strive to strengthen their necessary and independent defense capabilities in the light of specific conditions. This is a fundamental and reliable abroad.\n13>. As expected, the Soviet Government, which comes up with some novelties each year, has put forward this year an item entitled \\\"Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well being and health\\\" [item 103J. The letter requesting the inclusion of this item as an important and urgent matter in the agenda of this session [A 19702] is so obscurely worded that one cannot make out its real meaning. We would rather wait till the Soviet representative explains the matter in clear and simple language before acting whether it deserves some comment,\n138. Eighth, the Chinese delegation would like to state the following views on the question of defending State sovereignty and national economic rights and interests.\n139* Inspired by the victorious struggle which the Arab countries and people waged with oil as a weapon, the third world countries have started an immense tide of struggle to defend their State sovereignty, control their national resources, develop their national economy and oppose exploitation and plunder by imperialism, and particularly that of the superPowers. Through the efforts of numerous small and medium steed countries from all parts of the world, the General Assembly at its sixth special session finally adopted the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a Hew International Economic\nOrder. This was a significant victory for the united struggle of the third world countries. It marks a new trend in the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism, and particularly against hegemonism, a trend of deepening this struggle by carrying it into the economic field.\n140.\tSince the sixth special session, the developing countries have strongly demanded the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration and the Program of Action and the continued transformation of the old international economic relations based on exploitation and plunder. More and mote developing countries are taking bold action to control their national resources and the production and pricing of their raw materials. They have further united themselves in various raw material producers' organizations to strive to break superPower manipulation and monopoly. An important part of this struggle of the third world is the work of formulating the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, initiated by the President of Mexico.\n141.\tBut the superPowers have done their utmost to belittle or deny the great significance of the Declaration and the Program of Action and tried by all means to obstruct the realization of the just demands of the third world. One superPower openly declared its disagreement with certain principal paragraphs in the two documents and obstinately refused to implement their provisions. The other superPower has set in motion its propaganda machine to vilify the Declaration and the Program of Action as showing \\\"regionalism\\\" and \\\"economism\\\", \\\"reflecting group interests\\\", and so on and so forth. This fully shows that both superPowers want to preserve the old order of exploitation and plunder.\n142.\tSome people say that the current economic difficulties are caused by the increase in oil price. This is a specious statement. In the final analysis, the present economic difficulties are the inevitable outcome of the imperialist system; they are not due to increase in the prices of raw materials, still less to any alleged misdeeds on the part of the oil producing countries. Those people are daily spreading the idea that Arab and other oil producing countries have reaped a windfall of tens of billions of United States dollars through the oil price rise. But they forget that the international monopoly capital has reaped an immeasurably greater amount of super profits through long years of plunder and exploitation and through the forcing down of the prices of oil and other raw materials. Ever since the emergence of colonialism and then imperialism, the parity between the prices of raw materials and industrial goods on the world market has always been unfair. Particularly in times of economic crises, the colonialists and imperialists invariably use every possible means, including the forcing down of the prices of raw materials, to shift the grave consequences of economic crises on to the broad masses in the colonies and semi colons, i.e., the developing countries of today. The imperialists regard this state of affair* **s normal and reasonable, and even as sacred and inviolable. Now, this sacred and inviolable state of affairs is being violated. To fly into a rage is futile. To bluff is also f 'tile. The profound significance of the oil battle lieu in the fact that the developing countries have united themselves and independently exercised control over their national resources and fought against plunder, exploitation and the shifting of crises on to them. Of course, higher oil prices have caused non oil producing countries of the third world some temporary difficulties. Ways should be sought to resolve these difficulties, but this struggle and its great historic significance must not be negated on this account.\n143.\tCombating maritime hegemonism and formulating a new law of the sea is an important aspect of the struggle of the developing countries to safeguard state sovereignty and develop their national economy. At the recent Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held in Caracas, the great majority of the developing countries were for the establishment of an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles. Driven by circumstances, the two superPowers ostensibly gave up their opposition an attitude in which they had persisted all along. But, as if by agreement, they both raised a number of preconditions and restrictions under the name of a \\\"package deal\\\". The substance of these preconditions and restrictions is insistence on \\\"freedom of passage\\\" through straits within territorial seas and on \\\"freedom of fishing\\\" and \\\"freedom of scientific research\\\" in the exclusive economic zones. Nominally they have accepted a 200 nautical mile economic zone, but actually they want to emasculate the exclusive economic zone so that it will be devoid of any concrete substance and the developing countries will be left with nothing whatsoever. To put it bluntly, the \\\"freedoms\\\" demanded by the superPowers are their freedom to plunder the developing countries and their freedom to pursue hegemonism.\n144.\tIn particular, the super Power which claims to be \\\"the natural ally of the developing countries\\\" has put on an even more wonderful show. Assuming a compassionate tone, it exclaimed that international trade and security would be impaired if freedom of passage through straits within territorial seas should be denied, and that if it was not allowed to go fishing iii the exclusive economic zone, the fish there would die uselessly. You see, how kindhearted it is. In fact, these are but crocodile tears, which cannot disguise its vicious super features.\n145.\tIt is a serious struggle to defend State sovereignty, control national resources, develop national economy and combat superPower plunder and exploitation. The super Powers have bound to put up a desperate fight, but it will be of no avail. At the sixth special session of the General Assembly and the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at Caracas, numerous developing countries came forward to expose and condemn the superPowers and resolutely called for smashing the old international order and taking their destiny into their own hands. This is a thing that has never happened before. The superPowers have never been so isolated. The situation is excellent. We are confident that the numerous developing countries, closing their ranks, allying with all forces that can be allied with and persevering in struggle, will surely continue to win new victories.\n146.\tInternational developments show that the world has changed enormously and profoundly. Countries want independence, nations want liberation, and the people want revolution this torrential tide is sweeping into every corner of the earth. Storms have broken out even in places that have been rather quiet for decades. The world situation at present is indeed aptly described by the verse, \\\"The wind sweeping through the tower heralds a rising storm in the mountains.\\\" And this wind is gathering momentum. At such a juncture , it is our hope that this session of the General Assembly will do some useful things to advance the cause of human progress. The Chinese delegation is ready to work with all of you toward this end.\n"

        "file_text": "Taking the floor for the first time before this Assembly, I should like first of all to reaffirm unequivocally that the nation of Upper Volta has with determination, side by side with all nations represented here, assumed unfailingly the common responsibilities incumbent upon us all not only to free humanity from the specter of war, but also to ensure for future generations a universe of justice and prosperity.\n23.\tBut permit me first, Mr. President, to associate myself whole-heartedly with the extremely warm congratulations which have been extended to you already on the occasion of your election. The decision of the Assembly to entrust to you the conduct of our proceedings is a glowing tribute to your special qualities as a veteran diplomat, to all Africa and to the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, your own country. Your considerable experience with the United Nations and the authority which is undeniably yours qualify you particularly to preside over the important discussions at this twenty-ninth session.\n24.\tWe should also like to extend our warmest congratulations to the other officers. There is no doubt that the competence of the team which has been elected, together with its far-sightedness, wisdom and talent for conciliation, is for us a reassuring augury of success in our work.\n25.\tOur warmest thanks also go to Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who, throughout the last session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly, was the perfect incarnation of the wisdom and skill which made it possible to bring our work to a successful conclusion. We would simply like to say to him that his vast competence won him the admiration and sympathy of us all.\n26.\tMy delegation would now like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose role in the search for peace among nations and whose earnest desire to find solutions to the problems of the under-privileged countries have won him our admiration. We have seen in the areas concerned, wherever the circumstances have required, particularly in Africa, which is suffering from hunger, colonialism, under-development and racial discrimination, the Secretary-General contributing actively to the search for remedies for all these ills.\n.27. Our family has just grown by the addition of three new Members. I should like to convey to them my warmest congratulations.\n28.\tMy delegation also would like to mark enthusiastically the presence among us of the worthy representatives of the heroic people of Guinea-Bissau. The noble cause defended, at the cost of his life, with such intelligence, courage and perseverance by Amilcar Cabral, the work taken up by his brother Luis Cabral, have just been translated today into facts, to the great satisfaction of the whole of Africa and all freedom- and justice-loving nations. To our brothers from Guinea-Bissau, who have written, at the cost of their own blood, one of the most glorious pages in the history of African liberation, Upper Volta addresses here its warmest congratulations.\n29.\tWe should also like to welcome the delegation of Bangladesh, which represents a nation whose courage and wisdom have always compelled our admiration. We are sure that its presence among us will contribute greatly to the solution of the many problems facing our world.\n30.\tFinally, I should like to express my warmest congratulations to the Prime Minister of Grenada and also to the important delegation he heads. We would ask him to be good enough to convey to the people of Grenada and to his Government our ardent wishes for peace and prosperity.\n31.\tThe importance of this twenty-ninth session is obvious to all, because it is taking place at a very decisive cross-roads in history: It is taking place at a time when humanity is becoming aware of the precariousness of its existence, which seems every day to be threatened by a shortage of food, the constant dangers constituted by the arms race and bloody confrontations between certain nations, and by the fact, too, that it is becoming aware of the limits of our world, whose interdependence among its members poses a crucial problem of coexistence and tolerance.\n32.\tMoreover, this session is being held at a time when nations, great and small, are feeling the need to redefine the unequal relationships which have existed heretofore between them. In any case, the economic battle now being waged by the developing countries means that they are no longer prepared to remain the poor relations of development. The sixth special session of the General Assembly, the important resolutions on the new international economic order and the program of action which flowed from it, testify to the urgent need for such a change in international relations.\n33.\tBut we do not expect miracles from this redefinition of international relations, just as it would be illusory to base a policy of national development on international aid, which is always fluid. The example of the struggle against under-development which we have been waging since independence has taught us this. It is with this background in mind that Upper Volta is now planning its battle for development.\n34.\tWhen at the time of independence young States had to gage for the first time the enormous responsibilities bequeathed them by the colonial Power, they found themselves coming to grips with problems which they had of course foreseen, but whose scope they had never been able to appreciate. At the same time, they were obliged, with extremely limited resources, to think out and resolve very complex problems such as the appropriate political and administrative organization, economic development education, and social structures.\n35.\tFaced with these problems of unprecedented complexity, the new Members of the United Nations family had to display a great deal of realism and wisdom, particularly in view of the fact that they were under-developed countries. They had to base their ideal on the great truth that any lasting development requires enlightened administration which shall be both honest and devoted to the common weal, and had to organize all their energies to undertake the most urgent research to ensure the welfare of the people. Administrative corruption, unjustified and prolonged idleness, favoritism, waste, ostentation and discrimination; all crowned by ignorance, were the worst evils which threatened these societies. Thus, from the very dawn of their independence, the new sovereign States needed a healthy state of mind directed to their national construction; in short, they needed a solid development ethic.\n36.\tBut we must be honest and realistic, and recognize that, unfortunately, in such an important area as national development certain young States have not always been able to demonstrate that an ethical approach could bear the appropriate responsibilities and play its role in setting standards. The fault lay essentially with the new leaders, who then had to watch their countries suffer the consequences of their poor administration of public affairs.\n37.\tWhat has come to be known as the wave of military coups d'etat can be explained by the need for changes following a deterioration in domestic situations and the resignation of certain political leaders. In Upper Volta, the revolution of 3 January 1966 obeyed the same rule. In the face of the lack of consistency and the corruption of the politicians of the time, a popular movement transferred power to the army, the only force which at that time could defend the people against omnipotent leaders. Of course, this change of regime was quickly classed with the whole group of military coups d'etats which occurred, without any realization that it resulted solely from a contract between the popular masses and the army; the army had to restore order in public affairs, which had been seriously disturbed, and was sustained by the people in this work of rehabilitation.\n38.\tBut whatever the resulting views and attitudes, nations of goodwill discovered with ever-growing satisfaction that on 3 January 1966 Upper Volta had gained a government and political leaders firmly resolved to prove that in the very important area of national development the ethical approach was to play its proper part to the full. The Government then undertook a vigorous effort to promote the harmonious development of the young Republic, involving the placing of the financial situation on a sound basis, the liquidation of the public debt, the restoration of confidence in the business world, the lowering of salaries, patriotic contributions and the reduction of State expenditures. In a short time the world witnessed with admiration the financial rehabilitation of Upper Volta.\n39.\tIt is on the basis of these political and economic achievements that we have given Upper Volta democratic and parliamentary institutions permitting all shades of opinion a voice, so as to build a politically mature nation capable of undertaking the battle for development. But as the old adage says, \\\"habit is second nature\\\", for very soon the objectives of the revolution of 3 January 1966 were overlooked by the new leaders who had emerged from this new experiment. The result was a serious political crisis to which those who were anxious about the political future of the young State could net remain indifferent.\n40.\tAt a time when our country was going through the most difficult period of its history, at a time when it had to face the terrible scourge of drought, and at a time when international public opinion was becoming aware of our tragedy and mobilizing resources in order to support our efforts, morally and materially, it was out of the question to allow Upper Volta to be labeled as irresponsible and to become enmeshed in useless internal dissension. The President of the Republic, the Chief of Staff of the Army, faced the following dilemma: either to allow the crisis to develop without hope of a short-term solution, with all the danger that this involved of dividing the country into two rival factions, and demobilizing energies meant for national development, or, taking seriously his role as arbiter, to intervene to save the institutions, to revive the confidence of the working people, and to recall the objectives of 3 January 1966.\n41.\tAt a time when every nation is wondering about its future, at a time when economic uncertainty, the inexorable process of inflation and monetary disorder are monopolizing the attention of States and preventing nations from constructive activity and making reasonable provision for the near future, the choice was not in doubt. Taking seriously his role of guardian of the national security, the President of the Republic, General Sangoule Lamizana, put an end to all political machinations on 8 February 1974 by taking the decision to suspend the Constitution, to dissolve the National Assembly and to dismiss the Government. In their place there was installed the Government of National Renewal, composed of young civilians and soldiers known for their probity and their industry, and the National Consultative Committee for Renewal, composed of members from all social strata, whose essential task was constantly to remind the Government of the needs of the people.\n42.\tOf course, there are some who will regret that Upper Volta did not entirely meet the challenge of parliamentary democracy and a party system; others will take pleasure at seeing in these events a corroboration of their theses, which are based on simplistic premises. Be that as it may, we do not regret what we did. There was an urgent choice to be made, and in his statement of general policy the President of the Republic explained this choice as follows:\n\\\"The Army, without wishing to undermine democratic freedoms, could nevertheless not permit itself to play the role of an indifferent spectator at the execution, as it were, of our country for the sake of unreasonable respect for certain formulas satisfying to the mind but with pernicious consequences for everyone, when the application of those formulas was a threat to national cohesion.\\\"\n43.\tBut in Upper Volta citizens have enjoyed the benefits of democracy and they want to keep them. That is why it was the more necessary to guarantee, in the new institutions, all the democratic freedoms which were so dearly won on the morrow of the revolution of 3 January 1966. Thus, 8 February 1974 marked a new stage in the awakening of the people of Upper Volta, because that was the historic date on which new institutions were established, designed not only to ensure the general mobilization of the working people but also, consequently, to make possible accelerated and more harmonious development: in other words, Upper Volta was entering the era of renewal.\n44.\tBut what is this renewal of Upper Volta? Renewal means the end of the epoch of politicians outbidding each other, when demagogy was the only weapon in the battle for power. It also means the end of collective resignations. Finally it means the establishment of a true national development policy in the political, economic and cultural fields, all aimed at remodeling the face of Upper Volta in a way designed to promote its identity. In the final analysis, renewal is as much an ethical approach as it is a program.\n45.\tIn a speech made on 23 February 1974 General Sangoule Lamizana laid down the major guidelines for this new program of action. He said:\n\\\"We must do everything we can to shake off this apathy and to awaken the citizens of Upper Volta so that they may rediscover their vitality and all the forces of the richness of their spirit. It is on those terms that we shall be in a position to present a better front in the struggle to bring remedies to bear for the lack of technical and financial resources, within the limits of our possibilities, in order to pursue a policy of social promotion, which remains to be defined, to rethink our educational system, the in-adaptability of which leads more to failure than success and leaves on the street corners a potential for protest, to define a policy of industrialization in keeping with the interests of the nation, and to develop the cultural riches of our national heritage, which have hitherto been insufficiently developed -in a word, to conceive and undertake action designed to ensure economic development and the cultural and social promotion of the Upper Volta nation.\\\"\n46.\tRenewal is, therefore, first of all a policy of our whole means, a policy essentially based on unity, work and justice. However, we are very well aware that in spite of all our good will this threefold national policy is not enough. As the President of the Republic stated in his guidance speech of 23 February, \\\"However determined it is to succeed, Upper Volta cannot by itself overcome all the numerous difficulties it faces\\\".\n47.\tThat is why the foreign policy of our country is intended to be at the same time the indispensable complement to its development efforts. That foreign policy is based essentially on the following fundamental principles: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, as defined in the charter of the OAU and the Charter of the United Nations; non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States; non-alignment; and equality and reciprocity in international relations.\n48.\tThe assistance given to Upper Volta by friendly nations and international organizations is an indispensable adjunct to our plan of action. Let us therefore take this opportunity to pay ? tribute to all States and international organizations which have understood the encouraging meaning of friendship in the painful hours through which our country has been living, for, as is known, Upper Volta and the other countries of the Sahel are suffering from an unprecedented drought which has dealt a mortal blow not only to their economies but also to their peoples. From this very rostrum the President of the Republic, General Sangoule Lamizana, had occasion to refer to this matter in a previous session [2145th meeting]. Furthermore, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, realized this when at Ouagadougou in February 1974 he made an appeal for assistance for the people of the Sahel, threatened with famine.\n49.\tThe upsurge of solidarity demonstrated on that occasion gives us grounds for believing that it is pos-sible to create a unitary world on condition that all States and the whole international community are now aware of the solidarity of a world the limits of which are becoming ever clearer each day. That co-operation and international solidarity are the fundamental options of our Government of National Renewal. That is why Upper Volta has absolutely undertaken to work for integration -national, regional, continental and world integration. A land-locked country, it stands only to gain by such a policy, and it is in that conviction that one must seek the reason for our membership of various regional and interregional organizations. It is our view that that was in the minds of the States that created the United Nations itself. In creating the United Nations and becoming Members of the Organization we have undertaken the solemn responsibility not only to coexist in peace and brotherhood but also to seek ways and means of achieving a rapprochement among nations and effective solidarity.\n50.\tIt is also in that sense that from the very beginning we were the active militants of African unity represented by the great organization which is known to all. We intend to remain in that attitude, for we have placed too much hope in that organization to be disappointed; but we are convinced that with imagination it will be possible to find ever more original solutions to the problems of Africa. The struggle for African independence, the battle for economic development, the sheltering of the continent from the bloody upheavals of the modern world, political and economic integration -those are the subjects that concern us. This is indeed a program, is it not?\n51.\tIt is, finally, in that sense that Upper Volta has adopted the ideas of non-alignment, the outlines and contours of which the distinguished President of this twenty-ninth session has so ably described to us at the outset of our debate [2233rd meeting]. By sup-porting non-alignment, Upper Volta intends to reject the system of blocs and spheres of influence, while committing itself to finding original solutions to the many problems that beset us.\n52.\tExtraordinary and varied discoveries have made it possible to provide our world with thousands of amenities, commodities and comforts, and it seems to us that we need only to enjoy in peace all this storehouse of wealth in order to live a better and happier life. Unfortunately, for more than 30 years -and this is indeed strange logic -we have been fighting each other. More than 50 wars have shaken and still share the entire world.\n53.\tToday, at Che opening of this session, we are compelled to note that the analysis of the state of affairs in the world does not allow us to take too optimistic a view, although there are some glimmerings of hope on the horizon.\n54.\tTrue, the trend to dialog that has emerged over the past few years has continued. Bilateral con-tacts and multilateral meetings, even if they have not always produced the happy result's that we had expected, nonetheless are encouraging signs of detente and represent a lessening of tension in various regions of the world. True, in Europe the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, the Geneva Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Paris-Bonn rapprochement, and the normalization of Germano- Czech relations are on record to show us that with a bit of goodwill it is possible to cast down the barriers of centuries-long prejudice. True, agreements on the separation of the forces confronting each other in Sinai and on the Golan Heights have been signed, thus making it possible to take a step towards the settlement of the conflict of the Middle East. True, the Organization is tending increasingly towards universality through the admission to its midst of new States. But what is all this in comparison with the sombre background against which these events stand?\n55.\tThroughout the world, tragedies are still being enacted, spreading suffering, mourning and ruin among innocent peoples. It is an irony of fate that it should be the peoples of the poorest regions who meet death so tragically. But can one really talk about fate when one knows that in this cruel game all the strings are in a few hands that manipulate them as they wish?\n56.\tAnd above all, there is the tragedy of colonialism and apartheid.\n57.\tIt is with unparalleled delight that all peoples that love peace and freedom have welcomed the overthrow of the centuries-old dictatorship that ruled the Portuguese people. This delight turns to rightful pride when we recall that it was as a result of the combination of popular forces, both African and Portuguese, that the foundations of that dictatorship were shaken. In Africa as in Portugal, hope has been born. The most recent statements of the Portuguese Government, in any event, allow us be optimistic about the future. In his statement of 27 July 1974, did not General de\nnola say that Portugal was ready to entertain all initiatives for the preparation and implementation of the process of decolonization in Africa, involving the immediate acceptance of the right to political independence?\n58.\tThe agreements of Algiers and of Lusaka, fortunately, confirmed this hope, thus making it possible for the people of Guinea-Bissau to accede to full and complete independence and for the hostilities in Mozambique to cease. The democratic course on which Portugal has now decided to embark is of a sort to defuse the political atmosphere and to make a considerable contribution to peace. Through the voice of my delegation, Upper Volta wishes to pay a special tribute to the fine understanding of the Portuguese people and to the political courage and foresight of its new leaders.\n59.\tMoreover, we hope that the Portuguese people, having uprooted fascism in its country, will better understand the position of our brothers who live in South Africa and in Rhodesia, and that it will convince the Portuguese Government to change its attitude towards the policies of South Africa and Rhodesia, which it should oppose, as was decided by all the nations that love peace and freedom.\n60.\tHowever, the international community must remain vigilant. We must not accept any solution in the newly independent Territories that represents only a poor and lopsided compromise. Full and complete independence should be granted to all African Territories under domination. Nor will we accept a Rhodesian-type solution whereby a minority of white settlers tries to confiscate power for their sole benefit, as has already occurred in certain attempts. \n61.\tAs we know, indeed, in Rhodesia and South Africa a most abject and despicable lack of under-standing continues to be displayed; I refer to racism and the policy of apartheid. In this connexion, as we address the entire world from this rostrum, let us also remember that today, 2 October, is the anniversary of a person who, throughout his life, was the incarnation of the soul of the movement for national independence in his country and who founded his actions on the principle of non-violence. I am referring, of course, to Mahatma Gandhi. It was he who was the first to rise up and rebel against the cruel practices of the South African Government. Let us recall that he led a movement to improve the lot of colored people in South Africa even before he launched the civil disobedience movement in India to obtain the freedom and independence of his country.\n62.\tMoreover, ever since India raised this question in the United Nations in 1946, almost every Member of the Organization, including the allies of South Africa, has severely denounced the shameful and ignominious policy of apartheid. In the midst of this twentieth century it is inadmissible that peoples who call themselves civilized should support and nurture the folly of a concept of inequality among human beings. The hateful policy of apartheid practiced by the Fascist authorities of Pretoria, and by those who slowly but surely are imitating them, does honor neither to so-called civilized peoples nor to our age. My delegation hopes that this twenty-ninth session will not only condemn once again this policy of subjugation of man but will try to find the best means of putting into effect the decisions taken by the international community on this question.\n63.\tIn Namibia the United Nations has a special responsibility to the extent that legally this Territory should be administered by the Organization pending its accession to independence. Upper Volta will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations Council for Namibia to discharge the task entrusted to it by the Assembly.\n64.\tIn any event, it should be known that if a satisfactory solution is not found to the problems of the African subcontinent within a few years, this region will be one of the hottest spots on the globe. A bitter struggle will be waged there and no one yet can know who will win and who will lose. What we can say is that the inhabitants of the region, be they black or white, will have to pay heavily for this. If it is true that might can prevail over right for a certain time, it is equally sure that this cannot go on indefinitely.\n65.\tOur era is witnessing also the tragedies of brothers who are enemies. Thus the Middle East is still a serious source of concern to the international community, particularly at a time when a crisis has just erupted in Cyprus. If we are not careful, that tinder box will explode one day and endanger our entire world and its precarious balance.\n66.\tThe latent state of war between Israel and the neighboring Arab countries has commanded the world's attention for some time now. Despite individual and collective efforts, no final solution has yet been found. Despite all the resolutions that have been adopted, and particularly Security Council resolution 242 (1967), a latent situation of war continues to exist.\n67.\tWe should like to state here once again, first, that all the States of the region have the right to exist and the right to their territorial integrity; secondly, that occupation or acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible; and thirdly, that the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people must be taken into consideration. Those are the three conditions for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the region.\n68.\tWe are happy to note that during the past year a few glimmerings of hope have emerged that have rekindled our faith that a settlement can be found. Indeed, the international community's efforts have succeeded in achieving, in 1974, a cease-fire and a disengagement of forces between Israel on the one hand and Syria and Egypt on the other. Moreover, the Geneva Conference could be the appropriate framework in which to lay a basis for negotiations between the parties. We hope that that Conference will resume very soon, for if we take advantage of the chances for peace discernible on the horizon, there may be some grounds to hope for good results.\n69.\tBut so far the Middle East problem has seemed to concern only two parties: Israel and the neighboring Arab States. But there is a third party, which should be regarded as the most deeply concerned: the people of Palestine. It is not possible to imagine any solution to the Middle East problem that does not take into account those very people who are the essential issue. For its part, Upper Volta has always stated that a final solution to the Middle East problem must in one way or another proceed on the basis of a recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, rights that would enable them to inhabit their land and prosper there.\n70.\tThe inclusion of the Palestine question in the agenda is likely to enable us to discuss that problem seriously and not as a tangential issue, as has been done heretofore. We think that these discussions should lead to the emergence of a clear position which would make it possible to find a final solution.\n71.\tToday a serious danger is also to be discerned in Cyprus, for the struggle being carried on in that island threatens not only its security but also that of the international community. The coup d'etat carried out there created a new source of tension in the Mediterranean area. As members well know, the consequences were not long in emerging: Greeks and Turks began to fight each other, and the confrontation between the two communities went far beyond the expectations of those who had been moving them around like pawns on a chess-board. Indeed, the implications of the Cyprus situation have become so numerous and so wide-ranging that, in view of the disruption caused by the coup d'etat, the forces involved could not but react, knowing full well that, unfortunately, in our world, a fait accompli can create rights.\n72.\tObviously the situation created in Cyprus has introduced a new factor that has not simplified the Middle East problem; it raises even more acutely the question that was already of serious concern that is, the security of the Mediterranean region. We appeal to all the parties concerned to abide by the Treaty of Guarantee, signed at Nicosia on 16 August 1960, which guaranteed the independence of the island, and we call upon them to work to normalize the situation, in accordance with the Security Council resolutions on the subject.\n73.\tWe find too that in Asia, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Korea continue to be dangerous areas of tension. Despite the 1973 Paris agreements, peace has still not come to Viet Nam. It is for us to ensure that all the parties fully and immediately abide by all the provisions of those agreements. But, we may ask, what kind of peace, when in Cambodia\u2014Viet Nam's neighbor everything still remains to be done. That country, which formerly was peaceful under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who practiced a policy of non-alignment, today has suffered the fate that was meted out to Viet Nam. War has been brought to that country against the will of the people, who have undertaken to struggle in order clearly to show that if there is one course that their leaders should follow, it is that which they themselves have spelled out, and not one dictated from abroad. In any event, we can only note the rallying of the Khmer 'people around the person of Prince Sihanouk'. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, which he leads, is already administering the largest part of Cambodian territory. Hence, it goes without saying that it is the representatives of that Government who should represent Cambodia here. The choice that Upper Volta has made of recognizing that Government as the only legitimate one reflects our desire for peace and non-alignment and is also a clear condemnatory of foreign intervention in any country.\n74.\tThere is also, of course, the Korean problem. At the twenty-eighth session Upper Volta supported the consensus on the Korean question1 in the firm hope that the contacts that were beginning between the two parties, following the joint communique of 4 July 1972, would achieve tangible results.\n75.\tThe Organization has a mission in Korea: it is to create by peaceful means a unified, independent and democratic Korea. The United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, whose terms of reference were to create conditions likely to promote that unification, has not accomplished the task assigned to it. What is e/en worse, it has always been opposed by one of the parties involved. The dissolution of that Commission, which we have always recommended, would encourage the two parties to meet. For we think that, in the final analysis, the solution of the Korean prob-lem must be a Korean solution*\n76.\tVery fortunately, Upper Volta has relations with the two parties. We believe, and we wish to state this cldarly, tbit the Korean people, despite the many handicaps resulting from so many years of war and tension and political ups and downs, are sufficiently mature today to choose their own course.\n77.\tWhile avoiding the dictating of a code of conduct to the two parties, our sacred duty is to help them to achieve the reunification they are both actively seeking. But if that reunification is to be effective and above any kind of suspicion, it must be carried out by the Koreans themselves, free from any foreign influence or intervention, and particularly through the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed there under the United Nations flag.\n78.\tThere is, finally, the tragedy of the arms race, whose principal participants are the super-Powers.\n79.\tEvery year the Assembly discusses the problem of disarmament; and this discussion clearly reflects a major and legitimate concern. But it must be recognized that in this issue some discouragement and lassitude have crept in in view of the paucity of the results achieved up to now. Meanwhile, some countries are continuing to develop and to perfect quantitatively and qualitatively the most formidable weapons, and the small States are entitled to ask themselves -and not without fear -for what ultimate use these weapons are intended.\n80.\tAt the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers in 1973, those countries worked out quite clear conditions for the solution of this problem: the dissolution of military alliances born of the cold war; the dismantling of all military bases throughout the world; the creation of zones of peace in the various regions of the world; and the convening as soon as possible of a world conference on disarmament with the participation of all States.\n81.\tFor we may be sure that in order to dissipate the threat which hangs over our world, we will have to have general and complete disarmament, which should be the object of serious discussions among all countries. Just so long as the problem remains the exclusive concern of certain great countries and at the level of club discussions, we fear that no serious solution can be found.\n82.\tMoreover, what we are concerned about is collective security. Whatever precautions one may take, the catastrophic effects of a nuclear bomb will transcend all frontiers. Our planet at the present time is vacillating between fear and hope: the fear of one day seeing the world engulfed in flames, and the hope that millions of human beings place in the development of international solidarity. The central feature of the existence of our generation need not always be this perilous course along the narrow corridor which separates fear from hope. We should think about this carefully.\n83.\tBut the survival of our civilization is not only threatened by the arms race, it is also threatened, perhaps even more so, by disparities in economic development. In this area, the developing countries are chiefly responsible for making the necessary effort. Unfortunately, in many sectors their effort meets with failure because of external forces which are completely beyond their control.\n84.\tThe world's economy is still prey to convulsions which have been occurring now for nearly a year. These upheavals have already prompted the wise and timely initiative of President Boumediene that led to the convening of a special session of the General Assembly. In our opinion the sixth special session was crowned by brilliant success, the impact of which will be revealed over the years. Upper Volta considers that it is particularly appropriate to emphasize the emergence of new fundamental principles which, if accepted by the international community, will constitute a further milestone towards a new era of more equitable and more consistent partnerships. The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and the related Program of Action recognize the right of each State to adopt the economic and social system that it deems the most appropriate for its own development, to establish full permanent sovereignty over its natural resources and all its economic activities, including the right to nationalize industries and to restore and fully compensate for the exploitation and depletion of natural resources. That is one step forward towards a world economy based on a balance between the interests of all parties. The political sense and understanding of all will be judged according to how realistic they are in their resolute commitment to the attainment of those new horizons that promotes greater justice for all.\n85.\tAll these new elements should have created a better economic climate on the international level. However, we are compelled to realize that our ills still beset us.\n86.\tWith respect to commodities, Upper volta has always most firmly supported the efforts of the developing countries to commercialize their raw materials; we have done this at all international economic conferences and we intend to continue, for the demands of the third world for remunerative prices are timely and will make a decisive contribution to the introduction of a new international economic order which should not remain a dead letter.\n87.\tThat is why Upper Volta was pleased at the perceptible improvement in the terms of trade for the exporters of a limited range of commodities. Unfortunately, the general picture still leaves much to be desired, in particular for the African countries whose exports encounter very little elasticity of demand.\nSerious efforts should be made to reach a new inter-national agreement on coffee. With respect to cocoa, we support the legitimate claims of the producers, who feel that the range of prices fixed by the 1972 Agreement should be readjusted; these prices should be raised, duly taking into account the facts of the present-day markets.\n88.\tWe are gratified at the progress achieved with regard to a certain number of other products exported by the developing countries, owing to a resumption of the demand for industrial raw materials and to the upsurge in the economy in the industrialized countries.\n89.\tMy country's position regarding oil cannot be different from that taken with respect to other commodities. We should remember that oil is a non-renewable resource. It is in terms of price of this commodity and its availability that the present producer countries can promote their economic and social development.\n90.\tThe impact of the rise in prices of petroleum products on the economies in the developing countries is a problem which cannot be solved by a readjustment of the level of prices as they stand now; this is neither realistic nor desirable. In our opinion the solution would lie in the direction clearly pointed out by the General Assembly at its sixth special session, namely, by the taking of special measures in favor of the countries most affected to enable them to maintain their imports at desired levels. But the measures envisaged will be doomed to failure if the developed countries do not take action against the new situation created by the price of industrial products; indeed, the increase in the price of these products is completely out of proportion with the increase in the price of petroleum.\n91.\tThe price escalation thus set off by the developed countries and their multinational companies is an argument in favor of an immediate definition of the relationship to be established between the prices\n. of raw materials, manufactured and sen i-manufactured goods exported by the developing countries and the prices of industrial products, means of production and equipment imported by the third world. The establishment of such a relationship would guarantee to the developing countries the equivalent of the true value of their raw materials.\n92.\tUpper Volta wishes once again to express its gratitude to the international community, both countries and public and private organizations, whose moral and material support, given so generously, has made it possible to limit the consequences of the natural disaster that has so sorely tried all the peoples of African Sahel. In particular, we should like to thank the Secretary-General and all his colleagues for their tireless efforts to mobilize international public opinion and help for the people of the Sahelian region.\n93.\tHowever, there is still much to be done to enable Africa's Sahelian region to regain the pace and level of production it enjoyed before the disaster. The restoration of productive capital requires that the countries of the Sahelian region and the international community make an increased effort, in keeping with the scope and range of the disaster that must be corrected. As we have already said, means of production must be repaired and improved in order to make it possible for them very quickly to reach a development level that will protect them from such calamities.\n94.\tTo that end, it is essential that international assistance should be reinforced and pursued in pro-grammes ranging over a number of years. We are bound to observe that nothing has been done so far in respect of financing medium- and long-term projects worked out by the countries victims of the drought. Those projects are lying in desk drawers for lack of resources. The hopes they aroused have not been fulfilled, since those projects have called for investments of the order of $1,000 million. It is hardly necessary to emphasize the incalculable consequences of such indifference in the face of the requirements of those countries in their efforts to bolster their economies.\n95.\tMy delegation believes it is time to draw to the attention of the international community the encroachment of the desert, which has caused lasting damage to the environment not only in Africa but also on other continents. This phenomenon calls for urgent and concrete action at the world level.\n96.\tAs the Secretary-General stated at his press conference in Ouagadougou in February 1974, \\\"In less than 50 years from today, perhaps by the end of this century, the encroachment of the desert threatens to wipe off the map three or four countries of Africa\\\".\n97.\tThe drought seems to have struck everywhere. According to some meteorologists, climatic conditions will continue to be bad for some lime to come. Apparently a band of dry areas is being formed, and is spreading from the southern Sahara to northern China. Deserts and shrublands are spreading in the southern hemisphere. As evidence, let us note that the drought has also affected Nigeria, the United Republic of Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Guinea, Zaire, Angola, Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania. The level of underground water shows a constant decline. Lakes are progressively drying up, and wells must be driven to depths as great as 200 metres. In Asia, regions that were formerly fertile have been struck by drought, and the monsoon rains have been falling into the sea.\n98.\tIn our opinion, it is urgent that the United Nations should convene an international conference in order to record and analyze available data in respect of scientific knowledge on the process of desert- encroachment and work out a world plan of action to fight against it through water-level research and tests on forest resources that may be adapted for this purpose, the regeneration of grazing land, and so on.\n99.\tSuch a conference could be preceded by regional and subregional meetings, Within that framework we could schedule an African regional conference, including all the countries bordering on the Sahara, which would bring together the countries of the Sahelian region as well as the Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Nigeria, the Central African Republic, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. The preparatory work for such a conference could be entrusted to the United Nations Environment Program, which would report back to the General Assembly at its thirtieth session through the Economic and Social Council.\n100.\tWithout such an over-all approach, any solutions one might be tempted to prepare at the national level would be doomed to failure. Indeed, as the President of Mexico said in his statement at FAO Headquarters on 9 February 1974:\n\\\"Soil erosion on a planet the limits of which are henceforth dramatically clear to us constitutes one of the major questions of our time which cannot be settled except within the framework of a supra-national organization. The investments required for this purpose are, without doubt, far beyond the means of most countries, which for that very reason should support programs of common interest. There is nothing impossible about that task. We know that armaments are now costing the scandalous sum of $22,000 million annually, whereas in 1972 the developing countries received, in the form of governmental assistance, only $8,600 million, or precisely half the amount that was decided upon as part of the United Nations Program.\\\"\n101.\tThe difficulties encountered in these last two years make it essential for the entire international community to examine its conscience. That is essential if there is to be a fair solution to the problem of food production. Indeed, we are not proceeding towards famine, as Rene Dumont has said; we have already reached that point, and it remains to be seen whether the world wishes to cope with this problem before any possible solution is ruled out because appropriate action was not taken in time.\n102.\tIn the past six years the increase in world food output has been approximately 2.6 per cent. It will reach 3.7 per cent in the next decade. In 1972, the world output of cereals amounted to 1,200 million tons, the annual rate of increase ranging around 30 million tons.\n103.\tFrom 1959 to 1969, food production per capita for all of the countries of the third world remained more or less stagnant, the progress of a few being offset by the lagging of others. From 1969 until today, the general trend has been backwards. Per capita output has not ceased decreasing in the Sahelian region, in Latin America and in Asia, where the \\\"green revolution\\\" has not achieved the goals hoped for it.\n104.\tGrain production in Africa was on the order of 34 million tons, or 97 per cent of total consumption. Over the past 10 years, output has increased by 2.6 per cent per annum, and it is estimated that it will amount to 50 million tons in 1985. But let us be clear and realize that if the world is threatened with famine it is more because of squandering by the wealthy than overpopulation in the third world.\n105.\tIn North America grain consumption is 1.8 tons per capita per annum; in the Soviet Union 1.4 tons; one ton in the member countries of the European Economic Community; whereas in India it is only one ton for seven persons; and in the other developing countries one ton for five persons. Thus it is clear that the impact of population growth in the developed countries entail the consumption of the world's resources at about two and a half times the rate re suiting from the impact of population growth in the third world.\n106.\tHence the third world runs the risk of having to import 85 million tons of grain in 1985 -or close to the maximum of what the developed countries will be able to supply them with- if the latter do not agree to reduce their meat consumption. Indeed, as shown by Rene Dumont, the livestock of the developed countries in 1973 consumed 380 million tons of grain and fodder -or a thousand times more than the developed countries gave to the Sahelian region. Let us recall that the grain shortage in the Sahelian region amounted to 800,000 tons in 1973, and has reached 1,230,000 tons in 1974.\n107.\tThe Director-General of FAO has already repeatedly warned of the seriousness of the situation with regard to the world's stockpiles, which have fallen to 105 million tons, their lowest level in many years. We will of necessity have to double food production in the next generation, if only to maintain the present inadequate rate of per capita food supply.\n108.\tThe present shortage has led to a tripling in the cost of corn and other grains, thus placing them beyond the means of the least favored nations. Indeed, in 1973, the developing countries received only 5 million tons of grain from the developed countries, as against 10 million tons in 1972. Those same developing countries had to spend $10 billion in 1973 to import their grain, as compared with $4 billion in 1972.\n109.\tThe World Food Conference offers the desired framework for the search for appropriate solutions to cope with the shortage and the production slow-down.\n110.\tThe substantial increase in food production in the developing countries requires action in four fundamental directions: increased investment, the avail-ability of loans, research on adaptation to new conditions, and rural development. But it is the developed countries that must provide the extra measure of indispensable technical and financial assistance.\n111.\tExperiments carried out in certain developing countries, particularly in Africa, have shown that it is possible to triple, and even quintuple, agricultural output in most developing countries by a rational use of phosphate and nitrate fertilizers, which are the most important elements in food production.\n112.\tUnfortunately, with the demand for food-stuffs growing because of the growth in population and personal revenue, nitrate fertilizer producers have not been able to meet the demand. It is even expected that prices will remain high after supply has caught up with demand, because of the cost of the raw mate-rials involved in this process. Hence there is every reason to believe that fertilizer needs will reach extraordinary levels towards the end of this century.\n113.\tFor all these reasons, the developed countries should take immediate and positive action to heed the appeal for setting up a common fertilizer stockpile fund; they should make substantial contributions to that fund, while at the same time significantly in-creasing their exports of fertilizers and pesticides to the developing countries, and at prices duly reflecting the serious balance of payments deficits of the developing countries. The developed countries, moreover, should supply the developing countries with the necessary financial and technical assistance to enable them to make full use of their present productive capacity. The World Food Conference should similarly prepare a plan for the international management of stocks in order henceforth to avoid the tremendous fluctuations in prices and supplies which occurred, for example, in 1972-1973. The developed countries should undertake to make a serious contribution to the financing of strategic food reserves designed to offset shortages and the effects of natural disasters. Such stocks should be held in the developing countries to reduce maintenance and transportation costs. It is by such measures that development assistance can finally achieve its goal.\n114.\tAs you know, the general climate of development assistance has continued to deteriorate. Public assistance for the development of member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has shown a drop in real terms and as a percentage of the gross national product. Accordingly, for all those countries the percentage of the gross national product devoted to government assistance fell from 0.34 per cent in 1972 to 0.30 per cent in 1973, even though the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade had established a target of 0.7 per cent [see resolution 2626 (XXV), para. 43]. Total contributions, including export credits, loans, private investments and donations from benevolent organizations, amounted to 0.78 per cent of the gross national product, the same percentage as in 1972.\n115.\tIn quantitative terms, the volume of government assistance for development rose 9 per cent in 1973, from $8,700 million to $9,400 million. However, allowing for exchange rate fluctuations and the effects of widespread inflation, aid from the developed countries dropped by approximately 6 per cent in real terms, representing a 30 per cent decline compared with 1963. It is worth noting that the element of aid generosity did rise from 84 per cent to 86.7 per cent between 1972 and 1973. On the other hand, the proportion of that government aid to the total net contribution of financial resources fell from 44 per cent in 1972 to 39 per cent in 1973.\n116.\tIn the face of the present economic situation, it is essential and indeed urgent for all developed countries to commit themselves resolutely to maintain the quantity and quality of their government assistance and to meet the goals set within the timetable established by the International Development Strategy, particularly with respect to assistance to those countries most affected by the present crisis. An appeal should be made to the developed countries to live up to their commitments and make a substantial contribution to restoring the resources of the AID Program and to UNDF, which plays a remarkable role in respect of technical assistance and pre-investment.\n117.\tWith respect to the international monetary system, we are obliged to note also that restoration of monetary stability does not seem to be in sight yet. It is essential that member States of IMF should consider all necessary measures to put an end to the activities of international speculators, whose manipulations condemn us to ever-increasing fluctuations that dangerously dislocate the fragile economies of the developing countries.\n118.\tInflation continues its corrosive effects and it is more necessary than ever to combine every effort to strangle inflation; if we do not do this, the export earnings of the developing countries will continue to be drained off towards the developed countries for the purchase of industrial products at exorbitant prices. In almost all of the developed countries the rate of increase in prices was between 9 and 15 per cent in 1974. Some of them have already reached the level of 20 per cent. The over-all rate of inflation in the developing countries must inevitably limit their payments capacity and possibilities of acquiring a public debt.\n119.\tWith respect to the reform of the monetary system, there are grounds for satisfaction in the modest progress accomplished by the IMF ad hoc Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues, and in particular its decision to define the \\\"unit\\\" of the future monetary system, in terms of special drawing rights, on the basis no longer of gold or the dollar but rather on a \\\"basket\\\" of several currencies, each with a given weight. The definition of this new world monetary unit will gradually lead us to give gold and the dollar their proper place in the future monetary system.\n120.\tIn any case, my delegation feels that the framework for discussion and negotiation should provide for greater participation by the developing countries through their specially appointed representatives. We think that the new system will be very short-lived if it does not draw the necessary lessons from the erosion and downfall of the old international monetary system. The new system should take due account of the needs and concerns of the developing countries, in particular through the long-awaited setting up of a link between the special drawing rights and additional financing for development.\n121.\tThe industrial growth of the developing countries has continued to be characterized by considerable fluctuations, and by the inability of these countries to achieve sustained and continued progress. The fundamental reason for this is the instability of world trade, with sharp rises in the prices of industrial raw materials, as well as intermediary products and capital goods imported from the developed countries.\n122.\tThe industrialization strategy founded on import substitution applied by many of the developing countries gave rise to an industrial structure dependent on imports from industrial countries, which has served only to perpetuate the subjugation of the third world.\n123.\tThe Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization [UNIDO] will provide an opportunity for an examination in detail of the substantive problems which are frustrating the efforts of the developing countries to provide themselves with an industrial infrastructure. That Conference will have to give due consideration to the measures in favor of the least developed of the developing countries. It would be well to implement the recommendations already formulated within the framework of the special measures, as recommended at the time of the second Conference of the African Ministers of Industry. As of now, we should adopt new industrial growth targets for the least developed countries, as recommended in the relevant provisions of the Strategy. In addition to the objective of a 6 per cent annual growth in gross domestic product and an 8 per cent growth in the manufacturing sector, the Strategy recommends a higher target of 7 per cent for gross domestic product and 10 per cent for the manufacturing sector of the least developed countries.\n124.\tIn the field of transport, Upper Volta has suffered seriously from the consequences of the almost continuing rise in the cost of transit and in maritime freight rates. In 1972, additional transport costs rose to almost 20 per cent of the value of our imports and 10 per cent of the value of our exports. The additional costs, due to our lack of a coastline, are estimated at one third of the assistance deceived in the form of gifts. Since the crises of 1973-1974, transport rates have increased between 15 and 30 per cent; thus one third of the cost of certain mass consumption goods reflects transport costs.\n125.\tUpper Volta welcomes the adoption, on 6 April 1974, of the Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences. This Convention is very timely, and should put an end to methods of decision-making which have become absolutely intolerable for the developing countries: the absolute secrecy surrounding the establishment of freight rates; the arbitrary raising of the general level of freight rates without prior notice; and the inability of Governments or the competent authorities to intervene to safeguard their trade interests. For a country like our own, which is already beset by appalling difficulties, the transport problem gave an added dimension to those difficulties. That is why we would have hoped that the Convention would deal more explicitly with the granting of special freight rates favoring the exports and imports of the developing, land-locked countries.\n126.\tHowever, at the present stage of developments in this area, Upper Volta is prepared to support the provisions contained in that Convention, in the firm hope that the specific concerns of the land-locked countries will be duly taken into account at the first conference to revise that Convention, and in the instruments of application or any other instruments that may be adopted in this field.\n127.\tUpper Volta has devoted special attention to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held under the auspices of the United Nations at Caracas from 20 June to 29 August 1974. In this general effort to codify a new legal order, our position continues as always to be guided by General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) of 17 December 1970, declaring the sea \\\"the common heritage of mankind\\\". That is why we firmly support the principle of the establishment of an international authority representing all the States which would undertake the exploitation and direct management of the resources of this heritage on behalf of all mankind; the resulting benefits should be distributed equitably among States, with due regard for the needs of the developing countries, particularly the land-locked countries, which should be given special treatment. We must ensure that history does not repeat itself, and that we do not replace an unjust system by a new system that is even more unjust, where the costs would be paid only by the poor countries. For this reason, with a view to justice and equity, the land-locked countries should be given the greatest possible guarantees, based on the following minimum priorities: the right of access to the sea and the zone of the sea-bed; and the right to transit without restriction or discrimination on the part of the transit country.\n128.\tThe entire world is awaiting the forthcoming session in Geneva of a new conference on the law of the sea to enable all countries, large or small, land-locked or coastal States, to profit fully from the re-sources of the sea-bed.\n129.\tTurning now to co-operation among the developing countries, recent studies in this field show quite clearly how important and useful it is for the international community actively to foster this type of co-operation, which offers a new dimension in co-operation for development. In our opinion, the recommendations of the Working Group on Technical Co-operation between Developing Countries provide a very creative and promising framework. Upper Volta will spare no effort to see these recommendations implemented, thus making it possible to strengthen further the ties of co-operation among all countries, and in particular among the developing countries. We hope that the United Nations system will be able to adapt itself to this new requirement which is in the short- and long-term interest of all.\n130.\tThe problems which beset our community and in particular its most vulnerable members cannot and must not cause us to lose hope. We have the necessary imagination and material resources: all that is needed is that we all arm ourselves with the indispensable political determination to solve these problems in order to advance resolutely towards the building of a moral and material world worthy of our generation. It was in this spirit that the United Nations was conceived: it is in this spirit that this session of the General Assembly must work for the dawning of a better world.\n"

        "file_text": "95.\t Mr. President, speaking for the first time in the General Assembly, I feel a double satisfaction not simply because I represent here a new Portugal which has nothing to do with the one which was so repeatedly condemned in this Organization, but also because I have the opportunity to speak in a session presided over by you.\n96.\tThis new Portugal has ceased to be a hostile and silent country within the United Nations constantly refusing to fulfill its obligations. Today it is a country ready to participate fully in international life and to respect the recommendations of the United Nations and determined to re-enter in all good faith the community of nations, thus assuming the position to which its ancient culture and multi-secular history entitle it.\n97.\tI am equally delighted at the welcome circumstance of your presence here as President of the twenty-ninth session of this Assembly. As a Portuguese and a freedom fighter, I, like so many of my fellow citizens, cannot forget that your country, Sir, generously welcomed many dozens of Portuguese expelled from their country by the oppression of the previous regime people like General Humberto Delgado, later assassinated by Salazar's political police. We all have in mind the solidarity of your Government with us in our struggle and the position of Algeria as a meeting point of the Mediterranean, Arab and African worlds and of a third world, so ofter misunderstood, whose voice has now come to be heard with ever more respect. For it was in your country that the decisive negotiations between representatives of the Portuguese Government and the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC] took place so successfully, resulting in the Algiers accords and thus putting an end to the war and to colonial domination in Guinea-Bissau.\n98.\tI should also like to congratulate the outgoing President, Mr. Benites, for his excellent work which culminated in the important sixth special session of last April. Only last year, I had a welcome opportunity of visiting his beautiful country, and, apart from so many other things I learned there, I can state that the Galapagos Islands constitute an exemplary model of a balanced policy of ecological and environmental preservation matters that cannot be overshadow by the great economic and political problems of the world without endangering all human activity.\n99.\tIn the name of the new Portugal, which I represent here today, I wish to declare solemnly that henceforth we shall collaborate fully with the United Nations, to whose supreme ideals we now adhere without reservation, in the hope that we may be able to contribute in our modest way towards the building of a world of peace and understanding among nations.\n100.\tUnfortunately, the oppression and obscurantism which prevailed in Portugal for almost SO years have up to now impeded any fruitful co-operation and have resulted in the systematic disregard of the recommendations of the United Nations. This negative and unrealistic policy, which defied the comprehension of the real world, brought my country to a position of sterile isolation, thus subjecting the Portuguese to a veritable constraint. The dictator Salazar, in his absurd arrogance, even reached the point of proclaiming that we were \\\"proudly alone\\\" in the world. I wish to make it quite clear that the free and democratic Portugal which we are building now with great difficulties certainty, but strengthened by the general confidence of our people is now beginning to feel itself proudly accompanied. Indeed I see no better company for my country than that which it will find through intensely, faithfully and sincerely living the life of this international community which is the great family of the United Nations, an organization almost planetary in its universality.\n101.\tFrom the very dawn of the first hopes born of the Atlantic Charter, born amidst the full horror of a devastating war, the first objective proclaimed was \\\"to see the establishment of a peace which would create for all nations the means of living in security within their own boundaries and providing the assurance that all men in all countries would be able to live out their lives free from fear and want.\\\" To that end it was proposed that the nations create a center designed to harmonize their activities, which would spread the practice of tolerance, good-neighborliness and peace and security for all. This task of the United Nations, despite difficulties and failures, has become better and better understood and realized in the sense that every year new countries join this Assembly.\n102.\tAt this twenty-ninth session we can express our gratification at the admission of three new Members: Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. Permit us, however, to express our particular pleasure at the admission of the Republic of Guinea- Bissau, which Portugal is proud to see in this Assembly a Portuguese-speaking country to which we are linked by such strong historical and socio- cultural ties. I feel particularly honored to have participated personally in the process of the decolonization of Guinea-Bissau, a process which I hailed a year ago, with the unilateral proclamation of independence, and which now culminates with the entry of Guinea-Bissau into the United Nations. It can only be regretted and I say this with a feeling of anguish that this process of decolonization, so long delayed, has left behind it a long, useless war in which so many of the young men of both countries died or were left disabled, I can only hope that this blood so needlessly shed will serve to cement a future fraternal friendship between the two peoples, which gave so much of themselves to each other and which can benefit so much from close co-operation on the basis of ir'Uual respect and absolute equality.\n103.\tOne of the concerns of the Government I rep-resent in this Assembly was to draw the attention of its allies to the advantages of the immediate entry of Guinea-Bissau into the United Nations. It must indeed be recognized that during so many years of war and privation the PAIGC, whose leaders have demonstrated in so many instances their maturity and high sense of responsibility, practiced, through the establishment of its own popularity and spirit of resistance, the principle of the self-determination of the people whom it unquestionably represents today.\n104.\tNow I should like to address a word of special appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his persuasive personal action. His visit to Lisbon, in response to an invitation by the Portuguese Government, took place at a decisive phase in the process of decolonization and contributed a great deal to the acceleration of this process which today, in record time, has already yielded so many positive and concrete results.\n105.\tNone of this, however, would be possible if the changes caused by the military and popular movement of 25 April had not occurred in Portugal. Those changes have made it possible for the Portuguese people to construct a free and democratic country in which man's inalienable rights and fundamental liberties are respected, a country in which everyone works to bring about the reign of social justice.\n106.\tThe movement of 25 April was the result of a long and persistent struggle on the part of the Portuguese people against the tyranny and obscurantism of a dictatorial regime which made all decisions without ever consulting its citizens an anachronistic regime which boasted of turning its back on the realities of the contemporary world and which, never having wished to understand the interaction of political, social and economic phenomena in a world where such interdependence was increasing daily, made a tabula rasa of the major events of the second part of the twentieth century.\n107.\tIt was in the light of that state of affairs that the Portuguese people, without help from outside and counting only upon itself, engaged in a long battle which ended in the revolt of 25 April, launched by the young officers of the armed forces, conscientiously interpreting the dominant sentiments of the Portuguese people. The movement of 25 April 1974 thus revealed itself as a spontaneous and authentic movement of the people in arms and constituted, in the words of President Spinola, \\\"a victory over ourselves, over our errors, over our contradictions\\\".\n108.\tIndeed this struggle acquired irresistible momentum, inasmuch as the colonial wars imposed upon the country by reactionary forces were prolonged, in defiance of good sense. Therefore it was the colonial wars which hastened the maturing and political awakening of the Portuguese and their armed forces. The latter, finally understanding that such a conflict could not yield a military solution, made apparent the uselessness of an aimless war. The officers and the soldiers realized that the solution to the wars born of Portugal's domination could be achieved only through a political act, requiring the replacement of the dictatorial regime by a democratic one.\n109.\tIn that context, the three principal objectives which the movement of 25 April proposed to achieve in the shortest possible time were as follows. First, the democratization of institutions through the holding of free elections on all levels of national and regional life. Legislative elections for a National Constituent Assembly will be held in March 1975, and we hope they will be exemplary in their freedom in so far as laws will guarantee, as they do already, freedom of thought, expression, press and assembly and the formation of political parties authentically representative of the differing options. Second, the rapid and reliable decolonization of the Territories under Portuguese administration, to be carried out in accord with the legitimate representatives of the will of the respective peoples and leading necessarily to independence. Third, the accelerated development of the country, whose economy has been overburdened by enormous, intolerable and unproductive spending designed to sustain the colonial war effort, which now will have to meet the high expenditures of peace and co-operation. In that context, Portugal would appeal to international solidarity. We welcome aid, facilities, investment and economic co-operation from all countries of the world, beginning, naturally, with our traditional allies and the European Common Market. In the light of its national interests, Portugal is open to such co-operation in order to free itself from atavistic conditions of under-development which persist in certain strangled areas of its economic and social structure.\n110.\tI should like here to develop one of the three points relating to decolonization as it concerns a question which not only is of concern to Portugal but, in fact, has been and remains an object of profound interest to the international community.\n111.\tMembers may already know that on the very day the provisional Government was established in Portugal, immediately after I assumed my post as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I left for Dakar, where I had the first meeting with the PAIGC leaders, which opened up the possibility of a de facto cease-fire. There followed the talks; in London and Algiers, which culminated in the signing, on 26 August last, of the Algiers accords. These accords definitively established recognition of the de jure independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, solemnly proclaimed in Lisbon on 10 September by the President of the Republic, General Antonio de Spinola, thus assuring the transfer of power to the new State.\n112.\tBetween 16 May, when contacts between the two delegations were initiated, and 26 August, when the Algiers accords were signed, there elapsed little more than three months, a fact which indicates an undeniable willingness to conclude the process of decolonization and seems to us to be worthy of note in the light of the other examples of recent history and in the light of our own internal difficulties, which we have had to overcome.\n113.\tWith respect to the negotiations between the delegations of Portugal and the Freiije de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] concerning the future of Mozambique, it can be stated that the process has been carried out in a relatively short period of time, given the magnitude of the problems that were faced.\n114.\tThe High Commissioner of the Portuguese Government, representative of the Chief of State, has now assumed office in Mozambique and will guarantee until 25 June 1975 the date set for independence the functioning of a transitional government. The latter, composed of a majority of FRELIMO members and a number of Portuguese representatives, will unless precipitate acts prejudice the future of an independent Mozambique ensure the transfer of administration and of all State powers to the State.\n115.\tIt should be noted that each Territory under Portuguese administration is a .separate case with its own special features, which must thus be considered in the light of those special features in a pragmatic and realistic manner. The case of Angola, for example, is one of enormous complexity because of various factors, the principal one being the diversity indeed, the division among the necessary partners in negotiations. It is also, of all the Territories under Portuguese colonial domination, the one with the largest population of European origin. Nevertheless, contacts have been made on various levels, not only with the liberation movements,, but also with the leaders of neighboring countries, and we are sure that in the case of Angola, as in the previous cases, the best possible solution will be. found, a solution which assures an independent future free of colonial and neo-colonial pressures and promotes the progress and racial harmony of its people.\n116.\tWith respect to the other Territories in accordance with the declaration made during the visit of the Secretary-General to Lisbon, Portugal has solemnly reaffirmed what its constitutional laws already guarantee: that it fully recognizes the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. Portugal is therefore ready to apply the United Nations decisions to that effect, reaffirming also the fulfillment of its obligations arising from chapter XI of the United Nations Charter and General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), which contains the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as well as those resolutions that refer to Territories under Portuguese administration.\n117.\tFollowing the traditions of this Organization, and in accordance with the practice which seems most appropriate, the territorial integrity of the present colonies will be maintained during the process of decolonization. Thus, in a few months a free and democratic Portugal has given to the world irrefutable proof of its intentions the sincerity of which can no longer possibly be doubted and now presents itself to the international community with concrete and definite achievements to its credit in the area of decolonization.\n118.\tPortugal wishes to put an end to the sad position of isolation to which the force of events had condemned it and declares itself ready to co-operate actively with all the countries of the world, regardless of their political and social systems or ideological preferences. Thus, and for the first time, Portugal comes to this rostrum with a sincere desire to integrate itself fully within the international community and to assume within it its proper place. I therefore call for the unreserved acceptance of the new Portugal by the community of nations, as is only just. I call, too, for the new Portugal to be able quickly to establish normal relations with all States without exception, and I should like to mention here as an example the desire, which I believe to be reciprocal, of the Portuguese and Indian peoples to see their old and fruitful relations restored on all levels.\n119.\tThe breaking off of relations with the Republic of India the consequence of a conflict which could have been avoided had there been a minimum of flexibility on the part of Portugal represents one of the consequences of colonialism. At the time when Portugal is now breaking definitively with its colonial past, the re-establishment of friendly relations with the Republic of India would constitute a great symbolic gesture.\n120.\tConsequently, I believe that it would be unjust to continue to apply moral or other sanctions against my country, since, in a solemn declaration of faith, it proclaims its sincere adherence to the ideals of peace among all peoples and all nations and its unshakable confidence in fraternal dialog among all peoples; while at the same time it affirms unequivocally its desire for co-operation and for embarking upon mutually advantageous co-operation.\n121.\tThis profession of faith is quite clear and was laid down from the very beginning in the Program of the Armed Forces Movement and in the Program of the Provisional Government, released on 25 April, which enumerated the fundamental points of our foreign policy. Permit me to mention them here:\nRespect for the principles of independence and equality among States and /ion-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.\nRespect for current international treaties, especially the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and also trade and financial commitments undertaken previously; active contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security.\nIntensification of trade and political relations with the countries of the European Economic Community.\nMeasures to strengthen the practical effectiveness of the Luso-Brazilian Community.\nMaintenance of links with the United Kingdom, Portugal's oldest ally. \nContinued good-neighborly relations with Spain.\nGreater solidarity with the Latin countries in Europe and the Americas.\nMaintenance of our traditional friendship with the United States of America.\nCreation of diplomatic and trade relations with all the countries of the world.\nRenewing of historical relations with the Arab countries.\nRevision of the information policy in foreign countries.\nCultural and social support for the Portuguese communities scattered throughout the world.\nDefinition of a realistic policy towards the third- world countries.\nParticipation in, and active co-operation with, the United Nations and, in general, with international organizations of co-operation.\n122.\tIn accordance with those principles, we feel entitled to hope that the United Nations and the specialized agencies will lift the embargoes and restrictions which hitherto have affected Portugal and will henceforth promote the participation of Portuguese representatives in bodies from which they have been excluded for so many years.\n123.\tAll around us, despite the efforts of the United Nations to avoid conflicts and wars, there are arising in various places confrontation resulting from inequalities among people, from ambitions to dominate, from social and other injustices and from racism and colonialism. Portugal, a renewed and developing country, a country without any thirst for power, which has begun to undertake, with the courage it has found in its own people, the gigantic task of peace, voices the hope that all the nations of the world will refrain from conflicts which can solve nothing.\n124.\tIt is indispensable for a formula to be found which will make possible the diversion of the astronomical sums of money designed for armaments so often a total waste to the accelerated development of the less favored nations. Reconsidering the General Assembly's resolution proposing that each country apportion 10 per cent of its arms expenditure to aid economic growth [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)], we would like to suggest that apart from this minimal contribution which the majority have not made a fund could be created, the size of which would correspond to the development needs of the third-world countries, which are so poor. More than agreement for the partial reduction of certain weapons, more than promises of detente, which are also important, it is development and it is the gradual reduction of the gap dividing the poorer countries of the world from the industrialized countries which will contribute most towards peace between men.\n125.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is continuing in Geneva, is making a praiseworthy effort to bring about a climate of detente. Portugal, within the measure of its own modest influence, will seek to contribute towards this detente, and, to that end, has already established normal relations with the socialist countries of Eastern Europe. But beyond European detente, I am thinking now of world detente which requires from all of us a moment of reflection on the oneness of the human race, so rich in its diversity.\n126.\tThe cosmic and planetary man of the centuries to come cannot afford to be divided by the differences of race, creed and ideology which today confront the world and diminish it. Portugal, so many centuries old, a pioneer in contacts between the most varied civilizations, turns towards the horizon of the year 2000 with the hope that humanity will awake to its common origin and its common destiny.\n127.\tThe Portuguese people, free from the burdens of internal oppression and colonial domination, have recovered their traditional character and their universal humanism which, in the perhaps somewhat exaggerated words of Arnold Toynbee, has brought them to do \\\"more for human brotherhood than any other people\\\".\n128.\tI cannot help but think of the violation of human rights still frequent in so many countries which have subscribed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but which do not respect it in their every-day practice. That was the case in Portugal itself only a few months ago. In this regard, the Portuguese Government declares itself opposed to all forms of oppression and racial discrimination, and, though it holds as fundamental the rule of non-intervention in the affairs of other States, it cannot but condemn most categorically the existence and perpetuation of discriminatory social systems such as apartheid.\n129.\tAs I have said, I believe that the problems posed by international insecurity result above all from an unjust distribution of the world's wealth, a reflection, certainly, of natural conditions, but also of old injustices which so many peoples throughout history have had to suffer. We cannot allow the world to continue to be divided into two hemispheres: the developed and the under-developed, the latter providing raw materials and receiving, in the form of all kinds of discriminatory measures, nothing but humiliation.,\n130.\tAs became so obvious during the sixth special session in April, machinery must urgently be created at the global level, to diminish the imbalance between rich and poor countries. Portugal situated at the cross-roads of the world, a European country and a country which has so many ancient links with Africa, a European country but so close, by the very character of its people, to the third world, a country facing the sea, a sea which will be the road of the future as it was in the past knows that development is the new name of peace, as was so well stated by Pope Paul VI, And this peace, as we know, will be obtained, only when we have eliminated the great imbalances among peoples.\n131.\tBefore concluding, I would like to salute our brother countries in Latin America, pioneers in anti-colonialism, with which we are linked by so many historical ties and this is something I am compelled to mention today. I trust you will understand me if I address myself particularly to Brazil, with which we are connected by undying affinities of history, culture, sentiment and humanity, and with which we form a linguistic and cultural community, the development of which will yield many advantages to the international community.\n132.\tMy last words will, however, be for Africa, a continent with which Portugal has always maintained special relations, unhappily affected in recent years by a stupid colonial war, which is now happily being brought to an end. Permit me, therefore, to issue a call for reconciliation and the re-establishment of the most fraternal relations between Africa and the new Portugal, the new Portugal where Africa will always find support and aid. In that continent, where we follow so attentively the co-ordination of interests and efforts through that great regional organization the Organization of African Unity [OAU]there live Portuguese-speaking peoples, who populate new and important countries that can benefit from the maintenance of close ties of. co-operation among themselves. Similar ties of cooperation are being formed and developed with Portugal, on the basis of equality, fraternity and strict respect for the independence of each country.\n133.\tTies should be formed also with other countries of Africa with which Portugal desires to establish solid links of co-operation and friendship. Since there is no danger of the creation on the part of a country like Portugal which has no ambition for power of ambiguous relations of a neo-colonialist type, relations that in any case the Portuguese socio-economic structure could never permit, my country will be able to rediscover its vocation as a meeting ground between two worlds and might even become an exemplary connecting link between Europe and Africa.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of Costa Rica I should like to join the many speakers who have congratulated you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. We trust that your leadership will be as effective as that of your predecessor. It is with pride that, as a Latin American, I have herd participants at the twenty-eighth session express their approval at the extremely effective manner in which Mr. Leopoldo Benites conducted our discussions. He was always an imaginative and dispassionate President, who never displayed any fanaticism and who did not allow his ideas to divert him from the proper application of the Charter and the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.\n2.\tCosta Rica, a Central American country, has felt the tragedy of the sister Republic of Honduras as though it were its own. The Foreign Minister of that afflicted country, my good friend Cesar Batres, described to this Assembly on 25 September [2242nd meeting] the loss of life and the suffering that Honduras has had to endure as the result of the fury of the forces of nature. The material loss and the economic destruction have been so great that the people of Honduras by themselves could never repair the damage.\n3.\tThat is why generous international assistance has become indispensable, and this Organization, representing the international community, and many of its Members individually have already started to give such assistance. We are thankful for this overwhelming expression of solidarity .with our brothers from Honduras, and we make an appeal for redoubled efforts in the very difficult task of rebuilding the economy- of Honduras, which Hurricane Fifi has left in such a deplorable state.\n4.\tCosta Rica was the first Latin American nation to recognize the State of Bangladesh. Since 1972 we have supported its admission to the United Nations. On 10 June 1974 my delegation had the pleasure of .voting at the 1776th meeting of the Security Council in favor of the draft resolution recommending the admission of Bangladesh to the Organization. Therefore, it should surprise no one that now that the representatives of that nation have taken their place in our midst, we Costa Ricans should extend our warmest welcome to them.\n5.\tWe are pleased to note that the admission of Bangladesh is the result of the improvement brought about in the situation in the Asian subcontinent by the far-sighted and peace-promoting attitude of the three Governments involved in the 1971 war, namely, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The manner in which these Governments resolved a conflict which was as bloody as it was ancient should serve as an example to other parts of the world.\n6.\tThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also deserves a tribute for having implemented with singular effectiveness the New Delhi Agreement of 28 August 1973, which provided for the repatriation of the Bengalis from Pakistan and of the Pakistanis from Bangladesh. In the introduction to his report to this session, the Secretary-General states: \\\"More than 241,000 persons were moved across the subcontinent in that operation, which has been described as the largest airlift of human beings ever organized\\\". [Al9601lAdd.l, p. 6]\n7.\tThe enlightened and progressive eradication of British colonialism in the Antilles enables us today to extend a welcome also to a new American State: Grenada. We wish this new Caribbean nation every success and we hope to maintain with it very close bilateral relations, as well as warm relations within the Latin American group of States in the United Nations.\n8.\tThe independence of Guinea-Bissau and its admission to the United Nations are of very great significance in the lengthy struggle against colonialism. It is the beginning of the end of the Portuguese colonial empire in Africa, and that is the result both of the heroic struggle of the people of Guinea-Bissau to achieve self-determination and of the revolution for liberation waged by the Portuguese people themselves. On 25 April 1974, in Portugal, a dictatorial regime which had tried to drown in blood every expression of freedom of the Portuguese in their own country, as well as of the population of the colonies, came to an end.\n9.\tWe were very moved by the statement made in this Hall by the Foreign Minister of Portugal, Mr. Mario Soares. Among other things, he said:\n. . I represent here a new Portugal which has nothing to do with the one which was so repeatedly condemned in this Organization . . .\n\\\"This new Portugal has ceased to be a hostile and silent country within the United Nations, constantly refusing to fulfill its obligations. . .\nThe Assembly warmly applauded Minister Soares when, with obvious sincerity, he said:\n\\\"I feel particularly honored to have participated personally in the process of the decolonization of Guinea-Bissau ... It can only be regretted and I say this with a feeling of anguish that this process of decolonization, so long delayed, has left behind it a long, useless war in which so many of the young men of both countries died or were left disabled/' [2239th meeting, paras. 95, 96 and 102]\n10.\tIn warmly greeting the representatives of Guinea-Bissau who have taken their seat in this Hall, I express the hope that very soon, and with the co-operation of the new Portugal, the States which will emerge from what have thus far been the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique, Angola and the Cape Verde Islands will achieve independence and enter our Organization.\n11.\tOf course, Costa Rica does not confine its hopes to the decolonization of the Portuguese Territories. In keeping with its anti-colonialist tradition, my country will most firmly support all the efforts to achieve self-determination made by peoples still subjected to any form of colonial domination, irrespective of their geographical location.\n12.\tMy delegation agrees with the statement made by the representative of Brazil, Mr. Antonio Azeredo da Silveira, in his opening speech in this general debate, that just as important as the support to be given to the people struggling to achieve independence is the action undertaken to induce the Governments of the metropolitan countries to abandon, as Portugal has just done, their policy of colonial domination. He went on to say:\n\\\"For the Brazilian Government, the challenge faced by those who want to rid the world of the colonial stigma is the challenge of efficacy. To blame the colonizing past is not what matters; what matters is rather to help build the future of free nations.\\\" [2238th meeting, para. 15]\n13.\tCosta Rica is a member of the Credentials Committee and, since certain aims have-been pursued which are not within that Committee's competence, I should like to state my delegation's understanding of its task. Rule 27 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly states:\n\\\"The credentials of representatives and the names of members of a delegation shall be submitted to the Secretary-General if possible not less than one week before the opening of the session. The credentials shall be issued either by the Head of the State or Government or by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.\\\"\n14.\tDuring the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly a request was made to the Legal Counsel of the Organization to give an expert opinion on the scope of this article. In giving his opinion, the Legal Counsel made the following statement:\n\\\"... credentials for the General Assembly may be defined as a document issued by the Head of State or Government or by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a State Member of the United Nations submitted to the Secretary-General designating the persons entitled to represent that Member at a given session of the General Assembly. Unlike the acceptance of credentials in bilateral relations, the question of recognition of a Government of a Member State is not involved, and substantive issues concerning the status^ Governments do not arise. . . .\\\"\n15.\tMy delegation shares the views expressed by the Legal Counsel. It is in keeping with the universal practice with regard to the competence of the credentials committee in any international body or conference. It is also in keeping with the competence which article 28 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly grants the Credentials Committee, whose sole function is restricted to the almost mechanical task of determining whether the credentials with which representatives are accredited to the General Assembly have been legally issued by the Head of State or of Government or by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of that Member State.\n16.\tIt is in no way the task of that Committee to decide whether the Government issuing the credentials is or is not the legitimate representative of the peoples of that Member State. To grant that power to the Committee by means of an interpretation would be to flout legal logic, and would, furthermore, flagrantly violate the principle of non-intervention enshrined in Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter of the United Nations.\n17.\tNot even the Assembly or the Security Council has the power to express a judgment about the Government of a Member State, be it de jure or de facto, because that would be tantamount to interference in matters which fall within the internal jurisdiction of the State itself. Representatives can imagine the chaotic situation that would prevail if we were to discuss here the legitimacy of the Governments of each one of the Member States.\n18.\tStill less can we adopt a procedure whereby we reject the credentials of the representative of any Member State, as a means of preventing participation in the Assembly and in other bodies of the United Nations by any Government that my not be to the liking of the majority of Members. By not permitting participation by that Government, which, although perhaps repudiated by the majority, is still the Government in power in that Member State, in fact we would be excluding that Member State from participation in the Organization.\n19.\tIn accordance with Article 6 of the Charter, we can expel a Member State if repeated violations of the principles contained in the Charter have been proven. But this is not a decision that can be made by the Credentials Committee, either directly or indirectly. It is a most serious decision, and it can be taken only by the General Assembly by a two- thirds-majority vote of its Members, and only after such action has been recommended by the Security Council.\n20.\tIn view of the foregoing, Costa Rica will oppose the Credentials Committee's going even one whit beyond its specific duties in examining the credentials of representatives to the General Assembly, duties that, I repeat, are solely to determine whether or not the document which informs the Secretary-General of the names of the people representing a Member State at a given session of the Assembly the document which we call the credentials has been duly issued by the Head of State , or of Government or by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of a Member of the United Nations.\n21.\tDuring the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly [2153rd meeting], Costa Rica was elected a member of the Security Council. My country humbly accepted this high honor, and promised diligently to discharge the very delicate duty assigned to it.\n22.\tIn presiding at the 1761st session of the Council on 17 January 1974, the first meeting of this year, we stated the views that Costa Rica holds regarding that peace-keeping organ. After 10 months of the work of the Council, experience has confirmed the statement I made, and I am now able to give a brief analysis of the important matters discussed in that body.\n23.\tArticle 2 of the Charter of the United Nations mentions the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.. Nevertheless, this equality was not maintained with regard to the formation of the Security Council, since it gave, permanent seats in the Council to the five countries that were the main Powers when the San Francisco Charter was signed. Furthermore, its important agreements required the affirmative vote of the five so-called \\\"great Powers\\\" before they could be considered valid. \n24. This was due to the fact that the very structure of the United Nations is based on the essential political assumption of harmony and co-operation among the great Powers; and since the maintenance of peace is the main objective of the Organization, its peacemaking machinery is based on the hypothesis of joint action by the five great Powers. That is why the disagreement of one of them -namely, the veto is sufficient to paralyze this peace-making machinery.\n25.\tTo some, the concentration of power in the permanent members implies an attempt to establish a world government of the five Powers akin to an international oligarchy. To others, this preeminence of the great Powers is a fair price which the medium- sized and small countries must pay to obtain the co-operation of the more powerful nations in the United Nations. The veto is a safety valve to ensure that the United Nations does not exceed itself in accepting certain unrealistic commitments which may be beyond its power.\n26.\tCosta Rica has always felt that, irrespective of the thesis accepted as the ideal, the United Nations was so conceived that effective action for the maintenance of international peace and security is possible, as we have said, only with the assistance of the great Powers. In order to change that situation, we should not only have to create a new organization -a very unlikely eventuality - but further, it would be indispensable to change the thinking of the main protagonists of the world, an even more unlikely eventuality.\n27.\tIn realistic terms, we are convinced that we cannot achieve that goal at this time. It cannot even be said with certainty that it is the most suitable goal. That is why it is better to base our action on what can be reasonably hoped for from the foreign policy of States. Otherwise, as we have already stated, we run the risk of drawing up catalogs of what is desirable rather than building on what is possible.\n28.\tThe Security Council was given immense power by the Charter. That power derives from the authority which it has to impose coercive measures and other measures which involve certain punitive elements, agreed upon in the name of the entire international community.\n29.\tThe compulsory and binding decisions of the Council along these lines become a kind of legal sentence. But they should not lead us to consider the Council as a law enforcement body whose decisions should be free from all the incidental elements characteristic of political decisions.\n30.\tFar from hurting the Council, its political structure is the element which gives it its strength. Its decisions are not backed up by the impartiality of judges. The States of which it is composed are committed to finding viable formulas to harmonize differing and often opposing political ideas.\n31.\tFor that reason, the very strength of the Security Council becomes fully evident only when it makes decisions. Its function acquires true meaning and value to the extent that it ensures international peace and security under the Charter and, since decisions require first and foremost the agreement of the five great Powers, the validity of our premise is confirmed: peace-making by the Security Council is possible only when there exists harmony and cooperation among the great Powers.\n32.\tThus, when disagreement among the permanent members prevents the Council from reaching decisions in situations which threaten international peace and security, the Council's very existence as a peacemaking organ is deeply affected. The nature of international disputes which the Security Council must deal with is a matter of such high priority that the absence of a decision is as harmful as a delayed decision. Any delay in implementing possible solutions undermines the international standing of the Council and cruelly harms the cause of peace.\n33.\tIn the Security Council the delegation of Costa Rica has constantly pleaded for immediate action in the face of situations which might affect international peace and security. Regardless of the political interests of the States which make up the Council, we have always maintained that peace is the highest priority and that there is no justification for putting off matters so closely tied to the vital interests of mankind -namely, those concerning war and peace. We must find a consensus, in order to be able to work on the basis of agreement, negotiation and compromise.\n34.\tTo those who tell us that it is immoral to com-promise with an ideological adversary, we reply that the problems of war and peace involve the highest of all moral values, namely, respect for human life. Therefore, we have always maintained in the Council that more immoral than negotiating with those having different ideologies is closing the door to dialog, because, when it means the indiscriminate and large-scale destruction of human life, war is the greatest immorality of all.\n35.\tWhen, because of disagreements that have emerged between permanent members, decisions have been delayed that called for urgent and immediate action on the part of the Council, we have seen that the further development of the conflict has made it even more difficult for the Security Council to find solutions.\n36.\tIn the various situations in which peace-promoting activity has thus been paralyzed, my delegation has always expressed its concern, because each time it has become more firmly convinced that the Council's decisions can have their desired effect only if the action it has decided on is promptly and swiftly carried out. Experience shows that any delay inevitably widens the gulf between the uncontrolled forces at war with each other and unleashes new elements that increase the danger of the conflict.\n37.\tYear after year, the crisis in the Middle East has occupied a preponderant place in the debates of this Assembly, indicating the great importance the international community attaches to the problem and also its inability to resolve it.\n38.\tThe fourth Arab-Israeli war broke out in October 1973 -that is, at the beginning of the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly. Thanks to the combined efforts of bilateral diplomacy and the collective action of this Organization, it was possible to ensure that the conflict did not unleash a new, and last, world war. It was also possible to put an end to armed conflict between the Israeli, Egyptian and Syrian combatants.\n39.\tSecurity Council resolution 338 (1973), which called for a cease-fire and the initiation of peace talks between the parties, was not implemented immediately. That was one more example of failure to comply with decisions of the Security Council, which unfortunately occurs frequently these days. Hostilities ceased only when, thanks to the action of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, on 19 January 1974, Israel and Egypt, and, on 31 May 1974, Israel and Syria, signed cease-fire agreements.\n40.\tThose agreements were important because they constituted the first direct contact between the warring forces. If they are diligently maintained, they may open the way for successful peaceful negotiation of all the problems separating the Arabs and the Israelis.\n41.\tAt the beginning of the general debate, the Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, told this Assembly:\n\\\"[These agreements] were achieved, above all, because of the wisdom of the leaders of the Middle East who decided that there had been enough stalemate and war, that more might be gained by testing each other in negotiation than by testing each other on the battlefield.\\\" [2238th meeting, para. 59]\n42.\tNevertheless, earlier on, the Secretary of State had said that although the cease-fire and the two agreements for separating the forces had provided a breathing space, the shadow of war was still there. He said;,\n\\\"The legacy of hatred and suffering, the sense of irreconcilability have begun to yield -however haltingly- to the process of negotiation. But we still have a long road ahead.\n\\\"One side seeks the recovery of territory and justice for a displaced people. The other side seeks security and recognition by its neighbors of its legitimacy as a nation^ In the end, the common goal of peace surely is \\\"broad enough to embrace all these aspirations.\\\" [Ibid, para. 56 and 57]\n43.\tThe general framework for the establishment of peace in that region was laid down by Security Council resolution 338 (1973), as a result of which the Peace Conference on the Middle East started its work in Geneva in December 1973; the Conference has since .then not made much progress. However, it is heartening to recall that all parties have recognized that the problems to be dealt with are complex, and for that reason one must be patient and try to dissipate doubts before making commitments in any new initiative.\n44.\tThe international community can, however, facilitate those very difficult negotiations by creating the right atmosphere for reconciliation. Mutual recriminations expressed in this forum undoubtedly do not help to achieve that purpose. We must strive to maintain the progress made before the signing of the agreement on the separation of forces. We must struggle to see to it that the hunger for peace and the desire to And lasting solutions that emerged as the result of the devastation caused by the last war in the Middle East are not weakened by sterile discussion or the bitterness that grows from the lack of speedy and positive solutions.\n45.\tThe international community could take the initiative in seeking ways to make the warring parties and their allies moderate their mutual verbal attacks. The mass communications media of some of the Arab States and their allies are very effective in presenting Israel as the hated enemy which has no right whatsoever to be located in former Palestine. That kind of propaganda can boomerang against those very leaders who might otherwise be prepared to negotiate a just peace, because their peoples, encouraged by the constant publicity campaign of the mass media, may resist accepting whatever their leaders have in good faith succeeded in working out.\n46.\tThus there seems to be a marked contrast between the slow progress towards the achievement of peace that has been made this year -progress which must be maintained and protected at all costs- and the policy of open enmity between the parties that is made public even in these halls. Costa Rica hopes that the sense of the responsibility we share in resolving the problems of the Middle East will serve to moderate written and oral statements of aggression here and help the Assembly to co-operate in the creation of a less hostile atmosphere between Arab and Israeli that, unfortunately, I do not think will be favored by the inclusion in the agenda of the item on the question of Palestine as an issue separate from the Middle East, which was adopted at the 2236th meeting. This, however, does not mean that Costa Rica is indifferent to the destiny of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees seeking a permanent home. In this connexion, I would recall what was said by the Foreign Minister of Uruguay, Mr. Juan Carlos Blanco, on thiL problem [2240th meeting].\n47.\tThe United Nations is familiar indeed with the problems of Cyprus, problems that have existed since the moment when Cyprus attained its independence. The fight between the two communities on the island, Greek and Turkish, has been followed with close attention by the international community. For more than 10 years a United Nations Peacekeeping Force has been stationed in Cyprus. Our awareness of the problems of that island made us even more grief-stricken at the tragic events which broke the precarious peace at the beginning of August of this year.\n48.\tIn the Security Council Costa Rica has followed the events in Cyprus very closely. At the beginning of the crisis, when the peace was disturbed on Cyprus, we noted a lack of decision on the part of some of the permanent members. An opportunity was lost to take effective peace-making action in time and thus prevent further hostilities.\n49.\tCosta Rica shared the pain of that small nation which was powerless to stop a dispute involving other nations and other interests. We were greatly moved when we heard the news of the coup that had overthrown the constitutional President of Cyprus and learned that Cypriot soil was being trampled upon by foreign troop.\n50.\tThe delegation of Costa Rica severely criticized the badly timed and short-sighted attempt of th? Greek military dictatorship -which, as we now know, did not represent th? Greek people- to overthrow a legitimate Government. For my country could never accept any change in the structure of an independent and sovereign nation brought about by foreign intervention.\n51.\tAt the initial stages of the Cyprus conflict we were told that this was an internal matter, which meant that the Security Council could not take action on it. Costa Rica opposed that view. We stated that the removal of President Makarios had been planned and carried out by Greek military agents responding to the reckless ambitions of the military dictatorship that had done so much to that country, the cradle of Western civilization.\n52.\tCosta Rica stated that the Security Council must not allow itself to be paralyzed in cases where the \\\"... danger or threat no longer takes place on a battlefield but is surreptitiously displaced to a country and slyly disguises itself as an internal affair . . .\\\".\n53.\tSubsequently, when the Turkish invasion took place, because of the vacuum left by the lack of action by the Security Council, the fatal failure of the Security Council to act decisively in time became very obvious. When finally the Council decided to acknowledge that peace was being threatened, resolution 353 (1974) was adopted calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus.\n54.\tOur delegation has followed with attention the subsequent developments in Cyprus. We regret that the cease-fire resolution was not immediately implemented and, furthermore, that the part of the resolution regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops has still not been put into effect.\n55.\tCosta Rica wishes to state for the record that it approves the efforts made by the Secretary-General to restore constitutional order and peace to the afflicted Cypriot nation, and we will do our utmost to help find a formula under which the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus can be maintained because of the successful coexistence of the communities of Greek and Turkish origins.\n56.\tIn the year which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly, Argentina -and indeed Latin America as a whole- has suffered the loss of a great leader: President Juan Domingo Peron. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the memory of that statesman. His people will be guided by their memories of him in their search for justice, economic development and the reaffirmation of national sovereignty.\n57.\tAs was so well stated by the Argentine Foreign Minister, Mr. Alberto Vignes, great statesmen such as Peron will live beyond their lifetimes because \\\"their principles and objectives remain in force\\\" [ibid., para. 60]. And all of us here must agree with the eloquent and moving statement by Foreign Minister Vignes, on 24 September last, that \\\"[Peron's] prophetic ideas transformed him into the precursor of universalism and of a 'third-world position\\\" which are today recognized as being essential means for international coexistence\\\" [ibid. ].\n58.\tCosta Rica continues to have faith in the United Nations. We believe that, even though the Charter contains provisions which it would be desirable to. amend, the greatest Effectiveness of the Organization depends not on its legal foundations but rather on the political will of its Member States to live in accordance with its principles and to abide by the resolutions of the appropriate bodies and organs. For that reason my country, small as it is, wishes to preach by example. Costa Rica practices an international policy consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and it has never been remiss in shouldering responsibilities flowing from the activities of the organs of the international community.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the honor conferred on Ecuador when I was elected President of the twenty-eighth session of this Assembly had the disadvantage of preventing me, for almost one year, from exercising the exclusive representation of my people; nor, during that time, when I served my country at a high international level, was I able to serve it in other forums.\n40.\tOn returning to ground level with a clear conscience from having done my duty and resuming the full and exclusive representation of Ecuador, it is a great pleasure for me that my first duty is to congratulate you, on behalf of the people and Government of Ecuador, on your accession to the Presidency of the General Assembly. These grave moments of conflict in international life demand the clairvoyance of the statesman and the tough energy of the fighter, two qualities that are combined in your personality, which was formed in the fight for independence for your country and then in your continuous efforts undertaken in your exalted capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria to liberate the peoples of the world and to create a new order.\n41.\tIt also gives me great pleasure that one of my first duties is to greet, on behalf of the people and Government of Ecuador, the three new Members of the Organization, each from a different continent: Grenada, our sister by geography but above all by history, which since the history of the Iberian-Indian-African peoples of Latin America began in the Caribbean, has been a melting-pot of peoples and a matrix of nations; Bangladesh, set at the heart of a millenary culture; and Guinea-Bissau, which won its independence in an unflagging battle, to whose heroes and martyrs I wish to pay tribute in the noble and austere person of Amilcar Cabral.\n42.\tHaving fulfilled those pleasant duties, I must now refer to an event that has plunged my people into mourning: the tragedy of Honduras. Hurricane winds, torrential rains and high tides transformed the beautiful tropical country of Honduras into an enormous devastated area under whose mud 10,000 human beings are buried. Those who survived were attacked by maddened vipers, and, in the midst of the desolation, the specter of famine, disease and misery was raised.\n43.\tI do not wish to make of my statement to the General Assembly a kind of broadened agenda or an advance sample of the agenda items which we shall have an opportunity to deal with in the respective Main Committees or in plenary meetings when items are assigned to them. I shall now refer only to those matters which, although they do not yet appear specifically on our agenda, are implicit in many of the questions we are to debate.\n44.\tIt may seem to be a time-worn cliche if I say what I have been repeating in my latest statements and reaffirm today -namely, that we are in an era of transition which we can face only if we have a clear and accurate awareness of the change. Twenty-nine years ago, an historic event occurred: the organization of the international community for the noble purposes of living together in peace as good neighbors, prohibiting the use and even the mere threat of force, advocating respect for the dignity of free man without discrimination and enshrining the right of peoples to decide on their own forms of government.\n45.\tWe know that since the United Nations came into being there have been flagrant violations of its principles and purposes -for example, war as a means of expanding frontiers; the occupation of territories by force; the refusal to grant peoples their right to self-determination; the monstrous injustice of apartheid in South Africa and Rhodesia; the artificial division of peoples having ancient homogeneous cultures; the mass devastation of lands by barbarous methods of chemical warfare; and the use of hunger as a weapon. All that is true. But it is also true that the organization of the international community which the United Nations represents has created an international public opinion the obvious pressure of which has prevented the outbreak of a world war and the hegemony of a dominant Power and has made possible the liberation of colonial peoples which are today full-fledged States. The clearest expression of that to be found at this time is Portugal's break with an obsolete idea of domination, a break it has begun with the applause and sympathy of all the peoples of the world. Our civilization, which has successively been Mediterranean and Atlantic and has extended to every ocean, has come to be the civilization of the globe, of man, of all men, of all the peoples of a planet which, small and inadequate though it has become, is the only one we have to live for.\n46.\tI would not wish to evoke poetic images of facile rhetoric. Instead, I shall refer to the image used by an economist with a cool and clear mind, Mr. Robert McNamara, who, at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in 1972, said we are passengers on a spaceship on which one fourth of the people travels comfortably while three fourths travel in conditions of hunger, disease and destitution.\n47.\tAfter the successive failures of the efforts of the first United Nations Development Decade, the crisis in raw materials compelled us to hold the sixth special session of the General Assembly on the noble and, I would venture to say, bold initiative of President Boumediene of Algeria. The special session drew attention to the vital fact that the international community requires measures other than partial steps; it requires a new international economic order. In my opinion, this is the beginning of the second great era of the United Nations since it was established as the expression of the world community.\n48.\tI must with alarm confess that, instead of an atmosphere of co-operation, interrelationship and confidence which the establishment of a new international economic order requires, this session of the General Assembly has begun in an atmosphere of suspicion and threat. That is terribly negative because threats' and recriminations usually rebound against those who launch them, like a boomerang thrown by an inexpert hand.\n49.\tIn the first place, it is not true -and I would say it is hardly loyal to say that it is- that the economic deterioration and paralysis in development of those countries described as most seriously affected is due exclusively to the rise in petroleum prices. Before oil prices were raised, there was an increase of up to 400 per cent in the cost of food-stuffs such as wheat and sugar, building materials such as steel and cement, agricultural machinery, and products derived from hydrocarbons, such as acrylics and fertilizers. But in those cases the victims were not the industrialized countries which process raw materials; the. victims were the weak peoples of the developing world, which in silence suffered the effects upon their balances of payments.\n50.\tNor can runaway inflation be attributed solely to the so-called energy crisis. Inflation arises when more money is minted than is justified by the production of goods and therefore the vast increase in military expenditure and wars of political hegemony have generated inflation that has inevitably been exported to the economically weaker countries. Furthermore, the system established at Bretton Woods has led to an unequal development which has further enriched the rich and impoverished the poor.\n51.\tFinally, the rise in prices of oil and its derivatives has not affected developed countries that lack those products or have a deficit in their production such as the European countries and Japan in the same way as it has affected the United States, which depends on foreign oil imports for only about 12 per cent of its needs and whose oil companies, in the midst of the crisis, made profits of up to 800 per cent.\n52.\tLastly, I should like to point out that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] is not a political organization, since its members comprise countries with different systems of government and differing social goals; nor is it an ethnic organization, since in it are represented Arabs, Africans, Iranians, Asians and Latin Americans; nor is it an organization of petroleum producers, since it represents only 85 per cent of the producers; nor is it a mutual aid society, because I know of no decision which commits the wealthier among its members to render assistance to the poorer. It is simply an organization of exporters whose essential purpose is to defend prices that for many years bore no relation to the rising prices of other products while companies amassed wealth by exploiting a non-renewable resource.\n53.\tIn his message addressed to President Ford of the United States on the occasion of his statement at the beginning of the present session of the Assembly, as published in The New York Times on 25 September 1974, that great statesman who governs the destinies of Venezuela, Mr. Carlos Andres Perez, said:\n\\\"Venturing to interpret the policy of OPEC, I would assure you that it is the hope of our petroleum-producing countries that an agreement between the countries producing raw materials and the industrialized countries which will be equitable and bring international justice can be reached, through a world body such as the United Nations, with a view to striking a proper and acceptable balance between the prices paid to us for the labor of the men and women of our poverty-stricken countries and those paid by our economies for the imports we require.\\\"\n54.\tWithin OPEC there are different degrees of development, ranging from that of countries which can produce 8 million barrels daily, to that of countries, such as Ecuador, with a maximum output of 230,000 barrels daily; and from that of countries which process their hycro-carbons to countries, such as Ecuador, which have a very weak processing industry, and are therefore exporters of crude and importers of the derivatives of the refined product for which they are paying prices higher than their profits, with serious damage resulting to their balance of payments.\n55.\tIn this respect I should like to reaffirm the statement made not long ago by my Government in a communication addressed to the Secretary-General to the effect that Ecuador, with a low average production of crude, without a petrochemical industry and with a very small processing industry, is not in a position to be a capital donor merely because it is a member of OPEC. Ecuador, on the contrary, is a developing country which requires economic assistance in the form of soft loans and substantial assistance with regard to the transfer of technology.\n56.\tYet, there is one obvious fact that nobody can honestly deny, and that is that the rise in oil prices has had a serious impact on the world economy, not merely on small producers that export ail their crude and purchase the derivatives at high prices and on countries that have strong processing industries hut lack oil, but on all the countries of the world, and particularly on those which have no oil, whose balances of payments have been shattered, whose production has been cut because of a lack of fuel and fertilizers and whose inflation has been accelerated. Those are the countries that have \\\"been described as the ones most seriously affected. On the other hand, the investment of the profits obtained, as a result of the rise in the price of oil, in shares -including bank shares- in multinational companies and real estate in the developed countries has added to an inflation already seriously accelerated by the arms race and the acquisition of arms by countries which previously did not have the means to acquire them. The total figure for investment in military expenditure in the world has risen to $207,405 million, at a time when mankind faces an imminent and so far inevitable threat of tragic world-wide famine.\n57.\tTo deal with this threatening problem -the approach of famine- two international conferences have been held, under the auspices of the United Nations yet in complete autonomy, and another will be held shortly, also under United Nations auspices. I shall refer to them briefly.\n58.\tPeople are forgetting that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the first stage of which was held at Caracas this summer, had as its origin the need for the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and the subsoil thereof to be used for peaceful purposes and to be exploited for the benefit of mankind, so as to promote the development of the weakest countries and avert the dangers of economic imbalances arising out of the illicit, one-sided enrichment of those nations that are technically and financially most powerful. This implies that the sea-bed under national jurisdiction is for the use and benefit of the coastal State and that the work of the Conference had chiefly to concentrate on the establishment of a legal regime and an administrative mechanism applicable to the exploitation of the vast wealth of the high seas for the benefit of mankind.\n59.\tYet so far interest has centered mainly on determining the extent of national jurisdiction rather than on the kinds of rights which the coastal State should exercise over its adjacent sea and the rights of mankind on the high seas. This is due to the unyielding action of countries with large fishing fleets, which desire to engage freely in their predatory activities.\n60.\tIn Caracas three positions emerged in regard to the extent of jurisdiction. The most restrictive accepts a maximum of 12 miles of territorial sea. The second position, which emerged in 1972, accepts as a compromise a territorial sea of 12 miles over which full sovereignty would be exercised and an adjacent zone of up to 200 miles that is, 188 miles more without any agreement so far as to the kinds of rights which would be exercised over the adjacent zone. The only agreement is that these would not be sovereign rights, which could be exercised over the territorial sea alone. The last position -which my country maintains and which I defended on its behalf from 1955 to 1972- is based on the right of the coastal State to extend its complete sovereignty over the adjacent sea, in accordance with the geographical, geological and ecological characteristics of the coast and the economic needs of its population for up to 200 miles from the base line.\n61.\tThe expression \\\"200-mile sea\\\" lacks meaning so long as it is not known what kinds of rights can be exercised over that zone, and to prevent such confusion, Ecuador has maintained and incorporated in its laws that its territorial sea extends for 200 miles and that over that zone it exercises full sovereignty, from which it should be understood that we cannot admit of a 200-mile sea without full sovereignty, as would be the case with the exclusive economic zone or the patrimonial sea.\n62.\tThe head of State of Ecuador, General Guillermo Rodriguez Lara, in a statement of which an extract was published in the Quito newspaper El Comercio on 26 July of this year, emphasized the importance of the 200-mile territorial sea -embodied in the territorial laws of Ecuador- and affirmed that the sovereign entity of Ecuador \\\"is prepared to stop piracy by the powerful and fully implement our laws in regard to maritime jurisdiction.\n63.\tThe second United Nations conference held this year was the World Population Conference held at Bucharest. In our opinion, its special importance lies in the fact that it has drawn attention to the problem of the population explosion, but has left each State free to seek its own solutions. Quite obviously, a major population explosion occurring simultaneously with a reduction in food production and an increase in the cost of building materials represents a dramatic threat. The key to the problem, therefore, must be to meet the overall needs of development.\n64.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly, in putting forward the need for a new international economic order, set immediate and long-term targets with which the present session of the General Assembly must deal. The immediate objectives were entrusted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was asked to organize, as the first measure of the Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI), an emergency operation to assist the most seriously affected countries. The long- term goals were entrusted to the Ad Hoc Committee on the Special Program, which has to submit to the Economic and Social Council recommendations on the machinery and scope of the Special Fund, also established by the same resolution, which would meet the urgent needs of the most seriously affected countries but whose ultimate purpose would be to meet the overall needs of development.\n65.\tWherever we turn, the problem of development confronts us. Its challenge is imperative and urgent, and given this challenge we cannot play with words as children play with colored balloons. \\\"Coexistence\\\", \\\"co-operation\\\", \\\"interdependence\\\" are not mere words: they are calls to action. The simple rite of shifting our blame to a scapegoat and getting rid of it is a subterfuge: it does not really free our conscience.\n66.\tThe inexorable fact we must face is that the sixth special session charged us irrevocably with creating a new international economic order: not any order, but a just, co-ordinated and interdependent order. We know that the developed and highly industrialized countries are going through a crisis. We understand that countries which have made enormous profits from raising oil prices are entitled to do this because they were formerly exploited and impoverished. But we know that if both could agree on prudent and well-planned investments, particularly in infrastructure, in the less fortunate or less developed countries, they might dispel the threat of hunger which looms over an anxious mankind and could thus give a successful start to the new international economic order.\n67.\tTo say that the new order must be based on inter-dependence is to state the obvious, but it is also an evident truth. Interdependence means that the powerful industrial countries must learn to depend on those which they formerly exploited and that those which were formerly dependent wish to replace dependence by interdependence. The new economic order must basically be a new Order in reciprocal economic dependence.\n68.\tSince the Industrial Revolution, the economic order has been based on the idea of empire and therefore on the colonial relationship of the extraction of cheap raw materials and the creation of expensive manufactured goods- that is, a situation of dependence. The new order must be based as far as possible on giving the previously exploited peoples the means to process their own raw materials and progressively to alter their feudal or colonial structures by increased development and better use of the riches of their soil and subsoil and of their adjacent sea.\n69.\tBecause of what I have said previously, I believe that the role of the present Assembly is of vital importance. Instead of wasting itself in sterile rhetoric or fruitless struggles, this Assembly should devote every effort of reason, imagination and, I venture to say, intuition to creating a new international economic order which will make it possible for a threatened mankind to enjoy a dignified and secure existence.\n70.\tIn concluding, may I be permitted to inject a personal note and to express my gratitude to all who have spoken so generously of my work as President of the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n71.\tOn the decision of my Government this will be the last time that I shall speak in a general debate of the General Assembly as the representative of Ecuador. I shall, of course, continue to exercise my functions until the end of the present session. During 18 previous sessions I have shared unforgettable days in the struggle for decolonization, against racism, for the strengthening of international security, against aggression, and in favor of non-intervention. From the Assembly I have received for my country and for myself honors which had never before been conferred on citizens of my country, such as the successive chairmanship of the Special Political Committee and of the First Committee, apart from the high honor of being the first citizen of Ecuador to have been President of the General Assembly. So that I am not speaking \\\"with a pained voice and looking at my shadow\\\", as Don Francisco de Quevedo, the Spanish poet, said. I am speaking with a feeling in which humility is mixed with pride but a feeling above all of gratitude to all of you as well as hope for your future action. I believe and have often said that every man has within himself a spark of life and hope which, like a torch that has been lit, must be handed on. I place my torch here with a living flame at a time when I feel that all my vital forces are undiminished. I do so with the clear faith that I have had and still have in the destiny of an international community organized to achieve the lofty purposes which the United Nations represents.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it would be ungracious of the representative of Algeria not to associate himself with all the compliments which have been paid to you, and perhaps he is best placed to estimate how much those compliments were justified and to what extent they were personally merited. Perhaps it will suffice to say how honored we feel, as Algerians and Africans, and to express our assurance that, under your enlightened guidance, the work of the twenty-ninth session will indeed be crowned with success.\n90.\tWe would also like to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Leopoldo Benites and assure him of our admiration and friendship for having presided so competently and with such courtesy over the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n91.\tIt is a formidable task for me to speak at the end of the general debate, after everything has already been said by distinguished previous speakers, and at best my statement could be only a pale reflection of what the Assembly has already heard. The problems have been posed and analyzed, suggestions have been put forward, advice has been given and solutions proposed. I hope, therefore, that no one is expecting from me an originality to which I cannot lay claim nor any infallible recipe for solving our difficulties. However, I must stress the feeling of concern in the face of the serious dangers threatening the world which marked most statements. These dangers arise not so much from the actual problems faced by the international community problems which it can now clearly see and of which it is now keenly aware as the fact that it has so far found it impossible to produce a satisfactory and lasting solution to them.\n92.\tThe striking contrast between this tragic impotence and the prodigious development of the powers of man and his mastery of his environment is, I believe, a paradox typical of our times, when the disparities by which our world is torn stand out more starkly than ever under the glare of powerful lights.\n93.\tThere is no doubt that, a quarter century after the Second World War, we are entering an era where not only the international order which has hitherto prevailed, but also the principles which are its very foundation and the philosophy from which it derives its very essence, are now being challenged. In terms of people, the challenge was expressed by the wave of protests which stirred the younger generations throughout the world. It is no doubt to the credit of the old order that it has at least forged the new framework of international society; but this very evolution dooms this old order to oblivion unless it is able to adapt itself rapidly.\n94.\tThis new world is supposed to be, above all, a world of mature and responsible people, free from all tutelage and rejecting all paternalism. The rules of the game can no longer be those that decree that only the\nmost powerful can play. The lesson we can learn from history is that nothing lasting can be built against the will of the people. This lesson has never been better illustrated than in our times, which have in addition\nconfirmed that this will of the people is as sacred and as invincible whatever the latitude or continent.  \n95.\tIt is against this background that we should assess the changes that have occurred in international relations. While we would not dream of diminishing the importance of detente between the great Powers, we cannot, however, be more keenly aware of how much further we have to go before we can bring international morality into line with the new structure of our society.\n96. The claims of all these young countries which have just made their entry into the international arena and have suddenly become aware of their responsibilities cannot be met indefinitely by the prohibitions of an obsolete order, an order which they are all the less inclined to honor precisely because it was that order which permitted their enslavement, the plundering of their resources and the destruction of their identity. Obviously, one cannot build any new order without first attempting to wipe away all wrongs and to restore rights which have been disregarded or suppressed.\n97.\tWhether it be a political or an economic crisis, the situation is in fact the same. There is the same conflict between outmoded concepts and the exigencies of the modern world. Decolonization, for example, fits precisely into this context and, at the same time, is an inevitable stage on the road towards that society of free and sovereign peoples that will be the international community of tomorrow.\n98.\tProgress achieved in the process of independence for the Portuguese colonies gives us a rare occasion for satisfaction within the present world context. While we were happy to welcome here the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, we also greeted with relief the substantial changes which have occurred in Portugal itself and which, H they have to prove something, at least demonstrate that the freedom of the Portuguese people is intimately connected with that of the African peoples which, like it, have been subjected to the domination of the same regime, Fascist at home and colonialist \\\".broad. A very valuable lesson must be learned from the Portuguese experience which shows that one cannot destroy the freedom of others without affecting one's own freedom. Other countries besides Portugal have also had occasion to learn this lesson, to their cost. If this lesson were digested properly, humanity would, I am sure, find itseW free of the threats to its tranquility.\n99.\tThese victories in the anti-colonialist struggle should not conceal from us everything that still remains to be done not only to complete the liberation of colonial territories, but also and above all to put an end to the attacks on human dignity and human values, constituted by the policy of apartheid of South Africa and the racist minority regime of Rhodes^. This year the General Assembly has once again rejected by a larger majority than ever the credentials of the South African delegation, thus reflecting international public opinion, which is unanimous in its repugnance of apartheid. The Assembly wanted to make its condemnation more effective by asking the Security Council to review the relations between the United Nations and South Africa. But no one should be deluded by this. It is above all a test, a test of the determination of our community to impose respect for its principles, bu: a test also of the sincerity of its Members, particularly the most powerful, in their attachment to these principles.\n100.\tSince I am talking about African problems and decolonization, I should in my turn say a few words about the Sahara under Spanish domination. The Assembly has long been familiar with this problem and is aware of the interest attached by Algeria to all problems of liberation, an interest all the greater when there are involved as is the case here obvious geopolitical considerations, and when the desire of the peoples of this region for unity is founded on so many links of all kinds which have always existed among them despite the vicissitudes of time and history.\n101.\tAlgeria, Morocco and Mauritania have long been calling upon Spain to decolonize this Territory and allow its population to exercise its right to self-determination. For many years, in fact, these three sister States have co-ordinated their efforts towards this end in the OAU, in the non-aligned group and in particular at the United Nations.\n102.\tThe General Assembly has always supported this action and, in resolutions adopted at the last few sessions, it has constantly called upon the administering Power to organize, in agreement with the countries concerned, a referendum of self-determination, under the control of and guaranteed by our Organization. While affirming its attachment to the principle of the self-determination of peoples, the Spanish Government has, however, embarked upon a course of procrastination which has given rise to doubts as to the sincerity of its intentions and has even gradually led to a highly regrettable deterioration of the situation.\n103.\tAlthough the international community has noted the most recent statements of the Madrid Government, whereby it has undertaken to implement the decisions of the General Assembly, the concerted and common position o* Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania has been clearly express throughout these years, and it cannot be the subject of any misunderstanding: as to the natural interest of these three countries in a peaceful, satisfactory and lasting solution of this problem; as to the need to permit the Sahrawi people to exercise their self-determination and, finally, as to their wish to prevent this problem from degenerating into a source of insecurity in a particularly sensitive area. Stated thus, this position can accommodate any suggestion which would respect its principal elements.\n104.\tMorocco has just expressed its wish to place this matter before the International Court of Justice. Mauritania, to our pleasure, has agreed to this procedure. Algeria can see nothing but advantage in an arrangement which has been agreed upon by its brothers and allies, a procedure which would clarify the juridical and historical aspects of the problem by means of an opinion of the Court. That procedure will, of course, facilitate the search for a final agreement and will show the way to it. In any case, it goes without saying that the opinion of the population directly concerned will always be the most important element and the decisive factor in any settlement. Algeria's interest would be entirely satisfied if the decolonization of Sahara were to be achieved rapidly, thus enabling all the peoples of the region to strengthen and to promote their ties of co-operation, brotherhood and good neighborliness.\n105.\tThe Palestinian problem, which this year is on the agenda of our session, may seem somewhat strange because of some of its features and the emotional nature of its content. It belongs, in fact, by its origin, its nature and its ramifications, to the same category of problems which we have already mentioned, and which can be defined in simple terms: denial of justice and infringement of the freedom of peoples and their most sacred rights.\n106.\tThe rights of the Palestinian people, its legitimate claims to justice, are being thwarted by a situation of fait accompli, based not on law but on force, a situation which is being perpetrated thanks to uninterrupted aggression and the benevolent complicity of the inter-national community. Ever since this people was driven out of its country, denied its land, stripped of its goods, regrouped in refugee camps or dispersed all over the world, attempts have been made, wittingly or unwittingly, to deprive it of its identity, to deny it its national character and to reduce the scale of its tragedy to the eking out of a wretched daily existence.\n107.\tHow can we be surprised, therefore, that the situation created in this way in Palestine has been rapidly transformed into the Middle East crisis we know, which a quarter of a century of effort has not been able to settle, and which is now attaining such gravity that it is directly threatening peace in Europe and in the world? It is not enough to say in explanation that it is a complicated problem, nor is it enough to seek in history, religion or sociology reasons for the failure in the Middle East of methods of settlement which have proved their worth elsewhere.\n108.\tIt is becoming increasingly obvious now that the problem has only appeared insoluble because no one wanted to understand the central fact, its very core, which is the situation of the Palestinian people. We could even say that the Middle East crisis is the Palestinian problem, because that problem is the source of the crisis, and will determine its outcome. It is time for the United Nations and international public opinion as a whole to recognize at last something we have ceaselessly represented here as axiomatic. The Organization must understand that its duty is not so much to provide humanitarian relief for a people it has allowed to be struck down and dismembered, but to help it to preserve its identity, regain its homeland, and recover from a disaster which almost wiped it off the map.\n109.\tIn approving the inclusion on its agenda of the question of Palestine, the Assembly has taken the first step in that direction, and the debate that is to be held on this subject will, we are sure, make it possible now to deal with the problem of the Middle East within a realistic context, with full awareness of how much clear thinking, courage and sacrifice will be required for a true settlement. But this result will be possible only through a broad and sincere discussion which would involve all interested parties and, of course, first and foremost the Palestinians, through their authentic and best qualified representatives. Thus conceived and carried out, that debate will without doubt represent the most substantial progress that has been achieved since an attempt was first made to seek a solution which would be one in more than name.\n110.\tThe crisis that broke out last July in Cyprus and has since then undergone some dangerous developments is one more of the problems engendered by the Middle East situation. This is a serious crisis, because it affects the independence of a non-aligned country, threatens its sovereignty, and is destroying its national unity. It is also complex because of its international ramifications and the strategic consideration^ involved. I believe that this is not the time for apportioning blame for the events in Cyprus that eventually led to the present situation. There .are more important things to do at this time: firstly, to relieve all the sufferings that have been inflicted upon the people, to contain the conflict and prevent it from worsening, and to explore ways and means of achieving a progressive settlement which would respect the independence of the island and its sovereignty, and create conditions for a restoration of confidence between the two communities on the island.\n111.\tInitially peaceful coexistence and later, we hope, fraternal coexistence between the Greek and Turkish communities of Cyprus that, when all is said and done, is the essential objective of any attempt to find a true solution. It is only by eventually sharing the same national feelings, by coming to consider themselves the children of the same motherland and placing their loyalty to that motherland above all other allegiances, that the Cypriots will really be able to exercise their sovereignty and spare their country of all threats of division. This, of course, is something that will take a long time to learn, and it is only possible if all sides demonstrate the same sincere will to succeed. Yet the strongest nations have been forged in misfortune and division, and there is no reason to rule out optimism with regard to the communities of Cyprus.\n112.\tWe feel, too, that the contacts taking place between their representatives will be able to overcome present reservations, remedy the errors of the past, and pave the way for the reconciliation of tomorrow. For this it is essential to free Cyprus from its involvement in international strategies and to put an end to foreign intervention from whatever quarter. All foreign troops must be withdrawn and military bases dismantled, in spite of the humanitarian role that they can play in situations like those in which the Cypriot people has just found itself.\n113.\tOnce those initial conditions have been met it will be the task of the two communities to determine what system seems to them the best to guarantee the equality of rights at the present time and to promote the gradual forging of those communities into a single nation. The United Nations has spared no efforts to achieve that result and will undoubtedly have a role of primary importance to play in the restoration of confidence and the encouragement of progress towards a fruitful dialog.\n114.\tI am sure no one will be surprised at the extreme interest in the situation in Cyprus of the non-aligned group of countries, which could not possibly reconcile themselves to seeing the very existence of one of their members being threatened. The attacks against Cyprus, against its sovereignty and its national unity, is felt by the entire group as an attack against all the non-aligned countries and as jeopardizing the very policy of non-alignment. That is why the non-aligned group has been following so closely the development of the crisis and why it would like to assure the Cypriot people of its total solidarity. It is ready to do anything which would permit the rapid restoration of peace on the island and facilitate agreement between the two communities.\n115.\tThe current disturbances in international economic relations are the best illustration of what I described at the beginning of my statement as a confrontation between an old order clinging desperately to its privileges and a new order wishing to demolish the obsolete structures of the past and establish a scale of values more in keeping with the principles which should govern the modern world. It is there, fundamentally, that lies what some have called \\\"a world economic crisis\\\" and which others would like to limit to what they misleadingly describe as \\\"an energy crisis\\\".\n116.\tThe international economic order which has prevailed hitherto has made possible the extraordinary rise of the industrialized world, facilitated primarily by the availability of raw materials and cheap labor in colonial territories and in the third world generally speaking. That system, originally based upon a similarly serious imbalance in the distribution of wealth, could not but facilitate the enrichment of the most highly developed countries to the detriment of the poorer countries. When the poor countries finally awoken the abuse and, taking their own destinies in hand; wanted to make up their economic lag, under development it began to appear to be a threat to world peace, and world public opinion began suddenly to understand the seriousness of the situation.\n117.\tTo remedy that situation, no doubt important changes should have been made in the international economic system which, by reducing to reasonable limits the advantages of the industrialized countries, would have established a greater measure of justice in the world and given the under-developed countries an opportunity to restore their economies. But that was not the course followed. The rich countries preferred, while preserving their privileges, to respond to the claims of the third world by the granting of aid in various forms.\n118.\tI shall not dwell on the serious shortcomings of such assistance, which in any case was not always understood or presented as a duty towards those who had been exploited, and which if it had been left to the initiative of individual countries would never have exceeded an extremely low percentage of the national income of the developed countries. The result was that not only was the economic lag of the under-developed countries not reduced but also that their situation became more desperate with each year. To that should be added the difficulties which the economic system of the developed world had begun to experience, difficulties which derived primarily from an unbridled rate of growth in the industrial field, unprecedented waste and fabulous expenditures entailed in the pursuit of imperialist policies.\n119.\tThe world economic crisis in the result of a combination of two phenomena: inflation in industrialized countries, under-development in the rest of the world. The energy crisis has only made more apparent the cracks in the system, but the dimensions of the evil far transcend the mere consequences of a rise in the price of oil.\n120.\tWhat is the meaning, then, of all the fuss about the price of oil, to which people are attempting to attribute their current difficulties and on the basis of which a solution is sought? I shall not revert to arguments already put forward here by which it has been amply demonstrated that such assertions are inane. The most dangerous aspect of this maneuver against the petroleum-producing countries is that it attempts, first, to introduce division into the ranks of the countries producing raw materials and, secondly, to discourage any attempts to readjust the prices of r w materials by tying them, particularly, to the prices of industrial products. The surprising insistence on the tragic situation of the poorest countries, and the sympathy which is suddenly being lavished upon them cannot conceal from us the deep-seated motivations which are, in any case, fundamentally selfish, and which underlie this approach.\n121.\tThe seriousness of the troubles today is such that it should encourage all of us to face up to our responsibilities and not to seek a scapegoat for our sins. It we are convinced that it is only by joint efforts that we can rectify the situation, why, then, issue such incongruous warnings and threats and thus make even more difficult any attempt at understanding and co-operation.\n122.\tIt must be that it is easier to find wisdom among the humblest, for it was precisely in the hope of finally seeing the international community embarking upon a course of co-operation that we called for the convening of the special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and development. The primary objective of this meeting was to be, in our view, that of stressing the extent to which the world economic crisis had highlighted the solidarity of the industrialized and the underdeveloped worlds, and the extent to which the prosperity of the rich countries was vulnerable if it remained limited to those countries. Secondly, the debate was intended to bring out the real causes of the crisis and thus to define the precise perspective in which the energy crisis itself should be placed. This was thus a unique opportunity for the third world countries to set forth their problems, claims and suggestions in a new context, and for developed countries, rendered by the trials they themselves were undergoing more sensitive to and more heedful of these complaints, an opportunity to become more keenly alerted to the dangers of underdevelopment.\n123.\tThe work of resolving the crisis could not be confined to finding partial solutions, which, by not calling into question fundamentally the inequalities and disparities inherent in this system, would have only allowed a postponement of the consequences and would have left the situation to get even worse. Courage and clear sightedness demanded that we get to the bottom of things and discover that the roots of the crisis lay in the economic order itself, and that it was by working on the economic order itself that one could really expect to obtain positive results.\n124.\tThis is, in fact, what happened, not without difficulties in the attempt to establish an open and sincere dialog between the developed and the underdeveloped countries, and also not without reservations on the part of the industrialized countries. How-ever that may be, and whatever may be said of this result, it could reasonably be considered as a point of departure along a path which had already been traced, along which there was some ground for hoping that we could make even more progress.\n125.\tThe trends that have recently emerged and that would have us focus all our attention on the energy crisis and on the petroleum-producing countries, are aiming in fact at destroying everything which had been so arduously achieved at the last special session. We do not think that such initiatives, by disturbing the harmony which had begun to establish itself between developed and underdeveloped countries and by propelling them towards a confrontation which would be harmful to the interests of everyone, can really help us to get closer to a rapid, satisfactory solution of the economic crisis. We feel, rather, that we must continue to act within the framework laid down at the special session in the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, and attempt to increase what common ground there is, to overcome differences and to prepare practical measures for the application of that Declaration and Program.\n126.\tSince the end of the Second World War the world has undergone profound changes in its structure, in its potential and in its environment. What for so long appeared as a remote ideal difficult of attainment is now within our grasp and can be achieved, if only we want to achieve it and are prepared to pay the price. We could then build an entirely new world based upon principles which have, so far, constantly been proclaimed, but which today must be applied and respected. The years we are now passing through are crucial in this process of metamorphosis, in which we see the strengthening and acceleration of trends towards change and renewal. It is no surprise to see the parallel and contrasting development of forces of resistance to this trend which are attempting to preserve and prolong the old order and of the revolutionary forces which want to force the pace of change.\n127.\tIt is up to us, the international community as a whole, whether we want the new world society to be born without confrontation and without violence. It is up to us whether we do not wish it to give way to resentment and rancor which arouse feelings of vengeance and the desire for revenge. To be frank, that has been said by all previous speakers in the general debate, and I cannot better conclude my statement than with the consoling observation that such unanimity represents a hope for the whole of mankind.\n\n"

        "file_text": "The Philippines offers its warmest congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, on his election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. President Bouteflika's background is that of a revolutionary, and that is what the world needs right now a dedicated revolutionary.\n74.\tIn the session just past, we depended on the ripe wisdom of Mr. Leopoldo Benites to guide us through a series of crises more formidable than many we have faced in previous years. Having succeeded in drawing up the firm guidelines for coping with crises, we must now lean upon the vitality, the energy and the strong convictions of this youthful new President of the Assembly to see us through the next, and even more difficult, stages of implementing agreements reached in principle.\n75.\tWe wish to congratulate at this time and to welcome into our midst the latest members of the United Nations, the new sovereign States of Grenada, Bangladesh, and Guinea-Bissau. Their presence here is another affirmation of the powerful tides of self-determination which began sweeping the world shortly after the end of the Second World War. It is to the credit of Portugal, and a stern warning to the remaining colonial Powers in Africa, that it has recognized and accepted the fact that the course of decolonization is irreversible.\n76.\tWe listened this morning [2242nd meeting] to the moving statement of the representative of Honduras. I hasten to assure him, on behalf of the Philip pine Government, of our deepest sympathies for the tragic calamity which has befallen his people. I come from a country which is periodically buffeted by typhoons and often devastated by floods, and we in the Philippines understand the suffering of the Honduran people. We feel for them deeply.\n77.\tThe accession to the presidency of Mr. Abdel aziz Bouteflika is appropriate and timely in a very important sense. The world is in the midst of an economic dislocation so grave that its repercussions are bound to be felt far into the future. While all nations are in the grip of these dangerous economic trends, it is the developing nations which today feel its effects most strongly. Indeed, many of them are on the brink of economic collapse.\n78.\tAs a recognized leader among the developing countries, our new President can be expected to provide profound insights into their difficulties. At the same time, he is in a position to moderate what we most wish to avoid, namely, the degeneration of the understandable conflicts of interest between the rich and the poor countries conflicts inherent in the present economic system into bitter and frustrating confrontation. The future of mankind, both of its affluent and of its disadvantaged segments, lies not in confrontation but in co-operation based on equity and justice.\n79.\tAddressing the Governing Council of UNDP at its eighteenth session held in Manila earlier this year, the President of the Philippines called strongly for the immediate implementation of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of its accompanying Program of Action. He was the first Head of State to do so in an international forum. Recalling the debates during the sixth special session of the General Assembly an historic special session he said:\n\\\"[The] concern [of the sixth special session] was not with the past but rather with the present and future. Historical injustices were recalled, not to be exacerbated but to be redressed and transcended. The challenge presented to the rich, industrialized countries was not to irreconcilable conflict but to a massive joint commitment to fashion together a more rational and equitable relationship.\\\"\n80.\tThe grim prospects confronting the developing countries emphasize the importance of institutionalizing this new type of relationship as promptly as possible. Time has made their economic problems more acute, with further deterioration in sight in the coming year. Nor can we overlook the possibility of political and social upheavals in the wake of irresistible inflationary pressures coupled with worsening shortages.\n81.\tThe encouraging rise in commodity prices has now reached a peak and will soon decline. Only a quarter of the considerable gain in commodity prices went to the developing regions, and of this gain the bulk was negated by the steep increases in the prices of food grains and fertilizers.\n82.\tFurthermore, the developing countries experienced sharp deficits in trade in 1973, with every prospect that the deficits will increase this year.\n83.\tFew aspects of the world-wide economic up heaval cut closer to the bone than the food crisis. What was once viewed as an unfortunate but temporary state of affairs is now correctly regarded as a chronic condition which will grow worse in time unless concerted international action is taken promptly.\n84.\tAs long as their vast food resources remain untapped, because of understandable deficiencies in capital and in technology, the developing countries will continue to be the victims of hunger and malnutrition. On humanitarian grounds alone they deserve assistance from the more fortunate industrialized countries, for the toll in human lives now and in the years ahead can well exceed our most pessimistic calculations. And its effects on world stability, on peace and security should be obvious to all.\n85.\tSolving the problem, of course, is not easy. A rising population, competition for sources of food, the ever-present possibility that food assistance will be subject to narrow political ends rather than broad humanitarian objectives, the growing food requirements of the affluent societies themselves  these admittedly complex factors should not' deter us from confronting the very real dangers posed by hunger and famine.\n86.\tThe Philippines would therefore favor the establishment of a world food reserve in order to ensure assistance to countries suffering from food shortage regardless of the amount of surplus among donor countries. To this most basic of human problems the principle of special preferences for needy regions should be applied.\n87.\tIn the long run, expanding the world's food supply is a fundamental consideration. But in order to do this, greater assistance to the agricultural sec tors of developing nations would be required. Dwindling food stocks, even in many industrialized countries, make this step even more urgent. Beyond the immediate needs of food, improving the level of agriculture is a fundamental contributory factor to the national development of countries in the developing regions.\n88.\tThe Philippines attaches great importance to the forthcoming World Food Conference, with the strong hope that it will be able to evolve a concrete plan of action without too much delay.\n89.\tAn integral part of the food problem is the hap less plight of an estimated 400 million children in the developing countries. At its fifty-seventh session, in its resolution 1880 (LVII), the Economic and Social Council endorsed the decision of the Executive Board entitled \\\"Declaration of an emergency for children in developing countries as a result of the current economic crisis\\\", and made an urgent appeal to all Governments for increased contributions to UNICEF. It is, indeed, a sad commentary on the world's conscience that UNICEF, after almost three decades of quiet and dedicated service, has not received the adequate financial support it has always deserved. It is our hope that the 1974 United Nations Special Pledging Conference on UNICEF scheduled for November will elicit a generous response and demonstrate the anxieties and concerns of the international community over the world's suffering children.\n90.\tIt should be evident that the foregoing problems I have mentioned, being global in character, are susceptible only to collective measures on the part of the international community. The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, the World Population Conference, the World Food Conference, and the projected seventh special session of the General Assembly constitute historic efforts to tighten the web of world wide interdependence in order to solve the problems which impede development and endanger the world economy. They are important in still another sense, for they will be a test of whether we have developed in the United Nations the requisite political will to override narrow particularist concerns for the sake of the world community as a whole.\n91.\tIn this connexion, the Philippines hopes that the remaining difficulties with regard to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States could be resolved to permit the adoption of the Charter at this session of the Assembly. We feel that adoption of the Charter would be an indispensable step towards the establishment of the new international economic order. \n92.\tI have spoken of the profound interest of the President of the Philippines in a new international economic order. Committed as we are to expanded development and focusing all resources on the achievement of this objective, the Philippines under the New Society has been inevitably affected by the world-wide economic upheavals. Only through the most strenuous efforts has it been able to approximate the dramatic improvements achieved through drastic economic restructuring in the first year of our New Society. Our stake in the improvement of the world economic climate is therefore great, for it can be of decisive importance in our pursuit of the accelerated time-table for national development.\n93.\tLike most developing countries, the Philippines has been affected by the sharp increases in import prices, raising the probability of a deficit in our balance-of-payments position. Inflation, though our rate is among the most moderate in South-East Asia, has prevented further improvement in living standards without, however, causing a real decline.\n94.\tDespite the expected difficulties, however, the gross national product of the Philippines increased by 5.8 per cent in the first eight months of 1974, a figure which is higher than in previous years, with the exception of 1973. Last year the Philippines was in the upper third in the roll of developing countries which exceeded the target growth rate set by the Inter-national Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)\\ in the field of manufactures,\n95.\tAs a result of measures taken to prevent massive rice shortages caused by typhoons, the Philip pines increased its grain production by 12 per cent, short of self-sufficiency, but enough to avert wide spread shortages in the event of expected natural calamities.\n96.\tOverall food production, however, is at a record level, the Philippines being one of only four Asian countries to show this remarkable performance in a year of falling production in most developing regions.\n97.\tIn another field, the Philippines is among the fortunate few to exceed the amount of $200 million in gains in international reserves.\n98.\tBut the Philippines is under no illusion that its present generally favorable situation will persist if the world-wide economic situation continues to deteriorate. Nor can it dissociate itself from the plight of other, poorer countries which are now rapidly approaching the point of irreversible descent into anarchy and chaos caused by extreme poverty. Whether we wish it or not, their fate instills an awful sense of foreboding in the entire human community.\n99.\tIt is in this context that we view the arms race and the ever-increasing amounts wasted in its pursuit as a terrible comment on our sense of human values. It bespeaks a deadening of the finer impulses of man that he should place the development of weapons of destruction on a far higher scale of priority than the fulfillment of his most basic requirements.\n100. Nor is this race for weapons confined to the great Powers, for the supply of arms to the smaller Powers has increased at an unprecedented rate thereby increasing the danger of conventional wars which nevertheless always carry the risk of involving the great Powers.\n101.\tAn equally disturbing development is the dangerous proliferation of nuclear weapons. The capability for manufacturing them is no longer the exclusive monopoly of the rich, industrialized countries. This suggests that the threshold of nuclear danger has been lowered to a degree that may in the near future prove dangerous to world peace and security. That there should be nations whose populations are starving and afflicted by famine but that are producing nuclear arms is indeed a sad commentary on the world today.\n102.\tIn the light of the foregoing developments, the United Nations should begin seriously to con sider fresh initiatives to moderate the runaway arms race, halt nuclear proliferation and ban test explosions completely.\n103.\tThese matters acquire particular significance at a time when the Middle East problem still carries the potential for renewed conflict and at a time when agreement has yet to be reached on the tragic war in Cyprus. On the Middle East question, we of the Philippine delegation reiterate our view that a just solution should be based on the relevant United Nations resolutions calling on Israel to withdraw ; from all occupied territories.\n104.\tAnother important aspect of the Middle East problem, which is basic to its solution, is the question of the Palestinian people. Having no wish at this time to reopen a generation-old debate, I shall confine myself to quoting my original intervention in the Assembly on the same subject in 1947, when the sessions were being held at Flushing Meadows.\nI said then:\n\\\"We have assessed the legal arguments and found that they are not the decisive factors in shaping a just and practical solution. Whatever the weight we might choose to assign to the arguments of the one side or the other, it is clear to the Philippine Government that the rights conferred by mandatory power, even if subsequently con firmed by an international agreement, do not vitiate the primordial right of a people to deter mine the political future and to preserve the territorial integrity of its native land.\\\"\n105.\tContinuing, I said that the issue was primarily moral and that the enforcement of the partition policy was and I quote again \\\"repugnant to the valid nationalist aspirations of the people of Palestine\\\".2\n106.\tBecause the shape of the problem has been modified in the intervening years, the Philippines shall, against this background, speak on this subject j again at an appropriate time in this Assembly.\n107.\tTurning to our part of the world, the spirit of the Shanghai communique is alive in Asia, and a rearrangement in the balance of forces on its basis has ensued quietly and without fanfare. The apparent stability in the region has encouraged diplomatic activity, tending further to cement existing relation ships. Prime Minister Tanaka of Japan visited South-\nEast Asia, and Prime Minister Whitlam of Australia made a similar tour earlier this year.\n108.\tThe pursuit of normalized relations between (he People's Republic of China and South-East Asian countries continues. In mid-1974, Malaysia established full diplomatic relations with the People's\n- Republic, and trade and cultural missions from Peking and various South-East Asian capitals have exchanged visits visible evidences of a more relaxed relationship between them. At this very moment, Mrs. Imelda Marcos, wife of the President of the Philippines and his designated envoy, is in Peking on a goodwill mission and has been very well received there.\n109.\tBehind these activities lies the hope that the new balance of power will be a force for constructive changes on the basis of complementary interests, not alone among the big Powers with interests in the region, but also between them and the smaller Asian Powers.\n110. However, the problem of stability and security in the region remains the principal responsibility of the nations of the region. Among the six member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the first large step in enhanced economic co-operation was taken this year when active negotiations began on the implementation of industrial complementation projects and on the establishment of a free-trade zone in the region. An expanding web of relationships has also begun to develop between the ASEAN member countries and other countries and organizations, with, among others, Australia and New Zealand, and with the European Economic Community.\n111.\tMuch, of course, remains to be done to ensure the security of the region. As long as the Paris agreement remains unenforced and apparently unenforceable the situation in IndoChina will continue to be a threat to the general security of South-East Asia.\n112.\tIn the Khmer Republic, an unprecedented situation has emerged, raising political, legal and moral questions of great complexity. Last year the Philippines opposed the \\\"back-door\\\" grant of recognition to the rival Sihanouk \\\"Government\\\", which would give it the right to represent Khmer in the United Nations. We will continue to oppose this move, in the belief that the people of Khmer should be free to decide their own political future and to adopt the economic and social system of their choice without interference from any outside sources.\n113.\tOn the question of Korea, the peaceful reunification of the divided halves remains our objective, and we are prepared to lend our support to mutually acceptable means of reaching this goal. Provided it is acceptable to both the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of Korea, we shall support the admission to the United Nations of both those States in the hope that this would provide an additional avenue for reaching agreement on reunification.\n114.\tLet me touch on other items on the agenda that are of particular interest to us. My delegation feels that the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is one of the most significant endeavors of the world Organization. The objective of developing a progressive international law based on equity and social justice in order to bring about peace and stability in the oceans and to permit the full utilization of the vast resources of the sea for the benefit of all. mankind cannot be long deferred. Moreover, we cannot ignore the possibility that an area comprising two thirds of our planet will, unless agreement is reached, become yet another focus of intense rivalries dangerous to the peace of the world.\n115.\tFrom the particular point of view of an archipelagic State like the Philippines, the Conference has given us and similar States an opportunity never before provided us to secure recognition of the unique problems arising from our geographical configuration.\n116.\tAlthough we cannot, in complete candor, say that we were entirely satisfied with the result of the session held at Caracas, we feel that it has generated a momentum which should be maintained. It is our view, therefore, that no time should be wasted in permitting the Conference to continue its work. For this reason, the Philippines will support the recommendation that another session be convoked in Geneva from March to May 1975.\n117.\tOur traditional respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms remains undiminished. Indeed, our recent experience has given us a deeper insight into the nature and meaning of human rights. We realize today with special force the truth of the observation that the achievement of economic and social rights through accelerated national development is an indispensable requirement for the exercise of civil and political rights. Without the effective enforcement of law and order and without a sound economic base, respect for human rights remains at best theoretical. In this connexion, I am pleased to inform this Assembly that the Government of the Philippines deposited with the Secretary-General on 7 June 1974 its instruments of ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex].\n118.\tAt this session we shall support all measures which assist in advancing the cause of human rights throughout the world. And we shall continue to give the most vigorous support to the struggle against racist policies of all varieties and against all efforts to segregate peoples on the basis of color and race from the mainstream of their national life.\n119.\tAs a nation which by tradition has held women in high esteem, the Philippines favors the prompt elimination of discrimination on the basis of sex. Women in my country are the full and equal partners of men in national development; we look forward to the day when this practice is made universal. The observance of International Women's Year in 1975, for which the Philippines has already made preparations, is a timely reminder of the need to integrate women, who, after all, constitute half of the world's population, into the total human resources available for national development.\n120.\tLet me reiterate that this Assembly is faced with global problems which demand global solutions. Those solutions can be achieved only through greatly enhanced international co-operation. In turn, co-operation of such scope and depth requires the full use of the United Nations in the entire range of human concerns.\n121.\tAs the problems become progressively more acute, the need for effective solutions becomes more urgent. Some of the sense of urgency and the strong feeling of interdependence assured by the sixth special session of the General Assembly last April still remain. Our task is to maintain the momentum generated by the special session and to continue to foster the spirit of interdependence arising out of the very seriousness of the problems which confront us.\n122.\tBut a fundamental element seems to be missing. In a rare note of pessimism, the Secretary-General predicted that perhaps the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will be in the grip of a crisis of helplessness. A deficiency in determination, a lack of political will, delays the Assembly from taking the required courses of action that could lead to firm decisions. I suggest that this deficiency may also arise from the shortcomings of the Charter itself a Charter which, as I shall presently explain, contributes to a sense of division rather than of harmony in the context of today's realities. My delegation therefore welcomes the recommendation of the General Committee that item 95 entitled \\\"Need to consider suggestions regarding the review of the Charter of the United Nations: report of the Secretary-General\\\" should be retained on this year's agenda.\n123.\tOver the past 30 years, events and long-term developments have imposed the conclusion that the structure and processes adopted at the end of the last world war by the victorious allies very quickly lost their relevance and validity. I speak as one of the original signatories of the Charter in 1945 at the San Francisco Conference. The ideological confrontation destroyed the possibility of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council, and their veto power was transformed from a guarantee of international unity into an instrument for the protection of national interests.\n124.\tIt is needless to review, for all of us remember, the various conflicts, large and small, brief or protracted, for which the Organization, under its present Charter, was unable to find a solution, much less to enforce one. More and more often, solutions have been sought, and sometimes found, outside the framework of what was originally conceived to be the unchallengeable arbiter of the world's disputes.\n125.\tPerhaps the original ideal was impractical, beyond the possibility of realization in a world of sovereign States. All the more reason, then, to under take a serious and continuing review and revision of the structure and procedures of the Organization. The last of the Western colonial empires is now in liquidation; the emancipated nations have almost tripled the membership of the United Nations, while the former metropolitan Powers, which could formerly presume to represent their millions of subjects, can now speak only for themselves. On the other hand, it is perhaps understandable that they should seek protection against what may appear to them to be the tyranny of numbers at a time of a proliferation of States in various stages of development but all equally jealous of their equality in the vote.\n126.\tFew will deny that the United Nations has devised ingenious procedures to overcome the inherent limitations of the present Charter. It has broadened the scope of its activities to cover a wide spectrum of issues which the founders of the Organization never anticipated. Still, for our time, the Charter fails to reach the heart of the matter, which is the disturbing division between the developing and developed countries, or, to put it more bluntly, the few rich and the many poor. Never in the history of the United Nations has that division been more apparent that it is today.\n127.\tThe paramount need of the United Nations is a Charter which provides the institutional means for reconciling the two sides, for bridging the gap between them, and for inducing them to co-operate, instead of deepening the distrust in which they hold one another. On these terms alone, if no other, there is, I submit, little to be lost if we place the provisions of the Charter under continuing review, to study how they work and have worked in the past and, above all, to explore the possibilities of bringing them more in accord with present realities.\n128.\tIt is disheartening to see the United Nations unable for all these long years to put an end to the Palestinian problem, to the apartheid regime in South Africa, to the illegitimate occupation of Namibia, to so many other situations that haunt session after session of the General Assembly like ghosts that can neither be buried nor forgotten.\n129.\tIt is disillusioning to see the United Nations playing no direct part in reshaping the international monetary system,\n130.\tIt is deeply dismaying to realize that the United Nations, for all the bright promises of its Charter and declarations and proclamations, is unable to do more to protect the human rights of millions of human beings. No doubt, there are serious legal and political difficulties to be faced in any study or revision of the Charter. Such a revision might even entail its renegotiation. Any fundamental change is painful and calls for much thought and heart-searching; but when change is needed for survival, it is inevitable.\n131.\tAllow me to illustrate this with any example from our own national experience in the Philippines. Two years ago, almost to this very date, the President of our country placed it under martial law. It was within his constitutional powers to do so, as the Supreme Court of the Republic decided only last week; but it was also a very drastic, even revolutionary measure, for it meant a fundamental change, a radical revision of our political and social structure and institutions which had been part of our way of life since the proclamation of our independence in 1946 almost the same length of time as the United Nations has existed and, indeed, for about 40 years before that. \n132.\tThe change was a shock; it was agonizingly painful to many; but it worked, and it is working- It forestalled a revolution that, after all, sought only the same goals; it staved off financial ruin; it restored peace and promised social order. Above all, it worked because it brought the constitutional and govern mental structure and processes into line with the political, economic and social realities in a nation that had been groping for the true balance between them for more than a quarter-century.\n133.\tWe in the United Nations, I dare to suggest, have also been trying to strike that true balance for almost the same measure of time. To find it now, when it is so needed, if not for survival, at least for significance and effectiveness, we must, I suggest, be equally bold after long patience; we must be persistent with long deliberation and unafraid of radical departures when confident of our ultimate destination. For that reason my delegation will sup-port, and indeed sponsor, any initiative to establish a continuing or permanent group to study the revision of the Charter and submit recommendations thereon.\n134.\tTwo years ago, at this same forum, I made the observation that radical changes had overtaken the world. How profound these changes were we now fully realize. The detente begun in Asia and subsequently followed in Europe has, for all practical purposes, revised the structure of international relations. The beginning of concord and harmony in the political field, despite temporary set-backs, has be come visible, amid our hopes are buoyed by the rich possibilities of peace and security for all mankind. We fully expect it to create the environment in which we can pursue with greater vigor the progress and development of nations.\n135.\tToday, we are at the painful beginning of that search for progress. Because we view the problems at such close range, we tend to be traumatized by their immense difficulties. The danger is that this should lead to a fatal paralysis of will, leaving the problems unsolved and worse than they were be fore. I venture to say that in the midst of difficulties we have learned the lesson that today, more than ever, we must shed parochialism, discard selfishness, and dismiss the narrower demands of sheer self-interest. Never before has this thought emerged with greater clarity and force: if our society is to survive, we must accept collective responsibility for its well-being. Interdependence has ceased to be a mere pious wish. Inevitable, indeed inescapable, it is the very basis for the continuation of the society of man in the twentieth century.\n"

        "file_text": "Rarely, if ever, in the history of the United Nations has a President of the General Assembly been elected unanimously and without the whimsical aberration of a vote cast .in support of an imaginary candidate. Mr. Bouteflika has also perhaps achieved the record of being the youngest incumbent of this exalted and responsible office.\n53.\tThrough the delegation of Sri Lanka I offer to the President, on behalf of the Government and people of Sri Lanka, our warm felicitations and our best wishes for his success in the office which he has assumed. We salute him, not only as a true representative of the continent of Africa and one who personifies the spirit of a people that fought valiantly to free itself from the bondage of political subjection and still carries on with indomitable perseverance the struggle to erase the last vestiges of external economic exploitation, but also as the Foreign Minister of the country which happens to be at the moment the Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\n54.\tFounded on the principle of detachment from great-Power rivalries, the Non-Aligned Movement is pledged to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations; to the assertion protection of fundamental human rights; to recognition of the equality of all races and of all nations, large and small; to abstention from intervention or interference in the internal affairs of another country; and to the settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means. Through fidelity to these principles and policies, the Non- Aligned Movement has consistently sought to provide that element of moderation in international affairs which could be the most vital contribution to relieving international tensions and thereby promoting peace and harmony throughout the world.\n55.\tThe non-aligned group is today more united, numerically Stronger and better placed than it ever was to exert its influence on the course of international relations in the political, economic and social spheres and thereby to fortify the United Nations in all efforts directed towards the application and enforcement of the principles and purposes of the Charter. If we are to fulfill this high mission, we must be wary of besmirching our credentials by the least manifestation of partisanship. The non-aligned group must treat all nations as friends while dissociating itself from, and striving united to secure the abolition of, policies and practices repugnant to the ideals and objectives of non-alignment.\n56.\tMy delegation takes this opportunity of expressing its great admiration for the skill and ability with which Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador presided over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. His reputation as an eminent jurist, his vast experience as a diplomat and his penetrating knowledge of all aspects of United Nations activities, combined with his human qualities of courtesy, tact and patience, were fully manifested in his conduct of the twenty-eighth session.\n57.\tThe delegation of Sri Lanka extends a fervent welcome to the three new Members which have been admitted to the United Nations during this session: the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. We offer them our cordial congratulations and best wishes. We have the utmost confidence in their capacity and willingness to make an effective and constructive contribution towards the attainment of the aims and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations.\n58.\tThe admission of Grenada and Guinea-Bissau marks yet another milestone in the progress towards self-determination of subject peoples and their liberation from foreign rule, as well as the attainment of universality of representation of the peoples of the world in the Organization.\n59.\tThe admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh brings to a close a poignant episode in the history of the subcontinent to which that country belongs. The malevolence of nature has inflicted on it the severest tribulations at the very moment when it was making a desperate effort to revive its shattered economy. We sincerely hope that the nations of the world will help it generously to recover speedily from the indescribable devastation and suffering which it has experienced.\n60.\tAs in the case of Bangladesh, natural disaster has wrought widespread havoc in the territory of another Member nation\u2014Honduras. My delegation extends to the Government and people of Honduras our profound sympathy over the loss of life and the destruction resulting from the hurricane that recently struck it and trusts that it too will receive from the international community all the help that it needs to repair the damage to its economy.\n61.\tThe year that has elapsed since the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly has been marked by several momentous developments, each of a distinctive character, whether it be epoch-making, or pregnant with promise for the future, or even deeply disquieting.\n62.\tThe change of government in Portugal has happily resulted in a final renunciation of the former Government's anachronistic policy of colonial repression. The new Government's recognition of the right of its colonies to self-determination, beginning with Guinea-Bissau, and to be extended before long, we hope, to Mozambique and Angola, is a supreme act of redemption which merits universal approbation.\n63.\tThere remain only two racist regimes which have yet to abandon their obnoxious and inhuman policy of apartheid and to accord to the black African majorities, whom they dominate and persecute, their birth-right of self-determination and freedom in their homeland. The United Nations cannot tolerate any longer the pursuit of these policies which are an affront and a disgrace to modern civilization. Portugal's example is the light at the end of the tunnel. It will not be long before reason, humanity and self-interest prevail over perversity and racial arrogance and a peaceful settlement is found which results in the total emancipation of the black majorities and the colored communities of South Africa and Rhodesia and in the establishment of democratic rule on the principle of the equality of all races in those regions, thereby enabling them to live and work together in peace and good will in their mutual interest and for the greater good of all Africa.\n64.\tWhen I spoke of developments that offered some hope for the future, I had in mind the changes in the Middle East situation after the October 1973 war, and particularly the disengagement agreements relating to the Sinai-Suez front and the Golan Heights. The Secretary of State of the United States wrought a miraculous change through his whirlwind diplomacy and his imaginative statesmanship. We should neither exaggerate nor belittle his achievement. But the future of the Middle East does not depend on one single individual, however talented, resourceful and indefatigable he may be.\n65.\tThe changed situation provides a slight impetus to peace, but it must be sustained by a display of self-restraint and moderation on all sides. The only answer to the indiscriminate violence that erupts from time to time is the elimination of the factors and circumstances that drive individuals and organizations, out of frustration, despair and disillusionment, into a state of dementia in which intimidation proves more alluring than negotiation.\n66.\tThe agreements on the disengagement of forces in the Sinai-Suez front and the Golan Heights must not be regarded as anything more than a brief respite. Disengagement could be a mirage, unless it is accepted by all sides as only the first stage of a complex and difficult process leading ultimately to the full implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967. This resolution presents the best hope of a fair settlement, despite some of the ambiguities that have conveniently been detected in it and exploited to prevent and defer a final settlement while lands and territories conquered in war are being systematically incorporated into the territory of the occupying Power in contempt of the United Nations and the principles of its Charter.\n67.\tThe essential elements in the proposed settlement must be recognized and accepted without equivocation by one and all. Chief among them is the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. In accordance with this principle, Israel must withdraw its armed forces from the territories occupied by it as a result of war. If this principle is rejected, the Charter becomes a dead letter. The second element is the acknowledgment, not merely in words but in policy and practice as well, of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area, including Israel, and of the right of every State in the Middle East, including the State of Israel, to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or use of force. The third element is the guarantee of freedom of navigation through international waters in the area. Finally, and most important of all, there is the need for a just settlement of the refugee problem, which is a piece of circumlocution and a euphemistic synonym for the restoration of the right to self-determination of the peoples of Palestine which would give them a separate Arab Palestinian State as provided for and endorsed by the United Nations in the Partition Plan of 1947 [resolution 18/ (II)]. It is only by ensuring for the Palestinians the exercise of their right of self-determination that the United Nations can terminate the grim ordeal of a people who have for more than 25 years been compelled to lead a life bereft of hope, dependent on the charity of the international community, betrayed, as no other people in the world has been betrayed, by the very Organization that helped create the State of Israel. It is not by raining death and destruction on the defenseless women and children in the Palestinian Arab refugee camps and by enveloping them in a constant nightmare of fear and terror that a solution can be found. This derelict mass of displaced humanity must be given a home and a State in which they can live in honor and dignity without being left to languish and decay in humiliation and desolation.\n68.\tThe principle of a separate Palestine State was an integral feature of the partition. The United Nations must accept it and make it a reality. It is an impudent challenge to the authority of the United Nations, the creator of Israel, and miserable travesty of the very principle of justice which the United Nations sought to apply, even if under intimidation and pressure, by creating the State of Israel, for Israeli leaders to have the temerity to state that \\\"they\\\" -meaning the Palestinians- \\\"did not exist\\\", or to proclaim slogans of intransigence such as \\\"Jerusalem Never\\\". These slogans and these tendentious distortions of history do not provide the material out of which the edifice of peace can be built. They are irresponsible, inflammatory, uncompromising and unacceptable. By the same token, the United Nations cannot, even by implication, acquiesce in the proposition or offer any support to the idea that Israel does not exist or that its social and political structure should be so radically altered as to obliterate the separate identity which it seeks.\n69.\tLikewise, Security Council resolution 242 (1967), in which the Council affirmed that every State in the Middle East has a right to live within secure and recognized boundaries, cannot be interpreted as conferring on the State of Israel the unique prerogative, totally incompatible with international law and the principles of the Charter, of determining for itself and by itself where its boundaries should run in order to ensure its security. If that right were extended to all and sundry, the outcome would be universal anarchy. The question of safe and secure boundaries is a matter for negotiation, but it cannot be divorced from the recognition of the right of Israel to exist as a State and from the repudiation of belligerency. The time has come for all parties to eschew intemperance and extremism and to display restraint and moderation. Peace alone makes boundaries secure.\n70.\tAs one who has during the last four years been deeply involved in the Middle East problem in the unenviable capacity of Chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories, and as the representative of a country that recognized the State of Israel at an early stage and maintained diplomatic relations with it until 1970 when we decided that the only means open to us of recording our disapproval of a Member State's defiance of the Charter was the suspension of relations with Israel until it relinquished its conquests of 1967 or until a solution acceptable to the Arab people of the Middle East was reached I can claim that our credentials and our impartiality cannot be impugned by anyone with the least pretension to objectivity or detachment.\n71.\tWe earnestly wish to see an end to the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors, as we are convinced that the talents and technology of the people of Israel in partnership with the human and material resources of the Arab peoples of the Middle East could transform that entire area from a battlefield into a domain of concord, peaceful co-operation and prosperity. We hope the debate on the question of Palestine will not be used as an occasion for an exchange of acrimonious charges and counter-charges, but for a sober analysis of the causes of the present situation in the search for a compact that, by securing justice for all, will offer a guarantee of enduring peace for all.\n72.\tThe crisis in Cyprus has exposed once more the tragic shortcomings of the United Nations. Despite numerous resolutions of the Security Council calling for the withdrawal from the Republic of Cyprus of foreign military personnel present otherwise than under the authority of international agreements, recording its formal disapproval of the unilateral military actions undertaken against the Republic of Cyprus, and subscribing to the principle of respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the island, little or no progress has been made towards the full restoration of constitutional government in Cyprus.\n73.\tThere is much more involved in Cyprus than a bitter internecine conflict between two ethnic communities. We are all involved in Cyprus and not least of all the members of the non-aligned movement. The Government of Cyprus was one of the first to declare its policy of non-alignment. The agony of Cyprus is the agony of the non-aligned movement; the deliverance of Cyprus is the deliverance of non-alignment; the betrayal and abandonment of Cyprus is the betrayal and abandonment of the principles of the Charter. It is for this reason that, on the commendable initiative of the President of Yugoslavia, the non-aligned group has sought, through the appointment of a Good Offices Committee, to intervene in order to achieve a peaceful composition of the differences between the parties involved, Governments and communities alike, the withdrawal of all foreign military forces, and the complete restoration of constitutional government in Cyprus as the only means by which its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity can be preserved free from external influence and machination. There can be no partition, no enosis, no foreign occupation, but there can be a large measure of local autonomy for the two communities which would not be open to exploitation in a manner prejudicial to the survival of Cyprus as a sovereign, united and independent State.\n74.\tThis is the justification for the inclusion of the item \\\"The question of Cyprus\\\" in the agenda of the General Assembly as an urgent matter despite the fact that the situation created by the ouster of Archbishop Makarios, whom we recognize as the President of the Republic of Cyprus, and the subsequent events came within the purview of the Security Council's responsibility. This is not a matter that concerns only the five \\\"bishops\\\" of the Security Council and their 10 temporary \\\"coadjutors\\\". It is the responsibility of the entire \\\"synod\\\" because the issues involved are ecumenical in their reach and implications. The moving words of John Donne have been quoted here. To adapt them, I would say that we should not seek to ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for us all, nations great and small, powerful and weak, but chiefly for small defenseless countries and particularly those who, reposing their faith in non-alignment and in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, disavow military alliances. But the bell tolls loudest of all for the only institution that can bring us together in the pursuit of peace, justice and fraternity within the international community, the United Nations.\n75.\tMy delegation takes this opportunity of paying homage to those members of UNFICYP who volunteered to serve the cause of international peace and humanity and gave their lives to that cause, and also to those who have been wounded in the line of duty. To the families of those who were killed and to the Governments that dispatched them on their sublime mission, my delegation offers its heartfelt sympathy. At the same time we express the hope that those who have been injured may soon recover from their wounds and be restored to active life.\n76.\tPermit me at this stage to pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the zeal and speed with which he has acted, both in the Middle East and in Cyprus, in the cause of peace and humanity. He has not spared himself in the process and has set a shining example of conspicuous devotion to duty.\n77.\tIn the general debate now coming to a close, almost all participants have voiced loudly and clearly their anxiety over the future of our world in all its manifold preoccupations economic, social, political and legal. We have heard many references to detente, inflation, energy, population, food and the international law of the sea. There have been feverish negotiations and intense United Nations activity over many of these problems.\n78.\tIn the economic sphere, the historic sixth special session on raw materials and development occupies a position of preeminent importance along with the forthcoming World Food Conference shortly to be held at Rome.\n79.\tIn the social sphere, the World Population Conference held at Bucharest first brought together the nations of the world into open discussion of one of the most baffling problems of our time.\n80.\tAs regards the political sphere, I have already referred to the developments in the Middle East and in Cyprus.\n81.\tIn the legal sphere, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at its second session, held at Caracas from 20 June to 29 August 1974, completed its general discussion of the issues before it and decided to meet again in March and April of next year to begin the process of negotiation. This decision awaits approval by the General Assembly during the present session.\n82.\tAll those problems -economic, social, political and legal- imperiously demand our attention.\n83.\tThe threatened recession and the instability of the international monetary system, which have been linked with the energy crisis and the pricing policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC], have figured prominently in many statements, chiefly in those of representatives of certain developed countries. Many of the speakers who sought to condemn the members of OPEC and their pricing policies and indict them for precipitating a world-wide recession and wrecking the international monetary system have short memories and elastic economic theories doctored to suit their particular predicament and to absolve themselves. The OPEC members have been made to appear the villains of the piece. Even the problem of inflation has been laid at their door. It would be much closer to the truth to admit that a reduction in the astronomical expenditures on armaments, which create incomes without a corresponding increase in goods on which those incomes could be spent, could significantly ease the problem of inflation. The arguments advanced in criticism of the OPEC members are founded on the premise that the international trading system and the international monetary system must depend for their durability on the industrialized nations controlling the overwhelming proportion of the world's monetary reserves.\n84.\tThe increase in the price of oil has been condemned as arbitrary and totally unrelated to the economic determinants of pricing. The world has been asked to forget that, long before the oil-exporting countries realized, even belatedly, the value of their product and the fact that for years they had been denied anything resembling the market value or the strategic value of their product, the international monetary system had been placed in grave peril by the soaring price bf gold and the nervous breakdown which the dollar had suffered.\n85.\tAccording to these economic theorists, it is a law of nature, unquestionable and sacrosanct, that the prices paid for the products of the developing world should be determined by the importing developed industrialized countries without regard to the conditions of poverty and privation under which the producers live, while the manufactured goods sold to the impoverished world make full provision to satisfy the limitless and insatiable demands of the peoples of the developed world for the material things of life.\n86.\tThe policy of curtailing crude-oil production in order to ensure fair prices has been criticized as almost a form of economic aggression by those who justify the curtailment of acreages under food grains for the purpose of maintaining fair prices for their farmers. What sort of economic theory or moral philosophy is it that could justify the curtailment in food production at a time when many millions throughout the world are undernourished and millions die of starvation because of a lack of food or the inability to afford the soaring prices while at the same time, in regard to another essential commodity, condemning a price increase that does not threaten human survival?\n87.\tLest we be accused of ingratitude, my delegation would like to acknowledge, with thanks and appreciation, the economic aid given by the developed world to the developing nations, and especially the handsome contributions made by the developed world to humanitarian programs for the relief of famine and other forms of distress whenever the occasion demanded. But aid must not be regarded as an act of altruism. It is an investment that \\\"blessed him that gives and him that takes\\\", like the quality of mercy.\n88.\tIt was exhilarating to hear the statements of the Foreign Ministers of France [2238th meeting], the Netherlands [2252nd meeting] and the United Kingdom [2240th meeting], and of the Prime Minister of Australia [2249th meeting], who did not succumb to emotionalism in their analysis of the world economic situation but showed a readiness to deal with it in a realistic manner. The shift of approximately $75,000 million of reserves from the industrialized countries to the oil-exporting countries cannot be regarded, as a global calamity. One solution that has been suggested, that the oil producers should lend these amounts back to the industrialized countries so that the latter could have effective control over them and keep their industries in full production, took no heed of the consequences of such a course of action for those developing countries that do not produce oil. The only equitable solution lies in the joint association of the revenues of the oil-exporting countries with the technology of the industrialized nations and the human resources of the developing world. There is no denying that, if a world-wide recession is to be avoided, the revenues of the oil-exporting countries must be invested in a judicious manner, but they must be so invested as to sustain the productive capacity of the industrialized world and to increase progressively the purchasing power of the developing world. This requires a policy of planned and co-ordinated investment of those revenues in a manner which will wrest from the small coterie of industrialized countries their industrial oligopoly and create in the developing continents of the world\u2014Africa, Asia and Latin America a pattern of industrialization which would complement the productive capacity of the industrialized nations, thereby ensuring a rational division of labor and a more equitable distribution of world income.\n89.\tAt the sixth special session on raw materials and development the Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-Vi)] and the related Pro-gramme of Action [resolution 3202 (S- VI)], section of which contained the Special Program of emergency measures to mitigate the difficulties of the developing countries most seriously affected by the economic crisis.\n90.\tThe most unexceptionable declarations are, however, by themselves, not sufficient, and emergency measures are only a palliative. What we need is a new international economic order which would ensure an effective international scheme for the regulation of primary products and the stabilization of the prices of raw materials and primary products at reasonable levels, coupled with an assurance of steady supplies. There should be a permanent mechanism to ensure a proper equilibrium and balance between the prices received by developing countries for their exports and the prices paid by them for their imports from the developed world, so as to enable the developing countries to maintain their balance of payments and their terms of trade in conditions of stability which would permit the steady and orderly execution of their economic development programs. The economic growth process of developing countries must not be hampered by uncertainties, sharp price fluctuations and the vagaries of the market. There is yet no clear evidence that the will to produce the results contemplated in resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) exists where it has most to be demonstrated. Although Sri Lanka is one of the countries most seriously affected by the present economic crisis, we are not prepared to join the chorus of denunciation of the OPEC members or lean against the wailing wall.\n91.\tThe creation of the new international economic order would require patient negotiation and unremitting effort. It cannot materialize overnight. Meanwhile we would appeal to those who have at their disposal wealth beyond the dreams of Croesus to spare a thought for the developing countries which are faced with ruin and disaster and to help them in their predicament and to grant this help on terms which they can afford. If I may borrow a thought from Thucydides taken from the funeral oration of Pericles: \\\"Wealth is not just material for vainglory but an opportunity for achievement\\\". The Latin maxim \\\"Bis ilat qui cito dot\\\"\u2014\\\"He gives twice as much who gives promptly\\\" is most apposite in this context. The social and political fabric of the most seriously affected developing countries could be rent apart in the absence of immediate relief. It certainly cannot be kept intact with the promise and distant vision of a new economic order.\n92.\tThe second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea did not and could not secure final agreement on a treaty but it did, through an exhaustive examination of the principal issues, lay the foundation for the international covenant that we all so fervently desire. As I stated in Caracas, we must not let historians say, in the words of Simon Bolivar, that \\\"we ploughed the seas\\\"; let us rather by our joint efforts and through the display of mutual understanding, co-operation, tolerance and good will permit history to record that we helped future generations to garner the wealth of the oceans for the benefit of all mankind, with special regard to the interests and needs of developing nations, and that we bequeathed to them to be held in trust for all time the common heritage of mankind to be shared and enjoyed in a spirit of fraternity and in complete peace and tranquility. This is the task that confronts us when we next meet.\n93.\tI should like to take this opportunity of suggesting that when the item is taken up in plenary meeting we avoid general statements and confine our attention to matters of procedure, not the least of which should be a realistic appraisal of the possibility of completing our work in one more session, or of the need for providing for the contingency of yet another session to be held in 1975 at which we should conclude our deliberations and reach agreement.\n94.\tI must not let this occasion pass without expressing in the Assembly my most sincere thanks to the Government of Venezuela for the excellent arrangements and facilities provided by it for the Conference and for the courtesy, kindness and gracious hospitality of the people of Venezuela, who emulated the example set by their President, Mr. Andres Perez, and their Foreign Minister, Efrain Schacht Aristeguicta.\n95.\tThe report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean IA19629 and Add.l[ has to be presented to the present session of the General Assembly in accordance with resolution 3080 (XXVIII). We have no illusions as to the prospects for giving practical shape and form to what might appear to be an ideal concept. The great Powers, excluding China which is a member of the Ad Hoc Committee, have not shown the amount of interest that we might have expected of them. We hope that the much-talked-of detente is not just idle chatter and that its attainment will help them exclude the Indian Ocean from their policy of competitive expansion of armaments in that area in the not-too- distant future. I refer to the Powers involved in that talked of detente, \n96.\tThe realization of the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace is not the responsibility, however, of the great Powers alone. We of the littoral and hinterland States have the primary responsibility of composing our own differences, settling our disputes by peaceful means and resisting the temptation of repeating the mistakes which we impute to the great Powers. The major maritime Powers and all those who depend on the unrestricted passage of commercial traffic through the Indian Ocean may be assured that such passage will be granted to them in any arrangements to give effect to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. The lines of communication across the Indian Ocean must be kept open for vessels and aircraft of all kinds and of all nations subject only to the condition that their passage across and over the Indian Ocean does not constitute a threat to the peace, good order, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the littoral and hinterland States.\n97.\tIn the general debate hardly any mention is made of the heart and soul of the Organization, the Secretariat, on which we have to rely so heavily for the smooth conduct of our work and our activities and the execution of our policies. We have been fortunate all these years in having a staff of men and women of marked competence and devotion who have served us with steadfast loyalty. On rare occasions sections of the staff have reacted adversely. The blame rests not with them but with us. If we are to count on their loyalty and their zeal in the performance of their work and if we are to expect discipline of them, we have a duty first to discipline ourselves and to avoid making impossible demands of them and of straining that loyalty beyond all reasonable limits. Civil service must not be construed as civil servitude. Too many of us too often pay too little regard to the value of a proper employer-staff relationship. Mutual respect, mutual tolerance and mutual trust are the foundation of a sound relationship between any organization and its staff. The delegation of Sri Lanka takes this op-portunity of extending its warmest thanks to all ranks of the Secretariat for the high quality and standard of the service they continue to render us.\n98.\tAs we approach the last quarter of the twentieth century and look back on nearly 30 years of effort within the framework of the United Nations, we will realize that, although there are many political issues that still pose a deadly threat to international peace and stability, the portents should not discourage or perturb us. In the future, while the inner circle of powerful nations grapples with the dilemmas of disarmament, it is economic problems and economic relationships that will be our principal preoccupation, as they rightly should be.\n99.\tIt is incumbent on us to fashion in the new law of the sea and the proposed Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States acceptable, viable and effective instruments of international social justice which would set the tone and standard of a more enlightened international economic order and serve as an inspiring code of international morality.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with profound satisfaction that I address you from the rostrum of the United Nations on behalf of Poland, one of the founding Members of the Organization and an ever active participant in its activities, which are so vitally important to the world.\n3.\tI am happy, Mr. President, that this session is taking place under the guidance of an outstanding representative of Algeria, a country to which Poland is linked by bonds of mutual solidarity, sympathy and friendship. I wish to extend to you my congratulations on your election to a post of such eminence, and to all participants in this session my best wishes for all success in dealing jointly with the important problems on the Assembly's extensive agenda.\n4.\tI am addressing you in the year when the Polish People's Republic is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary. Its emergence marked a major turning point in the more than one-thousand-year-long history of the Polish nation, and its present development and policies stem from our nation's most significant experiences. It is from the standpoint of those experiences that I wish to address myself to certain problems which are the subject of the constant attention of the United Nations.\n5.\tThe pre-eminent objective of the United Nations, an organization which came into being during the most devastating of all wars, is to ensure world peace, for that is the greatest treasure of all nations.\n6.\tThe Polish nation has had to pay an exceptionally high and tragic price for peace. And it has learned to appreciate the inestimable value of peace over the past 30 years of construction, thanks to which the country has risen from ruins and its economic potential has been multiplied; education, science and culture developed; and favorable living conditions created.\n7.\tOur deep conviction of the indivisibility of peace and of the overriding importance of preventing a new world war is based on our experiences as well as on an appraisal of the state of affairs in the world of today. Ensuring lasting peace in our socio-economically and ideologically divided world depends above all on full implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems, principles which the socialist countries have espoused and consistently put into practice.\n8.\tWe believe that the most appropriate approach to that objective lies in the continuation, further development and consolidation of the process of inter-national detente in an effort to make it irreversible, in contrast to the aims of the forces of aggression and cold war. This process of detente is essential in order to overcome the political and military confrontation imposed by the imperialist forces, which constitutes the main cause of the arms race, tensions and threats to world peace.\n9.\tThe improvement of Soviet-American relations in recent years is of exceptional importance in easing and overcoming this global confrontation. We attach great importance to the agreements concluded between these two great Powers, which serve to further the overriding cause of all mankind: the prevention of nuclear war and the consolidation of the process of detente. The Soviet-American dialog exercises a positive influence on the entire world situation and is conducive to a general improvement in international relations. Hence, we are gratified at the prospect of further progress in that direction. That dialog in no sense limits but on the contrary creates more propitious conditions for a constructive contribution by all States, including medium-sized and small countries, irrespective of their social system and level of economic development, to the solution of the important problems facing various regions and the entire world.\n10.\tMy present official visit to the United States is one of the manifestations of the positive results of detente. I believe that the further development of Polish-American relations, for which we are jointly opening up new opportunities, and the exchange of views we have had will serve to shape international relations successfully on the basis of peaceful coexistence and mutually advantageous co-operation.\n11.\tWe favor detente throughout the world. The growing role of the non-aligned countries in the struggle for peace and international relations based on equal rights is an important factor in the consolidation of the positive processes in international life.\n12.\tThe great significance of the process of detente also lies in the fact that it is helpful in containing and extinguishing local conflicts and in the effort to settle many critical problems in accordance with the principles of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of nations. Poland favors precisely such a permanent settlement of the Middle East conflict, which above all calls for completely eliminating the consequences of aggression and ensuring the Arab people of Palestine its legitimate rights, We are also in favor of a peaceful settlement of the Cyprus conflict, which will restore that country's sovereignty, neutrality and territorial integrity. We are convinced that this objective would be attained by convening a representative international conference within the framework of the United Nations.\n13.\tWe are hopeful that through the full implementation of the Paris Agreements, the heroic, war-weary Vietnamese nation will be able to live in peace and that peace will be restored throughout IndoChina. Poland, which has been involved in peaceful missions in those regions, will do its best to continue to work in that direction.\n14.\tThe cause of peace is inseparable from the cause of freedom. The Polish nation is well aware of that fact. In its striving for independence it has made the greatest of sacrifices. We have always linked our struggle for independence with that of other nations under the banner \\\"For your freedom and ours\\\". A deep conviction of the indivisibility of the freedom of all nations and of its links with the revolutionary forces of progress stems from our experiences; hence our solidarity with those nations. The issue which today arouses the strongest protest by world public opinion is the brutal suppression of democratic freedom in Chile.\n15.\tDecolonization, which is nearing completion, and the struggle to put an end to all forms of neo-colonial domination, are of great, historic significance, as is the right of all nations to be represented in the United Nations. Accordingly, I wish to express our satisfaction that new Members, the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada, have taken their rightful place in the United Nations.\n16.\tInternational detente also promotes the joint consideration and solution of major world problems. We are in favor of that process becoming universal, encompassing all regions and ensuring continued progress in all key questions relating to the consolidation of peaceful international relations.\n17.\tBy virtue of its geographical location, true to its interests and convictions, and in concert with its socialist allies, Poland is making its contribution to the consolidation of detente, particularly in Europe. We are working towards that end through our participation in the overall improvement of the situation on our continent, through the all-round development of friendly relations with France, the Scandinavian countries and other States, and through our involvement in the process of normalizing relations in Central\nEurope, which was initiated by the treaties concluded between the socialist countries and the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as by the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin.\n18.\tEurope, which in the past has been both the source and the major theater of both world wars, has enjoyed peace for nearly 30 years, thanks to the victory of the great anti-fascist coalition, the emergence of the socialist community and the appearance of a new relationship of forces. The necessary conditions exist today for maintaining in the future the present state of affairs in Europe, which is so vital to world peace. It is here that the shift from \\\"cold war\\\" and \\\"power politics\\\" to normalization and detente has been most pronounced. Universal recognition of the territorial and political realities which came into being as a consequence of the Second World War and of the post-war development has been achieved. On this basis, mutual trust has grown and peaceful co-operation has developed more extensively. An awareness that there is no alternative to peaceful coexistence is taking ever stronger hold.\n19.\tUnder those circumstances, the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, advocated by the socialist countries, became possible. As will be recalled, Poland first advanced the idea of such a conference in this Assembly a decade ago.1 The great achievement of the Conference, which may well be able to terminate its deliberations within the next few months, will have been the adoption of the principles governing mutual relations among European States a sui generis charter of their rights and duties.\n20.\tAt a time when the Conference's activities are drawing to a close and talks on troop and arms reductions in Europe are under way at Vienna talks which will, we hope, also produce positive results a pertinent question arises. What should be done next in order that the process of consolidating European peace and security may continue and become irreversible?\n21.\tIt is our conviction that the peaceful future of Europe is linked to the construction of a system of collective security. At stake is a system in which prohibition of the use of force would become the supreme law, a system which would provide for durable security guarantees to each country. An essential precondition for a joint program for the future of Europe must always remain an awareness of the importance of the inviolability of frontiers and the territorial integrity of all States as well as respect for the principle of non-intervention in their internal affairs. Only in this way can the division into opposing political-military blocs be overcome. We also attach great importance to the creation of machinery for further consultation and common efforts aimed at consolidating security and developing mutually beneficial co-operation in all fields. The all- European body which we hope will be established by the Conference could become a forum for seeking common solutions to common problems. To this end, Europe's existing regional organizations, including those of the United Nations system, could and should also be properly utilized.\n22.\tBilateral, regional and subregional co-operation also promotes favorable developments on the European scene. We believe, for example, that the state of relations thus far achieved by the Baltic States has created conditions conducive to the transformation of that region into a zone of peace and friendly co-operation. Owing to the process of detente, all the traditions of positive, peaceful relationships have come alive and efforts are now being made for the joint solution of problems relating to navigation, fishing, utilization of maritime resources and protection of the natural environment. On the basis of the progress already achieved and in order to consolidate it, Poland plans to submit further proposals for governmental and public endeavors aimed at developing mutually advantageous, peaceful co-operation among the Baltic countries.\n23.\tThe consolidation of security in Europe renders an important service to world security, for the creation of regional systems points the way to the constriction of universal security. Hence, we fully support Soviet proposals calling for the creation of such a system in Asia and we shall support other endeavors with similar aims in view.\n24.\tThe halting of the arms race, full implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], and the elaboration of agreements which would ban the use and production of such weapons and open the way to general and complete disarmament are measures inextricably linked to the consolidation of international security. The steps that have been taken in these vital areas in recent years have laid the groundwork for the early convening of a World Disarmament Conference and for progress in the implementation of other important proposals, such as the reduction of military budgets, a ban on chemical weapons, and the elaboration of a convention on the prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military purposes, as proposed by the Soviet Union at the current session [2240th meeting]. Poland will continue to make a constructive contribution to the realization of all those initiatives.\n25.\tThe experience of our nation has shown that the natural rights of each country, in conditions of peace and security, is the creation of favorable opportunities for its development. Not so long ago, Poland was a country marked by socio-economic backwardness, and the consequences, of that fact adversely affected the nation's standard of living and its international standing as well. In a relatively short span of time, our nation has tackled the unfinished work of many centuries and carried out a basic reconstruction of the country, which now ranks as the world's tenth largest industrial producer. At present, we are dynamically expanding the country's potential.\n26.\tThe sources of this progress have been many. They include the transformations carried out by the socialist policy, fraternal co-operation with other socialist countries, particularly the Soviet Union, and the planned concentration of the nation's resources. The most important factor is the nation's toil: the liberation of its creative resources and the involvement of minds, hands and hearts in a common cause. Also of great importance are human qualifications the intensive training of. personnel capable of facing the challenge of rapid, all-round development. We are willing to share with the developing countries our achievements and experience in this field. We favor broad co-operation among all countries in the training of qualified personnel.\n27.\tAt its recent sixth special session the General Assembly drew attention to a series of urgent problems of international economic co-operation which call for joint solutions. Such co-operation is of crucial importance in eliminating the gaps between levels of development and in consolidating peaceful world relations, since it creates the material basis for those relations.\n28.\tThe growing utilization of the achievements of the scientific and technical revolution, combined with detente and the steady consolidation of the forces of progress in the world, offer an opportunity to create a just international division of labor and to develop the mechanisms needed to regulate international economic relations. Our Governments and, to a large extent, the United Nations must assume the historic responsibility for making proper use of that opportunity. Are special regional interests, the interests of more or less closed groups and inequality of access to the world market to continue to dominate the world? Or should we not rather set out to build a new open world system which would ensure each participant identical benefits? Poland, like the other socialist countries, has supported and will continue to work in the latter direction.\n29.\tThe sovereign right of each nation to the resources it possesses and the equality of all countries are our fundamental assumptions. On the strength of these elementary principles we favor a scheme of world economic relations which will ensure the equitable, non-discriminatory flow of the raw materials and technology indispensable to development.\n30.\tThe formulation of suitable principles in that regard is, in my opinion, one of the major tasks facing the United Nations. It is of great importance to base international economic relations on long-range ties and the co-ordination of development plans. Such a step would provide more advantageous conditions for world trade and economic co-operation for the benefit of all countries, especially the developing ones. Poland will continue to contribute to the achievement of such solutions.\n31.\tI have presented our views on certain issues connected with the development of peaceful relations among States. Let us continue to promote those relations in a spirit of detente, co-operation and peace. I should like to emphasize, however, that it is of equal importance to mold among nations and societies a consciousness that reflects these lofty aims. That is the special duty of our generation, which has known the tragedy of war, hatred and destruction. It is our obligation to overcome prejudice, distrust, intolerance, chauvinism and racialism, to inculcate in the younger generation a respect for other nations and a conviction of the right of all people to live in freedom, equality and peace. These ideals, deeply ingrained in the traditions of freedom and progress of the Polish nation, have in my country been transformed into the essential element in the system of education and upbringing in a socialist society. Let us make the cause of raising the younger generation to live in international peace and friendship one of our principal aims. Let us give practical expression to the deeply humanistic ideals contained in the United Nations Charter. Let us introduce them into the educational and training programs of all countries. Let us do everything possible to make the remaining quarter of this century, a century which has seen untold suffering brought upon mankind, an era of peaceful construction and of peace-oriented education.\n32.\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations will be universally celebrated next year. This Organization was brought into being by nations which sought peace, freedom and equality and by a desire for friendly coexistence and collaboration. Let us honor this anniversary with the greatest possible contribution by our Organization to the construction of a world in which the attainment of these goals will be ensured.\n33.\tPoland will continue to give its full support to the United Nations in the implementation of these lofty ideals\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is my privilege and pleasure to convey from our Sovereign, His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, and the Government and people of Bhutan their warm greetings to you, Sir, and distinguished representatives. May I take this opportunity to offer our heartiest congratulations on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is conscious of the fact that you bring to this important post years of rich experience in the field of international relations in your capacity as Foreign Minister of Algeria. We are particularly pleased about your election, since it was in Algiers that Bhutan was admitted to the non-aligned group of countries. We pledge our support to your endeavors in tackling the difficult and sometimes controversial items with confidence and diligence.\n60.\tI should be failing in my duty if I did not refer to the valuable leadership provided by your predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, during the twenty-eighth session as well as the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n61.\tLet me also place on record our deep appreciation of the tireless efforts made by Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General, for implementing the lofty objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. He has faced a difficult year, trying his utmost not only to implement the various resolutions of the United Nations but also to apply the principles and purposes of the Charter in order that situations of conflict, wherever they occurred, might be mollified by his vigilance and energetic action.\n62.\tWe are very happy to welcome the three new Members of the Organization, the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and Grenada into this family of nations. With the admission of these three countries to membership of the United Nations, we are closer to the principle of universality. We hope that the remaining countries will soon find their way on the road towards this great Organization. My Government is particularly delighted that Bangladesh, a close neighbor, has now taken its rightful seat in this Assembly. It is pertinent for me to recall what my Minister for Foreign Affairs, His Excellency Mr. Dawa Tsering, said at the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly:\n\\\"Bhutan welcomes the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent sovereign nation. We extended our sympathy and support to the people of Bangladesh during their struggle for national liberation and we are happy today that we were one of the first to recognize the reality of Bangladesh . \n63.\tMy delegation also had an opportunity to participate in the 1776th meeting of the Security Council, held on June 10 this year, when the Council adopted the decision to recommend to the General Assembly that it should admit the People's Republic of Bangladesh into the family of the United Nations, and we warmly welcomed that decision. With its ancient culture and heritage, we are confident that Bangladesh will make useful contributions in this Assembly and other forums with a view to strengthening this universal Organization.\n64.\tBhutan is fully conscious of the changes that are taking place in our part of the world, and we are taking the necessary steps to adopt our attitudes and policies in the context of these changes. We indeed compliment the leaders of the subcontinent for their courage and vision, and it is our sincere hope that this will continue to prevail in the interest of a durable peace in the region. Pakistan, displaying a sense of realism, recognized Bangladesh as a sovereign independent Republic, and Bangladesh, for its part, adopted an accommodating attitude towards Pakistan. We welcomed the New Delhi Agreement, under which this important event took place. We also hope that the spirit of the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972, and the mood generated by it, will prevail between India and Pakistan, resulting in the achievement of a durable peace in the subcontinent. In this regard we are happy to note that direct talks between India and Pakistan have recently been held to restore communications and travel facilities.\n65.\tHappily, Bhutan continues to enjoy close friendly relations with all the neighboring States, these friendly ties were more recently strengthened at the time of the Coronation of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, which took place on 2 June at Thimphu. The occasion was graced by the presence of the Heads of State from the neighboring countries, representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council and representatives from other friendly countries.\n66.\tOur Monarch, young as he is, shoulders heavy responsibility with a great sense of maturity and wisdom. Under his direction and guidance, Bhutan continues to progress steadily and to forge friendly relations with all countries, based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and sovereign equality. Bhutan is wedded to the principle of non-alignment and adheres to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. It is gratifying to note that our relations with India continue to be most cordial and friendly, with mutual trust and co-operation. We look forward to an era of still greater co-operation and friendship with India in the years to come.\n67.\tMy delegation also extends a warm welcome to Grenada on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations. Grenada's emergence as a sovereign independent nation was part of the evolutionary process set in motion by the administering Power, namely the United Kingdom, and the transfer of power by peaceful means is yet another landmark in the process of decolonization.\n68.\tAnother happy event for all of us is the admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Rations. We welcome this nation from Africa whose people waged an unrelenting struggle lasting over a decade in order to attain their birthright of freedom and independence. The presence of the representatives of Guinea-Bissau in this Assembly represents a fitting monument to all their martyrs.\n69.\tThe dramatic change in Portugal, with the acces-sion of progressive forces to the helm of affairs, has caused a new wind of change to blow in the Portuguese colonies in Africa. What Portugal has done and is definitely determined to do in Africa is, of course, of great moment in history. We welcome the recent transfer of power to an interim Government in Mozambique with the avowed purpose of granting independence to that country by June 1975, We hope that a satisfactory solution will be found for the Cape Verde Islands and that power will be transferred to the liberation movements in Angola with the least possible delay and without any local complications, either as to ethnic differences or the rights of the minority settlers. We note with pleasure and satisfaction Portugal's far-sighted vision and acceptance of the reality of the situation, and also congratulate the Secretary-General for his initiative in facilitating the pace of change.\n70.\tWe hope that the Portuguese example will enlighten the illegal regime in Zimbabwe and the racist regime in South Africa. The flood-gates of change cannot be closed by any imaginary dam, that of apartheid or any other. We applaud the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal for his condemnation of racism and apartheid from this forum [2239th meeting]. If any lesson is to be derived from the current movement, it is that South Africa would be well-advised to surrender the administration of Namibia to the United Nations in order to demonstrate that it will also change its heart. Simultaneously, South Africa should take steps to repeal all the obnoxious, repressive and dehumanizing laws, abandon apartheid, which has been declared by the Assembly to be a crime against humanity [see resolution 3068 (XXVIII), annex], and heed the incessant calls of this Assembly. Such a change would contribute to world peace and stability. Those who oppose change will be the architects of their own decay.\n71.\tBhutan is a peace-loving nation. We should be happy to see a relaxation of tense situations wherever these exist. In the opinion of our delegation, detente at the present moment has held its ground, although it is fragile. With the best will in the world we have still to work hard to strengthen and make it lasting. We feel that the trends towards detente are encouraging, but that is only one aspect of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV), annex]. My delegation attaches great importance to the implementation of these declarations. Many steps have been taken towards strengthening international security. For example, the limited agreement achieved by SALT is already in existence. We hope that the resumed SALT talks will make further significant progress, The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is well under way. Certain important principles have been thoroughly thrashed out by the European countries which, we hope, will soon lead to worthwhile results.\n72.\tWhile the major Powers are determined to securely anchor detente, the results of the Disarmament Conference are not very encouraging. We believe that the goal should be universal and complete disarmament. In the recent past, various proposals on disarmament have been made to the Assembly. Progress is painfully slow. My delegation last year also supported the resolution calling for a reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)] in the hope that the production of destructive armaments could be minimized and that the developing countries to that extent might benefit. In spite of these efforts, unfortunately, certain nuclear-weapon Powers are proceeding to accumulate deadly nuclear weapons. In view of this, a comprehensive disarmament conference has become more urgent than ever. My delegation would welcome the holding of a world disarmament conference to create conditions under which real progress could be made. Such a conference, in our opinion, might strengthen the foundations for a lasting peace, which is the highest aspiration of mankind.\n73.\tMy country does not favor nuclear proliferation. However, it seems essential that there should be a distinction between the military and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The military use of nuclear energy would be catastrophic, while its peaceful use could accelerate much needed development activities. Under existing conditions it is understandable that a developing country must search for solutions to the complex problems of development, even including the development of peaceful nuclear energy potential. It is in this spirit and context that Bhutan confidently appreciated the assurances given by India that it would . use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes.\n74.\tWe are happy to note that the truce in the Middle East is in force together with the disengagement of forces, and that UNEF is playing a valuable part in maintaining the truce conditions. The situation is still marked by uncertainty. My delegation believes that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is still a good basis for settling the problem in the area peacefully. We hope that the parties concerned will show great understanding, and a spirit of accommodation and com-promise in abandoning all claims to territories occupied by force, and in taking into account the legitimate rights of all the parties concerned, including the Palestinians.\n75.\tMy delegation viewed with deep concern the re-cent events in Cyprus. It is gratifying to note that the two communities in Cyprus have started exchanging prisoners of war, and we hope they will engage in a fruitful dialog. We are of the conviction that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus must be restored without the use of any outside force. That will be the only way in which to demonstrate that small States, specially the non-aligned ones, can enjoy the protection of the Charter as well as fulfilling its principles and purposes.\n76.\tBhutan also favors the creation of areas of peace in all regions. It is in this spirit that my Government supported the principle that the Indian Ocean should be declared a zone of peace. This question has been engaging the attention of the Assembly since 1971. The Secretary-General's factual statement of the effect of the great Powers' military presence in the Indian Ocean is well known [AI9629 and Add.I, annex), and we hope that the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean will be fruitful. My delegation fully recognizes that the Indian Ocean should be maintained as a zone of peace. If great-Power rivalry is allowed free rein, it will affect the vital interests of all the littoral States, and could also help bring about political in-stability and social and economic difficulties, which will also be felt by the hinterland States.\n77.\tThe situation in IndoChina is a good example. Although the war has officially ended, the countries concerned are stilTfavaged by the after-effects of war. We earnestly hope that the various parties concerned in those countries will soon find a peaceful solution with a view to ending all tensions and building a lasting edifice of peace in that region. In this spirit my delegation would support any move that could ensure stability and peace in the area.\n78.\tWe noted with satisfaction the consensus on the question of Korea that was reached at the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly. Unfortunately, the circumstances have not been propitious for translating the consensus into positive action. We hope that the authorities of both North and South Korea will start a dialog in pursuance of the consensus so as to achieve peaceful reunification without outside interference.\n79.\tThe international economic situation is gloomy. A perusal of some of the statements made earlier in this Assembly indicates that an economic catastrophe of a global nature is just around the corner. At the sixth special session held in April to consider the item \\\" Study of the problems of raw materials and development\\\", my delegation stated our case for international compensation to those countries that could not with-stand the pressure of the inflation brought about by the general increase in prices of the key inputs required for development. May I be permitted to quote some observations from the statement I made at the special session. I said:\n\\\"Owing to their reserves and their vast resources backed by modern technology, the rich nations have been able to cushion the shock of the crisis. On the other hand, the worst victims are the developing countries, in particular the land-locked least developed countries, which find themselves in a situation in which their survival is imperiled unless immediate remedial measures are set in motion.\\\"\n80.\tMy delegation also made the suggestion that the United Nations should seriously consider the creation of a special fund for the payment of international compensation to all the severely affected countries to tide them over the present crisis.\n81.\tThe special session of the General Assembly also indicated the countries which have been most seriously affected as being those which are at the greatest disadvantage in the world economy: the least developed, the landlocked and other low-income developing countries, and so on. But the provisional list of countries to benefit from the Special Fund of the Special Program excluded a number of land-locked and least developed countries. We hope the Ad Hoc Committee on the Special Program set up within the framework of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order will not fail to recommend the States which are in need of immediate assistance to mitigate their difficulties.\n82.\tAlthough the process of socio-economic development was initiated in Bhutan only in 1961 we have achieved good progress within a short span of time. In spite of this progress, we are at present confronted with difficulties in implementing the projects envisaged in the Five-Year Plans. These problems have been caused by runaway inflation, the increasing cost of transportation and the present rise in the cost of key materials and commodities. These difficulties tend to retard the progress of our development efforts towards self-reliance. Bhutan has no key materials to export which could alleviate the burden.\n83.\tBearing all these factors in mind, my delegation will watch with interest the shape of things to come and the framework of the global economic order which emerges, including the reforms of the world monetary system.\n84.\tCountries which are producers of a single commodity have become fabulously rich overnight. The transfer of monetary reserves, not only from the rich countries but also from the poor countries, to the few producers of that commodity does not appear to conform to any generally accepted economic or moral principles as understood in this decade. If the world economy is not to collapse although signs of its collapse are not wanting bringing in its wake untold sufferings for the millions of people in the third world, drastic remedies on an international scale are called for.\n85.\tBhutan was unable to attend the United Nations World Population Conference held at Bucharest in August. Nevertheless, we have made a preliminary examination of the report on the world Program of Action finally adopted by the Conference.5 While some of the principles of the world Program of Action are generally acceptable to us, we require more time to scrutinize the implications of the report. It is realized that a land-locked State like Bhutan should view the problem of a population explosion with due caution. In the view of my delegation the population question is linked with the problem of world food, and we look upon the inter connexion as an inevitable corollary to the increasing population and gradual decline in resources. We are happy that the World Food Conference will be IWd in Rome next month. Our delegation will be participating in the deliberations with keen interest to find solutions to the grave problems facing such a large portion of mankind.\n86.\tMy delegation has been taking a keen interest in the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction have been declared by this General Assembly to be the common heritage of mankind [resolution 2749 (XXV)]. There is no doubt that this should be the key concept of any legal order that is to govern the sea and the ocean floor. Indeed, any efforts to deviate from this principle would jeopardize the hopes and the fulfillment of the needs of the developing countries, particularly the landlocked States and other States at a disadvantage geographically. The session of the Conference held at Caracas has contributed a great deal towards bringing about a comprehensive legal order. It is the hope of my delegation that during the next session, which will take place at Geneva, the needs of the various interest groups will be taken fully into account irrespective of their size and geographical position. The urgency of the situation demands that international agreement be arrived at as early as possible. However, this should not be taken to mean compromising unduly the legitimate aspirations of the developing countries. We must bring into existence a strong international regime on rational and equitable lines for the benefit of all nations. My delegation would like to stress with all emphasis that we must not make the heritage of mankind the subject of unilateral acts by either coastal States or major maritime Powers. My delegation would be willing to contribute towards bringing about a just and equitable law of the sea.\n87.\tMy delegation maintains that the United Nations is doing the best it can with the contributions of the\nMember States. Its achievements, whether in the political, economic or social sphere, are many and varied. For the economic and social development of the third world it is imperative that conflict situations, local wars and violations of human rights be eliminated. On the question of eliminating them, and ensuring human survival in reasonable conditions, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, has stated:\n\\\"The basic question for the United Nations and its Members, therefore, continues to be whether the necessary effort and political will can be mustered in time to make the Organization effective in meeting the overwhelming problems of our time.\\\" [A I9601J Add. I, sect. /.]\n88.\tI earnestly hope that the necessary efforts and the political will be forthcoming, and I would like to conclude my statement on this note of cautious optimism.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the Norwegian delegation, I have the great honor to congratulate you on your election as President of this Assembly. I can assure you of the full co-operation of my delegation in your important task.\n237.\tIn the introduction to. his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General raises the following question: how is the United Nations responding to the formidable challenges that face the nations of the world, and in what ways can its performance and capacity be improved? I would like to take up this issue from the viewpoint of a small country which considered its membership in the United Nations a corner-stone of its foreign policy.\n238.\tWhen we consider the tasks and challenges confronting the world community today, there are two basic considerations that stand out: the one is the gravity and the magnitude of the tasks ahead; the second is the urgency involved.\n239.\tSuch fundamental problems as the arms race, the population explosion, the gap between the rich and the poor, the scarcity of resources, global inflation, pollution, food crises and so on, indicate the magnitude and scope of the tasks facing the world today. These problems are of concern to all nations because they concern mankind's possibility for survival.\n240.\tThe second main consideration is the time factor. Time is not on our side, and the question is whether or not we have sufficient time to cope with all these problems before they become truly unmanageable. What we need is a new sense of urgency and new approaches for common solutions of the many new tasks. What we need is international action and international management of mankind's common problems and tasks.\n241.\tIn this connexion, I would like to stress the importance of the international conferences that have taken place or are to be held this year under the auspices of the United Nations. Last spring the sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development, was held. The World Population Conference has just been concluded. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea had its first session in Caracas this summer and will resume next year. The World Food Conference is about to be opened.\n242.\tThose and other international conferences are important milestones in the work of the United Nations. Decisions have been taken. Declarations of principle and programs of action have been adopted. But more important still is the follow-up of these decisions, and, unfortunately, the conclusion must be drawn that so far the follow-up of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, as well as of the decisions taken at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, has not been marked by any strong sense of urgency. The efficient implementation of these decisions will require sacrifices from big and small States alike, and not least from those countries whose economy has recently been strengthened considerably as a result of improved terms of trade.\n243.\tFor its part, Norway is committed to participate to the best of its ability in the efforts to promote increased global economic and social solidarity. We attach special importance to the Special Program in favor of the most severely affected countries, and we would earnestly hope that this Program will gain wider support and be fully implemented as soon as possible.\n244.\tThe United Nations will have to play a central role in the implementation of declarations and pro-grammes of action already adopted at these various conferences. But here again we are faced with the question raised by the Secretary-General, how can the United Nations discharge its responsibilities? That question will undoubtedly be an important item on the agenda for the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 1975. There is, however, one aspect of this issue that I would like to comment upon today, and that is: how can the idea of collective economic security and solidarity best be realized within our present institutional framework? How can we best co-ordinate and direct the wide range of ongoing activities in the economic and social fields? This poses the question of the future role of the Economic and Social Council.\n245.\tIn the Charter a unique role in the promotion of economic and social progress and development has been entrusted to the Economic and Social Council. The question is, however, whether the Council's working methods today are fully adequate to deal effectively with the many important tasks attributed to it. Subsequent to the recent enlargement of its membership, the Council is more representative of the world community than before. However, we ought to consider how we can make the Council more efficient and increase its importance in order that the United Nations would be better equipped to deal with economic and social problems. Here I have in mind not only the long-term development problems but also acute economic crises, as well as emergency relief operations.\n246.\tMore frequent participation of cabinet ministers in the sessions of the Council is one possibility. An alternative and one more in line with my thinking is to transform the Council into a body in permanent session, that is, some kind of security council for economic and social affairs. For Norway, which hopes to beep me a member of the Economic and Social Council again as of next year, the question of how to strengthen the Council will be a central issue in the months ahead.\n247.\tAlso in the field of international disaster relief and longer term relief assistance, there is an urgent need for increased efforts with a view to improving efficiency and co-ordination. Much remains to be done, and the measures taken so far have not always yielded the expected results. The world community must give increased priority to disaster relief.\n248.\tAs a State Member of the United Nations, Norway has considered it an important task for the Organization to develop a more suitable system and machinery for dealing with violations of fundamental human rights. We have repeatedly had the experience that Member States invoke the principle of non-interference in matters within their domestic jurisdiction when attention is drawn to violations of human rights. However, such violations concern the world community as a whole and have a negative influence not only on relations between individual nations but also on the international climate in general. That is the reason why we have worked for the creation within the United Nations system of a post of High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n249.\tWe have recently received an increasing number of reports of torture and brutal treatment of prisoners in various parts of the world. The United Nations must now give increased priority to this question. By creating an alert world public opinion and by working systematically within the structure of the United Nations, we must seek to ensure that the individuals are effectively protected against torture and other gross violations of human rights. In this connexion, I would like to pay a tribute to the work carried out by Amnesty International and the campaign against torture which that organization has launched.\n250.\tAt a time when the world is confronted with very serious economic and political problems and when the need for global and regional co-operation is greater than ever before, we experience in all our countries and in all parts of the world & trend back to bilateralism and increased nationalism in inter-national politics. This is not in the interest of any country. It is, however, first and foremost, the small countries which will suffer from such a development. This trend towards bilateralism is perhaps even more pronounced in matters of peace and security. Here, however, the situation is fundamentally different.\n251.\tUnder the pressure of the modern weapons of mass destruction, a rapprochement has developed between the great Powers, as well as a common effort to co-operate in order to limit the arms race and prevent local conflicts from developing into a direct confrontation between themselves. It should, of course, be in the interest of all countries to support this development. Whether we like it or not, the question of peace and war will to a large extent remain the responsibility of the super-Powers.\n252.\tNevertheless, this development confronts us, the smaller countries, with a dilemma. On the one hand, we are vitally interested in and dependent upon the continued detente aid co-operation between the big Powers. On the other hand, we are not interested in this co-operation taking forms that could undermine the international system of co-operation or hamper the efforts to build a world community based on the United Nations.\n253.\tWe, the smaller countries, cannot escape this dilemma, either by automatically accepting everything the great Powers have agreed upon or by a priori condemning this co-operation or this agreement simply because we have not been consulted. What the great Powers are doing is developing a common conception between themselves of how peace can best be secured. This is necessary; but the smaller countries must also develop their conception of how the world community should be organized, and this should not be in opposition to the great Powers and their co-operation but should form a necessary supplement and act as a necessary corrective to the co-operation between the great Powers.\n254.\tThis conception, or the task of the smaller countries, must therefore lie in working for a strengthening of international co-operation through the United Nations which will secure international peace and at the same time make it possible to achieve the necessary peaceful changes in the political, economic and social structure of the world. And in working for this, we the smaller countries have a common interest, regardless of our geographical location, whether we are rich or poor and irrespective of political or ideological differences. Part of this small-Power conception must also be to tie the great Powers as strongly as possible to the United Nations and encourage them to make full use of the Organization. It is only through constructive interaction between the small and the large countries, and through the use of the United Nations machinery, that the potential of the Organization to meet the challenges of our time can be developed.\n255.\tThe current session of the General Assembly has on its agenda a number of important political questions of current interest, such as those of Cyprus, the Middle East, disarmament and the situation in southern Africa. The Norwegian delegation will come back to some of these questions during the consideration of the respective items on the agenda. I shall therefore limit myself here to some brief remarks on these subjects.\n256.\tThe situation in Cyprus continues to be a source of concern and anxiety. However, we can now discern certain trends in the negotiations between the leaders of the two communities on the island which give reason for some optimism. We hope that in the longer perspective these may lead to real negotiations with a view in achieving a just and lasting solution based on respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus. Such a solution can be obtained only by peaceful means and not by military force.\n257.\tAs I already mentioned, the Norwegian delegation will in a later statement discuss disarmament problems on a broader basis. However, today I shall stress the importance which my Government attaches to the earliest possible cessation of all nuclear tests and to the need for the problems of nuclear proliferation in connexion with tests for peaceful purposes to be considered seriously now in the United Nations or in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. I would also underline the importance of the continuing efforts by the United States and the Soviet Union to reach agreement on further limitations in the field of strategic weapons systems.\n258.\tThis year we welcome Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau as new Members of the Organization. This brings the United Nations even closer to fulfilling the principle of universality, a principle which Norway considers to be of the utmost importance.\n259. The admission of Guinea-Bissau is also a manifestation of the encouraging developments with regard to the abolition of Portugal's colonial rule in southern Africa. I should like to express the deepest appreciation of my Government for the important decision taken by the Portuguese Government to prepare, in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, for the rapid and peaceful achievement of self-determination and independence by the peoples in the colonies.\n260.\tIn South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia, the white minority regimes continue to suppress the African populations and to violate fundamental human rights. As far as Norway is concerned, we shall fully apply the sanctions which have been decided upon by the Security Council against Rhodesia. We shall also continue strictly to observe the arms embargo against South Africa and to work for intensified international pressure against oppression and racial discrimination in these areas\n261.\tIt is only natural that the international energy situation and its financial and economic implications will be a main theme in the debate during this session of the General Assembly. Several speakers have already stressed the gravity of the situation. It goes without saying that the Norwegian Government is also most concerned about these problems, and that has relevance to the dual position in which Norway finds itself.\n262.\tOn the one hand, Norway, as part of the industrialized world is greatly dependent upon stable supplies of energy being ensured to other industrialized countries at manageable prices. On the other hand, Norway, as an emerging net exporter of gas and oil, is preoccupied with the same, problems, such as the pace of exploitation and national control over natural resources, as the other producer nations.\n263.\tIn view of this dual position, my country has an obvious national interest in avoiding confrontations and crises between producers and consumers, and we shall to the best of our ability contribute to solutions that can ensure a sound international economy and take due account of all legitimate interests, in particular the needs of those developing countries dependent upon imports of oil.\n264.\tFinally, I should like to stress how important it is for the further development of the world community that we arrive at a comprehensive solution of the many outstanding questions related to the law of the sea. As a major shipping nation, as a producer of oil and gas from the continental shelf and, first and foremost, as a nation whose coastal population is overwhelmingly dependent upon the resources of the sea, it goes without saying that my country attaches great importance to the need for reaching international solutions to these problems as soon as possible.\n265.\tThe Norwegian Government had hoped that it would have been possible during the first session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to reach agreement on certain basic principles for a package solution. Well, the Conference did not succeed in this. Nevertheless, we noted with satisfaction that the first session of the Conference succeeded in creating a good basis for further negotiations next year, which we hope will succeed in achieving a comprehensive convention relating to the law of the sea.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the Tunisian delegation is happy to associate itself with all the speakers who have already congratulated you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly, succeeding Mr. Benites, whom the Organization will always remember as a man of great competence and ability. Tunisia has more than one reason to take pleasure in this demonstration of confidence in you and, through you, in the Government of Algeria, its President, the Algerian people, the great Arab Maghreb, and the African continent as a whole.\n2.\tWe are all the more pleased to see a statesman of your stature presiding over this session of the Assembly because the agenda before us indicates that this will be a very important session, in view of the acuteness and gravity of the problems facing it, particularly those affecting international peace and security. What could be more normal than for these problems to be submitted to the international community, and particularly to the General Assembly, which in our view is the principal instrument for the search for appropriate solutions, however grave the problems may be and whatever ramifications they may have. The United Nations represents the international conscience -indeed, it should represent the only sincere conscience that exists -thus becoming a source of hope for nations and peoples through the way it deals with all the problems that may confront the world, whether they be conflicts and crises or questions concerning progress towards peace and development.\n3.\tWe do not, however, think that the United Nations must completely upset the order established in international relations since the Second World War. Indeed, we are too much attached to the Organization to wish it to engage in such a course; we are sufficiently mature also not to wish it to do so. Nevertheless, we think that the present circumstances are perceptibly different from those existing when the United Nations was created. That obliges us to study ways of developing the methods used by the Organization so that it may remain in harmony with the changes occurring in the world and fully meet the requirements flowing from those changes. Indeed, realism and sense of responsibility oblige us to consider things in a balanced and rational way and to seek effectiveness when we choose our methods of action.\n4.\tIt is true that the great Powers have special responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and security, and the situation is not likely to change soon. But the development process that I have just mentioned and our concern to avoid a situation in which the Organization will be overtaken by events make it necessary to search for such means as can reconcile the requirements of the present order with those of that development process. Hence, we believe it indispensable to associate the United Nations with the great Powers in dealing with all problems affecting the fate of mankind.\n5.\tIn that respect I wish to pay tribute to the tireless efforts that the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, has been successfully exerting to strengthen the chances for peace throughout the world and to give the Organization .its proper place and the supreme responsibilities for which it was created.\n6.\tMr. President, permit me to express my great satisfaction at addressing the Assembly in the Arabic language, which now has the legal status that is due to it, and to consider this change as illustrating the capacity of the Organization to adapt itself to one of the requirements of the evolution which I have mentioned.\n7.\tToday, we have to deal with many questions on our agenda, each of which has its importance and its gravity. But the most serious thing perhaps is the fact that those problems are not new ones and are not confronting us for the first time. They have been submitted to us today in fact in far more acute terms than hitherto and there is real urgency surrounding some of them.\n8.\tThus, the past year was marked by the consequences of the war of October 1973 in the Middle East and despite the progress resulting from the troop disengagements, the problem is still there in its entirety. We very much hoped that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East would lead to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territories occupied in 1967, thus opening up the way to an examination of the fundamental problem, which is the Palestinian question.\n9.\tBut this hope has disappeared. The difficulties raised by the Israelis have prevented peace efforts from succeeding. It would seem that the leaders in Tel Aviv have learned no lesson from the October war and that, in spite of changes in their Government, \nthey persist in believing that security can be built on the conquest of the territories of others. In other words, they continue to believe in the supremacy of might over right.\n10.\tThe Arab countries, which agreed to sign the disengagement agreements, have seen Israel once again profiting from their desire for peace by freezing a situation that both suits it and permits it to strengthen its grip on the occupied territories. It is the duty of the great Powers, which have agreed to assume a special responsibility for the safeguarding of world peace, to bring Israel to reason, with a view to serious negotiations. For, if the Geneva negotiations or negotiations elsewhere do not within a reasonable period of time lead to the implementation of the Security Council's decisions there is a risk that the crisis will deteriorate dangerously and even degenerate into a new conflict with very serious consequences not only for the region but for the whole world.\n11.\tThe Assembly is duty-bound to draw the attention of the Security Council to the dangers involved in prolonging such a situation, the perpetuation of which would be tantamount, against all logic, to the recognition of the legitimacy of the occupation of the territory of others and the supremacy of injustice over right.\n12.\tWhile the evacuation of the territories occupied in 1967 is indispensable, it is far from being sufficient to get to the root of the problem because, as everyone realizes, including Israel, the essential problem is still the fate of the people of Palestine. This is not just a question of housing refugees or of international charity, but of the right of a whole people to its homeland, its dignity, its national character, its identity, and its freedom to decide what shall become of it. That is the fundamental reality, and no one will ever understand the Middle East crisis if he not grasped the truth of the Palestinian tragedy in all its ramifications. Therefore, we can only take pleasure; at seeing the question of Palestine included as a separate item on the Assembly's agenda [item 108] in accordance with the analysis of it made by President Bourguiba for more than 10 years now. It is time for the world to realize the will and determination of the Palestinian people to impose its right to life with its homeland and its security restored to it.\n13.\tIt is time to realize that without the Palestinian problem, there would never have been a Middle East problem, nor the specter of war that-from day to day threatens the whole world from this region.\n14.\tThe struggle of the Palestinian people is a natural phenomenon because it expresses the will of a people to affirm its right to existence. This struggle indeed does credit to all men, as it does credit to all those who, in spite of their misfortunes and the vicissitudes of history, have remained faithful in their conviction of their rights, without ever despairing of human justice. It will be simply doing them justice to permit them to come and make their voices heard in this hall before the representatives of world public opinion.\n15.\tYes, indeed, it is high time for the United Nations, which assumed great responsibilities with regard to Palestine, when in 1947 it decided on its partition [resolution 181 (II)], to examine this problem in the light of new developments that have occurred in the area.\n16.\tWe are all aware how things have developed. The decision to partition in 1947 was one of the most flagrant injustices in the history of mankind. In spite of that injustice, and since the decision of the world Organization conferred legitimacy on the partition plan, President Bourguiba tried to have it accepted both by the Arab States and by the Palestinians, and in 1965 appealed to have it conceded. That solution, which was not accepted at that time, now seems in the eyes of many the only way out of the crisis because it guarantees the existence of Israel within legal frontiers, as the great Powers required, at the same time as it permits the existence of the Palestinian State on a legal basis recognized by the United Nations.\n17.\tBut while the existence of Israel has become a fact, that State persists not only in refusing to evacuate the territories occupied in 1947, or those it has occupied ever since its aggression of 1967, but what is more, it categorically denies the very existence of the Palestinian people, an existence provided for in the document upon which its own existence is founded. For 20 years Israel has succeeded in arguing its extremist claims; but today, after the rebirth of the Palestine resistance movement, centered in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), whose leaders are the authentic and incontestable representatives of the Palestinian people as a whole, after the war of October 1973, it is no longer reasonable to continue to claim that Israel can still prolong its supremacy over the Arab Middle East. The myth of the invincibility of Israel has been destroyed, and that country, together with those who support it, must accept the new state of affairs. The chief element in that state of affairs is the determination of the Arab countries, whatever their differences with regard to other questions, to bring about a just and lasting solution based upon the right of peoples to self-determination and on the recognition that that right belongs to the Palestinian people in particular. And do we need to remind the Assembly that the Arab countries have demonstrated their capacity to use for that purpose all the resources available to them?\n18.\tThere is another question, which does not date from yesterday and which, because a satisfactory solution has not been found for it, is dangerously rearing its head once' more in the form of a crisis that is likely to upset the balance of powers in an important strategic region in the Mediterranean basin.\n19.\tThe question of Cyprus is among those which have always been of concern to the United Nations. The United Nations troops have effectively helped to prevent a confrontation between the two communities on the island. But the calm brought to the island by those forces has not been used profitably in order to achieve a final solution to the fundamental problem that would guarantee the coexistence of the two communities.\n20.\tSome people thought they could settle for a de facto situation which is in contravention of the Tripartite Agreements of Zurich and which is flagrantly prejudicial to the rights of a minority. It is not surprising that the minority should have felt that its rights were being dangerously threatened. When the already precarious balance that prevailed was destroyed by a coup d'etat endangering the independence of the country, the inevitable happened, and a conflict, grave in its consequences, came close to pitting two neighbouring Mediterranean nations against each other, two nations which had every reason to be reconciled.\n21.\tNow that the worst has been avoided, the problem of Cyprus must be resolved once and for all in a way permitting the coexistence of the two communities, with full respect for the character of each of them, within the framework of a single State, with the constitutional rights of each so guaranteed that neither of them can challenge the rights of the other, while at the same time the complete independence of the island is preserved under an international guarantee.\n22.\tAlthough the situation in the Middle East and in Cyprus is a cause of profound concern, the developments in the southern part of the African continent give grounds for hope, even though that region still continues to suffer the nightmare of colonialism and apartheid.\n23.\tWe have no doubt that sooner or later the bastions of colonialism will yield to the struggle of the peoples of those territories, supported by the fraternal solidarity of all the African nations and all anti-colonialist countries. But we must in all frankness admit that we did not expect the decolonization of those territories to come about in such favorable circumstances. As a result, the Portuguese nation, which has so admirably, changed its attitude towards Africa, is today restored to its proper place in our hearts. The Government of Tunisia was among the first to welcome the efforts of the Portuguese Government, and to resume its natural relations with that country; for it was the colonial policy of the old regime alone that divided us from Portugal, which throughout the course of history has had numerous ties with our Arab Maghreb. For that reason we take the greatest satisfaction in seeing this reconciliation between our Portuguese friends, on the one hand, and our brothers in Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique, on the other.\n24.\tIt is with great emotion that I welcome here today the delegation of Guinea-Bissau, which thus assumes its governmental responsibilities on an equal footing with all countries of the world, while at the same time, of course, I pay homage to the martyrs, both African and Portuguese, who fell victim to the blindness of the preceding Portuguese regime, and its persistent refusal to heed the appeals of reason and conscience. We are also happy to welcome the admission of Bangladesh and Grenada to our Organization, and to address to the peoples of those two friendly countries our best wishes for progress and prosperity. We hope that Angola will not be long in joining the ranks of the independent African States, and will overcome the present temporary difficulties that can in no way block the path to freedom, the goal for which the Angolan people were the first, in that area, to make the greatest of sacrifices.\n25.\tThus, decisive blows have been dealt to colonial and racist rule in southern Africa, and we are convinced that the combined struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa will soon win a victory for the cause of freedom and justice over tyranny and colonialism. But, unfortunately, there are still some other colonial enclaves in Africa. In our own region, the so-called Spanish Sahara has not yet freed itself from colonial rule. We believe that the time has come to resolve this problem that has been poisoning relations between Morocco, Mauritania and Spain. We thus welcome with great satisfaction the agreement reached during this session, and announced from this very rostrum, between Morocco [2249th meeting, para. 204] and Mauritania [2251st meeting, para. 162] to refer this question to the International Court of Justice. Without prejudging the verdict of the Court, I should like to recall three principles that, in our view, constitute three fundamental imperatives.\n26.\tFirst is the need for final, immediate and practical decolonization of those territories, for there can be raised question of allowing the colonial Power to continue to exercise any power, openly or covertly, after the emancipation of those territories.\n27.\tSecond is the search for a negotiated solution between Spain, Morocco \u00a3<id Mauritania, for the purpose of safeguarding the atmosphere of friendship and co-operation prevailing in that region.\n28.\tAnd third is, if it should prove impossible to arrive at a negotiated solution, an appeal to the Government of Madrid to subscribe to the agreement between Morocco and Mauritania and agree in refer this matter to the Court.\n29.\tI hope that the Spanish Government will agree to this proposal, and thus spare our Assembly the need to discuss and vote on this matter. In any case, if the Spanish Government should not consider it appropriate to agree to this proposal, I consider that the General Assembly should take full note of the gravity of this problem, and endorse the procedure suggested by Morocco and Mauritania, so that the Court may hand down an opinion in the light of which the United Nations can take a stand.\n30.\tMany other subjects no less grave and important likewise demand the attention of the Assembly during this session. In a world where detente is supposed to prevail, a number of tensions and frictions persist in many fields in various areas.\n31.\tIn Cyprus, as in the Middle East, detente has not prevented a deterioration of the situation, and in both places the course of events has come close indeed to catastrophe. It may appear paradoxical that detente can thus go hand in hand with so many conflicts between smaller countries, but in practice we realize that it has its limitations. To be sure, it can be credited with some successes, such as the agreements on troop disengagement in the Middle East, and the continuation of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Detente has also made it possible to avoid confrontation between the Turkish and Greek forces in Cyprus. We can even give detente the credit for having played some part in the favorable developments in Portugal and in its former African colonies.\n32.\tHowever, the reduction in tension between the two super-Powers remains a limited phenomenon that does not take in all the problems that beset the international community. What we hope for is a global detente that can and should be brought about within the framework of the United Nations and with its Members, a detente that must apply to all problems of the world, even though they may not seem to be direct and immediate threats to international peace and security as the great Powers conceive these to be, whether those problems concern disarmament, decolonization, or, above all, development.\n33.\tIf detente could lead us from the rather passive concept of peaceful coexistence to the more positive view of it as active international co-operation, in a world where the independence of all peoples, the sovereign equality of all States, and, more especially, balanced and stable -and thus more equitable- international economic relations prevailed, it could then command the enthusiastic support of all peoples, and mankind itself would be taking a considerable step forward towards happiness and prosperity. For ever since the war of October 1973, we have been living in an era in which we are finding how much, in the economic sphere, the interests of all nations, great and small, are bound together and interdependent.\n34.\tThus in today's world of crisis, there has been a change in the nature of tensions and in the antagonists involved. The developing countries are determined flatly to reject the state of affairs that prevailed until recently, which was both the legacy of the long period of colonialism, and a corollary of the principle that a minority of the human race could dominate the great majority of mankind.\n35.\tThe establishment of a new international economic order has become more than a necessary measure; it is an urgent one. We hope that the work of this session will contribute appreciably to the practical implementation of the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)] designed to ensure the application of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-Vl)] and the initiation of co-operation between industrialized countries and developing countries which will make it possible to confront the problem of inflation which threatens us all and which stems not solely, as some people would have it, from the rise in the prices of petroleum and raw materials but essentially from the policy of economic expansion pursued by the industrialized countries and also from other causes which it would taKe too long to enumerate here.\n36.\tIn the meantime, good work can and must be done at the regional level, and, in this regard, the dialog between Europe and the Arab countries has made a promising beginning. Geographical, economic and technological complementarity between Europe and the Arab world has made a promising beginning and it must become a reality as part of an ambitious design which would go much further than mere trading in energy products. On both sides, there is a full realization of the interdependence of our two regions and the need to co-operate in all areas, whether they be political or economic, in order to overcome our respective difficulties.\n37.\tWithin the same context, we can consider that the work of the sixth special session on raw materials and development, held in New York, the World Population Conference held at Bucharest, and the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas, comprises positive contributions by the United Nations to the solution of the fundamental problems of the hour. Here, too, the gaps that separate the members of the international community separate the affluent from the developing countries. Here, again, a spirit of co-operation is necessary if we are to find realistic solutions that are both practical and just. We have great hopes of seeing this session yield more concrete results.\n38.\tThere is an impressive list of problems before the Assembly. And this is really the proper place to consider them, because if there is anything all these problems have in common, it is their universality. Whether it be the Mediterranean crisis or decolonization in Africa, or peace, disarmament, energy or the law of the sea, population growth, development or, a fortiori, detente, all countries of the world are affected. And whatever may be said, it is this Organization that must debate those subjects. In a shrinking world, where problems are becoming every day more interdependent, we can only achieve international peace with the support of all nations, we can only make progress towards a solution of the gigantic problems which confront humanity and threaten our common security if we act in common and through negotiations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, those who have addressed this Assembly before me have ably expressed their congratulations to you on your unanimous election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Allow me, nevertheless, to add the cordial greetings and congratulations of His Majesty King Sobhuza II, the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland.\n2.\tYour distinguished career as leader of your great country, Algeria, and your well-known and tested experience in international affairs are qualities that eminently make you suited to preside over the deliberations of this Assembly, convened as it is for the first time since the sixth special session, of which your country was the initiator and in which it played a very important role.\n3.\tMy delegation is confident that the deliberations of this Assembly under your able guidance will succeed and contribute towards removing the obstacles that lie in the way of peace, justice, progress and international understanding.\n4.\tThe onerous duties of your high office, Mr. President, were efficiently discharged last year by your predecessor, the representative of the Republic of Ecuador, Mr. Leopoldo Benites.\n5.\tThe maintenance of international peace and security, by efforts to harmonize the actions of nations through the Organization, is one of the principal aims of the Charter. In this regard, my delegation warmly welcomes the newly independent States of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau into the fold of free and sovereign nations. The admission of these three new Member nations, in the view of my delegation, is a silver lining in a sky overcast with clouds of dubiousness about the universality of this supreme body.\n6.\tThe serious thing for the United Nations is that problems of world peace, justice and progress, to the solution of which this Assembly rededicated itself at the twenty-fifth session, have not diminished. Our world has no shortage of problems. It is constantly being terrorized by war and local wars, division, oppression, poverty and hunger, inflation, unemployment, decline in production, social demands and financial shortages. All these are with us left, right and center, and are sprouting all over the globe, like thorns in the flesh. Even before the recent increase in the price of oil and other commodities, the world economy was in a state of disorder. World-wide inflation and monetary instability are the major causes of that disorder.\n7.\tAlthough the industrialized world experienced a remarkable economic growth during recent years, the developing countries never really participated in this development. In fact, their terms of trade constantly deteriorated, causing balance-of-payments problems and slowing down economic growth. At the same time, the relative magnitude of official development assistance declined.\n8.\tThe recent increase in oil prices and in the cost of essential products such as fertilizers, insecticides and base chemicals has aggravated the problems immensely. Already part of the world? s population is experiencing severe food shortages, and every effort should be made to increase world agricultural output.\n9.\tNow that even the developed world is experiencing acute balance-of-payments deficits and unacceptable inflation rates, the dangers of increased monetary stringency, even higher interest rates and a general economic recession are imminent. Imports of primary commodities, most of them supplied by developing countries, will fall, with the ensuing effect on prices and export receipts.\n10.\tMy delegation sincerely hopes that a solution will be found whereby capital may be recycled from the strongest world economies to the weakest. Whatever solution is found, it is essential that the resistance rendered to the less developed countries be equivalent to the loss incurred by them and that such assistance be given on concessional terms in order not to increase further the financial burden of the recipient countries.\n11.\tIn this connexion, my country attaches great importance to the co-ordination we expect will be achieved as a result of holding the sixth special session of the Assembly, and we look forward to reaping the/ benefit of the establishment of a new international economic order, which we trust will not become a dead letter to be found in the archives of this Organization.\n12.\tFinally, my delegation feels that the difficulty in controlling the world-wide activities of multinational companies justifies examination by this Assembly. Although their provision of capital and know- how is important for the development of the less developed world, questions on the equal distribution of benefits and power remain.\n13.\tWith the independence of Guinea-Bissau, with the restoration of the rights of the people of Mozambique which will soon lead that country to complete independence and with the blueprint for Angola's independence now a reality, Africa has moved closer to its main goal of territorial freedom and unity. My delegation views the installation of the transitional Government led by the Frente de Libertasao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] in Mozambique as a good sign for peace in southern Africa.\n14.\tThe disturbances in Mozambique that followed the historic Lusaka Agreement between the FRELIMO leadership and the Portuguese Government were unfortunate and uncalled for. The Lusaka Agreement itself, seen in its true perspective, is a brilliant victory of the vision and diplomacy of all those who have contributed by their sacrifices to the liberation of Mozambique. To Africa, the Agreement is an unmistakable prelude to the complete decolonization of the African continent.\n15.\tThe recent attitude of the Portuguese Government in facing up to the truth about the rights of people of their former Territories, particularly their right to self-determination and national independence, should inspire all peace-loving people of the world to cooperate in closing honorably the rather soiled pages of the history of Portugal. In this regard, my delegation joins those States which have called on the Angolan nationalists to close ranks and work for the immediate independence of their country on the basis of majority rule.\n16.\tWe in Swaziland sincerely hope for and look forward to a speedy solution of the political dilemma in Namibia. The people of Namibia, like any other people, are entitled to self-determination to allow them to achieve complete independence and majority rule. Swaziland's policy remains strongly that of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States. But this policy is irreconcilable with any form of denial of fundamental human rights.\n17.\tWe have all of us, as Members of the United Nations, collective and individual responsibility to engender proper respect for the authority of the Organization, so that the brotherhood of men can be a practical reality in our world. All African States uphold the policy of good neighborliness, .and one would rightly assume that all desire to practice it. Racial and discriminatory policies militate against fundamental human rights and the establishment of fruitful and normal relations between men.\n18.\tThe settlers' regime in Rhodesia should learn the lesson of Portugal and settle for peace with the majority. My delegation is of the opinion that the British Government which, after 10 years of illegal rule in Rhodesia, is still responsible for that Territory is able and equipped to transfer power to the people of Zimbabwe. So long as the privileged minority is allowed political power, it will not voluntarily give it away. Yet self-determination is vital for the survival of Africa and independence a necessary base for its unity. All Africa must be free in order to unite.\n19.\tIn the unfolding panorama of the Middle East an uneasy calm still reigns. Attempts to secure and to confirm true national sovereignty for the Arabs as well as for Israel are being hindered by disharmony, suspicion and mistrust. These are human attitudes attitudes of one State towards another, attitudes of one racial group towards another attitudes of one power bloc towards another. Nevertheless, all of us should have long realized that in the Middle East, we as human beings are faced with one fundamental need, that is, for peaceful coexistence in that area so that the potential resources, both human and natural, could be harnessed to create a climate for a new society that should \\\"learn war no more\\\".\n20.\tPeace in the Middle East has become a national issue for all of us, for the survival of an international society is inherent in reciprocity and interdependence of nations. The absence of peace in the Middle East means the absence of peace in the world. It is in this spirit that my delegation would like to express appreciation and admiration to all the parties concerned in the Middle East conflict for showing human understanding and seeking a solution through negotiation. We admire also the diplomatic efforts of the leaders in that area in co-operating with those of the United States and the Soviet Union in bringing about better prospects for peace. All men of good conscience who value human life are encouraged by these prospects of lasting peace in that war-torn zone.\n21.\tNor is the Middle East the only area of an in-creasing gravity that threatens such world peace and security. The continuing failure to reach a lasting solution in Cyprus through the apparatus set up by this Assembly is now an obvious handicap to the people of Cyprus in dealing with their own problems in their own way.\n22.\tThe fabric of national unity is being woven in countries still divided and torn by conflicts, and a pattern of national existence is being developed, but not with ease. In the spirit of non-alignment, my delegation applauds these processes and in no circumstances will it take any action that could be seen to prejudice their fuller development.\n23.\tThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the people of Cambodia are capable of solving their problems without outside intervention, and we maintain that they need the necessary encouragement from this Assembly to do so. This principle is equally applicable to North and South Korea in the present circumstances.\n24.\tMy delegation would suggest, in connexion with the Korean question, the following: (a) that the Secretary-General institute a special commission to find out what it is that bars South and North Korea from their declared desire to peacefully unite their country; (b) to ascertain whether, in the event of the withdrawal of the United Nations Command, hostilities would not escalate into another major war.\n25.\tMankind today is not only faced with the question of achieving and maintaining world peace; it is not only faced with the problem of ending local wars, it is not only faced with the dilemma of improving the conditions of life for millions of human beings who now suffer from dire poverty, disease and hunger. Mankind today is also faced with the danger of self-annihilation. The world must achieve complete disarmament in order to re-channel human and material resources to those areas that will bear fruits of meaningful human fellowship for peace and progress.\n26.\tIn this regard, the Swaziland Government will continue to support efforts towards declaring the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. I wish to repeat what His Majesty's Government said on this matter in this very Assembly only two years ago:\n\\\"The area of this [the Indian] Ocean, up until recently not regarded as a sensitive military zone, is becoming a target for the less peaceful attention of some Powers. The nations that rightly regard the Indian Ocean as being on their own door-step have no nuclear designs or any other hostile ambitions in the area. They are in the forefront in seeing that other Powers regard the Ocean in a like manner. Unless the seas and oceans of the world come to be regarded as areas of peaceful and economic development only, un-peaceful usage will become more and more difficult to stop.\\\"\n27.\tIt is common knowledge that all the big Powers and North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] members have pledged themselves to \\\"save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\\\". The scars of slavery, the wounds of colonialism and exploitation, are still all too fresh and painful to us Africans. Therefore, we view with great concern the military buildup in the Indian Ocean by the superPowers and the military alliance of NATO members. Our continent should not be made a battlefield at a time when we are trying to rebuild it from the ashes of colonialism.\n28.\tFinally, the Organization, despite the glaring ineffectiveness inherent in it, has many attributes. One of these is that it has the ability to talk and has been talking for the last 28 years. Talking to each other is a rare gift to man; but as we talk let us listen not only to other people talk; let us listen also to ourselves, so that together, as sons of man, we can rise to heights of freedom, justice, peace, happiness and prosperity to realize peace and security in our time. This can happen if the representatives here present see to it that the deliberations of this Assembly, in the circumstances of our troubled times, search for the highest common factor in peace efforts rather than elegant equations in resolutions.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish first of all, on behalf of the Albanian delegation, to congratulate you whole-heartedly upon your unanimous election to the post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It gives us especial satisfaction to see the work of this session presided over by the representative of Algeria, a country with which the People's Republic of Albania has such close and friendly relations.\n115.\tIt is the second time that the General Assembly has met this year. This session is being held at a time when throughout the world many new events have taken place and continue to take place, giving rise to a number of grave problems. The Albanian delegation, imbued as always with the desire to make its modest contribution to positive progress in the work of the General Assembly, would like to express the views of the People's Republic of Albania and its Government on a series of questions which, in our opinion, deserve special attention.\n116.\tThe events of this year have shown still more clearly the fact that the world is going through a process of swift and dynamic development. The fundamental contradictions of our times are continually worsening and the many contrasts which exist in the various parts of the globe are increasing also. Freedom, independence and the sovereignty of freedom-loving States and peoples, their development and progress are constantly threatened and endangered. The policy of aggression and expansion, of oppression and violence, of exploitation by imperialism and social imperialism has acquired even greater proportions. The unbridled arms race, the growth of military budgets and the preparations for war are continuing without interruption. Aggressive fleets and military bases fill the seas and oceans.\n117.\tThe aggravation of the economic and financial crisis which has shaken the capitalist world has increased the difficulties of the world economy and international economic relations. The efforts of industrialized countries to make the developing countries bear the brunt of this crisis have further worsened the present international situation. The confrontation between peoples the exploited working masses of the countries that want to live in freedom and independence, on the one hand, and the imperialist forces, first and foremost the United States and the Soviet Union, on the other continues to worsen.\n118.\tThe imperialist and colonialist Powers, particularly the two super-Powers, call on all people to open their doors to them, to allow their economic and political interference, because this allegedly will help to create harmony among nations and to further the progress of mankind. But they wish to keep privileged positions for themselves, and ask that independent States give up their right to equality and sovereignty in international relations. The two super-Powers are, in fact, attacking national sovereignty by identifying it with a narrow nationalism. In short, they want others to admit that the world can find peace only if it is dominated by them.\n119.\tThe United States of America and the Soviet Union speculate a great deal about watchwords such as \\\"peace\\\", the \\\"inevitable interdependence of States\\\", \\\"the need to avoid upheavals in the world balance of peaceful coexistence\\\" or \\\"general Nowadays they spread the idea that peaceful peoples and States, the developing countries, cannot do without them, without their aid, without their loan, without their cadres or their technology; that these countries will not able so develop their own natural resource  freely or independently. They go so for as to threaten cut off this \\\"aid\\\", these \\\"loans\\\", to stop supplying machinery. They threaten them with famine and poverty.\n120.\tAs the leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Hoxha, has said: \\\"The two super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, who are engaged in the preparation of the hot war, try by their allegedly generous aid to enslave others, to place them in their economic and political claws, to bring them into their sphere of influence and to colonize them.\\\"\n121.\tThe peoples are beginning to understand better and better the hegemonic designs of these superPowers and they resolutely oppose their neo-colonialist practices. They are determined to strengthen and protect their sovereign rights; day by day they oppose more courageously the pressures and blackmail that are being brought to bear on them and continue their independent development.\n122.\tThe security and safeguarding of independence and full national sovereignty are indispensable factors in the progress of each nation and each State and the establishment of true peace and stability in the world. Events show that in present conditions everyone is affected to a greater or lesser degree by the aggressive hegemonic policies of the two superPowers. There is no country or region in the world which is not affected by the threats, the blackmail, and the interference of the United States and the Soviet Union, their conflicts and the bargaining carried on between them. The existence of aggressive military alliances and closed economic blocs, participation in those alliances and those blocs, the establishment of military bases and foreign troops on territories of other countries, military maneuvers near the borders of other States, agreements in which certain parties take the lion's share, and so on, greatly undermine the sovereignty of many States. Thus, the struggle for the defense and strengthening of national sovereignty acquires primordial importance. It has today become the common cause of all freedom-loving countries and peoples.\n123.\tThe successes which many countries have obtained in the achievement of their rights, in their struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and hegemony show that each nation, even the smallest, when it is resolved to defend its national interests, can face the enemies of its freedom, however mighty or powerful they may be, and overcome them.\n124.\tThe people of IndoChina are still resolutely engaged in their just struggle against the American imperialist aggressors. The Arab peoples have shown on the battlefield that they can triumph over the Zionist imperialist aggression and that they have the forces and other means necessary to regain their rights. The struggle of the African peoples against colonialism, neo-colonialism and racial discrimination has taken on renewed vigor. The developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America have become an important force on the international scene and are playing an active role there. In Europe too and in other parts of the world, a number of countries have risen up with increased strength against the policy of diktat and intervention in their internal affairs.\n125.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly, on the problems of raw materials and development, the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Caracas, and the work of the World Population Conference held at Bucharest were a further expression of the determined efforts of a number of countries, particularly developing countries, to defend their sovereign rights, to affirm their legitimate rights over the seas and oceans, and to become the real masters of their natural resources in order to place them at the service of their own development and progress and to solve by themselves the problems involved in increasing the material and cultural well-being of their peoples.\n126.\tWe greatly appreciate the firm support which the People's Republic of China, that powerful socialist State, is giving to the struggle for liberation waged by the peoples against colonialism and neocolonialism; we appreciate, too, the support that country is giving to the efforts of various countries to defend and strengthen their national independence and its valuable contribution to the cause of the peace and stability of Asia and of the rest of the world. Pursuing a foreign policy based on principle, the great People's Republic of China has become an important positive factor in the present evolution of the world and a determined opponent of the policies of hegemony of the two super-Powers.\n127.\tThe events of this year show that there are many obstacles and difficulties in the way of the achievement of the rights and aspirations of the peoples. Not only do past conflicts and disagreements remain unresolved, but new hotbeds of tension and war have been created, as can be seen by the recent events in Cyprus.\n128.\tThe United States and the Soviet Union, by simultaneously competing and co-operating with each other, are trying to maintain the status quo in the areas which they have already divided into zones of influence; to establish a balance acceptable to them in the areas where they have not yet been able to do that; and to extend their political, economic, military and ideological sway.\n129.\tThose two super-Powers base their policy of hegemony on the force of arms, on pressure, on interference in internal affairs, on intrigues and plots. They often talk about not resorting to force in international relations, and they have made that phrase the leitmotiv of many official agreements and acts; they speak of disarmament but in fact they continue the arms race; they constantly engage in military maneuvers and displays of force near the borders and coasts of other countries; they strengthen their aggressive blocs and try to take military bases and ports away from other States. Like monsters, their fleets plough the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and other seas and oceans, seriously threatening the freedom and independence of independent coastal countries.\n130.\tThe two super-Powers cynically try to arrogate to themselves the right to do what they please and to establish their presence everywhere in the world, to move about freely wherever and whenever they please. The United States ruling circles and the heads of the Pentagon openly state that the United States cannot accept any reductions in its defense budget because it must remain a first-rank military Power and its military potential must remain greater than that of all the others.\n131.\tOn the other hand, the Soviet leaders and their marshals and admirals, with their slogans of \\\"defense of the national interests of the Soviet Union\\\" and \\\"the Soviet Union's political role as a world Power\\\", do not hide the fact that their country must increase its military power and use it as a diplomatic means of intimidation and dissuasion.\n132.\tThe two super-Powers have made a system out of secret diplomacy. The summit meetings between the United States and the Soviet Union and the secret agreements concluded between them, including those concluded in July this year, continue to cast a sinister shadow over the world. Side by side with the deep contradictions that divide them, their hegemonic collaboration has been further strengthened.\n133.\tDespite the noise they are making in an attempt to create the impression that Europe is about to become a region of peace and tranquility, the truth is that real tension and many contradictions exist in that continent and that a large number of its problems remain unsolved. And there the interests and aims of the two super-Powers intersect, for they wish at any cost to make Europe accept a complete division into spheres of influence.\n134.\tRecently, the United StL ,s has been openly exerting pressure on its Western European allies to stop their attempts to take action without the guidance and control of the United States. The Washington Conference on energy problems, the meetings convened to approve the Ottawa Declaration, and so forth, are typical examples of the ojbstinacy and arrogance of the United States in its efforts to make its partners obey and accept United States hegemony. The Soviet Union, for its part, through the Warsaw Treaty and the Mutual Economic Aid Council, has doubled its efforts to achieve the complete economic, political and military integration of the countries within its sphere of influence. Its aim is to limit even more their independence and sovereignty and to turn them gradually , one after another, into kinds of federate republics.\n135.\tFor a long time now the Soviet Union and the United States have been boasting about the \\\"benefits\\\" that the carrying out of their plans for so-called European security would bring to the peoples of\nEurope. But behind these plans are concealed the designs of the two super-Powers to legalize the status quo and strengthen their spheres of influence in Europe, which is contrary to the true interests of the European peoples and of peace on that continent. The People's Republic of Albania is firmly opposed to that kind of security because it would merely increase the insecurity of Europe.\n136.\tIn order to achieve the foregoing objectives the two super-Powers, with a great clamor and all kinds of promises, organized the Conference on so- called European security. But it is already clear that the maneuvers and pressures to which the super-Powers have resorted have not achieved the expected results. The length of the sessions of that Conference and the constant interruptions of its work show that there are many contradictions. A large number of Governments have even felt great disappointment, and they are now much less interested in the Geneva negotiations.\n137.\tIn the Vienna negotiations on the so-called reduction of military forces and arms in Central Europe, the two super-Powers have tried to reach agreement on the number of troops and of armaments that they must maintain in Europe to support their policy of hegemony. The peoples of Europe are not at all interested in a symbolic reduction of American and Soviet forces; they want all those forces to be withdrawn from the countries where they are stationed. Experience has shown that such negotiations are a hoax. On the one hand there is talk about peace and stability in Europe and the reduction of forces and weapons, and on the other the Soviet Union and the United States are intensifying their arms race and building up their military arsenals in Europe, constantly brandishing their weapons and exerting pressure on certain European countries to let them use the territory and air space of those countries for their military forces; finally, under the cover of \\\"friendly\\\" visits they seek to establish their war fleets in the ports of those countries. While discussions go on in Geneva and in Vienna, the Soviet Union keeps sending division after division to eastern Europe and constantly engages in troop maneuvers and movements, creates new military posts and so on.\n138.\tWhy is all this happening? Could it be because the European countries cannot live without American and Soviet protection? No, the peoples of Europe want to be free and sovereign. Thus it is important for them to be increasingly vigilant and to harbor no illusions as to the policies -of the two superPowers. The European people cannot expect their security from the two super-Powers. They will obtain it only through constant struggle against the enemies of peace and security in Europe.\n139.\tThis year the expansionist policy of the two super-Powers has created thorny situations in different parts of the region of the Balkans and the Mediterranean. This has brought a further increase in tension in that region and in Europe .\n140.\tThe painful events that have recently occurred close to the Balkans, on the island of Cyprus, as well as the dangerous and regrettable consequences and complications that accompanied them, show the evils that can come to the Balkan peoples from the hegemonic policy of the United States and the Soviet Union, which engage in intrigue, intentionally create problems, and .arouse hostility among peoples and States and fan its flames, in order to achieve their own designs. They give the best proof of the justice of the words of the leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha:\n\\\"The Balkans have never by themselves constituted a powder keg. If they were so in the past, it was the fault of foreigners who held all the means of detonating the explosion. And it is they who want it to be so again. It is the duty of the peoples of the Balkans to take their swords and cut through all the fuses, so that peace and security may truly be established in the Balkans.\\\"\n141.\t'We believe that peace and stability in the Balkans can be served and national interests defended by developing friendly links among the peoples of the Balkans, by creating an atmosphere of good neighborliness between the States in that region of the world, and by firmly opposing the attempts of the two super-Powers to penetrate as deeply as possible into that area both politically and economically and to establish military bases and free passage for their troops. The \\\"friendship\\\" which either one of the super-Powers offers to any country of the Balkans has many dangerous consequences for its freedom and independence and for peace in the Balkans.\n142.\tThe events in Cyprus today cannot be dissociated from the greed of the imperialist Powers and first of all of the United States and the Soviet Union. American imperialists have organized the bloody events in Cyprus. They have thrown those people into fratricidal war in order to turn that country into a North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] base. They have always sought to use the island of Cyprus as a spring-board for their policies of aggression and expansion in the Mediterranean, in the Middle East and in other areas.\n143.\tSoviet social-imperialists, who have hegemonic designs in the Mediterranean and the near East, have hastened to take immediate advantage of the troubled situation in Cyprus and have warmed their hands at the fire that has been lit there. If we listen to the declarations 6f the Soviet Government, we might think that Government is the most ardent and sincere defender of the interests of the people Of Cyprus and of peace and tranquility on that island. But the Soviet social-imperialists cannot conceal their real designs and their hypocritical role in the events in Cyprus. The Soviet Union is encouraging quarrels and dissension, Its main concern is to take advantage of the situation to create bases for its warships, to penetrate further into the Mediterranean, the Adriatic and other regions of the world, and thus to fulfill an old dream of Tsarist Russia. This is the aim of its efforts to arrogate to itself the full powers of a State guarantor of the independence of Cyprus and to convene an international conference On Cyprus, efforts which are as dangerous for the just solution of the problem and for peace and stability in Cyprus as the various maneuvers and Offers made by the United States.\n144.\tThe Albanian people, who nourish sentiments of friendship for the peoples of Cyprus, Greece and Turkey, and who are sincerely concerned to achieve true peace and security in the Balkans and the Mediterranean, is opposed to any foreign interference in the internal affairs of the Cypriot people, and to any action which would further complicate the situation in that country. The interests of the Cypriot people require first and foremost that an end be put to the interference of the United States of America and the Soviet Union in. the internal affairs of that country, as well as to their attempts to take advantage of the situation created there to carry out their aggressive plans in the eastern Mediterranean.\n145.\tCyprus must be free and independent. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus must be respected. The Greek and Turkish communities must solve their problems' themselves, without foreign interference, on the basis of a guarantee .of coexistence with equal rights, iti perfect harmony and understanding, as is required by their common interests.\n146.\tThe events in Cyprus show even more clearly the grave danger of the presence of American and Soviet military bases and fleets in the Mediterranean for all the peoples and States of that region. Today more than ever it is urgently necessary for the peoples and countries of that area to act resolutely to compel the United States and the Soviet Union to withdraw their war fleets from the Mediterranean.\n147.\tWe hail the efforts and resolution of the Arab people to achieve their lofty national aspirations. In the October 'war against the Israeli Zionist aggressors, they have scored an important victory. During that war the heroic vitality of the Arab people, their strength and unity in combat stood out more clearly than ever before; proof was given us that the Arab people are able to vanquish the aggressor on the battlefield and that the key to the achievement of their legitimate claims is truly in their hands.\n148.\tThe United States and the Soviet Union strive to give the impression that great changes have taken place in that area and that, under their patronage, the problems of the Middle East will soon find a solution. But facts disprove these allegations. None of the causes of the explosive and tense situation in the Near East has been eliminated. The danger of new aggression on the part of Israel against the Arabs is still a reality. Israeli Zionists who live in occupied Arab territories once again state their aggressive claims for annexation; they threaten the Arab people and constantly renew their provocations. All the events that have taken place since the October war the intensification of rivalry and of Soviet-American collaboration in that part of the world, and the new tactics and machinations on the part of the Washington and Moscow diplomats- show that the two super-Powers want at all costs to achieve their former objectives in the Middle East, to transform partial solutions into a permanent status quo, to divide the Arabs and to refuse the Palestinian people their national and legitimate rights.\n149.\tGiven this situation, it appears clearly that the problem of the Middle feast has not been brought closer to a true solution. We cannot build peace in that part of the world by sacrificing the rights of the Arab people. One cannot resolve the problems of the Middle East by sacrificing an entire people, the Palestinian people. We must restore to the Palestinian people, who have been fighting heroically for so many years, all the national rights that were snatched from them. The People's Republic of Albania and the Albanian people continue most strongly to support the just struggle of their brothers the Arab peoples and of the Palestinian people against the imperialist-Zionist aggressor for the restoration of their sovereign rights.\n150.\tThe situation in IndoChina is still very disturbing. The Albanian people and its Government firmly denounce the continued aggressive policy of the American imperialists against the VietNamese people, and their military engagement in South Viet Nam as well as the systematic provocations committed by the Saigon clique against the liberated areas and the barbaric crimes perpetrated against the population of South Viet Nam. We support the struggles of the VietNamese people for the full realization of their lofty national aspirations and the just positions and demands of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam that the Agreement on the cessation of war and the restoration of peace in Viet Nam be strictly respected. The Provisional Revolutionary Government is the sole genuine representative of the will and interest of the people of South Viet Nam. It alone has the right to speak on their behalf. The discriminatory attitude vis-a-vis that Government which the United States has imposed upon certain international bodies must be rejected and come to an end. The United States must cease all interference in the internal affairs of the VietNamese people.\n151.\tIn Cambodia, the United States, with its economic and military assistance, tries to keep alive the Lon Nol clique, which has gone into hiding in Phnom Penh and in some other villages hemmed in by the hatred of the Cambodian people fighting for its freedom.\n152.\tThe Cambodian people, firmly resolved to continue its armed struggle to the end, has rejected the deceitful offers of the Phnom Penh clique for a cease-fire as well as the schemes for \\\"peaceful negotiations\\\" thought up by the United States, for whose realization the Soviet Union is striving too. In order for peace to be brought to Cambodia, the United States must immediately put an end to its criminal aggression and interference in the internal affairs of the Cambodian people, it must cease its assistance to the puppet clique of Phnom Penh and must leave the Cambodian people free to manage its own affairs.\n153.\tThe Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, with its Head of State, Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, is the only lawful Government of that country . It has been affirmed as such in that country and on the international level. It is the only Government vested with the right and necessary power to represent that country in foreign affairs and in international organizations. Albania and 32 other countries last year submitted a draft resolutions requesting that an end be put to the grave injustice being done to the Cambodian people, that the representatives of the Royal Government of National Union be invited to occupy their legitimate place in the United Nations and in the other United Nations bodies, and that the Phnom Penh clique be excluded from them since it represents nothing. We hope that most Member States, acting in conformity with the law and with the facts of. the case, will see to it that the General Assembly puts an end to this abnormal situation and that the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia will have its legitimate rights restored in the United Nations.\n154.\tThe General Assembly must also, without delay, adopt a decision on the evacuation of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations, thus putting an end to overt intervention in the internal affairs of the Korean people. The further maintenance of American troops in South Korea has increased tensions on the Korean peninsula. The United States has arbitrarily dictated the division of Korea into two parts. It continues to support and encourage the puppet regime in Seoul in its oppression of the people of South Korea* and in its constant provocation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Korean people has long asked that foreign troops leave its territory forthwith, and it is fighting to achieve a lofty national aspiration the reunification of its homeland.\n155.\tWe support the constructive efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to find an independent solution to the Korean problem. The People's Republic of Albania rejects the continued presence of aggressive American troops in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations. Those troops must be evacuated from South Korea, and the Korean people must be free to settle its own affairs without any foreign interference. We denounce the conspiracy designed to perpetuate the division of Korea into two parts.\n156.\tThe Albanian delegation believes that the adoption of the draft resolution in document A/9703/ Add;3 at this session would put an end to the inadmissible attitude that the United Nations has held for many years now with regard to the Korean people. That would eliminate one of the main obstacles to the independent reunification of Korea, and would contribute to the reduction of tension on that peninsular . \n157.\tThe Albanian people and Government will continue their 'solidarity with the just struggles of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique, Azania, Namibia, Puerto Rico, Northern Ireland and so on, to achieve freedom, independence and national liberation from colonialism, neo-colonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid. We warmly greet the people of Guinea-Bissau, which has crowned with victory its lengthy struggle against the Portuguese colonizers, which lasted for so many years. We welcome the Republic of Guinea-Bissau* a young, independent State, into the United Nations, and we hope that the peoples of Angola and Mozambique in their struggle for freedom will very soon achieve their aims. The victories they have won in that struggle once again show that the eradication of the odious system of colonialism is an inevitable historical process. Albania: will always strongly support the struggle of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America against imperialism and hegemony, plundering and exploitation - by foreign capitalist monopolies, in order to win and to safeguard their rights, so as to strengthen the sovereignty of their States.\n158.\tThe Albanian people will soon celebrate the glorious thirtieth' anniversary of the liberation of their homeland and the triumph of our people's revolution. The liberation of Albania from the foreign, Nazi and Fascist yoke on 29 November 1944, which resulted from the heroic struggle of the Albanian people, is the greatest victory of our history:\n159.\tDuring these three decades, despite our great lack of progress, a legacy of our past, and the very difficult conditions created by different imperialist and revisionist enemies^ ,our people, guided by our Labor Party and under the leadership of our beloved comrade Enver Hoxha, has been able to weather every storm and to overcome all kinds of obstacles and difficulties and has advanced resolutely and constantly along the path of socialism.\n160.\tIn the first place through its own strength, and thanks to its self-denying work, our people has achieved radical changes in all spheres of life and has completely changed the physiognomy of the country. Albania, which was a backward agricultural country, is rapidly becoming an industrial and agricultural nation. Global industrial production in Albania is today 86 times as great as it was in 1938, and 3.5 times greater than in 1960. In four days our industry now produces as much as it produced in a whole year in 1938. Our global agricultural production is approximately four times greater than it was in the days before liberation. Under popular leadership; the gross national product has increased eleven fold. Albania has achieved total electrification throughout the country. The old taxes of all kinds have been abolished, and health and medical services are now free of charge. Education, science and culture have made great advances on the past and one out of every three persons now goes to school.\n161.\tThe People's Republic of Albania has unceasingly and resolutely pursued a foreign policy based on high principles. The foreign policy of socialist Albania has been in the past and continues to be quite clear; it is a defense of liberty and national independence. It has always been and remains at the service of the cause of peoples struggling to defend their national sovereignty and independence, and in favor of self-determination and the establishment of- international co-operation truly based on equality . Thanks to this just policy the international position of Albania has constantly grown stronger. We have today sincere friends and many sympathizers on all continents. The relations of steadfast militant friendship and close brotherly co-operatiOn between the People's Republic of Albania and the People's Republic of China grow stronger and more firmly consolidated day by day. The People's Republic of Albania has friendly relations with a large number of countries, and has normal diplomatic relations with 66 States and is ready to establish such relations with other peace- and freedom-loving countries-on the basis of the well-known principles of mutual respect, sovereign equality and non-interference in anyone's internal affairs and of mutual benefit.\n162.\tThe People's Republic of Albania, in. future also, will be a resolute fighter against imperialism and social imperialism and will remain an element of peace and stability in the Balkans and in Europe, and it will make its contribution to the defense of the cause of the peoples, of peace and of general security.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I have already had occasion to congratulate you on your unanimous election, and also to welcome the three new Members to our Organization. On the present occasion I am happy to convey to the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our appreciation of his ceaseless endeavors in the cause of peace and in the fulfillment of the principles and purposes of the Charter. We are fortunate indeed in having him as our Secretary-General today, when his views are needed on collective and co-operative action to tackle the diverse and urgent problems facing mankind at present.\n73.\tIn the 29 years of its existence the United Nations has come to represent the overwhelming majority of the peoples and nations of the world. While this is indeed a matter for satisfaction, it is the few remaining areas of darkness that command our attention. I refer to the flagrant violation of the human rights of the majority of its people by the Government of South Africa, to the blatant refusal of South Africa to vacate Namibia, and to the continuance of the illegal racist regime in Zimbabwe. These continued affronts to the conscience of mankind are nagging reminders that, as long as some members of the human race are in bondage, the others are not wholly free. In our view, this Assembly should therefore consider more effective means of compelling these regimes practicing racism to respond positively to the collective will of the world represented by the United Nations.\n74.\tIt is a matter of particular satisfaction to us to welcome the new wind of change in Portugal. Guinea-Bissau has attained independence and world recognition by admission to our Organization. We welcome the installation of an interim Government in Mozambique representing the will and aspirations of its people, and we look forward to welcoming Mozambique soon in our Organization as an independent and sovereign member. This is an irreversible trend and we are confident that the people of Angola will also win their freedom soon in conditions of peace and honor. India is appreciative of the decision of the present Government of Portugal to liquidate its colonial empire. This decision will enable Portugal to assume its proper place in the world of today, a place befitting its distinct history and rich culture. I am glad to say that Portugal and India have decided to re-establish diplomatic relations and to develop cultural relations between the two countries.\n75.\tNow I should like to turn my attention to the areas of conflict. Recent events in Cyprus remind us of the fatal danger of neglecting, until too late,, the potential causes of conflict. In 1960 we saw the freeing of Cyprus from colonial rule and its birth as a sovereign, independent and non-aligned State, whose bi national character was guaranteed by some external Powers. In retrospect, this curious system of external guarantees has proved to be unwise in principle and self-defeating in practice. Recently, one external intervention led to another and a threat to world peace and security was thus created. It is the people of Cyprus who suffered greatly as a consequence and all our sympathies are with them in this moment of crisis and uncertainty in their lives. But the fact that all States without exception have declared their respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of non-aligned Cyprus is a good augury, for it provides the essential elements for a durable structure of peace and a return to constitutionality. We welcome the negotiations taking place directly between the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus which have been arranged with the assistance of the Secretary-General. We hope that their talks will also encompass future internal constitutional arrangements, and that agreement can be reached at an early date so that the withdrawal of foreign forces now in Cyprus becomes possible. The non-aligned countries have already declared their willingness to be available for any assistance that they can render.\n76.\tThe situation in the Middle East may freeze into another period of neglect, if the momentum towards a solution of the basic problems slows down. Only the rapid and full implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) can lead to a just and enduring peace. The restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people is another cornerstone in the structure of a lasting peace. Israel's refusal to vacate Arab territories captured as a result of aggression is a continuing provocation to the Arab States and negates the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. If the catastrophe of another war in the Middle East is to be avoided, Israel should end its aggression and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people should be restored to them.\n77.\tThe war in Cambodia shows no signs of ending, which is a matter of deep concern and anguish for us. In South Viet Nam, violations of the Paris Agreement continue to take place, with the legacies of external interference persisting and jeopardizing the prospects of early implementation of the provisions of the Agreement. How much longer are the peoples of IndoChina destined to suffer the ravages of war with all its frightful weapons? In South Viet Nam international efforts should be directed to the fulfillment of the constitutional provisions of the Paris Agreement. The people of Cambodia should be allowed to determine their future free from external interference and in conditions of peace and security. In Laos we welcome the formation of the Provisional Government of National Union, which is a testimony to the wisdom and statesmanship of the Laotian- leaders. We hope that this development, which has terminated several years of hostilities, will create conditions of peace and progress for the Laotian people.\n78.\tIn our part of the world, I am happy to report that tangible progress has been made in creating an atmosphere of good neighborliness. The Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972 provides a good and common basis for India and Pakistan to turn away from a period of confrontation and conflict to one of peace and co-operation. We have made special efforts to implement the Simla Agreement and, in spite of unfortunate delays, the two countries have concluded some agreements designed to normalize relations. The latest agreement signed at Islamabad on 14 September 1974 provides for the restoration of communications and travel facilities, and we hope that the progress achieved so far will lead to more agreements in other fields and to an era of peace and prosperity for the peoples of India and Pakistan.\n79.\tWe are actively engaged with our other neighbors to develop and extend bilateral and mutually beneficial co-operation in newer fields. The maritime boundary agreement with Sri Lanka is a significant example. Similarly, mutually satisfactory agreements on borders and other long-pending matters have been concluded with Indonesia, Burma and Bangladesh. Our relations with our other neighbors, Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal, are characterized by the spirit of mutual understanding and the desire to co-operate for our mutual benefit.\n80.\tOur underground peaceful nuclear explosive experiment of 18 May 1974 must be seen in the context of our endeavor, at the national level, to develop our natural resources and capacities to the fullest extent for the benefit of our people. The international community has long recognized that nuclear explosive technology can be of great value in the development process. The non-aligned countries had also stressed this in the Declaration adopted by the Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries, held at Lusaka from 8 to 10 September 1970. We have no intention of making nuclear weapons. I wish to reiterate once again in this forum our firm and consistent policy to use nuclear energy and technology solely for peaceful purposes.\n81.\tI should now like to say a few words about the areas of challenge that face the world community. Since the end of the last world war, the principal challenge to mankind has been the discovery of the basis for lasting world peace and security. In recent years, we have seen the evolution of a period of detente and a general relaxation of tensions among the great Powers. We welcome this development as a positive contribution to removing dangers of global conflict. However, the process of detente between the great Powers will have more meaning for the rest of the world if it takes into account the interests of all countries and if the benefits of detente are used to meet the challenges that face mankind, especially disarmament and development.\n82.\tDisarmament has been the subject of continuous discussion in multilateral forums since the days of the League of Nations. But progress was slow, and the arms race entered a qualitatively new phase with the stockpiling of nuclear weapons to such an alarming extent that they are capable, if used, of destroying their targets five times over and obliterating all signs of modern civilization. India feels that nuclear dis-armament should receive the highest priority in our deliberations, for it provides the key not only to the prevention of wars of mass destruction but also to the release of resources for tackling what the Secretary-General has called the other \\\"ancient enemies of mankind poverty, disease, natural disaster\\\" [A/9601/Add.I]. Progress towards disarmament is possible only if nuclear-weapon States abjure all nuclear weapons and accept equal obligations with the rest of the world community. We support the early convening of a world disarmament conference after adequate preparation and with the participation of all States.\n83.\tThe holding of the Caracas session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was an event of outstanding importance. Significant progress was made, as nearly 150 countries worked to reconcile their interests, which were sometimes widely divergent. As a developing country with a long coast-line, India attaches special importance to this .Conference. With several years of preparatory work behind us, it. is our hope that further progress will be made towards an equitable and universally acceptable treaty on the law of the sea during the third session of the Conference to be held in Geneva next year.\n84.\tDuring this year there have been major changes in the international economic scene. This world body dealt with the problems of development not only in the sixth special session held earlier this year but also in the World Population Conference which has just concluded in Bucharest, and it will deal with them further in the World Food Conference which is to be held in November. We are particularly appreciative of the fact that for the first time population questions have been accepted as an integral part of the developmental process. We hope that the World Food Conference will be a first step in tackling, at the international level, an important problem which so far has been neglected by the international community.\n85.\tThe problems of development will acquire ever greater urgency and importance with the rapid depletion of natural resources and the increasing population of the world. They are already assuming global proportions, and their effects will be felt everywhere. They cannot, be solved nationally or regionally, because there is already a growing and irreversible trend of interdependence among nations. Only global solutions can cope with global problems. Every problem today is virtually a world problem and calls for a world response.\n86.\tThe earth's resources are finite, and so is its capacity to absorb wastes. The world is in the grip of economic forces that appear to be uncontrollable. There is rampant inflation as well as stagnation in production. These phenomena have aggravated an already iniquitous situation with extremes of poverty and wealth in the world. In some parts of the world there seem to be no limits to the appetite for consumption, while in other countries millions of people are short of even the essentials of simple and plain living^ such as food, clothing, housing and medicine. The future growth of the developing countries is at the mercy of the high world prices of fertilizers, fuel and industrial goods. What are the global options available in this grave economic situation? It is not enough for the affluent countries to confine their concern to monetary fluctuations. There is an imperative need to help the countries most seriously affected by the current economic crisis. Any long-term global balance between demand and supply and natural resources must take into account, first and foremost, the requirements of those countries.\n87.\tWe welcome the statement of the Secretary- General in the thought-provoking introduction to his report that \\\"it is an underlying assumption of the United Nations that no problem of human relations is insoluble [ibid.]. It is in that spirit that we view the decisions of the sixth special session which are designed to pave the way to a new international economic order. While we appreciate the efforts made by the Secretary-General in trying to maintain the momentum generated by the special session, we note that he has himself pointed out that \\\"failure to sustain international action and collective responsibility may easily put in question the actual survival of millions of people\\\" [ibid.].\n88.\tAn emergency operation has been entrusted to the Secretary-General to provide immediate practical assistance to the most seriously affected countries, which have been rendered unable to meet the mounting costs of their essential imports [resolution 3202 (S-VI), chap. X], The responsibility for their present predicament is clearly not their own; they have been reduced to this precarious situation by economic events outside their control. In recognition of this fact, the sixth special session decided that emergency measures were necessary for assisting these countries, and it also envisaged the necessity for medium-term assistance to them. However, we are disappointed at the offers received so far of help for these countries. If tragic consequences to many countries and general disillusionment as to the effectiveness of international co-operation are to be averted, assistance must be forthcoming quickly and in adequate measure.\n89.\tPerhaps at no time before in human history has mankind been confronted with problems of the present scope and scale. And at no time before has man been so conscious of the unity and common destiny of his own kind. Nor has he ever been in a better position than now to regulate his resources, his consumption and his environment in such a manner as to meet his material and spiritual needs. There is no forum more appropriate than the United Nations for meeting to the full extent the challenges facing us. There is no better time than the present, and the lead can only come from those who are blessed with the means to do so.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and the people of Argentina, I should like first of all solemnly to express in this august Assembly our most profound solidarity with our sister republic of Honduras and its people in these hours of trial and sorrow. The Government of Argentina has already taken the necessary steps to bring Honduras evidence of our moral support and of our specific material help in order to contribute with our means to the alleviation of so tragic a situation, which we all feel as if it were our own. On this very day, aircraft of our air force are leaving for that sister republic, carrying the first aid which we can offer in these hours of tribulation. We have also committed ourselves to delivering 5,000 tons of wheat, or its equivalent in flour, to meet the first needs of the population which has been the victim of the catastrophe.\n55.\tThe President of the Republic of Argentina, Mrs. Maria Estela Martinez de Peron, has called the Ambassador of Honduras to Argentina to her office, so as to make available to our sister republic all the assistance that it may need. I trust that all countries represented here will also be mobilized so as to help the Republic of Honduras.\n56.\tIt is a most happy coincidence that as I address this General Assembly, our debates are now being guided by an illustrious representative of the great nation of Mexico, with which my country maintains the most cordial and brotherly ties of friendship.\n57.\tThe election which has conferred on Mr. Bouteflika the lofty position of President of this session of the General Assembly not only implies recognition of his personal qualifications and his ability as a representative of the great nation of Algeria but is also a tribute to the vigorous policy which that country has been developing with the non-aligned countries.\n58.\tThus, a personality of the third world is today responsible for guiding an Assembly which faces problems of vital interest to mankind. Among them we emphasize in particular the quest for means that will make it possible from many directions to approach that international understanding and that meeting of minds that we all desire and advocate. To extend the area of peace, to lessen the gulf between the developed and the developing countries and to bring dignity to man constitute the main challenges that the world must answer in order to achieve its objectives of understanding and unity.\n59.\tAt last year's session [2139th meeting] I emphasized that I was representing a people which by an overwhelming electoral majority had just definitely identified itself with the ideals of social justice, economic independence and political sovereignty. Since then, Argentina has made substantial headway along this course, consolidating its successes and adopting a far more positive political personality in the community of nations. In faith and serenity Argentina has whole-heartedly and without reserve embraced the cause of mankind, which is the real cause of the twentieth century, devoting its greatest efforts to the individual and collective well-being of the people. At the same time, it has maintained its historical traditions, which allow it the rather exceptional privilege in the world today of granting equal rights to all men throughout the world who wish to live in our land, without distinction of race or nationality.\n60.\tIn the past year, the Republic of Argentina suffered the great loss of its leader, Juan Peron. Great statesmen live on beyond their lifetime because their principles and their objectives remain in force, and it is my duty to emphasize here that those we inherited from General Peron have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of Argentina. His prophetic ideas transformed him into the precursor of universalism and of a \\\"third position\\\" which are today recognized as being essential means for inter-national coexistence. His death deeply moved the entire nation, but his thinking and his guidance constitute inalterable goals for the march of our Republic towards the future. And the people of Argentina firmly maintains the policy of international co-operation which he established and, in its relations with all the countries of the world, it ratifies his purpose of achieving a genuine international social justice. Among the ideas put forth in his message to the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which met in Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973, he expressed total support for the cause of the countries of the third world, indicating the imperative need for a \\\"change in social and productive structures, because incontinent luxury and waste cannot continue to be the basic motive force of any society.\n61.\tThese expressions and this ideology, of profound philosophical and humanist content, are the ones T wish to recall here with the utmost solemnity, reiterating the Argentine commitment of solidarity with the non-aligned countries. The future will see us still standing in their ranks and sympathizing with their aspirations, Nothing can better describe the attitudes of a numerous and outstanding group of countries -among which we are honored to be-than their desire for truth and justice, their complete respect for the dignity of man and their rapid and decided march towards the liberation of their people. I therefore reiterate our position as expressed at the Algiers Conference in regard to the Political Declaration,  which recommends support for decolonization and the liberation of territories occupied by force, as well as in regard to the Economic Declaration which, together with the Action Program for Economic Co-operation, is intended to enable the members of the group to develop with equality of opportunity with regard to the terms of trade with other countries of the world so that there will be a better and more just distribution of resources that will in turn contribute to greater harmony in international coexistence\n62.\tThe destiny of my country is today in the hands of Mrs. Maria Estela Martinez de Peron, who has the massive support of the citizens and of all the power factors of the nation, and she is energetically proceeding along the course set by General Peron, implementing the same ideas and seeking the attainment of identical objectives. The community of ideas and ideals between both ensure the historical continuity of Peron's thinking and the lasting character of his great design for Latin American integration, the inalterable validity of which I am pleased to reaffirm now.\n63.\tThe delegation of Argentina attends this great meeting at times which are particularly crucial for the future of the world, The combination of factors of economic and monetary tension, of generalized inflation, of the multiplicity of international political crises in various continents and the shortage and waste of natural resources, together with disease and hunger, the reduction in food reserves and the growing wave of violence throughout the world, have meant that, as our President has said, the times in which we live must be described as \\\"the era of insecurity\\\".\n64.\tThis disquieting picture appears paradoxical when we consider the high degree of technical and scientific development achieved by mankind. There are space trips and the breaking down of the atom; and still hunger, poor health and ignorance remain, whereas they should have been distant memories of superseded stages.\n65.\tOne of the solutions is clear: to unite our most determined efforts so as to achieve an equitable and just distribution of goods. If that is not rapidly achieved, tensions between human beings will increase in an accelerated manner and will increasingly acquire the apocalyptic shape of armed conflict.\n66.\tThe future demands special efforts from the United Nations, which must adopt the decisions which are indispensable to contributing to understanding among peoples and nations, to seeking the well-being of all and to avoiding the harmful predominance of some over others.\n67.\tOn the one hand, we have to review the problem of ensuring equity in the treatment of human beings in the world: of those who suffer serious poverty while there is infinite wealth; of the man with great spiritual worth, with great ideals and purposes, which all the religions and philosophies have emphasized, and of the man who is subjected to the physical limitations of the material world in which he has to live, and where frequently he is humiliated and subjected to deprivations of all kinds. Thus, rebellions are born, and sometimes they break out at odd times so that it becomes difficult to correlate them with their genuine causes. This diagnosis of the dramatic circumstances in which the world is living is, I believe, part of the conscience of all representatives, thus constituting a problem of responsibility towards others and towards ourselves.\n68.\tOn the other hand, the speed of change is such that we observe that neither persons, nor States, nor international organizations manage to keep up with an evolution which, because of the multiplicity of new discoveries and the growing interdependence among nations, creates a very dangerous delay between the adoption of decisions and their implementation. This then is yet another challenge which the United Nations faces.\n69.\tIt was Peron who was a true precursor of this universality which has today become a fact and who anticipated by almost two decades the problems that we now confront. He then stated the \\\"third position\\\". He clearly foresaw that a merciless dispute between the mighty would only contribute to a mass impoverishment of the world and, in particular, of the peoples who are today united under the principles and ideals of the \\\"non-aligned\\\".\n70.\tThe leader of the Argentine people said in February 1972:\n\\\"We believe that the time has come when all peoples and Governments of the world must become aware of the suicidal march of mankind through the pollution of the environment and the biosphere, and the waste of natural resources. It is no less serious that the social systems of waste of the technologically most advanced countries operate through the consumption of vast amounts of natural resources contributed by the third world.\\\"\nAnd he added:\n\\\"All these problems are indissolubly linked to the relaxation of international tension and the extension of international co-operation.\n\\\"In the defense of their interests, countries must move towards regional integrations and action based on solidarity.\\\"\n71.\tIt is to solve these problems that we are meeting today. No one can allege that he has not at this stage heard the anxious appeals of the dispossessed. The calls for help must be heeded, without verbal demagoguery; with just and realistic action, with respect for all and with magnanimity, particularly for the humble, and fundamentally by becoming aware of the fact that the time has come when the peoples of the world must go through life in understanding and solidarity toward a common destiny of greatness; otherwise, through selfishness and intolerance they will fall into the abyss of pain and poverty.\n72.\tAt the recent sixth special session, the General Assembly dealt with some of the underlying causes of the ills of mankind. But some of the objectives set were not achieved. Natural resources are still being wasted; it is maintained that industrialized products are unattainable for the majority; the price and wage race continues, causing inflation which shakes the general economy; and protectionist trade retains its pernicious rigidity for the socio-economic situation of the world.\n73.\tIt has been repeated insistently and it was proclaimed by the General Assembly at its sixth special session, in the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-K/J]- that it is necessary to facilitate the access of the developing countries to the markets of the developed by the gradual elimination of tariff barriers and other restrictive practices which hamper trade.\n74.\tOnly if the developing countries have a substantially greater share in international trade will it be possible to bring about a profound structural change and arrive at a just and permanent solution to present problems, thus consolidating a genuine process of development of our economies,\n75.\tThose objectives have been rendered null. In this respect, a most significant example is provided by the measures taken since April last by the European Communities to limit the importation of beef, measures which culminated last June with the total cessation of beef importation until I November 1974. That decision, taken without consultation, jeopardizes agreements that are linked to the economies of the developing countries which export meat to that market.\n76.\tObviously, it may be argued that those measures are caused by internal difficulties in the sector, but they arise from production and marketing policies and mechanisms that are highly protectionist, that have notoriously unfavorable repercussions upon international trade and are certainly not in accord with the repeated declarations of the European Communities in various international forums in favor of greater freedom in world exchanges.\n77.\tPeace, freedom, co-operation and friendship: those are big words which have been heard thousands of times in this Hall. Let us not again make the mistake of repeating them when they are devoid of practical content.\n78.\tTime and space are already too limited. We pride ourselves on the honorable, albeit demanding, title of plenipotentiaries of mankind, which desires order, well-being and justice. Were this Organization to prove unable to perfect itself as a sound instrument to bring about the common well-being of peoples, its authority would be seriously jeopardized and hopes for understanding among States would suffer a hard blow.\n79.\tThe interests of Argentina are not isolated; all peoples are with us in our ideals -in particular, the peoples of the third world. Our fundamental objective must be peace. Nevertheless, that peace does not depend solely on the silence of arms among nations. It depends also upon whether human beings are satisfied with the circumstances in which they happen to live. That depends on security of feelings and brotherly assistance, on the balance between needs and resources; it depends on the access of all to food, education and health. Thus peace, as has been said many times by His Holiness the Pope, cannot be based upon selfishness, poverty or moral degradation, be it internationally or at the level of the individual contact of human beings in each organized community.\n80.\tMay I quote a statesman? He said, \\\"If the strong try to impose their points of view, they will do so at the expense of justice and will bring about uprisings; if the weak resort to pressures, they will do so at the peril of world prosperity and bring about despair\\\", and, \\\"No nation or group of nations stands to gain anything by making claims in excess of the limits the economic growth of the world can bear.\\\"\n81.\tThat is a wise formula. But where will we find the just balance to apply it? Can we avoid the pressure of the strong? Can we do away with the despair of the weak, who constitute ever-growing multitudes and are afflicted by all kinds of needs? Important are the rules of the game we shall set so as to encourage what is best in human nature. And so the Republic of Argentina comes here once again with the greatest willingness to co-operate in the search for equitable but urgent formulas, ideals and practices which will respect the dignity of mankind and lead it to prosperity and confidence. We do not wish to yield to the temptation to make rhetorical allegations removed from the raw realities of the daily existence of millions of human beings. Accordingly, it is necessary that the spirit of co-operation become part of every conscience. We must respect each other's rights and share our efforts to achieve the progress and prosperity of the world.\n82.\tTaking into account that supreme aspiration and the constant and growing preoccupation of the vast majority of mankind, my delegation once again pronounces itself decisively and firmly against any policy of apartheid, and we state in advance that Argentina will support the resolutions this Assembly will adopt definitively to eradicate such practices, which degrade the inalienable dignity of the human person.\n83.\tNew practical procedures must be added to those already adopted by the United Nations. Such developments as greater communications, communications by satellite and the inevitable coming together of the world means that what is happening elsewhere is felt to be happening to oneself, Any event that affects one region or country has a palpable and almost immediate effect even in the most remote continents. More than ever, the world is one unit -one unit of events and thoughts, one social and economic unit. We face an irresistible force of cohesion.\n84.\tLet us, therefore, increase the effectiveness of the United Nations, which has won so much praise and rendered so much service as the only wise and viable mechanism so far developed for an exchange of views and for joint efforts by mankind.\n85.\tTo that end a first, and very efficient, method would be the strengthening of bonds between similar geographical zones. Here I believe it desirable to emphasize the ideals we pursue. We are applying a policy of co-operation and complementarity with neighboring countries, because universality must logically start at the regional level.\n86.\tIt is fitting to emphasize here that \\\"universality-\\\" means a total plurality of subjects or objects, each part acquiring its consistency in reference to the whole but without losing its sovereign individuality. That is the philosophical interpretation of the concept, and thus also we clarify the significance -primarily national, although with world-wide repercussions- of the doctrines we profess.\n87.\tAs a doctrine, we believe that to build a world society it is necessary to pass through a stage of continentalism. Countries must unite progressively on the basis of geographical neighborhood. This is Argentina's vision for Latin America: one that is just, open, generous and above all sincere. At the national level, no one can find fulfillment in a country that has none. The same holds true at the continental level. We wish to work jointly so as to build Latin America within the concept of an organized community. Its triumph will be ours, and it will also be that of the brotherhood of the third world, and it will be the triumph of unity among all States.\n88.\tThe Republic of Argentina therefore wants to place its resources and its potential above all at the service of its sister republics of America, without in the least overlooking the brotherhood we profess towards all other nations and in particular towards the nations of the third world.\n89.\tWe must go on uniting our efforts so that the vast natural resources of our American continent may be exploited for the benefit of the peoples that inhabit that soil and also may contribute to alleviating the penury of food, commodities and industrial goods in other areas of the world.\n90.\tIn particular, Latin America is living through an era of integration sustained by great spiritual vigor. We have a common strength which comes to us from the beginning of our history rooted in our origins and our similarities of character. The Republic of Argentina takes pride in being part of a continent which has so many potentialities and whose peoples hold aloft the banner of their legitimate claims, claims which include such basic and natural rights as the right to be able to trade among themselves in accordance with complete national sovereignty, to keep their territories free from any intruder or invader and to apply their own laws to their own acts; a continent which affirms justice and respect for ideologies, a continent, finally, which shares heroes who are revered as a common heritage.\n91.\tAs Peron stated:\n\\\"Latin America belongs to the Latin Americans. We have lived a history. The history of the future will not forgive us if we fail to be faithful to our past ... We Argentinians feel a strong Latin American conscience ... We are firm advocates of an effective spiritual closeness for the peoples of America and reciprocal co-operation at the economic level. It is unacceptable that in the name of the interests of the continent anyone should interfere in our internal economy and external policies ... In our Latin American continent many popular leaders are working for this brotherhood, and the results achieved so far are very rewarding.\\\"\n92.\tThus it is undoubted that the exercise of political sovereignty, whatever the historical circumstances, is not negotiable. This guiding principle multiplied in the national conscience of every Latin American country creates a total regional conscience, which accordingly is not negotiable either.\n93.\tThe Republic of Argentina now as never before feels that its ties with its sister republics in Latin America are deep. We feel at one with the sufferings and the just claims of the peoples which constitute the third world, and we consider that we are thereby also serving the cause of all human beings who want union and not hatred, love and not division.\n94.\tIn referring to this need for understanding and justice, Argentina cannot fail to point out that without doubt the United Nations General Assembly expressed itself to that effect when it adopted resolution 3160 (XXVIII) urging that negotiations proceed without delay with the United Kingdom in regard to the Malvinas Islands.\n95.\tOur country still has to bear the occupation of part of our territory by an extra-continental Power, a situation which is not in accordance with the direction and the ideals of the world today, and the Republic of Argentina considers that this continuing situation is inadmissible. It is true that, as my Government communicated to the Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contacts do exist for resuming these negotiations. A solution, however, has not yet been reached, and I must accordingly reiterate here the unalterable sovereignty of Argentina over the territory of the Malvinas Islands and point out that this just claim will of necessity condition our international relations in any circumstances in which our right may be discussed,\n96.\tAs I said not long ago at the Atlanta Conference of the Organization of American States \\\"The decision to achieve the final eradication of this anachronistic colonial situation is one which is shared by all the people of Argentina, and their Government recognizes it as a mandate that cannot be renounced.\\\" I reiterate my confidence that, in seeking a solution, we shall be able to count on the necessary understanding and political decision of the present Government of the United Kingdom so as to put an end to this problem.\n97.\tAs proof of our concern in regard to the matters involved, I declare once again that the Republic of Argentina will do everything in its power to protect the interests of the inhabitants of the Islands and to increase their well-being, thus enabling them to accede to the benefits and progress enjoyed by the people of Argentina. Therefore I am pleased to announce here that a few days ago I had the satisfaction of signing, together with the representative of the United Kingdom in Buenos Aires, separate notes in which an enlargement of the fuel plant installed by my Government on the Islands is envisaged as well as other measures intended to facilitate trade between the continental territory of Argentina and the Malvinas Islands.\n98.\tWe know that international policy is not a goal in itself but a means of contributing to the happiness of man and the greatness of States; but international policy is also a duty for Governments in order to fulfill the destiny of each people. From its very inception Argentina, in attaining political independence, placed everything it possessed at the service of the peoples of the continent. That has been our guideline. That is our objective for greatness, and under our present decisions both in the United Nations and in the inter-American system we shall continue to follow that historic mandate and achieve and strengthen hemispheric brotherhood.\n99.\tI do not believe it would be idle to emphasize once again here the importance which the Republic of Argentina attaches to the principle of non-intervention. That principle, which has no limitations, must be applied without exception and must once and for all become a sacrosanct norm of the external policy of States. Only four years ago this very Assembly so decided in unequivocal provisions of resolutions 2625 (XXV) and 2627 (XXV).\n100.\tAs integral members of the Latin American community we are bound to express our satisfaction that a noble nation, albeit far removed from Latin America, has ensured the study by this Assembly of a legal political institution which was inherited from our own motherland, Spain, and which is typically Latin American. I refer to the item on diplomatic asylum, included in the agenda Of this session at Australia's request [see A19704]. Diplomatic asylum is but a humanitarian rule to give shelter to those who are persecuted for political and not criminal reasons. In Latin America asylum in diplomatic missions has been an unbroken tradition maintained by almost every Government at all times, even when there was no obligation to provide political asylum. Argentina signed the initial multilateral treaty at the Latin American level in Montevideo in 1880s and has had the opportunity of applying its generous principles not only in America but in other hemispheres.\n101.\tThe seventh special session to be held in September 1975 in the two weeks preceding the thirtieth session of the General Assembly acquires particular significance in the light of the results achieved since the sixth special session, on raw materials and development. Argentina shares the general feeling that the seventh special session must provide a unique opportunity for achieving the objectives incorporated in the Declaration [resolution 3201 (S-Vl)} and the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, since the sixth special session was but a transcendental point of departure in a particularly dynamic process, the goal of which is the establishment of a new international economic order which will be more just and equitable. Possibly one of the means of achieving more practical results in the deliberations might consist in some change in the administrative structure of the United Nations to adapt it better to quick changes, particularly in the economic and social fields, so that the developing countries could be better represented in executive posts in that administrative structure.\n102.\tOn the other hand, the Republic of Argentina is keenly interested, in accordance with its governmental and political philosophy, in everything relating to the quality of life, because that is tied to the very future of mankind. We therefore pay particular attention to problems relating to natural resources and the environment, and we consider it timely for the United Nations to continue to deal with those far-reaching items with special emphasis.\n103.\tIn particular, my country is interested in those and other aspects which deserve further study and solution in this General Assembly. I am referring to \\\"collective ecological security\\\", that is to say the cooperation which must exist between States in order to maintain an equitable balance in regard to certain elements which cover or involve more than one country and action in solidarity when the acts of one Government might run counter to that concept. Thus, in principle, we might consider as being in contradiction with the collective ecological security of nations such acts which, to an extent that is not normal, disturb health conditions, the climate, their own or shared natural resources or the purity of waters that flow from one nation to another, or such measures as might affect the natural existence of forests, rivers, the fauna and flora of land, seas or rivers or those which could contaminate the atmosphere.\n104.\tMy country reaffirms the inalienable right of peoples and nations to permanent sovereignty over their own natural resources and wealth, whether they be removable or non-removable, living or nonliving. That is a principle which we practice to the full, in particular as regards energy resources.\n105.\tIn accordance with the characteristics of shared natural resources for use and exploitation we seek the establishment of general and universal policies on the basis of recognition and reaffirmation of principles and practices which have been sanctioned by use, doctrine and international jurisprudence, Along that line of thinking the General Assembly established, in resolution 3129 (XXVIII), a mechanism for prior consultation and the exchange of information, so that the exploration, exploitation and development of shared natural resources might be carried out in close co-operation between the parties concerned and in a rational manner so as to obtain optimum yields.\n106.\tWith regard to the results of the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, my Government deems them to have been positive, Undoubtedly, the international community has lent broad support to the maritime claims of the Latin American countries.\n107.\tIt is the hope of Argentina that agreement will be reached on a convention which will finally provide adequate political solutions to the difficult maritime and oceanic problems. In the first place, with the establishment of a territorial sea of 12 miles and an adjacent exclusive economic zone up to a distance of 200 miles, within which there would be freedom of navigation and overflight and freedom to place submarine cables, the coastal State would exercise sovereign rights in regard to fishing, the regulation and control of scientific research and the preservation of the marine environment,\n108.\tThat position prevailed at the Caracas session. We hope it will be strengthened in Geneva and finally enshrined in the future convention. And yet we believe it is fitting to warn of the dangers of some proposals which apparently recognize the 200-mile zone, but with so many conditions attached as to distort its essence. This claim by some great Powers, which cannot resign themselves to losing their privileges, is unacceptable to the developing countries,\n109.\tLikewise, the Convention cannot affect the rights acquired by the coastal State over its continental shelf beyond the 200 miles since the continental shelf, in accordance with existing inter-national law, constitutes the natural prolongation of its territory under the sea. In other words, no acceptable political solution can affect the sovereignty of the coastal State over its submerged territory, which extends to the external lower edge of the continental margin, My country hopes that this position will be finally accepted at the next session of the Conference, since this mechanism will prevent the renewal of international injustices on the sea international injustices which have characterized the appropriation of natural resources on land.\n110.\tIt has been the purpose of the Government which I represent to intensify to the utmost the links of the Republic of Argentina with the other countries of the international community. The last decades have been witness to fundamental changes in the world community, with the inclusion of many nations which have emerged to independent life and the resurgence of others which, although having a glorious past, had been subject to long periods of subordination or isolation, To those States, which constitute a large part of the third world, the diplomatic activity of Argentina was specially directed so as to seek their presence when it had been absent and to strengthen it where it existed.\n111.\tThat policy was not due merely to a desire to create or to intensify relations. It was the response to a profound motivation, to a sincere and open feeling of solidarity with the peoples of the third world,\n112.\tAt this difficult and. complex stage of substantial and rapid alterations in relations among States, the need for close and frank co-operation is imperative for those who are not at the center of power. In this way we prevent the fundamental decisions of world policy being adopted in our absence or without taking into account the interests of those who represent two thirds of mankind.\n113.\tThis act of solidarity of the Republic of Argentina has been made manifest in various international forums and has led to the recognition of new States and the establishment of diplomatic relations with numerous countries in every latitude. This is eloquent testimony of our will to expand our international panorama to the utmost and to create a constructive dialog with all geographical and political entities, once and for all going beyond the ideological and partial schemes or omissions of the past.\n114.\tThe most recent event of this new approach of our foreign policy, which faithfully reflects the aspirations of the Argentine people, has been the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. We thus supplemented the first step which we took several months ago when the Government of Argentina recognized that new State in the midst of difficulties which still hampered its fully independent life. Today I am most happy to welcome among us that country whose struggle for emancipation evokes in our memory the emancipation battles of Latin American countries in different times and circumstances but with the inspiration of the same ideals of freedom and justice.\n115.\tWe sincerely hope that the process of liberation of the Portuguese colonies will continue at an accelerated rate. The policy implemented by the new Government of Portugal deserves our respect and we express the hope that other events will rapidly take place which will assist in ending once and for all vestiges of a colonialism which history has superseded.\n116.\tBecause of our proven anti-colonialist vocation, we add the voice of the Republic of Argentina to that of the Secretary-General, who, in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Al960IIAdd.I], emphasizes the positive and valuable aspects of the new policy of Portugal in regard to its former colonies. The change has a transcendental projection within the framework of the United Nations, whose constant struggle to eradicate those chronic situations of injustice had the active support of my country. Now our Organization must be the main channel whereby opinions and actions of the international community will be guided in this question,\n117.\tWe also welcome the other two new Members of the United Nations, Bangladesh and Grenada. With regard to the latter country, may I in particular mention the special satisfaction of the Government and people of Argentina at its admission; the Latin American group has gained a valuable representative which, together with the other English-speaking countries in the hemisphere, will help in increasing their over-all contribution to the \nimportant questions that are before the Assembly at this session.\n118.\tMy words are a message of brotherhood towards all nations and they express in brief the feeling of the people of Argentina which, with its willingness to serve, endeavors to contribute with what is best in itself so that by achieving spiritual and material progress for every human being we will give effect to our aspiration to build a better world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure, at the outset of my address to the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, to join with those who preceded me in expressing my sincere and profound congratulations to the distinguished President of the Assembly, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session. Your election, Mr. President, is a personal tribute to your accomplishments and your struggle. It is likewise a tribute to the struggle of our brother people of Algeria.\n48.\tI should like at the outset also to express the most sincere and heartfelt congratulations, and a fraternal welcome, on the occasion of the admission of three new States to our international family, namely Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. The admission of the two latter States to the family of the United Nations is further evidence of the twilight of the colonial era and its eclipse in the remaining Territories which for so many centuries have suffered under its yoke. It also heralds a new era of freedom and human dignity.\n49.\tMy Government, while acknowledging with appreciation the wisdom and far-sightedness which the new Government of Portugal has shown, hopes that Portugal will continue its enlightened policy of decolonization in the other territories which have not as yet achieved their liberation namely, Mozambique and Angola.\n50.\tA cursory glance at the agenda of the current session, which consists of more than 100 items, conveys a clear picture of the broad and comprehensive scope of the present tasks which indeed constitute a permanent and continuous challenge of this universal Organization.\n51.\tIn the agenda there are certain items which have become our inheritance year after year either because of their importance and their recurring nature or, in many instances, on account of the failure of the United Nations to find appropriate and effective solutions, notwithstanding the United Nations resolutions pertaining thereto, which have expressed the will of the international community by categorical and absolute majorities.\n52.\tOn the agenda, and in the valuable report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [AI960I and Add.I] there are items of considerable importance and gravity. These items form significant landmarks along the road, if not decisive cross-roads. It is incumbent upon all of us to accord them optimum and most expeditious attention before the position deteriorates and they become unnameable to solution.\n53.\tI refer here to what the Secretary-General says in the introduction to his report concerning the sixth special session, which the General Assembly held in the spring of this year to discuss the situation regarding raw materials and development [Al960llAdd.l, sect. V]. We believe that these two matters constitute an embodiment of the great economic and social issues which confront the present international community.\n54.\tIt has become all too clear that the acute economic crises and social upheavals which the world is witnessing today are not isolated or unforeseen occurrences. Nor are they confined to one country or region. Rather, they represent a rapid deterioration, the inevitable outcome of which may well undermine the entire economic and social structure of the whole world. They are the outcome of several phenomena, including a population explosion in many parts of the world which does not seem to lend itself to any control, as was seen during the World Population Conference held in Bucharest during the summer of this year.\n55.\tThere is also the accelerating attrition and waste of the world's finite raw materials stemming from an inexorable consumer revolution, particularly in the developed countries, without regard for the rights and needs of succeeding generations.\n56.\tThere is also the revolution of rising expectations, which is pervading the whole world, as a result of increasing progress and awakened consciousness unprecedented in the history of the human race. While the World Population Conference dealt with an important element in the current international economic situation, Jordan looks forward with considerable interest to the forthcoming World Food Conference, scheduled to meet at Rome next November. It is our hope that the Conference will succeed in formulating a world food policy which will include the expanded production of food-stuffs, the equitable distribution of food and the establishment of a sound basis for world food security.\n57.\tLast, but not least, is the deep and growing chasm between the developed and the developing countries, the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\", whose efforts to catch up with the march of progress are being rendered more costly and difficult as a result of inflation, owing to which most of them are compelled to import, for reasons which have nothing to do with their own conditions but are rather the outcome of economic and social convulsions in the more advanced States and societies.\n58.\tThese fateful, vital issues were discussed in depth and detail during the sixth special session of the General Assembly and this is not the appropriate place to analyze them or pass conclusive judgments on them. However, I feel compelled to refer to them, for two reasons.\n59.\tFirst, the current economic situation in the world affects the survival of hundreds of millions of the human race, particularly in the developing countries. Furthermore, the world today has become so inter-dependent that if one member is stricken all others feel the affliction, not in one area of life but in all its manifold manifestations.\n60.\tSecondly, there are persistent and unfair attempts to explain the current world crises by placing responsibility on the shoulders of a group of developing countries which nature has endowed with one principal raw material petroleum. This is being done at a stage in technological progress at which petroleum plays an important if not a cardinal role. But, we are entitled to ask and Jordan, incidentally, is not an oil- producing country is the inflation which threatens the economy of every country in the world a product of today or even of the recent past, as claimed by those who wish to link it to the rise in petroleum prices during this year? Do we not all realize that the runaway inflation which is getting more and more out of control is the consequence of years of economic and social convulsions in the developed countries?\n61.\tAll States, big and small, rich and poor, are genuinely concerned about controlling the ever more devastating inflation, because a stable, reasonable and balanced criterion of value is an indispensable condition of the preservation of stability and confidence, which are the corner-stone of any sound economic or political world order. This can be achieved only by quiet dialog and objective appraisal in the search for appropriate solutions.\n62.\tDiverting attention from the real causes under-lying the destabilization of the world economic order or attempting to find a single fictitious scapegoat for the present world malaise, will not serve the interests of any party. On the contrary, this compounds an already sordid situation.\n63.\tThe Government of Jordan wishes to acknowledge with approbation the initiative which the oil- producing countries have taken in the establishment of special development funds and programs to assist the developing nations of the third world in shouldering the burdens of the present and in -looking to a better future. It is our hope that good will may be followed by speedy and practical implementation because bureaucracy, as the experience of developed countries in carrying out assistance programs have taught us, often constitutes the major obstacle to satisfying the needs and the aspirations of peoples for a better life.\n64.\tWe are convinced also that the peoples of the third world, including the 130 millions of the Arab nations, will receive a fair share of all the investment and assistance programs which countries with a currency surplus intend to carry out in order that every part of our world may become an active and positive factor in the world economy rather than a burden on it.\n65.\tThis will also dissipate the myth that there are funds without peoples and peoples without funds. The Arab nations, in partnership with the peoples of the third world, are capable of absorbing a substantial ratio of any surpluses that may become available, for their own good as well as for the world economy as a whole.\n66.\tEconomic development and sound international dealings presuppose the existence of an international order based on justice in every corner of the globe. Peoples can never devote any thought to the precepts of normal life, to which we all aspire, so long as they are deprived of the elements of peace and national security for their peoples or their homelands. Let us add to this what certain people suffer as a result of racial discrimination which is contrary to all the values of the civilized world and which is the scourge of every country or people which allows itself to exercise this discrimination.\n67.\tI am stressing this view because I represent a country that is an integral part of the greater Arab homeland and that has had to suffer aggression against its peace, security and territorial integrity. The share of such aggression falling to Jordan has been substantial.\n68.\tThe agenda of this twenty-ninth session is studded with items concerning the Middle East which are in essence and in reality derivatives of one basic problem, namely, the Zionist aggression in Palestine and the extension of that aggression over the past quarter of a century to include territories and peoples of neighboring Arab countries.\n69.\tThus, we have, for example, item 38, pertaining to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. I do not believe that anyone will disagree when I state that it is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, agenda item in the history of the United Nations. The tragedy of it all is that it pertains to the fate of one and a half million human beings who are still living a life of dispersal, deprivation and physical, as well as psychological, suffering in consequence of their forced expulsion from their homeland in 1948.\n70.\tUnder this item the General Assembly also receives the report of the United Nations Palestine Conciliation Commission, which in the early 1950s, and in co-operation with all parties concerned, strove to arrive at a just and permanent solution to the Palestine question, on the basis of the implementation of all General Assembly resolutions on this subject. All the parties concerned, including Israel, came to an agreement and initialed what came to be known as the Lausanne Protocol. But no sooner had Israel signed that instrument than it retracted and refused to ratify it. It consequently caused the loss of an historic opportunity to settle this dispute once and for all, thus sparing all concerned the wars and tragedies of the past quarter of a century.\n71.\tAlso on the agenda is item 40, which deals with Israeli oppressive practices against the inhabitants of the occupied territories since 1967; the violations of their human rights and Israel's systematic efforts to absorb their lands and transform their physical terrain and history. And while violations of human rights continue unashamedly, and unacceptably to our contemporary world, regardless of the guises and excuses under which they are perpetrated, they are nevertheless violations of the rights of humanity. They are reflected in the atrocious and irresponsible tampering by Israel with a civilization that has a legacy going back almost two thousand years. Before our eyes is the holy city of Jerusalem whose historical, architectural, religious and cultural legacy falls victim to the hammers of destruction, mutilation and distortion, regardless of its sacredness, its majesty and its eternity. The fact that it symbolizes the loftiest spiritual aspirations of humanity has not spared Jerusalem the agony of a ruthless metamorphosis.\n72.\tThe agenda also comprises a broad item under the heading \\\"The situation in the Middle East\\\" [item 109], This simply alludes to the fact that Israel, which launched an all-out aggression against three Arab States, namely, Jordan, Syria and Egypt, in 1967, still persists in that aggression by its continued occupation of vast areas of Arab lands. And even though the war of October 1973 was a reminder to Israel that its expansionist aggression and usurpation of other people's lands could lead only to an explosion, it has reverted once again to dragging its feet. Israel has been declaring to the world that it is determined to grab this part or that part of Arab occupied homelands; that it would be ready to withdraw from a bit of territory here and a bit of territory there, arrogating to itself the option of which parts of our homelands and rights it would not wish to relinquish, and without showing any serious concern lest such an attitude destroy the possibilities of establishing a just and permanent peace in the Middle East, in accordance with the resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council.\n73.\tIn historical hindsight it becomes abundantly clear that what happened in 1967 was a calculated and deliberate plan. If anyone has any doubt that this is so, let him look at how Israel, after occupying Jerusalem, the west bank of the Jordan and Gaza, went about absorbing those territories, in addition to occupying them. Let him witness how Israel today refuses to pull out, in any real or meaningful sense, from these occupied territories, notwithstanding the fact that the Arab States directly involved have agreed in unequivocal and categorical terms to accept peace, within the framework and provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and its subsequent concomitant resolution 338 (1973), which confirms it. What excuse remains in the arsenal of Israel for re-fusing to relinquish the territories which it occupied by force of arms in 1967?\n74.\tThe agenda includes an item entitled the \\\"Question of Palestine\\\" [item 108]. And as the title indicates, it represents an initiative to restore the question to its roots and fundamentals, after it has lain in abeyance for more than 20 years. During all those years any discussion of the problem was restricted to subsidiary issues such as that of resolution 194 (III), paragraph 11, which the General Assembly adopted in 1948 asserting the rights of the Palestinians to return to their homeland and properties and ensuring compensation for those who might choose not to return. I need hardly remind this distinguished General Assembly that the said resolution, along with many others, has remained ink on paper and is being stored under a thick layer of dust and indifference became Israel wished it to be so. The General Assembly has remained immobilized and incapable of doing anything about it.\n75.\tThe items to which I have referred will be dis-cussed in full detail when the time for their debate comes up. But I feel it is my duty, within the framework of this general debate to outline as clearly as possible the position of Jordan in regard to this question.\n76.\tFirst, Jordan supports without reservation, like all its sister Arab States indeed, like all States of the world that are committed to supporting right and justice the full restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people.\n77.\tSecondly, the rights of the Palestinian people have been victimized by the most flagrant of violations ever since 1948, when the majority of the Palestinians were forcibly expelled from their lands and from their homeland. Furthermore, the rights of the Palestinian people were once again trampled upon in 1967, when Israel occupied large areas of Arab territory within which live more than a million people. The rights of the Palestinian people quite obviously cannot be restored except on their own soil and in their own homeland, in accordance with the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations, and by their being enabled to return to their homeland through an ending of the occupation.\n78.\tThirdly, Jordan's direct historical, national and moral imperative is to do all it can, in conjunction with the other Arab States, with a view to restoring the territories occupied as a result of the grave setback suffered by the Arab States in 1967. This duty stems from Jordan's national commitment, as well as from the special relationship which identifies Jordan with the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people.\n79.\tIt should be recalled that, following the catastrophe which befell the Palestinian people in 1948 and which resulted in the loss of four fifths of their homeland, a voluntary unity was achieved within the framework of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan between the east bank and the west bank of the Jordan. That unity remained and stood firm until 1967, when Israel succeeded in occupying the west bank in its entirety, along with its occupation of other Arab territories.\n80.\tJordan will continue every effort for bringing about the total withdrawal of Israel, so as to make it possible for the people of Palestine to exercise their right of self-determination in their own homeland and on their own soil. This is a position which Jordan shares with all the other Arab States.\n81.\tI wish to emphasize here that the only obstacle standing in the way of the Palestinian people in the exercise of their rights is the Israeli occupation and Israel's obduracy in refusing to implement the principles and resolutions of the United Nations.\n82.\tIn close proximity to our territory lies the island of Cyprus, with its Greek and Turkish communities, with whose ancient and valiant peoples we have the strongest bonds of fraternal friendship. Our people were dismayed, as were other peoples, by the national catastrophe that has afflicted this small and beautiful island. My Government offers its deepest condolences for the innocent victims from among the two communities who lost their lives. Jordan also expresses deep regret for the destruction that has been wrought upon the economic structure of the island. It is our fervent hope that the international community will, after the restoration of peace and amity in Cyprus, offer the necessary assistance to enable that country to rebuild its shattered economy.\n83.\tThe explosion of the situation in Cyprus, though its immediate cause was the mistakes of a handful of people who did not weigh the consequences of their acts, serves none the less as proof that a policy of sleeping through crisis situations and letting the fire smolder under the ashes, and failing to take serious initiatives with a view to solving deep-rooted crisis situations as was the case in Cyprus is the most short-sighted and most dangerous of policies. Time does not solve problems; it merely aggravates them. It is to be hoped that the tragic events in Cyprus will serve as a lesson to those who are content to leave crisis situations unresolved as is the case in the explosive Middle East because of either short-sightedness or lack of will, or both.\n84.\tJordan quite naturally supports the preservation of the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus. We also believe that this should be based on the peace and security of the two communities, without allowing conflicting external interests in the world to stand in the way of such an accord. We hope that the leaders of the two communities will reach an agreement that will ensure such peace and security, without permitting external interests to aggravate the situation.\n85.\tJordan has followed with profound satisfaction the continuation of the policy of detente which was the central theme of the debate at its twenty-eighth session. I wish to stress in particular the attitude of detente which permeated the two major Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, in their efforts to limit strategic weapons. But there is, as the Secretary-General has noted, a greater danger arising from the increasing proliferation of atomic capabilities among a growing number of States [A/96011Add./, sect. X], The danger is particularly great in view of the fact that any differentiation between atomic capabilities for peaceful purposes and those for military purposes is inconsequential. It is a noteworthy fact that there are at present perhaps 12 States with the potentiality of becoming nuclear-weapon States, but which have not as yet signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XX//), annex]. Some States have signed it but have not yet ratified it. This number may well double over the next few years.\n86.\tIt is the duty of the United Nations, and particularly of the major Powers, to do everything in their power -and to do it before it is too late- to ensure a firm and effective system to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This can be achieved only on the basis of equality of treatment for all States within each region. If one State is permitted, either by silence or out of permissiveness, to acquire nuclear arms, it becomes impossible to persuade the other States of the region, which deeply feel this terrifying power hovering over their heads, to refrain from acquiring possession of such arms as time goes by. And therein lies the danger to world peace as a whole.\n87.\tJordan fully supports the proposal to declare the regions of the Middle Bast and of South Asia nuclear- free zones similar to the one declared in the case of Latin America, and approves the increasing attention that is being given to proposals to declare the continent of Africa a nuclear-free zone as well. This can become a plausible and serious objective only if each and every State within the regions concerned abides by it without exception.\n88.\tThe world today is passing through one of the most perilous periods in the history of the human race. On the one hand, this period holds out great hopes for the advancement of mankind; on the other, it is fraught with unprecedented dangers because of its potential for destruction. In many circles there is a growing feeling of inevitable doom. But we need not be unduly pessimistic because, given good-will, sound judgment and selflessness, we should be able to tackle and successfully overcome every problem that now appears difficult or incapable of solution.\n89.\tJordan, as an integral pa.*t of the Arab world, believes that the time has come for the Middle East to surge forward, with all the human and material re-sources at its disposal, in a renascence that will not only resuscitate its own great cultural heritage -it is the cradle of civilization -but also work towards the enrichment of contemporary civilization and culture, side by side with the other nations of the world.\n90.\tOur nation looks forward with determination to becoming, shoulder to shoulder with the other peoples of the world, a positive force in shaping the present and the future. It will not tolerate a situation in which its causes remain but sordid and repetitive items at every session of the General Assembly.\n91.\tThe capabilities of our nation are still either dispersed or immobilized in consequence of the aggressions and the unlimited and unreasonable demands made upon it. These aggressions and demands are unique in that they run counter to the aspirations of all peoples for freedom, progress, and unrestricted international co-operation and amity. Hence, it is incumbent upon the United Nations not only to stand by the cause of right and justice, but also to strive firmly with a view to making it possible for the Middle East to become an area of peace, progress and justice, for the good of our region itself and of the world at large.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of Sweden, I wish to join in the congratulations that have been addressed to Foreign Minister Bouteflika on his election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The high responsibilities entrusted to him testify to the important role of Algeria in international politics today, as well as to his own outstanding qualities as a statesman. The excellent relations that exist between Sweden and Algeria are an added reason to express pleasure in seeing him occupy this distinguished office.\n182.\tLet me take this opportunity also to thank Mr. Leopoldo Benites for his outstanding work as President of the General Assembly at its last two sessions.\n183.\tSince last year's general debate important, often dramatic, events have occurred which clearly have influenced relations between countries and groups of countries. Those events have illustrated both the possibilities and the limitations of our Organization.\n184.\tSince this is the first time that I have spoken before the General Assembly, let me confirm the determination of my Government to support, as before, all efforts to strengthen the authority of the\nUnited Nations and its capacity to further the aims of the Charter. At the same time, Sweden consistently pursues a policy of non-alignment in peace aiming at neutrality in time of war.\n185.\tThese two principles in Swedish foreign policy have the overwhelming support of public opinion in Sweden. They supplement each other.\n186.\tWe are deeply aware of the connexion between peace and security in Europe, global detente and disarmament, a more just relationship between rich and poor nations, and respect for the right of all peoples to decide their own future. We have found that the aims of our foreign policy, as I have described them, give rise to expectations that Sweden should make active contributions in these various fields. At times they may also give us special opportunities to act.\n187.\tThe Organization should be a forum where all peoples can present their policies and defend their interests. That is also what we need in order to tackle the immense problems which now confront us and which concern all human beings. In this spirit I wish to welcome our new Members, Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau.\n188.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development, became a milestone in the history of the United Nations. It stressed the increasing interdependence between all countries. It made clear that co-operation on equal terms between developed and developing countries is a necessary condition for the progress and development of the world community. This is also true for the fight against world inflation.\n189.\tThe gap between rich and poor nations is widening. The world's resources are unequally distributed. They are scarce, and tend to become even more so, in relation to a growing world population that expects at least satisfaction of basic needs for food, housing and employment. A more just world economic order must be created, where the rich countries show restraint in the use of the world's resources. We must be aware of the limits of what the human environment can bear when the world's resources are being exploited at a rapidly increasing pace.\n190.\tThe World Population Conference in Bucharest emphasized, in its Plan of Action, the relationship between, on the one hand, population trends and, on the other hand, economic and social conditions, as well as the distribution of the world's limited resources.\n191.\tToday millions of people suffer from hunger. If we do not succeed in solving the problems of food production, we have to reckon with the fearful prospect of new millions being condemned to malnutrition and premature death. The World Food Conference in Rome must be followed by concrete measures and commitments.\n192.\tThe next session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea must establish conditions for the exploitation of the oceans with a view to guaranteeing good management and fair distribution of their wealth.\n193.\tThe United Nations has to come to grips with the problems arising from conflicts between growing multinational enterprises and the legitimate needs and claims of individual countries.\n194.\tThe world conferences in 1974 and 1975, together with the review of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, provide a unique opportunity to work out an integrated approach to problems of global development. We regard this work as an indispensable part of the efforts to secure peace in a long-term perspective.\n195.\tOf equal importance is the work of the United Nations to avert and overcome crises which constitute imminent threats to peace and security, and to create the foundation for lasting peace by means of disarmament.\n196.\tThe Charter of the United Nations places the main responsibility for peace and security on the permanent members of the Security Council. This assumes a willingness and ability on the part of the States to reach agreement. Two of them, the United States and the Soviet Union, have come to play a special role on account of their economic strength and their military resources, particularly in the field of nuclear weapons. All attempts to limit their immense armaments should be greeted with satisfaction. The results so far, however, have been quite inadequate. No efficient barriers have yet been created to halt the development of their most destructive weapons. The cessation of all nuclear testing still meets resistance. The unwillingness or inability of the leading nuclear-weapon States to live up to their commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is one of the reasons why the Treaty has not gained, sufficient support. The threat increases that nuclear arms may be produced by a growing number ,of countries. Six Powers have carried out nuclear explosions during the past year. A strengthening of the control of fissionable material is a matter which requires urgent international attention. The multilateral agreements which have so far been reached in the field of armaments are of limited value. The negotiations on a ban on chemical weapons proceed only too slowly. The efforts to prohibit the use of particularly cruel weapons have not yet resulted in any decisions.\n197.\tStates Members of the United Nations must raise their voices to make it clear that practical results are now needed in the struggle against war and the means of war.\n198.\tThe United States and the Soviet Union have tended to seek bilateral understanding also on other vital issues. The efforts towards detente by these Powers seem to imply mutual recognition of, and respect for, the interests of the other party as well as an understanding to follow closely and to attempt to limit any crisis which ultimately may lead to a major war. Agreements between them for these purposes are essential for lasting world peace. However, this policy also entails problems for States and peoples whose legitimate interests may not be duly taken into account. The policy of detente is incomplete as long as it does not tackle the basic political problems which create local tensions and conflicts.\n199.\tThe great Powers have in a number of cases been anxious to anchor their agreements in decisions by the United Nations. If other Member States are given reasonable opportunities to influence the final results of negotiations, such ratification by the world community is in the interest of all. Confidence in the United Nations is strengthened. All States are given joint responsibility for translating the agreements into practical action and for making them a basis for peaceful and permanent solutions.\n200.\tThere is anxiety in many quarters that States commanding superior resources may use them in order to influence internal political developments in smaller countries. The Charter of the United Nations as well as the Declaration on Principles of Inter-national Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV), annex] aims at establishing protection against such interference. The Declaration emphasizes that every State has the duty to respect the right of all peoples freely to determine, without external interference, their political, economic and social conditions. It is emphatically stated that no nation shall\n\\\"... organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State\\\".\nEvidently those principles are as binding for great Powers as for small nations. No State may evade those obligations by referring, for instance, to interests of national security.\n201.\tThe tragic fate of Cyprus is a matter of serious concern for the United Nations and its Members. No one can deny that the crisis was triggered by the irresponsible policies of the earlier Greek regime. The dangers of expansionist dictatorship, lacking democratic support, have again been demonstrated. We welcome the fact that the people of Greece will have the opportunity to shape its own destiny.\n202.\tThe military intervention of Turkey in Cyprus could be viewed against the background of 10 years of unsuccessful attempts to regulate the relationship between the two population groups on the island and the situation that suddenly arose this past summer; but in the light of the Charter, the Turkish intervention is a matter for serious concern. Today there is an urgent need for clear confirmation that the objective of the intervention is restricted to maintaining the independence of Cyprus and protecting the legitimate interests of the Turkish minority.\n203.\tIn our opinion, any settlement of the Cyprus problem must provide guarantees for the independence and territorial integrity of the country. Independent Cyprus must also be enabled to continue its policy of non-alignment. Sweden does not try to persuade other States to adopt a policy of non- alignment but regards it as essential that such a policy, once freely chosen, be respected. Strategic interests must not take precedence over the right to self-determination of small countries.\n204.\tIn the other serious conflict in the Eastern Mediterranean, the United Nations involvement dates back to the role played by the General Assembly in the question of Palestine during the years immediately following the Second World War. Time and again basic United Nations principles have been violated in the tense situation that has since then prevailed in that area. Negotiations aiming at a peaceful solution did not prove possible. The way in which the great Powers pursued their interests, often in competition with each other, contributed for a long time to the aggravation of the situation. When they changed their policies in the direction of mutual detente, they left the Middle East problem as deadlocked as before. It was a tragic paradox that a new military flare-up became a precondition for the active involvement of the great Powers in bringing about negotiations which might open up prospects for a settlement. The world now waits with impatience for the parties to begin at last substantive negotiations in Geneva. It is obvious that the endeavours towards a lasting peace in the area must be based on certain principles which have gained widespread support among the Members of the United Nations. The acquisition of territory by war is not admissible. The right of the State of Israel to exist must be clearly recognized. All States in the area must be able to live in security. The legitimate interests of the Palestinian Arabs must be satisfied. The responsibility of the United Nations for any solution that may be reached must be clearly stated.\n205.\tThe United Nations has been kept out of the problems in a third conflict area, IndoChina; but important principles of the United Nations have been at stake in the Viet Nam conflict. Resistance to a necessary process of decolonization lay behind the many years of cruel and brutal fighting. The Paris Agreement put an end to the extensive and direct great-Power intervention; but fighting is still going on in Viet Nam, and tens of thousands of human lives are being sacrificed. This is because the fundamental political problems have not been solved in accordance with the Agreement. In particular it is obvious that the Saigon Administration has no intention of implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement. A devastating war is driving Cambodia ever deeper into chaos and misery. The United States still bears a heavy responsibility for the absence of a solution to the problems in IndoChina. It should also be noted that the Paris Agreement provides for international machinery to be put into effect should the Agreement be violated; but this machinery has not yet been used.\n206.\tThe continuous debate and pressure of opinion within the United Nations led to the increasing international isolation of the former Portuguese regime and eroded the basis for its antiquated colonial policy. Within Portugal, strong popular forces carried on a courageous struggle against the dictatorship and its policies.\n207.\tThe liberation movements in Africa contributed to creating a new situation. Portuguese soldiers and officers who all too long had been forced to fight a meaningless war without hope decided one day to set their country upon the path of democracy and human rights. Thereby the road was cleared for negotiations on a peaceful liquidation of colonial rule. The new Portuguese Government has shown a constructive attitude which deserves the appreciation of the international community. The African States and the liberation movements have important tasks to fulfill in the final solution of the problems of decolonization. GuinearBissau has already gained independence. Mozambique has taken decisive steps in the same direction. In Angola, it is necessary to create appropriate and effective forms for the transition from colonial rule to true independence. Sweden has, within the .framework of international law, supported and will continue to support the forces striving for decolonization.\n208.\tOur Organization must now consider how to tackle the problems of Southern Rhodesia, Namibia and South Africa. Great vigilance is called for against any effort to secure or expand white minority rule. The sanctions against the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia must be made more effective. The Smith regime has every reason to fear future developments. Nor can the white ruling class in South Africa remain unaffected by the ever stronger winds of change.\n209.\tThe United Nations must increase its efforts to make South Africa abandon its abhorrent policy of apartheid and respect United Nations decisions on Namibia. The non-white majority in South Africa deserves all possible support in its struggle for liberation. Sweden is prepared to make practical contributions to the efforts of the United Nations Council for Namibia.\n210.\tWhen the United Nations was founded, problems such as apartheid were considered to be outside the competence of the Organization. Developments since then have meant the rejection of too narrow an interpretation of the expression, in Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter, \\\"matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State\\\".\n211.\tIn a similar way, the United Nations has demonstrated a growing interest in human rights, traditional civil rights as well as economic and social rights, which have a decisive importance for safeguarding human dignity and for offering a better life to all inhabitants of the earth. There are still no means available to induce Member States to respect those rights even when they are stipulated in conventions and solemn declarations. A wide gap often appears between legal documents and reality. But public opinion must constantly be mobilized in support of human rights. Non-governmental organizations have an important task to fulfill in this field. Commitments made by Governments must be observed. New commitments must be prepared. This work also serves the cause of peace and detente. Extreme violations of human rights evoke international tension. The campaign of protest against the brutal regime in Chile is a case in point. The new rulers of Chile must be reminded that the exercise of power based on brute force can only bring misery to the people and dishonor to the country.\n212.\tOnly through strenuous work for justice in relations among nations, as well as among citizens in any one nation, can the United Nations realize the ideas embodied in its Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am happy to join those who preceded me in paying tribute to you on your election to the presidency of this, the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, We recall with satisfaction the initiative taken by the President of Algeria which led to the convening of the sixth special session of the General Assembly to deal with a matter of immediate concern to all nations. At this time when our preoccupation must be the need to forge a new international economic order, we can think of no better tribute to you and your Country than that the honor of presiding over the deliberations of this session should be bestowed upon so illustrious a representative.\n141.\tI wish also to place on record our deep appreciation of your predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, whose wise and efficient guidance of our deliberations during the twenty-eighth regular session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly not only earned him the respect of the international community but also brought credit to his country and all of Latin America.\n142.\tI should also like, on behalf of my delegation, to pay due tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the untiring efforts he continues to devote to the service of the United Nations.\n143.\tToday we greet three new Members of this Organization. My delegation has great pleasure in being able on this occasion to extend a cordial welcome, to our sister Caribbean State of Grenada, which has long-established links with the English-speaking States of the Caribbean, links which are the result of a common historical experience. We are indeed happy to share with Grenada the stirring challenges that face this body.\n144.\tAs one of the first States to recognize the sovereignty of the people of Bangladesh, we take particular satisfaction, too, in welcoming a delegation from the People's Republic of Bangladesh and would reiterate to them our sympathy concerning the recent natural disasters which so cruelly struck this new nation. Our condolences also go to the Government and people of Honduras on the suffering which that sister Latin American State now experiences after the grave tragedy which befell it on the eve of this Assembly session.\n145.\tThese calamities must serve as forcible reminders of the obvious responsibility this Organization must seek to discharge in providing assistance in cases of natural disaster.\n146.\tWe must welcome, too, the fact that the Portuguese people have found a new leadership persuaded to end the vicious wars which that country has waged in Africa for over a decade. The presence of a delegation from Guinea-Bissau in this Assembly is a welcome indication that the Portuguese Government accepts the inalienable right of a people to govern itself. We look forward to being able by the next session to welcome delegations from the other Territories which, until recently, formed part of the Portuguese empire.\n147.\tThe universality of membership of this Organization will provide the possibility of greater contentment and, it may be hoped, easier dispersal of the suspicions and frustrations of its Member States. But the admission of any new Member State reminds us that Belize, a member of our Caribbean community, has yet to achieve its independence, not because the metropolitan Power has refused to surrender its control, but because it fears possible assaults upon its territorial integrity. We believe it to be the responsibility not only of States like mine that share a common destiny with Belize but also of this forum to be continually seized of the problem and to work towards a solution that will help to ensure the ultimate goal of independence for that Territory.\n148.\tWe regret to note, too, that in southern Africa the indigenous peoples are yet struggling to attain the human status which the Members of this Organization are committed to guarantee to all peoples of this world. It would be difficult to justify in any human terms the oppression meted out to the African populations of Namibia and Rhodesia and the abominable repudiation of human values practiced under the system of apartheid in South Africa.\n149.\tMy Government has time and again emphasized its abhorrence of the malevolent system of apartheid and will continue to condemn the South African Government for its criminal imposition of this system on the peoples of southern Africa, for its refusal to hand over Namibia to its legitimate rulers and for its support of Rhodesia's illegal Government -all in defiance of the United Nations and its Charter.\n150.\tBut while we display eagerness for every people to enjoy its inalienable right to political freedom and would share in their joy of newly gained independence, we must reflect whether the attainment of sovereignty is not threatened by the political and economic instability of today's world. Barbados is pleased to note the continuation of the very positive steps which some countries have taken during the past year further to resolve their differences. The widening and deepening of detente between the superPowers will no doubt save humanity from the ravages of another major war, and the poorer and weaker countries must applaud all efforts to strengthen peace and security in the world.\n151.\tBut it is with regret that we observe that no lasting settlement has yet been found for the conflict in the Middle East. There are few international problems which so clearly bring home to the small countries of the world how negligent the so-called great Powers have been. It was these Powers that sponsored the creation of the State of Israel. But their pursuit of shifting and contradictory policies and their use of the area as a stamping-ground have been largely to blame for the sorry and wasteful belligerence that has prevailed in the region since 1948 and the tragedy that has overtaken millions of Arab refugees.\n152.\tWe would applaud the tireless and concerted efforts which brought about disengagement in the region after last October's conflagration, but we feel it the moral responsibility of the same Powers to bring all parties to the long-standing conflict to the conference table, to have the problems of frontiers worked out and to have the problem of the wandering and buffeted Palestinians resolved -in short, not only to effect disengagement, but also to create a lasting and effective basis for peace in that part of the world. It would then be possible to ensure that the human and material resources now devoted to the waging of war in that l ea could be better deployed to the general fulfillment of all the legitimate goals of humanity within the Middle East.\n153.\tMy country also deplores the damage done to the political independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus during the past few months. Here is ,a case of a small, defenseless country ripped apart at the will of more powerful countries and made the battle-ground upon which the latter choose to settle their differences. This most recent experience is indeed a sad commentary on the achievements of this body since the Second. World War, for it again reminds us that our system of international peace-keeping is at best selective, at worst ineffective.\n154.\tAnother area of major concern must of necessity be the economic injustice suffered by the majority of States and peoples. At no time in the history of this Organization has the world economic outlook been as gloomy as it is today. Throughout the countries of the developing world there is a common denominator: life is poor in quality, poor in prospect. And yet it is not by divine inevitability that the rich grow richer and the poor grow poorer.\n155.\tAs we approach the mid-point of the Second United Nations Development Decade, we might understandably extrapolate from our accumulated experience in international co-operation for development and ask whether that experience justifies faith in a future of fruitful action in this sphere. Unless we would proceed blindly in today's world of crises, inflation, disequilibrium and deepening poverty, we cannot escape the responsibility of examination and analysis of the factors underlying the frustration of our agreed goals and objectives.\n156.\tThirty years ago the Charter of the United Nations committed the international community to the creation of conditions of stability and well-being and to ensuring a minimum standard of living consistent with human dignity through economic and social progress. The launching of the First and Second Development Decades marked attempts to give substance to this pledge and to adopt policies of international co-operation to achieve the agreed purpose. It was true then, and remains tine today, that the scale of such co-operation should match the magnitude of the problem.\n157.\tThat the record of achievement of the stated goals has been less than satisfactory is a common-place. That there is a probability of abandonment of the goals is now a common fear. So let us not forget that the crisis in energy* is but the latest in a series of crises or setbacks that have characterized the international economy in recent times.\n158.\tWe all know that the widening gap between rich and poor countries predated the energy crisis. We all know that the phenomenon of international inflation -the export of inflation from the rich to the poor countries -predated the energy crisis. We all know that the specter of global food shortages predated the energy crisis. We all know, too, that foiling levels of development assistance predated the energy crisis. All this is known.\n159.\tBut the phenomenon of vastly increased prices for the world's main source of energy has aggravated these trends. For oil-importing developing countries the prospects are bleak indeed. The most affected among the developing countries can hardly afford to buy food any longer. For the rest, the disequilibrium of crippling external payments prevents the expansion in productive capacity that is a prerequisite to growth and improved living standards. In this period of international economic crisis the future prospects of the majority of the world's peoples will depend on how poor countries like Barbados, with fragile economies, are able to manage the immediate problem. The case for immediate emergency relief to the most affected countries of the world is beyond dispute. The problem is survival today, or we may not reach the challenges of tomorrow.\n160.\tThe international community has in fact ad-dressed itself to that problem. The elements for the mechanism of relief were agreed in the Special Pro-gramme contained in the Program of Action adopted at the sixth special session of the Assembly. The dimensions of the problem and the magnitude of assistance needed have been outlined by the Secretary- General. But once again performance unhappily falls below requirements and expectations. And, if we must be frank, it falls below the collective ability of those able to assist. The world is treated to the spectacle of posturing by all but a few of the donor countries, while those in need remain uncertain of the fulfillment of the aims of the Special Program and of the magnitude of the assistance they will receive, and are doubtful whether such assistance as is eventually rendered will reach them in time.\n161.\tBut let us not forget that development -not mere survival- remains the essential path to peace and justice. And let us not be fooled into believing that the improvement in the living standards of the vast majority of the world's peoples will necessarily be achieved by stop-gap measures, any more than it will be achieved by an exclusive concern with the survival of those on the brink of total disaster. Countries like mine, which previously received little by way of development assistance, can no longer view with equanimity either the absence of such assistance or its painfully slow rate of disbursement.\n162.\tIt has long been recognized that an essential ingredient of international co-operation for the achievement of a more equitable world order is the transfer of resources from the developed to the developing nations. In today's realities, oil-exporting countries can play a crucial role in making such transfers possible. Looked at in the longer term, what is doubtless needed is a restructuring of the productive capacity of the world as distinct from the mere redistribution of its incomes. That, as we see it, is the essence of the new economic order called for by the sixth special session. The elements of the new order are already perceived. The courage for its implementation is yet to be demonstrated.\n163.\tThe demand for a new order of international economic justice has been nowhere louder than at the United Nations Conference recently convened in Caracas to work out a new regime for the control of the resources of the sea, My country put forward the view that the formulation of the principles of any regime governing the use of the sea may well depend on the willingness of the developed maritime countries to accept the fact that the rules of the traditional freedoms of the sea as at present interpreted by them have to give way to a new and revised order based on political and economic justice. Developing countries must exercise sovereignty and control over the marine resources within their national jurisdictions, while at the same time accepting responsibility for ensuring that the traditional interests of the community of nations in the areas of their sea are respected and protected. It is to be hoped that whenever the new regime that will govern the use of the sea is finally elaborated there will be an effective expression of political and economic justice on the sea -justice which, regrettably, we cannot say now exists on land.\n164. The Government and people of Barbados believe that we are here to bend our several efforts to the improvement of the human condition. If by our words and our deeds we fail to justify that belief, I must then ask, why are we here?\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is a great pleasure for me on behalf of my Government and personally to congratulate you on your election as President of the twenty ninth session of the General Assembly.\n15.\tWe congratulate not only you as President on this honor and this confidence that have thus been placed in you personally, but also your country, Algeria. The place of your country and your own personal place in the field of international cooperation will make it greatly possible for you during your presidency to initiate those progressive, conciliatory  and mediating activities upon which the success of our General Assembly depends.\n.\n16.\tIn his interesting report on the work of the Organization [A/9601 and Add.I], the Secretary General has made it quite clear that this session of the General Assembly is of particular significance. Our attention this year must be focused on the danger of a recession in the industrialized countries, on the new possibilities for cooperation between industrialized and developing nations, and on the urgent need for emergency assistance to the countries most seriously affected by the economic crisis.\n17.\tThe United Nations must be prepared to keep abreast of rapidly and radically changing problems. At the same time, nations must be ready to meet new challenges. We must all realize the steadily growing interdependence of nations. The traditional grouping of countries is undergoing changes. International solidarity has become indispensable for an increasing number of countries.\n18.\tThe past year has seen sharp changes in international price relationships. The rate of inflation rose steeply. Balance of payments difficulties are threatening a great many countries. The deliberations of this General Assembly on economic and social problems are taking place against the background of fears of a world economic recession unprecedented in the history of this Organization. If we allow the situation to become further aggravated, the whole world will stand to lose.\n19.\tNot only a feeling of solidarity, but also far sighted self-interest should inspire the wealthier nations to contribute to the promotion of economic progress in the less fortunate countries. These countries, for their part, must recognize that stable economic growth in the developed countries is a sine qua non for the expansion of world trade and, in turn, for the economic development of the developing countries.\n20.\tAt the sixth special session of the General Assembly I stated from this rostrum [2218th meeting] that, in the view of the Danish Government, changes in relative prices are not only acceptable but necessary if technological and economic progress in all parts of the world is to continue.\n21.\tBut at the same time I warned against substantial price changes over short periods. Industries need time to adapt techniques to changed circumstances, Only by taking these factors into account can we hope to accomplish our aim of a more equitable distribution of resources among the peoples of the world at a steadily increasing level of wealth.\n22.\tThe present economic difficulties of countries like mine cannot, of course, be compared to those of a number of countries of the third world, where people are often wanting the most basic amenities of life. However, being heavily dependent on foreign trade, including imports of most raw materials, Denmark is also faced with very real problems that are especially hard to solve for a small country with an even distribution of income and with a democratic political system.\n23.\tIn Denmark we are striving to adjust ourselves to the hew economic situation. *We have just made a substantial change in the economy of our public sector by reducing our income taxes by 7,000 million Danish kroner a year, which corresponds to about 25 per cent, and at the same time reducing public expenditure by about 7,000 million Danish kroner. We know that to overcome the present situation the active part of the Danish population will have to work harder and more effectively to maintain the present standard of living. We have in fact been able to make this drastic cut in public expenses without changing the Danish development policy or the amount to be allocated to development assistance. We will continue, to the best of our ability, to maintain the high level of our contributions to multilateral development organs. We recognize that long term assistance provided by industrial countries is the type of aid with which developing countries can best improve their economies and raise the standard of living of their people. It is our sincere hope that these efforts will not be undermined by policies leading to a contraction of economic activities in other industrial countries. Finally, the need for assistance in emergencies must certainty be recognized. As a member of the European Economic Community, Denmark will participate in the planned contribution by the Community to the developing countries most seriously affected by the economic crisis.\n24.\tBy organizing a series of worldwide conferences on economic and social problems, the United Nations has provided a framework for shaping new policies in international development cooperation. These conferences present unique opportunities which we must utilize. We must endeavor to understand the problems facing other Governments and the limitations set for their freedom of action. We must recognize that only widely accepted recommendations can lead to workable and lasting solutions.\n25.\tThe scope of these problems has also presented the European Economic Community with great challenges. It is the justified hope of the Danish Government that the nine members of the Community will be able to live up to these challenges so that the European buildup may gather renewed momentum for the benefit of the member States of the European communities as well as for all other nations of the world. My country attaches particular importance to the responsibility and open-mindedness of the European communities towards the outside world. We for our part expect that other economic groupings of the world will show understanding of the importance and necessity of growing economic cooperation in Europe.\n26.\tDenmark together with the other member States of the European communities has wholeheartedly supported the establishment of a European Arab dialog. This dialog, which is directed neither against any other State nor against any other geographical area in the world and which in aim and content differs from the efforts made to solve the current Middle East conflict, is a natural continuation of a tradition based upon geographical, historical, cultural and economic realities. The dialog is an innovation a form of region to region cooperation based on the presumption that close neighbors have a concern for one another.\n27.\tIn Portugal, the firm resolve of the new Government to bring an end to 500 years of colonial rule in Africa has so far resulted in the admission of the Republic of GuineaBissau to membership in the United Nations, in the formation of a Government with African representation in Mozambique, which will soon attain independence, and also in the opening of negotiations for the future existence of Angola in freedom and independence. To a representative of a European country, which, throughout the lifetime of the United Nations, has made persistent and active efforts to speed up such developments, it is extremely gratifying to note that this mission of the United Nations is about to accomplish its ultimate goal. It is our hope that in the final phase of this process all sides will show the understanding necessary to ensure that the process can be terminated in peace and cooperation.\n28.\tWe have witnessed encouraging trends in international developments, but there are still areas in which human tragedies occur and political tensions prevail. I should like, in particular, to underline that, in order to secure for individuals respect for fundamental human rights, we consider torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment to be impermissible, wherever in the world it occurs.\n29.\tIn southern Africa, the policies of apartheid of the Government of South Africa and the attitude cf the minority regime of Southern Rhodesia are frightening examples of developments that are incompatible with universally accepted trends. My Government is prepared, now as before, to contribute, within the framework of the Charter, to such effective measures as can be adopted to reverse the trend in these areas.\n30.\tAlthough the situation in the Middle East remains very serious and fraught with danger there are still, in our opinion, prospects of progress towards an overall solution of the Middle East conflict. It is essential to keep up the momentum in the international efforts which are being made to provide a just and durable peace on the basis of the troop separation agreements, with due regard for all legitimate interests, including the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.\n31.\tIn the last few months, we have witnessed a tragic conflict in Cyprus. We have the greatest sympathy for the Cypriot people, and we deplore the painful humanitarian problems which the crisis has created. The Danish Government, having contributed to the peacekeeping as well as to the humanitarian efforts in Cyprus, hopes that all parties will abide by the resolutions of the Security Council and observe the ceasefire, respect the United Nations flag and facilitate in every way the work of the United\nNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus in discharging the important tasks imposed upon the Force. We are convinced that a just and durable solution to the problems of Cyprus can be achieved only through negotiations in complete conformity with the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations.\n32.\tThe major Powers, evidently, have a special responsibility for ensuring more stable developments in these troubled areas developments opening possibilities for solutions equitable to both parties. Against this background it is most essential that developments in EastWest relations should be marked by continuity in the policy of detente a continuity which may hold out hopes for the viability of this policy.\n33.\tThe efforts to bring nuclear weapons under control and to expand cooperation in various fields between the United States and the Soviet Union have been continuing, and in our part of the world important questions stemming from the wish to develop mutual trust and cooperation and to reduce the level of military forces have been the subject of significant multilateral talks in Geneva and Vienna.\n34.\tDenmark has noted with interest the agreements in the field of disarmament that were concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union at the summit meeting in Moscow in July. We hope that these agreements will provide a basis for progress towards limitations of strategic arms and complete disarmament. Denmark hopes that the treaty concerning underground nuclear arms test explosions may be extended to cover more than explosions exceeding 150 kilotons.\n35.\tEfforts should be made in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to reach agreement on a complete test ban treaty and on a treaty prohibiting the development, manufacture and stockpiling of all chemical weapons and providing for the elimination of existing stocks of such weapons.\n36.\tMy Government considers it to be of great importance to achieve, as soon as possible, the adherence of all States Members of the United Nations to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex].\n37.\tThe efforts which Denmark has made for years to convene a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe spring from a wish to give real substance to EastWest detente in regard to the States as well as the peoples and the individuals involved. It remains our view that the' mandate of the Conference, which was drafted during the preparatory talks in Helsinki, reflects in a realistic manner questions with respect to which it should be possible at the present juncture to make progress towards a solution. We believe also that such progress would be of great significance for continued and further detente both in Europe and in a broader perspective, which would be the primary aim of the Conference.\n38.\tThe Conference has just resumed its work in Geneva, and Denmark will continue its efforts to bring about as soon as possible a solution of the outstanding issues that will fully redeem the hopes which the convening of the Conference has generated in all participating countries.\n39.\tIn conclusion, I want to say that it is well known to this Assembly that Denmark has always attached decisive importance to participation in the work of the United Nations and has always regarded the United Nations as a fundamental element in the efforts to bring about a just world order and to preserve international peace and security. The existence of a workable and universal United Nations is one of the cornerstones of Denmark's foreign policy.\n40.\tAs a Nordic country we have, together with other Nordic countries, enjoyed a high standard of living and we have, jointly and to the best of our abilities, tried to help to promote development of the least favored nations. The intention of my further remarks is to emphasize that a country which does not produce raw materials and energy is also interested in continuing economic development and in contributing to progress and development in ether parts of the world. It calls for understanding in other countries.\n41.\tAs a member of the European communities, we want to be able to participate in the progressive development of European cooperation so as to make Europe a cornerstone of world peace and an important economic factor in the efforts to promote development and raise the standard of living in other countries. That work too has met with difficulties in the present economic situation; that work too demands that other countries understand and accept what we are doing in Europe.\n42.\tIn the long term, the solution must be found in the 'evolving of new technology and in cooperation on an equal footing with the countries possessing natural resources. The task now before us is to ensure, by mutual understanding and cooperation, that the changes take a smooth course, leaving reasonable room and possibilities for countries with widely differing structures.\n43.\tThis Organization should be judged by its ability to reconcile conflicting views, to bend our wills towards one another, and to adapt its activities to the ever changing problems.\n"

        "file_text": "Recent developments in the international situation have aroused hopes. The agreements concerning peace and co-operation reached in areas of tension in the world; the dialog to bring about greater equality and justice in trade and co-operation between rich and developing countries initiated at the sixth special session on raw materials and development; the victory of progressive forces in certain parts of the world as on 25 April in Portugal, when the Portuguese people triumphed over fascism; and the troop disengagement agreements in Sinai and the Golan Heights aimed at achieving a peaceful settlement of the Middle East crisis, are all events which mark an important stage in the liberation struggle of the peoples.\n93.\tHowever, while we are gratified at these developments we must recognize that there are still many hot-beds of tension.\n94.\tIn the Middle East the disengagement agreements binding the parties in no way get to the root of the problem, and a great deal remains to be done to bring about a just and lasting peace in that area. Here, any peace settlement which does not take into account the fate of the Palestinian people and the restoration of their rights will not encompass the basic elements of the fundamental problem of the area.\n95.\tWhen weSnention Palestine we are hardly thinking of the notoriety which the vicissitudes of history have conferred on the place. Our hearts, our attachment, our respect and our unconditional support go straight to this nation of martyrs, victim of oppression and deprivation, a people whose right to life would be denied.\n96.\tIn the Mediterranean, it is Cyprus which has been the scene of a bloody confrontation. As we have said here and elsewhere, the internal affairs of every country must be managed by its people without any foreign intervention. This principle must prevail in any solution to the tragedy of Cyprus.\n97.\tSouth-East Asia still remains a source of concern to the international community. The elementary and inalienable rights of the peoples are being made the subject of deals and bargaining and the chances of peace there continue to be jeopardized.\n98.\tThe obstinate resistance of the regimes of Phnom Penh and Saigon to the liberation forces regrettably removes any grounds for optimism. The greatest good which could be done by those who support Lon Nol in Cambodia would be to stop all aid to his regime which has amply demonstrated its unpopularity, and to recognize as the only legitimate Government, that of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.\n99.\tIn Viet Nam, the situation remains critical and requires an urgent solution before it is too late. The hopes aroused by the Paris agreements are vanishing with every passing day in the face of the flagrant and repeated violations of clause of those agreements by the Saigon regime, which is still being supported and strengthened against the liberation forces.\n100.\tIn the Korean peninsula, as has been stated and continued by the Korean people themselves, re-unification should be brought about with independence without recourse to force or outside intervention. Hence, the United Nations should recall and withdraw all troops stationed under its flag in South Korea. The continued maintenance of these troops is contrary to the rights and aspirations of the Korean people and makes no contribution to bringing this people closer to national unity and reconciliation.\n101.\tThese are situations -just to mention a few- fraught with consequences that have a dangerous effect on the prospects for peace. Peace can last only if it is founded on the solid foundation of justice, because without justice the world may well be compared to a house built on sand which collapses when the slightest crack appears.\n102.\tMr. President, at this stage of the discussion, permit me to associate myself with previous speakers in conveying to you our warm congratulations on your election and expressing to you our great pleasure at seeing you in this important post at this session. Your ability, your vast experience, your great knowledge of the questions which are of concern today to our Organization, confirm us in our faith that, under your Presidency, this session will be crowned with success.\n103.\tI could not fail to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the President of the twenty- eighth session, Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador, who discharged his functions with such authority, skill and devotion and with such a high sense of responsibility.\n104.\tMay we also take this opportunity to repeat our great appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr, Kurt Waldheim, for the many efforts he has made in such a short time to advance the cause of understanding among peoples and peace and justice throughout the world. He may be assured of our full co-operation and support.\n105.\tIt is quite natural for us to rejoice at the admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh and Grenada to the family of the United Nations. The achievement of their independence and their admission to the United Nations represent another victory for the ideals of our Organization. It is also a reaffirmation of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. We are counting on close co-operation and collaboration with the delegations of both countries.\n106.\tMy delegation cannot express with sufficient force or the right words the deep satisfaction we feel at the admission of the sister Republic of Guinea- Bissau to the United Nations; for that event represents the culmination of the constant ardent appeals of my people and Government made over the course of many years, in many forums, ranging from the General Assembly to meetings and deliberations of other international organizations, conferences and seminars.\n107.\tThese feelings are inspired by the common destiny and active solidarity binding the peoples of Africa, not to mention the unreserved adherence of the Democratic Party of Guinea to their cause and its sincere and unconditional support for the right of peoples to self-determination.\n108.\tNor can I conceal my deep emotion in recalling our sheer jubilation at the recognition of the victory of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC], a universal recognition of inde-pendence which, far from being a mere act of kindness, is rather an acquiescence in the conquest by the valiant people of Guinea-Bissau of its right to join the community of sovereign nations which is our Organization. We wish also to extend our gratitude to all those who, throughout the struggle, were unstinting in their support and encouragement.\n109.\tThe independence of Guinea-Bissau has been a dramatic achievement, the background to which was a veritable tapestry of tribulation and suffering, sacrifice and bloodshed, which only unswerving devotion to the cause of liberty and a rare tenacity and courage can really account for. Among those martyrs to the sacred cause, those fighters, living or dead, there stands out as an undying memory and source of inspiration an eminent figure in the world struggle for the emancipation of peoples, one who has been seen and heard at all international meetings devoted to the problems of Africa and its oppressed: an incomparable military leader, a statesman of rare nobility and a tireless pilgrim for peace, Amilcar Cabral, whose memory we devoutly honor.\n110.\tThe United Nations must now do for others what it has done for Guinea-Bissau, and what it is in duty-bound to continue to do. To achieve universality, the Organization's task, objective and obligation is to wage a continuous struggle to see to it that the interests of States and peoples be given the highest priority on the agenda of all proceedings that require decision making.\n111.\tThe developments in Portugal confirm, beyond the shadow of a doubt and in themselves, the justness of the struggle and of wars of national liberation, and of the continuation of unrelenting pressure, which are sources of decency and constructive realism capable of surviving the longest nights.\n112.\tThe process begun by the liberation movements has opened a new chapter in Portugal's history and has ushered in a new era -an era of dynamism that instills in the people and progressive forces of that country, the natural allies of the African peoples, a sense of history and a taste for restored liberty and reconquered human dignity, and the need to preserve democracy. Amilcar Cabral was right in saying that it was through the liberation struggle that the African Territories under Portuguese domination, in liberating themselves, would be freeing Portugal from fascism.\n113.\tExperience has taught us that the liberation movements are more than ready to assume their responsibilities, particularly at a time when confidence and good faith are essential for an effort to put an end to centuries of colonization which have left behind them nothing but a dismal record of acts of genocide and sinister, cold-blooded crimes.\n114.\tWhile it is true that the Portuguese people and armed forces movement as a whole, have unreservedly rejected fascism, it is still more true that, in organizing their resistance and in taking up arms, the peoples of the Territories under Portuguese domination have unequivocally given notice to Portugal and the world of their unshakable will to put an end to servitude.\n115.\tTo preserve the intent of the agreements reached between the Frente de Libertaao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] and Portugal agreements whereby the Portuguese Government solemnly undertakes to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of Mozambique in order finally to lead it to independence on 25 June 1975, it is important that the guarantor Power and the international community constantly bear in mind that the advocates of colonization who were behind the terrorism which we deplored in Lourenzo Marques and in the other large urban centers of the country would not hesitate, given the opportunity, to bring about what was inflicted on Africa in 1960 and 1962 in two of its countries, during and after the liberation struggle. Indeed, the protection and complicity enjoyed by the die-hards in well-known influential circles in Salisbury and Pretoria can hardly reassure us.\n116.\tFor Mozambique, Angola, the Cape Verde Islands, Sao Tome and Principe, there is only one thing that matters: total and immediate independence. As it was so well put by President Ahmed Sekou Toure, \\\"Liberty is non-negotiable: it is a right\\\". Indeed, independence will not be given to those peoples: they will win it by themselves.\n117.\tWhile it is undeniably true that the action of the young officers fully. Satisfied the legitimate aspirations of the people to rid themselves of fascism, the Portuguese right wing, through subtle maneuvers, is trying to compromise, as least partially, the victory of the Portuguese people, which is a consequence of the other victories of the peoples of Africa. In this situation, we know that the Portuguese people are organizing themselves into political parties and that they are now working towards the building of a genuine democracy.\n118.\tWe reaffirm that the present successful stage of the anti-colonial struggle -and we want this to be so, determined as we are to contribute to it by all means at our disposal, as we have always done - marks what, without overstating the case, can be called the beginning of the end. We have considered it an offensive, a single movement on a single front, where any success or break-through in one sector leads to successes and victories in others. Peace and liberty cannot stand in isolation. That is why we must not permit the creation of a situation in which there is progress in one area but stagnation elsewhere. It is consequently important that after the radical change that has occurred in what were the Portuguese colonies, our collective efforts should be concentrated with ever more conviction and political will on Zimbabwe,\nNamibia and apartheid in South Africa, where inter-national imperialism, realizing every day more and more the magnitude of the natural resources and potential of those Territories, is fostering a more widespread policy of genocide which would reduce what remains of the African peoples to the status of mere third-class citizens deprived of all rights.\n119.\tAfrica would not be surprised if tomorrow, in accordance with the poles of interest as we can discern them on the current geo-political map of the exploitation of southern Africa, the systematic Balkanization of this region were undertaken at the very moment when Mozambique and Angola are to achieve independence.\n120.\tWe are only too sensitive to what happens in this strategic region, where the scope of the international economic interests at stake has direct repercussions on the military involvement of certain great Powers in the Indian Ocean, and continuously conjures up the specter before us of a possible partition of the emergent States, a partition that could be used for a control so ominous for the balance in Africa, particularly that area of Africa where structures are already very fragile. It is no accident that whichever way you turn you find the same forces supported by the same metropolitan countries attempting to perpetuate their grip on these sensitive regions\n121.\tIs it not revealing that just a few months after the coming to power of the Portuguese military junta we are witnessing new imperialist maneuvers the sole purpose of which is to mortgage the inalienable rights of the peoples of the so-called Portuguese territories to liberty? The formation of a so-called liberation front of the enclave of Cabinda, a movement not recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU], is surely a constituent part of a new strategy of imperialism which would lead to the balkanization of Angola and which recalls to us the sad realities of the recent past: the tragedies of Katanga and Biafra.\n122.\tThat is the meaning of a, situation that we have ceaselessly denounced, namely, that imperialism will never cheerfully agree to its own defeat in the so- called Portuguese territories, and that it will attempt the impossible to keep itself in power through its agents.\n123.\tSolidly behind the struggle of the heroic people of Angola, so honorably led by the Movimento Popular de Libertao de Angola [MPLA ] in \\\" e spirit of African liberty and dignity, the Government of the Republic of Guinea condemns such machinations and holds the Fascist element of the Portuguese military junta and its imperialist allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] alone responsible for this situation.\n124.\tWe would clarify our position on the colonial question and say that we are in favor of Africa having a greater capacity to protect itself and to meet the various dangers which continue to beset it as if it were only a field of experimentation.\n125.\tTo come back to the responsibility of the United Nations, it is regrettable that a name such as that of Namibia, where the situation is getting gradually worse, is considered to reflect the failure of our Organization rather than the perverse blindness of an imperialist structure, persecuting, exploiting and murdering so many of our people on the soil of their ancestors. The case of Namibia, where the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Namibia is to expire without the slightest improvement in the status quo, is sufficient to indicate the urgency and firmness with which the United Nations must act if this Organization wishes- to preserve its authority, its mandate and its purpose.\n126.\tFor us, mention of the situation along the Mozambique Canal and the southern third of Africa involves mention of the situation that we are witnessing along the shores of the Indian Ocean, where the people of the Comoros, in unity and territorial integrity, wish to take charge fully of their own destiny without any insidious subjugation. |4 this regard, and recalling the declaration of 26 August last of the Government of the administering Power of the Comoros, a declaration to the effect that the consultation of the population on the independence of the Archipelago would take due account of the natural identity of the territory, that is to say, its geographical frontiers, excluding a plurality of statuses for the different islands, my delegation considers that in order to give logical effect to such a view, it is essential to permit the return of all Comorian citizens residing outside their country.\n127.\tWithin the same context, we hope that the process of decolonization begun in the Comoros will be extended to what is known as French Somalia, as well as to the other colonial territories in Africa and elsewhere.\n128.\tThe so-called Spanish Sahara remains a problem and a matter of concern to African countries, and to all peoples who love peace and justice. That is why my delegation takes sincere pleasure in the spirit of lofty understanding which our brothers in Morocco and Mauritania have displayed in their statements on this problem.\n129.\tAfrica can count on the habitual wisdom and the competence of the International Court of Justice in reaching a just solution of this problem. However, the Republic of Guinea, faithful to the ideal of justice which inspires all peoples, faithful above all to its so often repeated determination to tolerate no foreign occupation of any fragment of our continent, will continue to work by the side of all peace-loving peoples and demonstrate vigorously to the Spanish Government that it is time, high time, to return to the so- called Spanish Sahara its long-denied liberty. We are sure that by so doing the Spanish Government will win a worthy place of history, and will thus guarantee the future of its interests in that territory, restored to its proper owners, who will freely make their own decisions.\n130.\tWe also wish to recall that we share the concerns of all those countries that have coasts on the Indian Ocean, which has been declared a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)], and which should be one. In this regard, in accordance with resolution 3080 (XXVIII), whereby the General Assembly calls upon the great Powers to halt the escalation and expansion of their military presence in the Indian Ocean, to eliminate from this region all bases and military installations, and to co-operate to this end with the Ad Hoc Committee set up by resolution 2992 (XXVII), my delegation firmly supports the appeal addressed by the coastal States of the Indian Ocean to the United States and the United Kingdom to give up their project to enlarge the naval air base on the island of Diego Garcia, the dismantling of which should and indeed must be contemplated in the interest of the peace and security of the peoples of that region.\n131.\tWithin the same context, and to a large extent, all the great Powers, taken individually or collectively, must put an end to their search for zones of influence, which today has led to the proliferation of military bases throughout the world. This state of affairs, far from solving the problems posed by the competition, not to say the rivalry, which persists among the great Powers, is a dangerous threat to international peace and security , the strengthening of which is more than ever necessary given the current concerns of the peoples of the third world, who need to wage their battle for economic and social progress in peace and harmony.\n132.\tThe events which have occurred in Africa, more particularly in the Territories administered by Portugal, show that the independence of colonial peoples is an inexorable process. Respect for this process is a sure guarantee of the improvement of international relations in the sense that it makes possible the evolution and development of the universal community in the most rational and peaceful way. For history is not made up of intentions or promises, but rather of specific facts which mold the processes of history and determine its successive phases of development towards the accomplishment of the destiny of each striving nation.\n133.\tIf we are able to remember, it is because we are able to hope. And it is thus that we remain open to all currents of thought which, through effort and action, subscribe effectively and democratically to the principle of dignity. That is why, believing that detente is not something which merely happens to suit private interests, we believe it will strengthen human understanding in the service of the full realization of man's destiny.\n134.\tWe want peace and development for ourselves and others; we hope for happiness, as does everyone. The third world, too, wishes this the third world which has hardly had time to stanch the wounds of the last war but is drawn away from that task by the sounds of new wars.\n135.\tLearning the lessons of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held recently at Caracas, particularly on the problem of the regime to govern the sea-bed, it is interesting to recall that today more than in the past national sovereignty of States seems to embrace an ever wider field. It is well known that positive international law sanctions this and that the sovereignty of a State applies to the national territory and the air space above it, all delimited by de facto or de jure frontiers of the State in question. The juridical protection and determination of this status is of extreme political and strategic importance for the international community. To delimit the zone of territorial waters over which there shall be full and unobstructed exercise of State sovereignty has become one of the most imperative concerns of States and of the international community.\n136.\tThe Republic of Guinea, for its part, in 1964, delimited its territorial zone, which it considers to be a zone having a direct bearing on its security and the development of its economy. In this very territorial zone it has been carrying on important prospecting work, both on fishing resources and on mineral and energy resources, which has led most happily for the future of our people to discoveries of immense economic potential, whose exploitation is reflected in the priorities in our five-year economic and social development plan. Now, it is at the very time when we are linking and will continue legitimately to link these discoveries with our prospects for rapid economic growth that we see the organization and intensification of an all-out movement by certain Powers designed to reduce the ocean space of States.\n137.\tIn any case, the Republic of Guinea reaffirms that it will not reduce, under any pressure or for any reason whatsoever, its minimum limit of 130 nautical miles of territorial sea -confused here with the economic zone. Conscious of the need for international communications and trade, Guinea will, however, grant freedom of navigation to nations, individuals and corporate entities which ask for it, just as it will facilitate the laying of submarine cables and pipelines. We recall that our country has never impeded freedom of navigation, which certain maritime Powers have abused by bringing into our territorial waters a number of pirate trawlers to engage in the systematic pillaging of our fishing resources and thus threaten criminally to deplete our fishing zones. But, if we do not have the right to mortgage the future of our people by permitting this exploitation under any condition, we are very much aware of the economic interdependence of all nations and the fact that our fate is indissolubly linked with that of mankind.\n138.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly on primary commodities and development was a decisive turning-point in the history of our Organization. We heard representatives of developing nations which, in spite of their persevering efforts to ensure the rapid economic development of their countries, are thwarted in their determination by the persistent inequality which prevails in international economic relations. The international economic order will continue to be detrimental to developing countries and is being marked by an aggravation of the existing inequality in the rates of economic growth in developed countries as compared with the developing countries. Attempts to counter this disastrous trend have really not produced any satisfactory results.\n139.\tThe main difficulty lies in the selfishness of the most highly developed countries which are unwilling to give up their privileges and refuse to change a system which promotes their own prosperity at the expense of the countries that produce primary commodities. The disappointing results of the first United Nations Development Decade are familiar to everyone. The Second Decade does not seem to be giving any further grounds for hope. The disruption resulting from this disparity in the distribution of wealth may have even more sinister effects on the whole of the international equilibrium, and the crises that have already occurred in the energy field attest to the depth of the malaise which is a feature of the present international situation.\n140.\tThe monetary crisis that we are now witnessing has had a most adverse effect on developing countries, while the responsibility for it lies exclusively with the industrialized countries, which alone should bear its consequences, In the circumstances, it would be an illusion to expect short of a miracle any reduction in the gap which at present exists between the industrialized and the developing countries by the mere growth of a few sectors of the economy of the latter. Faced with the depletion of the world's natural wealth and over-consumption which profits only one side, the developing nations which own vast quantities of most of the primary commodities necessary for the survival of the imperialist economies are ever more exploited and sometimes even plundered. The gap which separates them from the industrialized Powers far from narrowing, is getting wider and deeper, and they know it.\n141.\tThe situation thus created and the long experience accumulated by the developing countries in the course of their arduous struggle for independence and sovereignty have now led these peoples both to an awareness of their state as proletarian nations which are becoming ever more proletarized and at the same time to the conviction that they can change everything.\n142.\tThe international community is now undeniably approaching a new stage in its history: a radical challenge now exists to an economic order that has become outmoded. As was so correctly written by President Ahmed Sekou Toure: \\\"We must deliberately break out of the present situation. To do this, what we need it not evolution but revolution.\\\" We need this to permit the establishment of a new economic and trading order in the interest of all peoples. No matter how remote the victory may be, its inevitability mobilizes us ever further for the sake of the noble ideals of justice which it implies.\n143.\tAnother aspect of the problem of development was raised quite recently by the World Population Conference at Bucharest. Much was made of the \\\"population explosion\\\" factor as a danger which might slow down the economic and social development of third-world countries. The revolutionary people of Guinea places the human element above everything else as an expression of the existence of peoples and of the worth of the individual which is an important social component.\n144.\tThe economic imbalance that has been mentioned and the inadequacy of resources in face of the immense needs of peoples are problems deriving from the failure of the systems of distribution of wealth available to mankind to adapt to the real requirements of harmonious democratic progress. As a result, from the strictly demographic point of view, the developing countries must have a predominantly young population. Such a structure will make it possible effectively to place demography at the service of development. Hence, in our view, it follows that the question is far from being solely a demographic problem but, rather, the result of a whole complex of problems of development and planning and the utilization of human resources. It is there that the remedy is to be applied.\n145.\tIn the final analysis, concrete action and a historically just solution for the countries with under-developed productive power can only mean an all-out struggle to reduce the death rate to a minimum and to intensify education and professional training, all based upon planning, which alone can reflect the scientific organization of labor.\n146.\tThe Guinean Revolution has chosen to make the economy its revolutionary policy and not the politics of its economy. That is why economic problems must be studied in relation to the real needs of the peoples. But imperialism and capitalism always make use of the economy, not to liberate peoples, but to exploit them. To that policy the Republic of Guinea will never stop saying \\\"No\\\".\n147.\tIn conclusion, my delegation would like to state once again the need to overhaul the Charter of the United Nations. That need is all the more urgent because our Organization, which had 52 Members when it was created, now has 138, of which three fourths are from the third world. The United Nations, conceived as an instrument to serve mankind, must take account of the economic, political and social development of mankind and must not remain a frozen, rigid institution in a world in perpetual flux. That is why the Republic of Guinea will continue to condemn the well-known veto right, whose continued existence amply demonstrates the lack of democracy that unfortunately still marks our Organization, which is supposed to be democratic and just.\n148.\tThe delegation of Guinea, faithful to its fundamental political views, to its ideals of true freedom, peace, justice and democratic and social progress, will make its full and whole-hearted contribution to the work of this session.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, I should like to congratulate you upon your election to the important post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I should like to wish you success in the fulfillment of this important task. The unanimity with which you were elected once again demonstrates the respect which is enjoyed internationally by your country, the Algerian People's Democratic Republic.\n120.\tNo session of the General Assembly is the same as the previous one, nor is the world situation against the background of which they convene the same. This is particularly noticeable against the swiftly changing background of events in recent years. What does remain unchanged, however, is the criterion that the United Nations and each of its Members must be guided by at all times and in all things -namely, concern for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is against this fundamental criterion that the activities of the United Nations and the practical actions of States in the international arena should be measured.\n121.\tWith regard to the Soviet Union, we throw onto the scales of peace the entire influence of our State, the whole authority of our policy. This has always been the case and it will continue to be. Those who are earnestly seeking for ways to establish and consolidate peaceful relations and to settle disputed problems around the negotiating table can definitely count on the reliable co-operation of the Soviet Union.\n122.\tFor more than half a century our country has consistently pursued a policy of peace, a policy of rebuffing aggression and safeguarding the rights of peoples, as that policy was formulated by Vladimir ilyich Lenin. In present-day conditions too the struggle for peace means for us not just an abstract category but a matter of concrete efforts to give practical effect to the foreign policy guidelines laid down by the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It is the expression of the Soviet people's will for peace and uncompromising determination to make it stronger.\n123.\tImplementation of the Congress's decisions the program of Peace and Co-operation has already yielded tangible results in the improvement of the international situation. This is clear to any impartial observer. It is equally clear that the current positive changes are to everyone's benefit. Indeed, if there is an area where the fundamental interests of all nations, without exception, do converge, that is the maintenance of peace.\n124.\tThe Soviet Union pursues its policies in close co-ordination with its allies and friends. The socialist community of States unites its participants in a common creative effort the building of an advanced society which by its very nature rejects war. It is no accident that many major peace initiatives have been sponsored by the socialist countries. The session of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty last April reaffirmed their joint determination to fight for the triumph of the ideals of peace and the economic and social progress of the peoples.\n125.\tThe general state of world affairs is being molded by a tremendous number of factors, ranging from political and military to national or even psychological factors. And it therefore hardly lends itself to one-dimensional assessment. But the main trend of international development arouses no doubts: it is detente and the desire for detente which are today the predominant features.\n126.\tFor the first time, international detente has gone beyond good wishes and verbal assurances. It is a term that has now found a place for itself in the political vocabulary precisely because it is backed by some very real content the positive changes in reality itself. From the vantage point of recent years one can distinctly see how much has been done in this respect.\n127.\tThrough joint efforts by many States it has become possible to reduce the risk of armed conflict between the two social systems. But of special significance are the well-known agreements of 1972-1974 between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. This applies above all to the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War. The two major Powers undertook to make efforts to preclude entirely the risk of military conflict, including that involving nuclear weapons, between the Soviet Union and the United States, or between either of the parties and other States. At the same time, they agreed to refrain from the use of force against each other and against other countries in circumstances which may endanger international peace and security.\n128.\tNot long ago there was bitter fighting in IndoChina, in the Middle East, and in South Asia. And these were not the only areas where events took a dangerous turn. Now several international conflicts have, to a certain extent, been channeled in the direction of political settlement.\n129.\tIt is well known that on more than one occasion tensions in Europe have risen to an alarming level. There were no military clashes, but if the total damage inflicted by the \\\"cold war\\\" and its tensions is estimated, it will prove enormous from all standpoints. Nowadays the political development of the European continent is ever more steadily taking a different course. Not only have acute problems of the territorial and political arrangements arising out of the Second World War been solved there, but also prospects for a safer, peaceful future for Europe have been opened up.\n130.\tAlongside this there is another major asset of detente\u2014 the development of bilateral relations between States with different social systems. In the past too there were periods when it was impossible to organize business-like co-operation between them. But the experience of decades has shown us that that was rather the exception than the rule. Now peaceful co-existence is increasingly becoming the law of contemporary life. And the very nature of these relations is changing in many ways as they become steeped in the spirit of peaceful co-operation.\n131.\tFinally, it was precisely detente that put on the agenda the question of restructuring economic relations in the world. The point of this was to eliminate inequality and discrimination, and to ensure in practice the sovereign right of States to dispose of their natural resources. The sixth special session of the General Assembly called severely to task those who for centuries have been exploiting the labor and resources of others, and indicated ways of eliminating economic oppression. The Soviet Union supports the just demands of the developing countries.\n132.\tOn the whole, it can be stated with confidence that international events are now taking a course closer to peace. However, one should also see one other thing clearly: the movement towards peace does not always follow a straight line, and difficulties along this road will not necessarily decrease with each passing year. In a certain sense the problems which have to be dealt with today are not simpler but perhaps even more complicated than those of yesterday. And there is more to it than just objective causes.\n133.\tIn the final analysis, the solution of the accumulated problems is hampered by the deliberate opposition of those forces whose interests are associated with policies contrary to the policy of detente. A closer look will reveal behind each instance of aggravation whether caused by encroachments on the freedom and independence of nations, by the stepping-up of the arms race, or by attempts to test the durability of existing international treaties the overt or covert activities of those forces. And when at times you hear people say that detente is a purely temporary phenomenon or allege that it has exhausted itself, you can recognize without fail from what quarter these statements come.\n134.\tThe Soviet Union counters them with its own motto, which is not to slacken efforts to ensure that the healthy processes which have now been embarked upon should become irreversible and consolidated. As the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Leonid I. Brezhnev, stressed recently, \\\"If you want peace, pursue a policy of peace and struggle for that policy\\\". We are convinced that in our time the complete elimination of the threat of war is feasible albeit not close at hand provided active and persistent efforts are made to that end.\n135.\tThe fact that the world is still far from what the peoples would like it to be is demonstrated by the tragedy which has afflicted the Republic of Cyprus. Some may have the impression that this is an event of local significance. The Soviet Union takes a different view.\n136.\tBefore the eyes of the world the force of arms is being used ruthlessly to trample on the independence and territorial integrity of a sovereign Member State of the United Nations, a participant in the non-aligned movement. The fact that this is a small country presents developments in a special light. Another hotbed of tension has appeared in the eastern Mediterranean, and unless urgent measures are taken no one can guarantee that the situation will not deteriorate even further.\n137.\tFrom the very beginning the Soviet Union came out in defense of the inalienable rights of the State of Cyprus. It has been resolutely calling for an end to outside interference in the affairs of Cyprus, for the withdrawal of foreign troops from its soil, for the restoration of constitutional order, and for the Cypriots to be given a chance to decide their destiny for themselves. That is the only way radically to remove the tension. The demand that , the Charter of the United Nations be observed should not be an empty phrase as those responsible for events in Cyprus would like to see it. It must be complied with in the case of the Cyprus tragedy too.\n138.\tThe Cyprus problem must be brought out of the impasse resulting from attempts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] to solve it in camera, in political darkness, and in the narrow interests of militarist circles. This purpose that is, a just solution to the Cyprus problem is promoted by the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an international conference on Cyprus within the framework of the United Nations.7 The decisions of such a conference, adopted with the direct participation of representatives of the Republic of Cyprus and aimed at ensuring the country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, could be effectively guaranteed by the States permanent members of the Security Council, for, under the Charter of the United Nations, it is precisely they who are entrusted with special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.\n139.\tIndoChina is situated on the other side of the planet, and the situation there is different. But the underlying reasons why the guns are still firing and blood is still flowing in some parts of the region are the same as in Cyprus. It is all due to the stubborn reluctance of foreign-backed reactionary forces to respect the legitimate rights of the peoples.\n140.\tTo bring to a conclusion the political settlement in Viet Nam it is necessary, in the first place, to make the Saigon regime give up its military provocations and attempts to undermine the Paris agreements on Viet Nam. Strict observance of these agreements by all parties is an indispensable condition for the normalization of the situation. As for Cambodia, its problems must be solved by the Cambodians themselves, in accordance with their national interests and without any outside interference. The positive results of agreements reached in Laos should also be consolidated.\n141.\tThe comprehensive assistance and support given by the Soviet Union and other States of the Socialist community to the Vietnamese people have helped them to achieve victory in the long and heroic struggle against aggression. The Soviet Union will continue to support the Vietnamese people in peacetime too. The aspirations of the patriotic forces of IndoChina to freedom and independence will always be met with our understanding and solidarity.\n142.\tFor almost 30 years now the Middle East has been in a state of fever. Over this period wars have broken out there time and time again. In fact, the last one was only a year ago. This should be enough to convince anyone that the Middle East problem must be solved and solved justly, with the interests of all the peoples of the region being taken into account.\n143.\tWhat does that imply? First of all, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all\u2014I stress, from all the Arab lands seized by them in 1967 and the assurance of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine. Otherwise there can be no stable peace in the Middle East. It does not need a prophet to foresee a new flare-up of hostilities if the Middle East settlement is reduced to half-measures, no matter how-well advertised they may be.\n144.\tThere are increasing signs that Israel regards the disengagement of forces on Sinai and the Golan Heights not as the first step towards a general settlement which is what it should be but as a maneuver intended to freeze the situation. The clear unwillingness to leave the occupied Arab territories and, moreover, a desire to consolidate Israel's hold on them are quite evident. What other explanation can there be for the militarist intoxication which has again overcome Israel and for the attempts to exert military pressure on the Arab States? Unless this stops, the disengagement of troops may prove to be a mere regrouping of forces prior to a new clash.\n145.\tThe Soviet Union believes that there must be no delay in implementing measures leading to a political settlement in the Middle East, and this means prompt resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, the most appropriate forum for considering the Middle East problem in all its complex totality and for finding solutions satisfactory to the parties involved in the conflict. Naturally, this fully applies also to the Arab people of Palestine, whose representatives must take their rightful place at the conference.\t;\n146.\tWe believe that the time has surely come to address ourselves earnestly to the problem of Palestine. A wider approach is required here, which would open the way to ensuring not only in words but in deeds the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, and that is why we favoured including the question of Palestine on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly as a separate item.\n147.\tThere are some who try to represent the Soviet Union's position as one-sided and only serving the interests of the Arab States. Yes, indeed, we do support and will continue to support the legitimate demands of the Arabs. But it would be wrong to see only this particular aspect in our position. When we insist that territories acquired by force should not become a prize for aggression, the implications of our demand go well beyond the limits of the Middle East. It reflects intolerance of aggression in general. What this involves, therefore, is a major international principle and the question of consistency in policy.\n148.\tFurthermore, the Soviet Union is in favor of Israel's existence and development as an independent sovereign State. We have said so many times\nin\nand we affirm it once again. Real, not illusory, progress towards a Middle East settlement will create prerequisites for the development of relations between the Soviet Union and all the States of the Middle East, including Israel.\n149.\tThe scope of the policy of peace and detente is broad. It is important not to lose momentum in any field and, above all, wherever serious work has already begun to build more stable relations between States on the basis of the observance of the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n150.\tIn this context, the Soviet Union attaches primary importance to the successful conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This is question number one in European political life today. An objective assessment of what has already been done at the Conference prompts the conclusion that, on the whole, the results are impressive.\n151.\tHas anyone ever before succeeded in jointly elaborating practical standards of peaceful relations among States in Europe, in particular, on questions which have hitherto seemed insoluble? Until now nothing of this kind has been seen, at least on such a scale. Today, this work is proceeding successfully. Several important principles have been formulated in detail as specifically applicable to Europe. The arrival at generally acceptable decisions on them, on the basis of a reasonable balance of interests of the parties, is not a routine phenomenon. Not all the participants in the Conference rely, even in their bilateral relations, on such a solid foundation as the one which is now being laid for an all-European agreement.\n152.\tIt has also proved possible to reach agreement on a wide range of questions relating to cooperation among States in the most varied fields: from trade and economics to culture; from the protection of the environment to the extension of human contacts and exchanges of information. Experience has shown that such questions can be settled if they are viewed in direct proportion to the main problem of ensuring peace in Europe, and if the principle of non-interference in internal affairs is strictly adhered to.\n153.\tThe Soviet Union is convinced that there is an opportunity to conclude the Conference at an early date by adopting weighty decisions in the interests of security in Europe. In saying this we not only properly appreciate the collective work that has already been done; we also proceed from the premise that solutions to the still outstanding problems can be found, if all the participants display the necessary political will and realism.\n154.\tNaturally, it would not be right to expect the Conference to settle at one fell swoop all the questions accumulated over the long years of tension and mistrust. But it is equal to the task of achieving agreements. on crucial problems which can determine a stable peaceful development in Europe for the foreseeable future. It will also be easier to tackle other outstanding issues in the atmosphere of detente.\n155.\tThe Soviet Union will continue to do everything to ensure the complete success of the Conference. We trust that our Western partners will also take a constructive approach to this task. It is in the interests of the peoples of Europe, and not just of Europe alone, to work to bring nearer the day when agreements designed to legitimize peace and co-operation on the scale of an entire continent can be signed at the highest level.\n156.\tIt is also important to achieve results at the Vienna Talks on the Mutual Reduction of Forces and Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. The key to this is strict observance by all of the rule of undiminished security for each side. Agreement on the questions under discussion would in practice supplement political detente in Europe with military detente.\n157.\tThe conversion into a practical proposition of the idea of consolidating peace in Asia through the joint efforts of States should not, in our opinion, be a matter for the distant future. No doubt, the situation there remains complex. There is no small number of trouble spots, conflicts and international disputes on the continent of Asia.\n158.\tPolitical thought in Asia, too, is switching more and more to the search for ways of securing peace and stability. And surely this is demonstrated by the efforts of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to normalize relations on the Hindustan Peninsula, or by the idea of converting the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace.\n159.\tWe note with satisfaction the growing interest in the Soviet Union's initiative concerning the establishment of a collective security system in Asia. More and more States in Asia are supporting it. The Soviet-Indian Declaration signed as a result of the visit of Leonid Uyich Brezhnev to India in November 1973 contains important principles which can serve as a basis for the development of an effective system of relations between States in Asia.\n160.\tThe establishment of peace and co-operation in Asia meets the fundamental interests of all the Asian people. The achievement of this goal is a matter which concerns every country of that continent.\n161.\tThe agenda of this session includes an item which has a direct bearing on the improvement of the situation in Asia. This is the proposal by 34 States, including the Soviet Union, on the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations [AI9703 and Add. 1-3}. The presence of those troops, which have now been there for more than two decades, represents a source of constant military and political tension in the Korean Peninsula. Their presence is still more inappropriate under present conditions when, on the initiative of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, efforts are being made to bring about the peaceful reunification of Korea.\n162.\tIf we analyze the reasons which have so often caused acute tensions in the world, and which even now frequently lead to dangerous situations, we shall easily see that in many cases this was the result of the armaments race. It is indeed a fact that immediately after the Second World War some States embarked upon a course of building up armaments and setting up military bases on foreign territories, thus making the creation of tensions and saber- rattling their policy. It is a secret to no one that it was precisely that policy of theirs which at times brought the world to a very dangerous brink.\n163.\tHow many speeches have been made on disarmament and the cessation of the arms race in the last 25 years? Probably no other problem has absorbed the attention of statesmen and public figures to such an extent in the post-war period. And this is understandable. Stable and lasting peace is incompatible with the arms race. They are antipodes. One cannot seriously think of eliminating the threat of war while at the same time increasing military budgets and endlessly building up armaments.\n164.\tFacts must be faced. So far it has not proved possible to stop the arms race. Furthermore, today the arms race absorbs more money than ten or twenty years ago. It has been estimated that the world annually burns in the furnace of armaments over $250,000 million. This is more than the entire national income of the developing States of Asia and Africa. One can only imagine what benefits these resources could yield if they were used for peaceful purposes, for development, to combat hunger, poverty and disease.\n165.\tNo Government -at least openly- declares that it favors the arms race. Nevertheless, arms are accumulating. For three months every year appeals to end the arms race are heard at the session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. But the arms race continues. Ever more and newer papers and resolutions on disarmament are filling the archives of the United Nations. But disarmament still does not manage to overcome its inertia. Conveyor belts keep on moving inexorably, turning out new consignments of destructive weapons.\n166.\tAnd so a paradoxical situation develops. The peace movement has never had such momentum as it enjoys today, and never has the world produced such quantities of arms as it does today. On the one hand, there is the longing for peace on the part of hundreds of millions of people who realize the grim danger of the arms race, but, on the other hand, there is the increasing avalanche of armaments.\n167.\tWhat is the matter? Maybe some forces which have got out of human control are at work? Certainly not. The reason is policy. And if it is policy, well, one may ask, whose policy?\n168.\tIf it all depended on the socialist countries, the arms race would have been eliminated long ago. No one has tabled more concrete proposals on disarmament than they. Ever since the non-aligned countries moved into the forefront of international affairs they too have been actively working in favor of disarmament. Voices of reason are to be heard in other countries too, and they resound with ever greater confidence both in parliaments and in broad public circles,\n169.\tMilitary-industrial circles that profit from the arms race oppose its cessation. Those politicians who are linked with these circles have long since placed their narrow interests above the aspirations of the peoples. The influence of these circles has had a telling effect on all disarmament negotiations, including those in the General Assembly and the Security Council.\n170.\tThe arms race affects all States, even those not directly involved in it. All the peoples of the world live under one and the same roof. The risks posed by the unrestrained build-up of armaments are a danger to all. On the other hand, is there any country in the world whose economy is not affected, one way or another, by the burden of armaments? Everyone here could adduce numerous examples in confirmation of the correctness of this argument.\n171.\tFurthermore, recently economic upheavals, which have been affecting many States, have increased in intensity and increasingly affect the material situation of people. Statesmen and economists are racking their brains over the causes underlying all this. But there is one undeniable conclusion that is borne out every day and every hour: the aggravation of economic problems is largely connected with the rising scale of the arms race and with soaring military expenditures.\n172.\tBut if the disarmament problem affects everyone, then the solution to the problem should be sought jointly by all States.\n173.\tThe main thing here is not just to mark time, hiding behind arguments about the complexity of the problem. If right now it cannot be solved at one stroke, solutions should be sought for individual aspects so that this should lead at least step by step to the ultimate goal of disarmament, and in effect, such an approach has already been tried out in recent years and has justified itself.\n174.\tAs positive changes make their way in the world, so objective prerequisites for finding real agreements in the sphere of disarmament improve. It is noteworthy that the largest number of agreements of this kind have been reached in the last few years. Although they do not reverse the arms race, they do curb it in a whole series of ways.\n175.\tIn one case, this takes the form of limiting further perfection of nuclear weapons and the creation of their new destructive models. The Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963, has been serving this end well for over a decade now.\n176.\tThe same objective is served by the Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States of 3 July 1974, whereby both countries have undertaken to stop, as of 31 March 1976, underground testing of nuclear weapons with the most powerful nuclear charges and also to limit underground nuclear test explosions in general. The Soviet Union will strive to see to it that the prohibition of nuclear weapon tests eventually becomes comprehensive and universal.\n177.\tIn another case, it takes the form of a limit on the territorial spread of armaments. Such is the purport of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which has proved its effectiveness. We are in favor of making full use of the possibilities inherent in that Treaty and of increasing the number of States parties to it. The objective is to make this Treaty universal.\n178.\tA number of agreements exclude the sea-bed and the ocean floor, outer space and celestial bodies from the sphere of possible emplacement of nuclear weapons. In accordance with an international agreement bacteriological weapons have been prohibited and eliminated from military arsenals, and prospects are emerging for the outlawing of another deadly means of warfare, namely, chemical weapons.\n179.\tAnd what about the agreements on the limitation of strategic arms between the Soviet Union and the United States? I feel that there is no need to explain their unprecedented significance since they are designed to narrow the actual material basis of the nuclear-missile arms race. Quite recently these agreements have been supplemented by new important agreements. Last July, the Soviet Union and the United States decided further to limit their anti-ballistic missile systems and mapped out ways of achieving further limitation of strategic offensive arms in terms of both quality and quantity. The Soviet delegation in Geneva, where talks on these questions were resumed the other day, has firm instructions to seek their solution,\n180.\tThe supreme interests not only of the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States but also of the peoples of the whole world require that the Soviet Union and the United States, possessing the colossal might of nuclear weapons, should make every effort to achieve appropriate understandings and agreements. We should like to express our gratification at the fact that this idea was clearly stated too from the rostrum of the General Assembly by President Ford of the United States [2234th meeting].\n181.\tWhen two Powers voluntarily limit their military preparations, when they establish a ceiling above which they will not increase nuclear missile armaments, their actions, apart from anything else, must set a good example for others.\n182.\tThe Soviet Union will continue to work tirelessly to further the cause of disarmament in areas where this is possible; it will look for new fields where concrete results can be achieved through the joint efforts of States.\n183.\tThe Soviet Union took the initiative by proposing the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly, as an important and urgent question, of item 103, entitled \\\"Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well- being and health\\\" [4/9702].\n184.\tWhat is the motive for this? The achievements of scientific and technological progress have expanded the possibilities of influencing nature and the climate of the globe and, in a certain sense, of controlling the complex and powerful processes involved. Unfortunately, the latest discoveries can be used not only for creative, but also for military, purposes with extremely destructive consequences for mankind. These are not the conjectures of science fiction writers, but an actual threat that is assuming an ever more realistic shape. It is in the interests of all peoples to nip this threat in the bud.\n185.\tThe Soviet Union proposes that an international convention should be concluded which will outlaw the military use of the environment. Compliance with the provisions of such a convention, a draft of which we will submit [see AlC.JIL.675], could be secured through the adoption by each State, in accordance with its constitutional processes, of appropriate measures to prohibit activities contrary to the convention and through consultations and co-operation among States, notably within the framework of the United Nations.\n186.\tThe conclusion of such a convention would prevent the emergence of new means of warfare and, at the same time, would facilitate the solution of a problem common to all mankind the protection of the environment. We trust that all the participants in the Assembly will fully appreciate the universal significance of this important initiative and treat this proposal accordingly. The Soviet Union and the socialist countries as a whole seek to gain .nothing from this. We have made this proposal because it is in the interests of all States, all peoples and the whole world.\n187.\tIn its attitude in the United Nations, the Soviet Union proceeds on the assumption that the Organization can and must play an important part in developing and consolidating the positive processes characteristic of the present-day world situation. We have quite a number of useful resolutions to our credit aimed at strengthening international peace. Now, everything depends on their being consistently implemented.\n188.\tIn this regard, I should like to refer especially to some resolutions adopted by the United Nations over the last two or three years by a large majority of votes. In the first place, I have in mind the one on the prohibition of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]. This is an Assembly decision of fundamental importance. It must acquire binding force for all States and, in this regard, the Security Council has an important role.\n189.\tOne cannot say that the General Assembly resolution on the convening of a world disarmament conference [resolution 2833 (XXVI)] has not been followed up. An Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference [resolution 3183 (XXVIII)] has even been set up, in which, among other States, three nuclear Powers are participating. However, in fact, the question is not really being dealt with. It is time for the Committee to proceed, in close co-operation with the nuclear Powers, to prepare concrete recommendations on the practical aspects of the convocation of that conference. The boycotting of this important measure by several States is contrary to the clearly expressed desire of the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations. We regard it as a challenge to the world Organization.\n190.\tThrough no fault of the Soviet Union, there is delay in the implementation of such a commonly useful enterprise as that of the reduction of the military budgets of the States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and the utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries. This example belongs in the same category. This action would have a double effect: it would promote the limitation of the arms race and, at the same time, provide additional assistance to States that need it most. The attitudes towards this proposal act as a kind of litmus paper revealing the intentions of States regarding acute present-day problems.\n191.\tThe further development of bilateral relations between States based on the principles of peaceful coexistence is a vast and far from exhausted reserve for deepening detente. On this basis our country is prepared to establish and expand not just normal but, where possible, friendly relations with all States sharing this approach. This has been and remains one of the most important lines of the Soviet Union's foreign policy.\n192.\tIt is our desire to see the consolidation of all the positive results that have been achieved so far in our relations with leading capitalist States on the basis of fruitful efforts on both sides. We' want to move ahead and make these relations stable. In this context, the statements by the new leaders of the United States, France and the Federal Republic of Germany about their intentions to continue to move towards detente and co-operation have been met in the Soviet Union with satisfaction.\n193.\tToday economic, scientific and technological links assume an increasingly large role in relations between States with different social systems. If co-operation in these fields is built on respect for the principles of equality and non-interference, it will not only be mutually advantageous but will also promote the establishment of a material basis of sorts for durable peace and good neighborliness.\n194.\tWe value highly the good and, in some instances, close relations which have been established between the Soviet Union and many developing countries. The countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America which have embarked upon the road of national independence and the consolidation of economic independence can continue to rely firmly on our support. We were in at the source of their struggle against colonialism, and at each and every stage of it we have supported and will continue to support the developing States in word and in deed. That is our line of principle, and we shall not deviate from it.\n195.\tThe solution of such complex and urgent problems as those of energy and food, which are attracting much attention, particularly in the United Nations, should also be sought on the path of peace and co-operation, of strict observance of the principles of equality and sovereignty, and of the right of States to dispose of their natural resources.\n196.\tThe number of young States Members of the United Nations has increased at this session of the General Assembly. We should like to express our particular satisfaction at the fact that the People's Republic of Bangladesh has become a full Member of the United Nations and that thus an end has been put to an injustice with regard to that major Asian State.\n197.\tThe Soviet Union, which was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, welcomes that State's admission to the United Nations with great satisfaction. The Soviet Union also welcomes the admission to the United Nations of the newly independent State of Grenada. Soon to come is the proclamation of the national independence of Mozambique. The current attempts to frustrate the process of decolonization that has begun in that country must be most resolutely rebuffed. That of course applies equally and fully to Angola. That will, indeed, be the crowning moment of the armed phase of the struggle for national liberation of the former Portuguese colonies, and will provide even further evidence of the irresistible march of social progress.\n198.\tThe year that has passed since the Fascist coup in Chile has revealed the great depth of the tragedy that has befallen the Chilean people. But it has also demonstrated that endless terror and the suppression of elementary human rights cannot break the will of the people of Chile for a free and independent life. The bloody deeds of the junta are in glaring contradiction with the lofty human principles and purposes of the United Nations, and are a challenge to human honor and decency. It is no accident that the junta in fact remains in a state of international isolation.\n199.\tThe struggle for national independence and economic liberation and for the elimination of the vestiges of the colonial system has been scoring impressive victories in recent years. But that struggle is by no means ended. The manifestations of economic oppression and inequality and the fact that there are still dark blemishes of colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination on earth cannot be tolerated. Until they disappear, the peace-loving States and the United Nations as a whole cannot slacken their efforts to eradicate them.\n200.\tIt is always necessary to identify the most topical issues among the great variety of problems posed by the course of world developments. At any given moment, the efforts of States striving to achieve the strengthening of peace should be concentrated precisely upon them. It is the opinion of the Soviet Union that some of the high-priority tasks of today are the following:\n-to proceed in practical terms to a Cyprus settlement; stop the violence against that country and its people; secure respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of that State and, for those purposes, convene a representative international conference on Cyprus within the framework of the United Nations;\n-to resume as a matter of urgency the work of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East to solve questions concerning the establishment of a just and durable peace in that area;\n-to complete the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at an early date by adopting, at the highest level, decisions ensuring a peaceful future for Europe;\n-to achieve specific agreements in the Soviet- American Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, in the multilateral negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, and in the Committee on Disarmament;\n-to take measures to implement the decisions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly on strengthening the economic independence of developing States.\n201.\tNo one would venture to claim that the solution of all those problems, and of others to which we have drawn the attention of this Assembly, is an easy task. But their solution is necessary and feasible, and all States really interested in developing peaceful and reasonable forms of international inter-course should work towards that end. The Soviet Union will be unstinting in its efforts to promote the establishment of durable and lasting peace on earth.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am profoundly pleased and privileged to offer you the sincere congratulations of Indonesia's delegation upon your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your statesmanship and your untiring efforts and well-known accomplishments in the cause of peace and a more equitable world order are justly recognized throughout the international community. We are confident therefore that, although the problems before this Assembly are grave and many, we will, under your guidance, be able to find satisfactory answers to them. The fact that you have been called upon to serve in this post of distinction at the present moment gives my delegation added satisfaction, for we see in you not only an eminent son of Africa and of the Arab nation but also one of the outstanding leaders of the non-aligned world as well. At a time of great opportunity as well as oT great challenge, the non- aligned countries have an important role to play in the promotion of global peace, progress and prosperity. It seems to my delegation most appropriate that these forces for peace and progress are exemplified in the person of the President of the General Assembly.\n2.\tMy delegation would also like to take this opportunity to convey its deep appreciation to the outgoing President, the representative of Ecuador, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who has shown admirable qualities of leadership in a period marked by momentous events.\n3.\tIt is with great satisfaction that my delegation welcomes the new Members of the Organization. Representing a country situated so close to southern Asia, my delegation takes special pleasure in welcoming Bangladesh to membership in the United Nations. The admission of this new State manifests a further step in the efforts to heal the wounds of war and strife in the recent history of the region and, it is to be hoped, marks the beginning of an era no longer plagued by enmity and distrust but characterized by friendly relations and close co-operation.\n4.\tI would further like to welcome Grenada as a fellow Member in our midst. My delegation is convinced that Grenada's commitment to the principles of the Charter and the goals of the United Nations will enable it to play a significant role in the work of our Organization.\n5.\tOur warm welcome also goes to Guinea-Bissau upon its admission to the United Nations, as we greeted with equal joy its berth as an independent nation on 24 September 1973. The process leading to the independence of Guinea-Bissau was a long and arduous one, spanning almost twp decades of political struggle and 10 years of uninterrupted and determined armed struggle. Guinea-Bissau's entry now as a full-fledged partner in the work of the Organization for global peace and progress cannot but be greeted with deep satisfaction.\n6.\tMy delegation expects that before long we shall also have the pleasure of welcoming Mozambique and Angola as Members of the Organization.\n7.\tIn expressing our satisfaction at the admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations, we in Indonesia welcome the recent changes in Portugal's policy vis-a-vis the colonial Territories under its administration. A new page has now been opened in the history of Portugal's relations not only with those Territories but also with the continents of Africa and Asia and with all freedom-loving peoples in the world. This development indeed constitutes a beacon of hope for all those who are still fettered by the bonds of colonialism, apartheid and racism. But until all peoples who are still denied their inalienable rights to self-determination achieve their rightful place in the world community, the United Nations should not slacken its efforts to further the process of decolonization.\n8.\tThe past year has witnessed profound political, economic, social and technological developments which have themselves caused fundamental changes in relations among nations and peoples. As I have just remarked, it has been a year notable both for its great challenges and for its great opportunities.\n9.\tOn the one hand, the international community has been confronted with problems of a magnitude and complexity unprecedented in our experience; on the other hand, these very conditions have offered unique opportunities to the Organization and to the world at large. If we possess the necessary vision and courage and, above all, the required political \nwill, we may yet utilize these opportunities in order to lay the foundations of new economic and political relationships that would move the world closer towards the establishment of a more just and more durable order and towards a more equitable distribution of the world's wealth.\n10.\tThe need for change in the character of inter-national relations is now universally recognized. It is clear, however, that as to the nature and the timing of such change, as well as with regard to the modalities of achieving it, wide differences of opinion still exist within the international community.\n11.\tConcurrent with the recognition of the need for change, there is a growing awareness that the problems now confronting the world cannot be resolved by any single nation or group of nations acting on its own; they can be overcome only by the joint efforts of the entire world community which recognizes that global interdependence requires global cooperation.\n12.\tOne encouraging result of this new awareness is that the United Nations has been called upon to play an ever-expanding role as the organ of the inter-national community best suited to dealing with the problems created by our increasing interdependence. Thus it may be useful to take this occasion to scrutinize the record of the Organization over the past year and to evaluate the manner in which the United Nations has exercised its growing role in the new international situation.\n13.\tOne of the gravest challenges posed to the Organization last year was how to cope with the renewed outbreak of full-scale hostilities in the Middle East, which again jolted the world dangerously close to the brink of global conflict.\n14.\tMy delegation is satisfied that the United Nations proved itself capable of meeting that challenge. The substantial role that the United Nations played in establishing the cease-fire in the Middle East and in arranging the troop disengagement agreements in the Sinai and on the Golan Heights is generally recognized. The Organization was equally instrumental in the creation of the United Nations Emergency Force, which has enabled it to act firmly in maintaining the cease-fire. And it is a particular honor for Indonesia to be able to contribute a contingent to the Force at the request of the Security Council.\n15.\tWhile we may thus be reasonably satisfied with the role that the United Nations has played and will continue to play in the Middle East, my delegation must reiterate its view that unless the root-causes of the Arab-Israeli conflict are removed and until some fundamental requisites are met, no lasting peace can be achieved in that troubled region.\n16.\tAn integral and just solution of the Middle East problem can be achieved only if all relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions are implemented consistently. Israeli aggression must be terminated and all Arab territories occupied since 1967 must revert back to their lawful owners. The Holy City of Jerusalem must be returned to Arab custody and Israel must rescind all measures it has taken to alter the status and character of that City. Furthermore, my delegation is convinced that the Middle East will remain an arena of conflict and bloodshed as long as the Palestinian people are denied their fundamental rights, including the right to self-determination.\n17.\tIndonesia is encouraged by the prospect of peace that has been opened by the Geneva negotiations. But whatever success these negotiations may achieve in all other fields, a satisfactory solution of the Palestinian aspect of the problem will remain a condition sine qua non for the return of a stable peace in the Middle East. The participation of Palestinian representatives in all talks affecting their future is, therefore, a matter of great importance.\n18.\tIt is with these considerations in mind that Indonesia joined many other delegations in proposing that the item entitled \\\"Question of Palestine\\\" be included in the agenda of this session [AI9742 and Add. I-4}.\n19.\tHardly had the initial foundations been laid for a peaceful solution of the Middle East problem when another challenge presented itself before the Organization. In July this year the world was startled by the coup d'etat against President Makarios of Cyprus. This event, and the Turkish intervention which followed, has given the Cyprus problem a dangerous dimension.\n20.\tWhat we see in Cyprus is the tragedy of two communities compelled by realities to live together but unable to agree among themselves how to do so in peace and harmony. In their implications, how-ever, the recent developments in Cyprus go beyond the unhappy fate that has befallen its two communities, as these developments not only imperil the independence and territorial integrity of that country but also pose a serious threat to the peace and security of the Mediterranean region.\n21.\tMy delegation is deeply aware of the complexities of the problem and of its long and bitter political background. It is not easy, nor is it necessary, to try to apportion the blame to one or the other party, as the two communities must continue to live together. What is of cardinal importance now is to get all parties concerned back to the negotiating table to create conditions in which it will be possible for the people of Cyprus themselves to determine their future.\n22.\tIndonesia holds the view that Cyprus should remain an independent, sovereign and non-aligned country. A new constitutional framework should be worked out that can guarantee the rights of each community and enable them to live in harmony with one another, so that a true Cypriot national identity may develop.\n23.\tAllow me now to turn to a conflict in a region nearer to Indonesia. I refer to the ongoing war and bloodshed in IndoChina. The peoples of Asia and, for that matter, people all over the world are gravely concerned that, almost two years after the signing of the Paris agreement, peace still proves elusive in Viet Nam. This agreement could provide a basis for resolving the long and bitter conflict, which in its toll of human lives and material damage far exceeds the magnitude of either the Middle East or the Cyprus conflict. My delegation notes with regret, however, that there is as yet little evidence of the necessary goodwill of the parties directly concerned to implement the agreement, especially that part providing for a political settlement. Thus the situation is allowed to deteriorate, increasing the likelihood of full-scale war again breaking out in Viet Nam.\n24.\tIndonesia has been in a position to make a modest contribution to the efforts to implement the Paris agreement on Viet Nam through its membership in the International Commission of Control and Supervision. Indonesia will continue to serve in the Commission as long as it thinks that its participation can indeed contribute to the restoration of genuine peace in Viet Nam.\n25.\tIn the same way, the tragic situation in the Khmer Republic is a source of deep concern to Indonesia. The sacrifices in human lives and suffering which this conflict has exacted, as well as its potential to cause wider instability in the region, make us fervently hope that a peaceful solution to this problem will be achieved through negotiations among the contending factions of the Khmer people themselves. The way in which this problem is now being presented to the Assembly, therefore, cat es the greatest misgivings to my delegation.\n26.\tIt remains Indonesia's considered view that the Khmer people should be given the opportunity to resolve their own problems in peace, free from out-side intervention or imposition, and to decide for themselves the leadership they want and the system of government under which they choose to live.\n27.\tWe are against the idea cf the imposition of a government and a leadership on the Khmer people by the United Nations. We would fully support United Nations intervention in the Khmer problem, however, if indeed such intervention would lead to the ending of the fighting among the Khmers and to a peaceful overall solution.\n28.\tWe are convinced that to impose a leadership and a government on the Khmer people by United Nations resolution will not bring about a solution to the conflict, will not end the fighting and the blood-shed among the Khmers, but will, on the contrary, intensify and prolong them. Thus, it would be a tragic irony indeed if the United Nations, after so many years of non-involvement in IndoChina, now suddenly decided to intervene, not to bring peace but, in effect, to encourage and prolong conflict and bloodshed among the Khmers.\n29.\tIf the United Nations is to take action, then to my delegation's view, it would, be more in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter if the General Assembly were to appeal to the contending parties to stop the fighting and start negotiations for a peaceful solution acceptable to all the Khmer people. In this connexion, I would like to refer to the offer made on 9 July 1974 by the Government of the Khmer Republic in Phnom Penh, to start negotiations, with no preconditions and with any representative of the Khmers on the other side, in order to find a peaceful solution to their conflict and end the killing among brothers. My delegation believes that this offer should be welcomed by the Assembly as one fully in conformity with the spirit of all United Nations endeavors to seek peaceful solutions to problems through negotiation.\n30.\tAllow me now to reiterate briefly my Government's position with regard to the question of national leadership in Cambodia.\n31.\tWe have nothing against Prince Sihanouk or the so-called \\\"Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia\\\". In fact, the Indonesian people respect Prince Sihanouk for his role in the struggle of the Khmer people for independence and sovereignty. But the Khmer Parliament his own Parliament elected by the Khmer people in accordance with the Khmer Constitution, deposed him, and he is now making his claim to national leadership as an exile, from the capital of a foreign country.\n32.\tAs a matter of principle, Indonesia is against the recognition of a government-in-exile as long as there exists in the country itself a national government which is lawfully established and accepted by the people on the basis of their own constitutional processes.\n33.\tIf the Assembly were to embark upon recognition of such regimes in exile this would not only be tantamount to interfering in the domestic jurisdiction of a State but would indeed set a precedent which would endanger the very structure of the United Nations. Today this question concerns the Khmer Republic; tomorrow it may concern another country, perhaps one of those which now support the idea of recognizing a regime in exile because of feelings of solidarity with a person or a group representing certain political beliefs or because of emotional considerations. I would strongly suggest, therefore, that the choice be allowed to remain with the people and that the United Nations not be permitted to introduce the practice of imposing a government upon a people.\n34.\tRanging further afield in the Asian region, my delegation notes with regret that in the two years following the joint communique of 4 July 1972 issued by the Governments of North Korea and South Korea, the dialog between them has achieved little progress. Prospects for reconciliation have been further diminished now that this dialog has been indefinitely suspended. We believe that it would be useful for both sides to resume their interrupted dialog at an early date and exert renewed efforts to implement the principles enunciated in their joint communique.\n35.\tThis year the Assembly is again considering the question of Korea. My delegation agrees with the view that the United Nations should end its military presence in Korea. It is indeed high time that the state of war which still formally exists between the United Nations and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was terminated. However, as the United Nations military involvement in Korea is based upon a Security Council resolution, it is the view of my delegation that the Assembly should request the Security Council to take promptly the necessary action for the termination of such United Nations military presence. At the same time, my delegation thinks that an alternative machinery should be found to guarantee the continuation of the cease-fire along the armistice line, and that the United Nations should assist, in whatever way is possible, in the efforts of both parts of Korea to achieve reunification through peaceful negotiations.\n36.\tAs far as the presence of foreign troops in a country is concerned, it has always been Indonesia's conviction that such presence will not contribute to peace and security. As for ourselves, we cannot accept the presence of foreign troops or foreign military bases on our country's territory. However, every sovereign State has the right to conclude bilateral agreements with other States to allow such presence on its territory for national defense purposes, and as long as it is not directed against another State.\n37.\tIf there are focal points of crisis on the Asian scene, there is also a brighter side to the picture.\n38.\tIt is with great satisfaction that Indonesia welcomes the formation of the Provisional Government of National Union in Laos. We hope that this achievement will usher in an era of peace and stability in a country that has been a bitter battleground for more than 20 years. We also hope that these developments in Laos will equally contribute to the improvement of the political climate in the region, and serve as an example worthy of emulation by contending parties in other parts of IndoChina.\n39.\tRecent developments in South Asia have, as I remarked earlier, opened a new chapter in the political history of that region. Thanks to the statesmanship displayed by the leaders of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the door is open to a new era of greater peace, mutual co-operation and understanding.\n40.\tIt is with particular satisfaction that my delegation refers to the developments in South-East Asia, specifically with regard to the efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] to foster more effective regional co-operation. Whereas ASEAN was initially founded to promote economic, technical and cultural co-operation, it has also provided the opportunity to the member countries to deal with political aspects- of regional problems as well. We are pleased to note that these activities have led to the development of increasingly closer patterns of co-operation, which in turn have strengthened the Association as a whole, making it more viable and meaningful to its members. Last year's decision to establish a permanent ASEAN secretariat in Jakarta is another logical step forward in the Association's efforts to consolidate its gains, and to give greater coherence to ASEAN.\n41.\tAs part of this policy of devoting our efforts and resources to the economic betterment of our nation in conditions of peace and tranquility, Indonesia, together with other nations in the region, has consistently endeavored to maintain the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, free from great-Power rivalry and military escalation. To this end, Indonesia has given active support to Sri Lanka's initiatives concerning the Indian Ocean as well as to the relevant United Nations resolutions on this important issue. However, much remains to be done if this idea is to materialize.\n42.\tIt is with deep concern that my delegation views the increasing military presence of the great Powers in the region of the Indian Ocean, which poses a serious setback to the efforts of the nations of the area to keep great-Power arms rivalry out of the Indian Ocean.\n43.\tWe should like to urge the great Powers concerned not to continue on their path of arms com-petition in the Indian Ocean, as the pursuit of such a path will endanger the peace and tranquility not only of the area, but of the whole world.\n44.\tThe international community has been seized for a long period with the problem of establishing a new regime of the sea, one which will not only guarantee the sound management and equitable distribution of the ocean'.s wealth, but which will also accommodate the diverse and conflicting national interests created by existing outdated rules of the law of the sea or by the existence of legal vacuums. As an archipelagic State, Indonesia, by virtue of its geographical composition, attaches the greatest importance to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. This composition brings with it special needs and imperatives relating to the maintenance of Indonesia's national sovereignty, political unity and territorial integrity. At the same time it also entails special responsibilities relating to the interests of the international community, responsibilities 'which the Government of Indonesia has always been willing to shoulder and to discharge, now and in the future.\n45.\tIndonesia expects, on the other hand, that other States, especially those which, on the basis of previous practice, are enjoying a privileged position in the use of the seas, will adapt themselves to the changes that have taken place and are now taking place in the world. The issues involved in a reformulation of the law of the sea should be approached on the basis of sovereign equality and equity and not on those Of power relationships, either economic or military.\n46.\tWhile noteworthy and encouraging progress has been recorded in several fields in the political sphere, it is dismaying to find that this is not matched with commensurate progress in the field of economic and social development.\n47.\tThe picture here is one of gloom and pessimism. In this respect, the world is still starkly divided be-tween developing and developed countries. And it is becoming abundantly clear that, despite strenuous efforts to reverse the trend, the gap between the developing and the developed countries continues to widen with each passing year while the burden of international poverty is increasing rather than declining.\n48.\tThis is certainly not a new subject. But it will continue to be raised at every opportunity, not only to demonstrate our concern and anxiety, but also to underscore the point that such an imbalance in international economic growth cannot be conducive to a peaceful, stable and just world order.\n49.\tThe series of global crises, thoroughly exposed and analyzed during the sixth special session of the General Assembly last May, has thrust into prominence the inescapable reality of interdependence among nations, the inter-connexion of problems and the necessity of joint and concerted action to solve them.\n50.\tThe Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-Vl)], together with the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)], adopted by the special session, provide us with a broad framework for concerted action to help rectify the inequities and injustices of the present economic system.\n51.\tThe world cannot continue to be apathetic or unresponsive to the basic problems of the developing countries which are facing inadequate food supplies, rapid population growth, unemployment, sharp price increases of capital goods badly needed for development, and technological backwardness.\n52.\tAs regards the food problem, the assessment of the world food situation clearly shows that, unless effective actions are taken quickly, the food crisis will soon assume catastrophic proportions particularly affecting the developing countries. The forth-coming World Food Conference, therefore, should, in our view, agree on an effective program of action, comprising co-ordinated international efforts to secure the flow of food aid and provide for world food security and a long-term world food policy. Such a program should lead to a fundamental remedy of recurrent world food scarcity, inter alia, by increasing food production in the developing countries.\n53.\tClosely connected with the problem of food is the problem of rapid population growth in a great number of developing countries. The convening of the World Population Conference in Bucharest last August is testimony to the universal recognition that the population problems faced by many countries are problems of world-wide magnitude and concern which require concerted national and international actions to achieve their solutions.\n54.\tThe World Population Conference adopted a World Population Plan of Action as a constituent part of overall economic and social development policies. This Plan of Action has underlined the fact that whatever population policy is pursued, rapid population growth in the years to come necessitates an acceleration of economic and social development through a more just utilization of resources, capital and technology, in the spirit of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.\\\"\n55.\tThe efforts to expand and diversify markets for the commodities, semi-manufactured and manufactured products of the developing countries continue to be adversely affected by world-wide inflation and recurrent international monetary instability, at a time when there is urgent need for increased export earnings and enlarged employment opportunities. The multilateral trade negotiations which are designed to give a new impetus to ever greater liberalizatioiTof trade and the improvement of the international framework for the conduct of world trade have not even begun. The decline of official development assistance to developing countries has further affected efforts for the sustained economic and social development of these countries.\n56.\tIt is essential, therefore, that substantial progress also be made in these vital areas of trade and development assistance which are crucial to the efforts to establish a new world economic order. In this context, in the interest of both the developed and developing countries, we earnestly hope that the developed countries could display the required political will by removing whatever reservations they may still have in order to enable the speedy implementation of the Declaration and the Program of Action. Only in this way and by collective efforts on the part of both developed and developing countries can we move toward a more just, more prosperous and more secure world.\n57.\tThe draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which will be considered under agenda item 482 and which is still being negotiated at present, will certainly enhance the realization of the new economic order. It is to be hoped that these negotiations will be concluded successfully to enable the timely submission of the draft to this session of the General Assembly for consideration and adoption. The adoption of this Charter will, we believe, also facilitate the work of the proposed institutional machinery to deal with transnational corporations, whose role and activities exercise an increasingly important bearing on international relations.\n58.\tThe whole process of restructuring the present economic system will culminate in September 1975 in the seventh special session of the General Assembly, which will be devoted solely to development and international economic co-operation. All of us have a vital stake in the success of that session and all efforts should therefore be made to enable it to contribute fully to the establishment of the new international economic order.\n59.\tThe Indonesian delegation is also looking for-ward to the successful conclusion of the mid-term review of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], to be held in April 1975. The findings and conclusions of this review will be of particular importance to the smooth conduct of our deliberations in the forthcoming special session.\n60.\tThere should also be no doubt that this special session will take into account the results of the World Population Conference, the World Food Conference, the multilateral trade negotiations within the frame-work of GATT and the Second General Conference of UNIDO, all of which have an important bearing on the realization of the new international economic order.\n61.\tThe successful conclusion of the special session will undoubtedly have a positive effect on our efforts to reach agreement at the fourth session of UNCTAD on the new approaches now being initiated by the Secretary-General of UNCTAD in the important areas of commodities, financial and technical co-operation, economic co-operation among the developing countries and transfer of technology.\n62.\tWithin the current changing international situation it is worth while noting two developments which will determine in a significant wry the stability and resilience of Indonesia in particular and the region of South-East Asia in general during the second half of this- decade. I refer to Indonesia's second development plan and to the co-operation of the nations of South-East Asia within the framework of ASEAN..\n63.\tOur second five-year development plan, which started in April 1974, is a continuation and acceleration of the development efforts made during the first five-year development plan. In the second plan, increased food production, the development of agro-allied industries and infrastructure remain the central points of our development strategy. Increased efforts will be made towards accelerating growth in the production of natural resources, including mineral products. The benefits to be derived from those sectors will, we believe, contribute significantly to an increase in domestic products and to the easing of foreign-exchange constraints on development, as well as to the creation of new employment opportunities. That, in turn, will induce a better distribution of wealth and income.\n64.\tIn attaining our national development objectives, natural resources will therefore be optimally exploited consistent with the preservation of environmental conditions and the protection of the interests of future generations. The involvement of the people in the development process and in social welfare development will also become focal points of our second development plan.\n65.\tAH those activities will need huge funds, far greater than before, in order to increase the momentum of development and to enable us to improve the standard of living of the people. It is the policy of the Indonesian Government, therefore, to direct all efforts to the maximum extent possible towards mobilizing its financial resources for development, including its domestic resources, and at the same time towards increasing export earnings.\n66.\tThe magnitude of Indonesia's development efforts is exemplified by the fact that Indonesia's per capita income still falls in the lowest income brackets on the international scale, due to the size of our population and its high growth rate. That fact has necessitated substantial food imports, which continue to exert a considerable drain on our foreign- exchange reserves. By way of illustration, despite steady increases in our food production, our annual imports of rice and fertilizers remain on the order of $US 1,500 million. The recent favorable development in Indonesia's balance-of-payments position should therefore be viewed in the perspective of our huge import requirements to fulfill the basic necessities of the people and of our increased development activities, which far exceed Indonesia's present financial capabilities. Consequently, external development assistance will be required for a further period to complement our domestic financial re-sources.\n67.\tFor those reasons, the Government of Indonesia regretfully finds itself unable at this stage to contribute to the proposed Special Fund to be established under the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. That should not, however, be interpreted to mean that Indonesia does not want to participate in any effort to enhance development co-operation among the developing countries through the machinery of certain specific development funds. In that regard, I can mention Indonesia's active participation in the initiation of the Islamic Development Bank, which is to be established soon and to have as its declared objective the mobilization of financial and other resources and the promotion of domestic savings and investment among its members.\n68.\tIn the same vein, we might also mention the recent decision of the secretaries-general of ASEAN to the effect that specific measures will be taken to alleviate the problems of raw-materials shortages among its members. In that particular case, Indonesia will make an effort to provide some form of aid to the other members of ASEAN within its limited capacity.\n69.\tWith regard to regional co-operation with ASEAN, that organization has now entered its second stage of operations,. Whereas the first stage was devoted to consolidation, in the second stage ASEAN will have to move more rapidly towards actual realization of economic co-operation in various fields. Particular reference must also be made to co-operation in the industrial field, which will lead to concrete results in the form of setting up ASEAN industrial projects to provide the goods and services necessary to raise the people's standard of living and to improve economic viability.\n70.\tOur summary review of some of the problems and challenges which the international community will have to face now and in the immediate future clearly shows how crucial a role the United Nations can and must play within the prevailing pattern of global interdependence.\n71.\tIn the light of the all-encompassing process of transition and change through which the world is going, and in the face of problems it is far beyond the scope and capacity of single nations to contend with, there seems to be dawning a new realization of the necessity to forge a fundamentally different kind of global co-operation and global co-ordination among the nations of the world. No international organization other than the United Nations possesses the inherent capacity, universality and credibility to assume the indispensable task of acting as the central instrument and principal catalyst in this common venture.\n72.\tI cannot, therefore, but whole-heartedly endorse the plea of the Secretary-General, so eloquently summed up in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Al9601IAiid.l], that the widest possible effort and political will on the part of all Member States should be mustered so as to enable the Organization effectively to meet the overwhelming challenges of our time and to be truly fashioned into a lifeline to a better human society in the future.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to state that it is a signal honor to address the Assembly from this rostrum the highest expression of world thinking where illustrious statesmen from the most distant corners of the world have come to carry out a dialogue, which is a means of understanding par excellence between peoples and between men. This is possible because of the growing universality of the United Nations, which at each session of the General Assembly enables us to greet new States that have joined the system.\n2.\tOn behalf of my Government and my people, in our language which is a language of peace, I greet all the nations represented here. We wish to practice friendship without reservations or exclusions. We are a developing country, a part of the earth which shares the limitations, hopes, disappointments and impatience of those countries which earnestly seek their progress in an atmosphere of stable peace, based on the broadest co-operation.\n3.\tI wish to express to the President of the Assembly, Mr. Abdelaziz Boutefiika, the eminent statesman from Algeria, our most cordial greetings and our best wishes for his success. To the outgoing President, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, and to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, we express our appreciation of their unflagging work for world peace.\n4.\tI also wish to extend a brotherly welcome to the new Members of the Organization, the States of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. As my country has from the outset maintained cordial relations with Bangladesh, we can only rejoice at its entry into the United Nations. The same holds true in respect of Grenada, a State which is also within the\nAmerican region, thereby making its presence in the United Nations a twofold source of very great satisfaction to the Latin American group of States. As regards Guinea-Bissau, we again have many grounds for satisfaction in view of all that its presence represents.\n5.\tThe General Assembly heard with deep consternation Mr. Cesar Batres, the Minister for. Foreign Affairs of Honduras [2242nd meeting]. His words brought to us the tragic confirmation of the gravity of the disaster which has struck his country. He made us feel as our own the pain and devastation which the Honduran people have been suffering. We know that there are tragedies in respect of which words are meaningless. But we know too that the ideas transmitted in this august Assembly are the expression of an international solidarity profoundly moved and stimulated by the marvelous sense of human brother-hood, a brotherhood which in the midst of pain, and perhaps because of it, will bring spiritual comfort, moral encouragement and material assistance to the sister State of Honduras, with which the Government and the people of Bolivia feel a deep sense of solidarity in these moments of sorrow and affliction.\n6.\tAs I was saying, every year we meet here - countries which are united and separated for many reasons quite apart from geographical distances. We come here seeking a pledge, bringing our concerns and our hopes. This is the most eloquent proof that our faith in the supreme world body has not faltered. We believe in the ideals and postulates of the San Francisco Charter, which was masterfully conceived 29 years ago.\n7.\tThese principles have not lost force with the pas-sage of time, and they are as valid today as they were then in promoting an international conduct designed\nto enable mankind \t1 so many ways, to\nfollow a road le^u. ^ ihe attainment of a destiny of happiness and prosperity.\n8.\tThe items to be debated in the Assembly are many and complex. Among them there is no order of priority with which to determine their importance. All, every one of them, are intimately connected with the lofty purposes of the United Nations; but it is quite true that some are of greater concern to us.\n9.\tAccordingly, I shall refer only to some of the items which, in our opinion, require priority attention and immediate action by the States Members of this Organ-ization so that through adequate adjustments we may promote success in the great tasks which the inter-national community seeks to complete ,\nA/PV.2259 and Corr.l\n10.\tAt this stage in our civilization, when man, through his inexhaustible ingenuity, has solved the mystery of outer space, mankind cannot consider wars to be inevitable. There is therefore no acceptable justification for mass destruction.\u2003\n11.\tFor this reason, from this rostrum of peace, where we nobly endeavor to arrive at understanding and friendship among peoples, my delegation wishes to express its most earnest hope that the efforts of the Security Council will strengthen peace on Cyprus and that the international community will endorse the initiative of the Secretary-General to bring comfort to the populations affected by the conflict.\n12.\tBut the aims of peace cannot be secured except by political action designed to prevent possible confrontations. At present, the elimination of world tension must be sought, basically, in a frank and determined co-operation for development, which will make it possible to establish a just order in economic relations among States in the knowledge that external aid and co-operation have ceased to be an act of philanthropy and have become a duty which the most advanced countries can no longer shirk.\n13.\tThese motives gave impetus to the drafting and implementation of a major effort -the international development strategy for the First United Nations Development Decade. We recognize, in all its auspicious intention, the essential achievements of that program, even though it must be pointed out that they were not sufficient to solve the complex problem of underdevelopment. This circumstance led to a feeling of frustration which, with the useful lessons learned from the earlier attempt, we must try to dispel and overcome. The desire to achieve the advancement and prosperity of peoples is a goal which, despite frustrations, cannot be abandoned. The will of nations must persist in its purpose to achieve those aims. Were this not to be so, we would be committing a blunder with unforeseeable consequences for the future of mankind.\n14.\tWith these irrenunciable aims still in view, the Second United Nations Development Decade was started in a spirit of renewal. The responsibility shoul-dered by the international community is greater at this stage than in the past because new expectations and prospects are being nurtured. These must be satisfied lest our peoples become inevitably exposed to a crisis of confidence in the mechanisms of world co-operation and in the very system of international economic relations.\n15.\tIt is not our intention to encourage pessimistic prophecies, but if our peoples have to continue to bear fresh disappointments the consequences will doubtless be catastrophic. Faith will have been weakened, and we shall have further removed the goal of progress to which the most numerous part of mankind aspires for its complete fulfillment.\n16.\tFor these reasons, my delegation feels that it is both desirable and urgent that the industrialized countries, and the developing countries replace the present state of near-confrontation by a broad and constructive understanding so as to arrive at an economic alliance through the same channels which made it possible to reach a political detente, designed to create a sound and lasting world understanding.\n17.\tMy delegation wishes to reiterate its complete endorsement of the principles, objectives and policies contained in the basic documents adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly. We consider that they faithfully reflect the interests and aspirations of the economically backward countries.\n18.\tHence, we not only appeal for understanding from the industrialized nations but we also require their dynamic participation in this undertaking, through generous and concrete expressions of their political will, with a view to establishing a more balanced and just economic system.\n19.\tThere is clearly the threat of a world-wide economic dislocation. It is a time of trial and of urgent decisions. Joint action and solidarity must go beyond simple statements. Positive altitudes conceived of with imagination and executed with boldness are what is needed.\n20.\tIt is of the utmost importance that we obtain a progressive revaluation of the exports of the developing countries. But we believe that this will only be possible if we adopt an appropriate mechanism which will link and automatically adjust, starting with equitable levels, the evolution of prices of the exports of the least developed nations with the manufactures of the industrialized countries.\n21.\tIt is also of priority interest to strengthen the organs for these purposes so as to achieve a greater transfer of financial and technological resources for the benefit of States which seek to develop.\n22.\tAnother legitimate means to prevent any possible crisis might be found by the international community if, with a criterion of equity, it agrees to promote and facilitate the processing of natural resources in the regions where they are found, that is to say, for the benefit of the soil itself where nature placed these riches. It is also important to assist in the process of regional and subregional integration.\n23.\tAnother chapter which deserves our attention is the one regarding a draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.\n24.\tWe should like to make it possible, in brief, that through joint efforts, as the original element of the voluntary act, the intelligence of man may conceive of and apply a system whereby the growing prosperity of the richer nations does not become a threat of greater poverty for the small nations. The entire effort represented by the Second United Nations Development Decade would not be effective, however, unless we promote with like interest and will to act the Disarmament Decade. It is of the utmost importance that substantial resources previously intended for destruction now be used for work that will raise the well-being of all peoples.\n25.\tOn the other hand, we were justly alarmed to hear some expressions here in regard to the rising prices of raw materials and energy supplies, which augur an escalation of confrontation in world trade. We trust that, with the creative capacity of man and a predominantly just spirit, channels of understanding and balance will be found. Thus, we shall serve the aspirations to well-being and, above all, solidarity among nations.\n26.\tAnother item which is current in the common concern of mankind for maintaining peace refers to the quest for an adequate conciliatory formula so as to finally remove the violence of the convulsed regions of the Middle East. The Government of Bolivia is sensitive to the suffering of the Palestinian people. Therefore, we express our most whole-hearted hope that the negotiations started in Geneva will prosper and be consolidated. We believe that, in order to achieve genuine peace in the Middle East, the parties to the conflict must continue effective negotiations, covering the interests of all, without outside interference or impositions.\n27.\tLet us encourage what is constructive. We believe that the quest for peace requires many sacrifices. The situation in the Middle East, therefore, calls for the most serene reflection and requires that we pave a smooth way for the negotiators.\n28.\tMy country, which traditionally has opposed colonialism in any form, wishes to greet with satisfaction the fundamental changes in attitude which are taking place in this field. These are not isolated successes but proof of the ability to adjust to the new molds of history. It is, in brief, a triumph of the international community.\n29.\tIn this way, the first step has been taken for new States to come into being and they, we are sure, will enter the international community to practice the principles advocated by the Charter of the United Nations, which places the ideals of peace above any resentments of the past.\n30.\tThis year has been a period of doubts and achievements. There have been frustration and also hope; and the hope for a new era more just and in accordance with the concerns of our peoples is shown precisely in the context of America. The widespread acceptance of dialog, resulting from understanding, has enabled us in America to break the lack of communication and has made it easier to seek joint formulas for an effective coming together on a basis of complete solidarity. Tlatelolco and Washington, and shortly Buenos Aires, are landmarks of a new policy and of an edifying example. Developing countries and one of the world Powers, on a footing of equality, decided to review their relations in every sphere so as to reconcile interests and, what is more important, to establish mechanisms Of co-operation which will give content to the ideals of solidarity.\n31.\tWe, the Latin Americans, believe that the roads are free and clear and that a future of happiness and understanding depends, then, on our ability and imagination and the vast scope of common objectives. Dialog is again a synonym for understanding.\n32.\tAmerica, too, looks for justice. America has taken a historical decision to apply solidarity. America is resolved that on its soil sterile confrontation should end, giving way to harmony and mutual co-operation among its peoples. Finally, America has united its will and launched the challenge in Atlanta, at the Fourth regular session of the Organization of American States (OAS): conflicts do not contribute to well- being, and their solution is an imperative of our times. To do away with suspicions, to defeat acceptance of injustice, it is recognized \\\"that hemispheric solidarity constitutes one of the essential foundations of the' inter- American system\\\", and we declare, with the unanimity of causes of noble origin, \\\"that it is of fundamental interest for the continent to solve the problems which disturb solidarity, lessen co-operation among the American nations or threaten peace, and represent barriers to their economic and social development\\\".\n33.\tMy Government has thus brought to Atlanta its words of peace for the solution of the injustice arising from the geographical enclosure to which my country is confined. In this world society I must reiterate it more broadly, together with our willingness for a constructive dialog. The solution of the landlocked status of Bolivia is a continental problem. It is a challenge to America which wounds the spirit of understanding of just men and peoples. The return of Bolivia to the sea is the most deep-rooted feeling among its citizens. We trust that we shall not witness the centennial of our enclosure, because we see the foreshadowing of fruitful understanding free from formalisms and with a profoundly practical sense. America has so decided.\n34.\tWith these same principles, full of the vocation for peace and progress, the Nationalist Government, under the presidency of General Hugo Banzer Suarez, has continued the task of national reconstruction. For the past three yea* s Bolivians have enjoyed the benefits of stability and order and have found that it is possible to build their own historic destiny, through the genuine national entity. The task has been an arduous one, and we still foresee a stage of work and sacrifice.\n35.\tThe Bolivian nation faces many problems -among them, strengthening its economy and its political system, which embraces both the nation and the people, and institutionalizing its republican life. But our will is strong. With the help of all Bolivians, we shall overcome and lay the foundations that will enable future generations to have a free country, a country that is just and full of opportunities.\n36.\tI would not wish to end my statement without reiterating the faith of the people and Government of Bolivia in the United Nations. At this General Assembly session we again express our hope that mankind, here represented, will engage in a more vigorous quest for the happy future we must seek, as the result of the construction Of a truly integrated international society.\n37.\tThere are, to be sure, many problems facing the contemporary world. But I am convinced that if we exert all our efforts, and with the sincere purpose that guides our peoples, we shall find the right path that will lead us to universal brotherhood.\n38.\tThe very fact that more than 130 countries come together in this ecumenical gathering to express their hopes and aspirations and to reaffirm their faith in peace confirms our conviction that mankind is moving towards systems of loyal communication, solidarity and shared effort. That is faith in our destiny. That is support for harmonious coexistence. That is, finally, the certainty that in this changing world, where man himself is astonished by his accomplishments, ways to happiness can be found.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me first of all to extend, on my own behalf and on that of my delegation, our most sincere and warm congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, on having been elected to the high post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\n37.\tHis unanimous election is a significant confirmation of his diplomatic and political qualities. My delegation takes the deepest pleasure in this circumstance and is very much encouraged and derives great comfort from the fact that the difficult task inherent in the office he holds will always be fairly and wisely carried out by such an outstanding son of the African soil of Algeria. I cannot conceal the pleasure and satisfaction of my delegation at seeing him occupy the presidential chair in this Assembly because my country admires and highly appreciates our valiant brothers, the people of Algeria, to whom we are bound by so many close social and political ties and with whom we have maintained and continue to maintain good relations of frank brotherhood and understanding within the context of the unity and the strengthening of the African continent and international peace and security. My delegation pledges its close co-operation with the President for the success of this session.\n38.\tThis is a most appropriate opportunity for me to express in this Assembly, on behalf of my Government and on my own behalf and that, of my delegation, most sincere appreciation and gratitude to the valiant fraternal people of Guinea-Bissau which for more than 11 years has been waging an armed struggle against Portuguese colonialism and has by its own efforts seized its independence. We are today celebrating its victory, which has been consummated by its full membership in the United Nations. To this valiant brother people my delegation offers the warmest possible welcome to this Organization; we pledge ourselves to work alongside it and together with it for the total emancipation of all the peoples of the world and in particular of those parts of the world still under the domination of colonialism.\n39.\tWe cannot forget that the independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and its subsequent admission to the United Nations was the result of an arduous struggle, filled with sacrifice and self- denial throughout many years. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau has demonstrated its maturity and ability as a sovereign State and my Government is firmly convinced that it will play its proper role effectively as a Member of this Organization. For my country, the victory won by the Republic of Guinea-Bissau against Portuguese colonialism constitutes one of the most significant victories in the struggle undertaken by Africa against colonialism to rid mother Africa of colonialism was perhaps the most notable victory because it is a victory achieved over the Olympic champion of colonialism in that continent. At a time when the flag of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is flying at the United Nations, my delegation would like to commemorate an illustrious son of Africa from Guinea-Bissau who devoted his whole life to and gave it for the salvation and emancipation of his people. I refer to the great revolutionary Amflcar Cabral. May his memory long endure!\n40.\tMy sincere congratulations go also to the States of Bangladesh and Grenada, which have now joined the international community of the United Nations, thus once moire bringing the universality of the Organization closer to reality. My Government is sincerely confident that the participation of those new States Members of this Organization will contribute to improving the efficiency of the United Nations. We extend the warmest possible welcome to those new Member States.\n41.\tWith regard to the universality of the United Nations, my delegation believes and is totally convinced that this is one of the strengths of the Organization, helping it towards the full and effective achievement of its universally acknowledged objectives. This universality, along with the political good will of Member States, is the essential condition without which all our efforts to achieve the objectives of the Organization would lack consistency and it may be claimed that these two elements - universality and the political good will of the Member States - constitute the sine qua non for the success of our Organization. We therefore take pleasure in the fact that, with the admission of the new Member States, we have achieved almost total universality in the United Nations; and, as a supplement, my delegation would like to make an appeal to all States to redouble their efforts so that those parts of the world which are today, still under the yoke of colonialism will win their liberation from that evil which has inflicted indescribable suffering on mankind. In this connexion, I should like to commend the co-ordinated action undertaken by the United Nations ever since its historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. \n42.\tThe root of the evils from which the world is suffering today lies in the inequality of rights to which peoples are subjected and which brings in its train an unjust distribution of resources. The colonial system is the one which primarily generates this human injustice and has done so for centuries. The struggle for liberation by colonial peoples as a consequence of this injustice is entirely justified, in the view of my delegation, by their claim to the legitimate rights to which they are entitled: liberty, human dignity and the inalienable right to self-determination and independence. The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, under its President- for-Life, Francisco Macias Nguema Biyogo, resolutely supports this legitimate struggle of the colonial peoples, whatever form it takes, as the only means by which the peoples suffering from colonialism can be heard by their oppressors. That this has become the rule.is due to the very nature of colonialism, since the imposition of colonialism could never be negotiable by dialog at least not in the way it was imposed by the, various colonial Powers in Africa.\n43.\tSome may think that this struggle of the colonial peoples for their liberation constitutes a breach of the peace and a disturbance of order. But those who hold this belief and make this contention may be forgetting that peace has never existed in colonial Territories, because their peoples lack the fundamental right to liberty and thus, by definition, they have never had peace. My Government has a deep concern for international peace and security, as was stated by the President-for-Life on the historic day of the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea:\n\\\"Peace is our third watchword. We were born in peace, we achieved our independence in peace and this peace, internal and external, under whose sign our nation was born is something that we must maintain at all costs. We are entering the international community with the Arm determination to do everything in our power to promote the cause of peace.\\\"\n44.\tIt is for this reason that, beginning with the countries in Africa and other parts of the world which are suffering under colonialism and ending with the mayor disturbances to peace in the Middle East, Cyprus and the zones of IndoChina which are still the scene of hostilities, my Government cannot remain indifferent to the circumstances which have given rise to the devastation of those areas, circumstances which, because of their nature and origin, are liable to jeopardize international peace and security. We would like to appeal to the forces directly or indirectly involved in those hostilities to reconsider their positions and find proper solutions.\n45.\tAs Members of the United Nations we are all only too keenly aware of the role we are supposed to play and we are perfectly well aware of our duties, rights and obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. The importance of strict. observance of these obligations is fundamental, and peace * to which we all so much aspire, lies precisely in the strict observance by all Members of our duties and obligations, which today many subordinate to the satisfaction of their ambition to dominate. The situation could be very simple if we had a vigorous, energetic and mature political will.\n46.\tMy delegation would very much like to commend the co-ordinated action of many Members of the United Nations aimed at the decolonization of those parts of the world which are still under the domination of colonialism. In this respect, we enthusiastically applaud what has been done so far by the new Portuguese Government with regard to its\nAfrican colonies. As the representative of the Portuguese Government- stated from this rostrum on 23 September, we hope that General Spinola will not disappoint us and that words and agreements will mean a commitment on the part of the Government of Portugal, contracted before the eyes of the international community, to guarantee the independence and integrity of its colonies and that there will be no resort to habitual Machiavellian maneuvers which are so familiar to us as the doings of neocolonialism.\n47.\tAs I have said before, we view with pleasure the attitude adopted by the new Portuguese Government. But my Government does not consider sufficient what has been done so far and we do not have too much confidence in it. My Government hopes that immediate independence will be given to the rest of the Portuguese colonies in Africa secure, not a fictitious, independence, and independence which will be in keeping with the rights of the African peoples and give them the possibility of exercising their sovereignty. That will be of immense credit to the people of Portugal and its Government. In spite of the fact that their name has been tarnished during the three centuries of their colonial rule in Africa, this will make it possible for the African peoples to feel ourselves true friends of the Portuguese people.\n48.\tOne of the measures which my Government believes to be urgent is the de facto immediate recognition of all liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAJU\\ as legitimate representatives of the colonial peoples, their protection and the provision of guarantees for them so that they can freely put into effect their programs of action without any kind of repression. In spite of the plurality of political movements which may exist in the colonies, the important thing is to recognize them and to let them work. The multiplicity of political parties is something which has been experienced by almost all the African peoples that are today independent and does not constitute any obstacle to the granting of independence. What is needed is to allow the liberation movements to work freely and to grant them facilities to carry out their programs. They themselves will do whatever is best for their peoples. That is a path which we have all trodden.\n49.\tIn contrast to what is happening today in the Portuguese colonies in Africa my. delegation views with profound concern the scant progress achieved towards the emancipation of the African peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe^, the Sahara and so on, because of the disdainful and deaf attitude of the Administering Authorities which disregard the various resolutions adopted by this General Assembly. The permanent occupation and foreign administration of Nive, Guam, Pitcairn, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, Solomon Islands, the Seychelles and New Hebrides, American Samoa and St. Helena, the British and the United States Virgin, Brunei and the Malvinas Islands, and the Comoro Archipelago, still continue to be one of the serious obstacles to the full and effective attainment of the objectives to which we are devoting our efforts.\n50.\tMy Government is fully convinced that the decolonization of all parts of the world still under foreign domination is of fundamental importance for the balance of social, international justice. I should like to stress the subject of the independence of peoples, since my Government finds it a fundamental factor in the achievement of social justice and for international peace and security. This independence presupposes the right of all peoples to conduct their own political, social and economic lives. Foreign intervention in these matters has led only to disturbances in their lives from the very beginning. Any country by virtue of its being a sovereign State is perfectly able to adopt the political, social and economic system which it believes is most appropriate to its interests. That does not imply that it cannot share in the benefits of the rest of the international community, provided that that does not mean any intervention in the affairs of others. What country in the world would agree that another country should conduct its destiny?\n51.\tAll peoples should enjoy the freedom of independence, and respect for that independence on the part of all others is vital for good international relations. My Government respects the independence of the other countries of the world. For this same reason my Government sets no limits on maintaining relations with all countries of the world that love peace. My Government is convinced that world peace lies precisely in this total and absolute sovereignty of all countries of the world and a respect for and recognition of that sovereignty by all others. Failure to respect that sovereignty, I think I may maintain without fear of error, has given rise to practically all the conflicts to which we have been witness today.\n52.\tIn spite of the atmosphere of the easing of tension, and understanding and tolerance that can be observed today in international relations, particularly between the great Powers, my Government is not sure that peace between peoples has been entirely achieved. We are somewhat concerned still at seeing that the absolute sovereignty of the peoples is not being exercised as fully as it might be and frequently is not respected by many Members of our Organization that have imperialist ambitions. The conflicts in the Middle East, Cyprus, Cambodia and Viet Nam are nothing more than the consequence of a violation of this fundamental right of all peoples. Foreign intervention in these hostilities with a view to imperialist domination has made ever more difficult the easing of tension and the-establishment of dialog between the parties to the conflict.\n53.\tThe Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, no matter how tolerant it may be, will never permit its sovereignty to be slighted and will always reject countries of an imperialist regime which pursue this policy. We reaffirm our faith in the idea that through peaceful coexistence, rapprochement between peoples will become ever more successful and in this way the dream of our forefathers, which is also our own dream, can be realized, to see all the nations of the world living in an atmosphere of peace, understanding and tolerance.\n54.\tIt may be asserted today that the ideological struggle has lost pride of place and has been replaced by peaceful coexistence which is identified today with non-alignment. Indeed, at the present time we see visiting each other very frequently Heads of State and Government with different ideological doctrines, often very much opposed to one another, and also agreements being signed between these Heads of State. This constitutes a precondition for the replacement of tensions and differences which characterized the recent past by understanding among States today.\n55.\tMy Government, which advocates the policy of non-alignment, does not define it, as some have tried to do, by somewhat distorting it and claiming that it is another kind of alignment. My Government interprets non-alignment as a symbol of the actual emancipation of every State. We the non- aligned countries place our sovereignty and independence before any kind of political doctrine. Our only doctrine is based on the sovereignty and independence of countries: in other words, the freedom of every people to exercise its legitimate rights without foreign influence. We are entirely convinced that the perfection of one leads to the perfection of the whole, and if each State can consider that it is enjoying perfect peace and freedom, consequently this will be true of the peace and freedom of the world community as a whole.\n56.\tMy Government, in referring to areas of hostilities, appeals to the parties to subordinate their ambitions and individual appetites to an attempt to And appropriate solutions. The human lives lost in Cambodia can never be justified by the Fascist Government of Lon Nol. It is well-known by all how legitimate is the struggle of the Royal Government of Prince Sihanouk, who was the victim of imperialist aggression, when the sovereignty of the Cambodian peoples was trampled underfoot, and when that popular and democratic Government was replaced by another puppet government, guided by remote control by imperialist reactionaries. My delegation is convinced that this General Assembly will find a solution, a way to restore the legitimate rights of the Royal Government, recognized today by most countries which are Members of this Organization.\n57.\tThe Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, as I stated earlier, no matter how tolerant it may be, will never belong to that category of governments which is contemptuous of the sovereignty and independence of peoples. Therefore, at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly, from this rostrum [2154th meeting, para. 47], we gave public notice of the breaking off of our diplomatic relations with the Zionist State of Israel because of its policy of imperialist annexation; and while that State continues to occupy independent Arab territories and to ignore the rights of the Palestinian people, the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea will not reconsider its position. The international community must react to the aggressive attitude of these States and respond positively to the-appeal of our Organization for respect for the rights of oppressed peoples. My Government does not tolerate aggression because it is contrary to the objectives of the United Nations, nor will we stand by and see the rights of peoples trampled underfoot.\n58.\tIn its international relations, my Government asks nothing more than that its rights should be respected by others, just as we respect theirs. When one protects a criminal, one runs the risk of being his victim. I believe that acting logically is the sensible thing that can be done by the Members of the United Nations, and I say that without any partisan considerations. That applies to countries which support regimes like South Africa and Rhodesia. The comportment of the Government of South Africa is nothing but a flagrant violation of resolutions of the General Assembly and open defiance of the Organization. All my Government can do with regard to that country is require that it respect the Charter and strictly apply the provisions of Article 6 thereof.\n59.\tThose who believe that the purpose of the United Nations is to foment disturbances in the world and to take advantage of those disturbances to divert the attention of the world community, or allow them to be exploited by some interested parties, are mistaken. For instance, in the Korean peninsula, in spite of the time the United Nations Force has been stationed there and the efforts that have been exerted by this Organization, the Korean people have not been able to achieve their longed-for reunification because of difficulties resulting from the stationing in their country of foreign forces which use the name and the flag of the United Nations to make any kind of fruitful negotiation impossible. We would like to make clear our conviction that, as that people matures politically, reunification will be achieved peacefully by means of constructive dialogue between the North and the South, without foreign intervention.\n60.\tMy delegation continues to consider that the joint communique issued on 4 July 1972 by North and South Korea2 constitutes the basis for any negotiations. The General Assembly must object to the use of the name of the United Nations and its troops to complicate a solution to the problem of the Korean peninsula. That would increase the prestige of this Organization and would encourage the harmonious development of contacts between North and South. We are sure that in the not-too-distant future the entire Korean nation, as a unitary political entity, will participate in the work of our Organization as a fully fledged Member. The Korean people, which has a very high human potential, with its traditions and unique culture, deserves to be heard here as a Member of the United Nations.\n61.\tThe Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea believes it to be the political right of all peoples to solve their own problems without any foreign intervention. But that political right will not be effective if countries cannot exercise the same sovereignty in the economic and social realms. However, apart from that right of the peoples, my Government considers that co-operation among States is vital and has always emphasized th. necessity for a balanced world economy. The interdependence which, from the very beginning, the peoples of the world have always experienced is obvious proof of the need for economic co-operation among States. Peoples must come to an understanding in spite of their ideological differences. Only in that way can there be trade on a basis of mutual advantage.\n62.\tFortunately, the United Nations is the most appropriate forum in which the peoples of the world can come together and deal with each other. It is the best place for the efforts of all of us to be combined in order to meet the most elementary needs. My delegation is confident that this session of the General Assembly, without prejudice to what has been done at previous sessions and in other forums of the United Nations, will tackle the problems of economic co-operation among nations, giving it the highest priority and dealing with it with the attention and care it deserves.\n63.\tOne of the primary objectives of the United Nations, as our historic Charter states so clearly, is to unite the efforts of all the peoples of the world to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security, to save succeeding generations from the afflictions of hunger and poverty, and to provide the best living conditions in accordance with human dignity. If all those conditions are fulfilled through the provision of economic justice, the Organization will have played its proper role. My country, like all other countries of the third world, is not fighting for any power or political hegemony. That is the dream of the great Powers. If there really is democracy in the United Nations, as we hope, it will be possible to eliminate items on nuclear weapons from its agenda and to replace them by items affecting the lives of human beings.\n64.\tThat is the feeling of the majority. Within this context, my delegation would like to repeat at this session of the Assembly the attitude of the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea with regard to the World Population Plan of Action, adopted by the World Population Conference which has just been held in Bucharest. My country understands and has had experience of the problem of overpopulation, a problem affecting certain parts of the world. But, unfortunately, we cannot support a demographic policy which would have us exercise birth control. We are convinced that the countries affected, both economically and socially, by the uncontrollable growth in population understand that in other parts of the world the situation is completely different. That is the case in my own country, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\n65.\tWe are not convinced that poverty and illiteracy, which are so symbolic even today of the third world, or the international economic imbalance which now exists in some countries will be, as certain Powers like to maintain, consequences of the present size of the world population or of future population growth. My Government cannot believe this because, in its opinion, the improvement in prices of raw materials in view of the profits made by the industrialized countries and the equitable distribution of material goods constitute the proper basis for bringing about a better world free from the social and economic difficulties we are experiencing today.\n66.\tIn view of this fact, my Government believes that demographic policy should be pursued unilaterally by each and every one of usv without any foreign influence in accordance with the conditions, possibilities and needs of each country .\n67.\tThe world today is a vast battlefield. We, the countries of the third world, are struggling for our independence and our right to sovereignty while the great Powers are fighting for hegemony and domination. But the nature of mankind itself does not necessarily lead to war, for peoples have a natural tendency to draw closer to each other. My Government thinks, that in spite of these struggles, there is essentially no such thing as a rich country or a poor country, because the balance of the comparative needs of peoples to a certain extent may be considered stable since we all have needs that depend on each other. This is an undeniable truth which has influenced the conduct of peoples throughout history. My delegation is firmly convinced and very much hopes that the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which is to be considered by the Second Committee in agenda item 48, will constitute a very valuable instrument for influencing the conduct of States in economic matters, thus averting the abuses which have been continually committed by many countries.\n68.\tIn summary, my Government reaffirms its faith in the idea that decolonization of all parts of the world still under colonial domination and respect for the independence and sovereignty of States will contribute effectively to the restoration of international peace and security. We reaffirm our faith in the objectives and principles of the United Nations, mainly peace, security and economic and social progress. We reaffirm our conviction that through peaceful coexistence tensions among nations will be replaced by understanding and tolerance. We are firmly convinced that by means of co-operation among all the peoples of the world solutions will be found to overcome all the obstacles which today hinder the social and economic progress.\n69.\tI would not like to Conclude my statement without conveying to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General, the gratitude of my Government for his merits and for the efforts which he has made in the search for feasible solutions to the problems faced by this Organization and particularly for his interest in decolonization, peace, international security and the economic problems of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me at the outset to address to you my most sincere congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. Your election not only is a tribute to the militant sister-country of Algeria but also attests to the general appreciation of your personal talents and your constant efforts to support the movements of national liberation by backing them with effective means and by moving to a successful confrontation with imperialism and Zionism. We are confident that under your presidency this session will be one of the most important and most effective. You have our most sincere wishes for success.\n109.\tWe also wish to extend our heartfelt thanks to Mr. Benites, President of the last session, for his efforts which yielded such good results. To him and his friendly country, our best wishes.\n110.\tMay we also congratulate the States of Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada on their admission to our Organization. Their role in the bringing about of justice and peace will be, we are sure, a very prominent one.\n111.\tWe must ever bear in mind that the objectives for which the United Nations was created still fall short of complete realization. There is no doubt, however, that international relations have gone a long way towards international detente, thanks to the dialog established in all fields between the two greatest Powers.\n112.\tMoreover, a number of peoples have taken a great step forward in their continuing struggle to achieve liberation and independence, albeit at the cost of tremendous human and material sacrifices. In the vanguard stands Guinea-Bissau, which has gained its independence through its heroic struggle;, and the people of Mozambique are about to attain independence, thanks to the blood shed by its sons. We salute the courageous policy of the Government of Portugal, which has come to understand the real interests of the Portuguese people and has Abandoned its colonial policy, thus turning a new page in its co-operation with the international community after a long period of boycott by this community. We are confident that the peoples of Namibia, Angola, Zimbabwe and South Africa will obtain their independence and will do away with the remnants of racist and colonialist regimes which have been exploiting their homelands and their resources.\n113.\tThe dialog which is taking place in Europe, the disappearance of the hotbed of the German conflict, and the process of peace in the Indian subcontinent are all positive signs of the evolution of international religions towards a better world.\n114.\tDespite all these welcome trends, however, international peace is still threatened by many hotbeds of tension and danger, in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations and the will of peoples for liberation, independence and unity. The critical situation in Viet Nam persists; the unpatriotic regime in South Viet Nam constantly violates the Paris agreements; and barriers are set in the path of the Korean people, preventing it from achieving its national unity. Moreover, one aggression after another is committed against the militant Cambodian people, which has mustered all its strength, under the leadership of the Royal Government of National Union, headed by Prince Sihanouk, to confront the agents of imperialism who are engaged in a desperate last-ditch fight.\n115.\tFurthermore, it is impossible to speak of international detente and of respect for the Charter and for the right of peoples to self-determination in isolation from the events in the Middle East, a region which so many factors combine to make one of the most important in the world. The strategic position of the Middle East as a bridge between three continents, the Arab history with its civilization and culture that have been established in that area, its tremendous wealth in raw materials, its surplus of exports and the impact of all these factors on the international economic and monetary order are all realities which make it necessary to stop and reflect on the Middle East question and to approach it with the utmost care.\n116.\tThe October war of liberation demonstrated this, underscoring the sensitivity of the region in relation to international peace and security and the international economy. The danger of possible military confrontation between the two great Powers was then clear and present, and the crises to which the world economy was exposed as a result of the war that was imposed on the Arabs were acute. The Arabs, in order to defend their legitimate rights, were compelled to fight for their national existence and for the liberation of their own territories.\n117.\tThe tragedy that besets the region began after the First World War, when British colonialism undertook to facilitate Jewish emigration in accordance with a colonialist Zionist plan. The tragedy crystallized in the establishment of the racist entity of Israel, which has received backing and support from imperialist and colonialist States and from international Zionism, with a view to consolidating a racist entity in the very heart of the Arab homeland, constituting a factor of continual blood-letting. This entity was created to prevent the Arabs from freeing themselves from economic and political colonialism and to obstruct their national unity. It is not difficult to grasp the nature of this entity, for it was founded on the basis of exploiting religion for racist and expansionist purposes in an era when peoples reject such reactionary forms of national structure.\n118.\tThis racist entity was admitted to the United Nations in 1949 by virtue of General Assembly resolution 273 (III) of 11 May 1949, which made the membership of Israel conditional on the implementation of the United Nations resolutions relative to territories and to the return of the refugees especially General Assembly resolution 194 (III), paragraph 11 in particular, a paragraph which provides for the return of the Arab refugees to their homes. The Foreign Minister of Israel undertook then, on behalf of the Zionist authorities, to respect the relevant United Nations resolutions and to abide by those conditions.\n119.\tA simple comparison between the area under Israeli control in 1948 and the area under its control today and a quick review of the history of Israel, which shows that it has refused to adhere to any international resolution whatsoever, reveal the nature of Israel and the kind of \\\"peace\\\" it seeks.\n120.\tThe establishment of this entity was accompanied by the dispersion of the Palestinian people ever since 1948. The Arabs of Palestine have since been living under the worst of economic and social conditions. Israel has persistently rejected the United Nations resolutions requiring that the Palestinians be permitted to return to their homeland and to exercise their right of self-determination; Israel has intensified oppression and injustice and has repeatedly perpetrated raids on refugee camps. Israel, in its hostility to the Arabs, went so far as to wage war against Egypt in 1956; this was followed by continued territorial expansion up to the time of the June 1967 war, when Israel proceeded to occupy territories belonging to three Arab States Members of the United Nations, to disperse additional hundreds of thousands, to change the features of Arab towns, to set up scores of colonial to incarcerate thousands of citizens, and to practice Nazi methods of tyranny and oppression. Despite all this, the Arabs have always adhered to the emblem of peace based upon justice. But a just peace is impossible to achieve unless it is based on the principles of the Charter, which require complete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and full recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to return to their homeland, therein to exercise the right of self-determination.\n121.\tThe Arabs have spared no effort and have lost no opportunity to induce the members of the international Organization to take effective measures to bring pressure on Israel to honor the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations and to adhere strictly to their implementation. All such efforts have met with Israeli rejection on the ground that Israel needed \\\"secure borders\\\".\n122.\tThe Israelis mock people's intelligence when they use such childish pretexts. This comes from their superiority complex and the intense selfishness which mark all their thoughts and behavior. They tell us that geographic borders are secure borders, in complete disregard of the fact that this is an age of scientific advancement; particularly in armaments, and that technology has eliminated the immunity of terrain. In any case, the international community is entitled to ask why secure borders are demanded for a few Israeli villages white they are denied to millions of the Arab indigenous population. Does not the idea of unilaterally secure borders carry with it implications of racial discrimination? The Israelis have occupied the Golan Heights, announcing that they will not withdraw, using the \\\"secure border\\\" pretext again in proclaiming their intentions with respect to the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Sharm El-Sheikh. Yet did this occupation prevent Syria and Egypt from defending their, rights in the October war? The Israelis well remember what the Arabs achieved during that war, and what they might have achieved but for the airlifts and shipments by sea which submerged Israel with armaments, equipment and personnel to an unprecedented extent.\n123.\tOn 22 October 1973 the Security Council adopted resolution 338 (1973) which my country accepted on 24 October 1973 by a telegram which I sent iO the Secretary-General, declaring that we understood the decision to mean complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and full safeguard of the national fights of the Palestinian people. In the period which, followed the cease-fire, however, we quickly came to realize that Israel was determined to persist in its aggression. Israel expressed this determination by provocative declarations that it would not withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, especially not from the Golan Heights. On the contrary, Israel considered the Golan Heights as part of Israel and by so doing tried to restore the situation to what it was before the October war, and to abort all the valuable political results which the Arabs had achieved in the elan with which they set themselves to defend their rights and to liberate their territories. Israel has resumed its delusion of invincibility; apparently the war held no lesson for it. The Arabs, who rejected the set-back of 1967, refuse to relinquish their achievements of the October war. They are more than ever determined to protect and defend and safeguard their national rights not only because these are their rights, but because to safeguard and defend such rights is to defend the Charter and the freedom and dignity of man.\n124.\tWe deployed our utmost efforts following the cease-fire to secure implementation of Security Council resolution 338 (1973). The Israeli response was more procrastination and more provocative statements, Our people is struggling for freedom. It has not tired of the struggle. It will not give way to despair. This was evident in our acceptance of the Golan war -as of any other war. That was brought to a halt by the agreement on separation of forces signed in Geneva on 31 May 1974. The text expressly stipulates that the agreement is but a step towards implementing resolution 338 (1973) and does not constitute the just and durable peace desired. Although four months have elapsed since the signing of this agreement, Israel still continues to maneuver, procrastinate and issue refusals.\n125.\tIsrael is escalating the tension with military preparations behind which lie new aggressive intentions, with no regard to the far-reaching harm this may do to international security and peace depending on the encouragement received from some Powers which continue to send economic aid and armaments to Israel. Israel fully disregards the harmful effects to international security and peace at a time when the situation in the Middle East has ceased to be one of mere regional dimensions and when its impact and dangers extend to all points of the globe.\n126.\tWe summon the attention of the international community once more to the fact that acquiescence in aggression and complacency in the face of its continuation in one part of the world encourage aggression in other parts. Therefore we appeal to you to stand by our people, who are striving for peace, to support us so that we can continue towards this goal, and take measures which will impress upon Israel that it cannot with impunity persist in its hostile policy against peoples, that violation of its commitments on the basis of which it was admitted to the United Nations makes Israel unfit for membership in the international community.\n127.\tIndeed, it has become a focal point of disturbance and terror in this sensitive region of the world. Visit yourselves, my friends, the town of Quneitra to see what Israeli hatred did just before the evacuation, following the separation agreement. See for yourselves the evidence that Israel could not contain its racism and instinct to destroy, but indulged them by razing the features of the town, demolishing every house, every shop, mosque, church, school, hospital, water reservoir and electric generator, every precious antiquity, even desecrating the sanctity of cemeteries with tractors and explosives. After such criminal operations the Israelis found the easiest course was to claim that the destruction of Quneitra occurred during the war, thus adding lies and hypocrisy to their war crimes.\n128.\tThe Government of the Syrian Arab Republic calls upon the international Organization not to neglect the situation in the Middle East, for it is explosive, and hopes that it will go to the root of the problem. The Syrian Government insists that restoration to the Palestinian people of their national rights and other rights recognized by the Charter and United Nations resolutions is indispensable for the establishment of a just and durable peace in the Middle East, that the exercise by this people of its right to self-determination requires the implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III) adopted on 11 December 1948, which the Assembly has yearly reaffirmed, requiring the return of the Palestinians to their homes, and that Israel be compelled to annul all the measures it has taken to deprive the Palestinian people of its national and human rights. It calls upon the Security Council to take the necessary steps to safeguard those rights.\n129.\tPersistence in depriving the Palestinian people of its rights is contrary to the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; it is contrary to the policy of the United Nations, which is to liquidate colonialism and combat racism. The identity and individual character of the Palestinian people have been manifested through its struggle under the leadership of PLO, which most States have recognized, as they have recognized the legitimacy of the struggle of the Palestinian people. Therefore we appeal to you to extend political, material and moral support to this struggling people, to achieve peace and justice in the Middle East.\n130.\tAmong the responsibilities of the United Nations, which inherited the question of Palestine from the League of Nations and has dealt with the Middle East crisis, is to declare without ambiguity that no just peace can be established save by the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Arab Territories occupied since June 1967 and by the revocation of all changes introduced by Israel in the demographic, economic and cultural structure of the occupied Territories. If Israel does not comply, the Organization should proceed forthwith to take all measures provided for in the Charter to deprive it of its membership and force complete withdrawal from all the occupied Territories and the restoration, to the Palestinian people of its national rights. Failure of the Organization to shoulder its responsibilities will jeopardize the progress achieved in international relations and allow them to revert to a state of explosive tension, for whatever occurs in the Middle East will have repercussions throughout the whole world.\n131.\tOn these premises, the Arab States and others have decided to request the inclusion of the question of Palestine as an item on the agenda of the present session [AI9742 and Add J-4]. All States have supported this request and merit our sincerest thanks. The question of Palestine has been On the world's conscience for more than half a century. It behooves the Assembly now to examine all its aspects, so that Members can form a clear picture of what Israel is an example of settler colonialism similar in its nature and in the way it has been achieved to that of South Africa and Rhodesia. When we insist on the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Territories, and associate with this the ensuring of the rights of the Arab Palestinian people, we base ourselves on a historical reality which neither the series of Israeli aggressions nor the policy of fait accompli can eliminate from existence. By refusing to comply with United Nations resolutions, by engaging in maneuvers in order to evade the obligation of implementing Security Council resolution 338 (1973), Israel places the region in a condition hardly conducive to assuring international peace and security. Any co-operation with or assistance to Israel, militarily, economically or politically, will encourage it to persist in shunning its international obligations. All States, and particularly those which have been and are backing Israel, are called upon to fulfill their responsibility in the protection of the United Nations Charter and in the implementation of United Nations resolutions.\n132.\tAny attempt to restore, in one form or another, the situation that prevailed prior to the October war will have a nefarious impact on peace. Hence the need for strong measures to be undertaken by the United Nations and by all peace-loving peoples, measures such as those urged in the resolutions adopted by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, convened in Algiers, calling for a political, military, economic and cultural boycott of Israel and for the discontinuance of all sea and air communications facilities extended to Israel by any country. We are entitled to expect and the events of October have only served to emphasize this such an international effort for the fulfillment of the Arab nation's legitimate demand of complete withdrawal and the demands for the national rights of the Arab Palestinian people. Unfortunately, we do not believe that hope will be fulfilled, unless we reach this result as soon as possible, particularly since Israel is resorting to all sorts of maneuvers for the purpose of aborting all such efforts and evading its obligations under the United Nations resolutions and the Charter.\n133.\tThe policy of our country is that of a door open to the world in a spirit of friendship, positiveness and co-operation with all countries save those that base their philosophy and existence on racism. As a result of that policy, our country, together with other Arab countries, is witnessing a great and fruitful evolution in political, economic and spiritual relations with most other countries of the world. Some illustrations of this can be found in the top-level meetings that have taken place and are taking place in our country and in other Arab countries; in our active participation in the most important international conferences; in the series of visits undertaken recently by President Hafez El-Assad to a number of friendly States. In all of these there is an impulse for greater international understanding and co-operation, and a strong reaffirmation of a common faith in the principles of the Charter and in the moral values and norms of justice of the international community. The results of the conferences of the non-aligned countries and of the Islamic countries in Lahore and the summit meeting of the Arab States demonstrate and confirm this fact. Thus the way is being ^prepared for attainment by the people of Palestine of their national rights, under the leadership of PLO.\n134.\tOur people look forward to the day when the Mediterranean will be a lake over which peace reigns supreme, following on the disappearance of the hotbeds of tension in the Middle East resulting from the Zionist aggression against the Arab nation. We are saddened by the events in Cyprus, that island, so close to our shores, to which we are linked by cordial relations based on proximity, co-operation, the principles of the Charter and the policy of non-alignment. When we consider that those events are not isolated from the situation as a whole in the Miduik Bast and Europe, we feel that we should do everything possible that can put an end to the ordeal of the Cypriot people and settle their problem on the basis of the territorial integrity and independence of their country, remove all causes of tension in the island, and ensure that Cyprus remains a member of the group of non-aligned countries. We appeal to all Member States to co-operate towards the realization of these goals. \n135.\tOur Organization faces a new era. As was stated by the Secretary-General, it must respond to challenges and changes without sacrificing its principles. AU peoples look to the Organization in the hope that it will be able to spare the world the horrors of war and to build an international community based on sound and proper political, economic and social foundations; that it may do so by eliminating injustice, upholding right, spreading international justice and securing to all peoples their full rights. It is imperative for this Organization to find solutions to the great problems facing the international economy, and it is mandatory that it work towards narrowing the gap between the developing and developed countries. The disparities resulting from that gap which made it necessary to hold the historic sixth special session of the General Assembly last spring require sincere, serious and prompt work on the part of the technologically advanced States on the basis of full and rapid implementation of General Assembly resolution 3202 (S-VI), with restoration to all States of full sovereignty over their natural resources, easier access for them to technology, and technical assistance in promoting the construction of their economies on a sure, strong and self-confident basis, and the liquidation of aggression, foreign occupation and every form of foreign economic exploitation.\n136.\tThere is no doubt that indulgence in military aggression, the appropriation by great Powers of huge budgetary sums for military expenditures, the amounts of aid given or proffered to racist and expansionist regimes, and the control of third-world resources all figure prominently in the state of inflation that is overwhelming the world.\n137.\tIt is the right of the peoples of the third world that have suffered from colonialism and exploitation by imperialist companies to 'restore their full control over their natural resources and to utilize those resources for safeguarding their independence, sovereignty and national territory. If such utilization results in certain negative effects on other States, it is the duty of those States to cease giving their support to aggression, whether it be political, economic or military support, and to offer aid and assistance to the peoples suffering from aggression. The liquidation of aggression and its causes is one of the most important factors in eradicating the hotbeds of tension in the world, and it represents a process that will certainly have positive effects on the world economy and will serve the interests of different peoples.\n138.\tOnly by working tirelessly, with courage and profound faith in the principles of the Charter and their applicability, can we fulfill the hopes of humanity. We are optimistic, Mr. President, that this session over which you preside will be the starting-point for a new era, one highlighting the strength and efficiency of this Organization.\n139.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic, reasserting its belief in the Charter and in international law, feels strongly committed to the liberation of its occupied territories by every means available to it, and to securing the rights of the Palestinian people. In working towards these ends, we are giving expression to the aspirations and the interests of the international community in its longing for a just and lasting peace, and we are sincerely collaborating with all States and all forces working towards this. These are indeed the propitious conditions necessary for a climate of international relationships that can prosper under the auspices of the United Nations and become one of justice, love and equality in a world of peace, progress and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the Cuban delegation wishes to express joyous, friendly and fraternal congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. In addition to your known reputation as a revolutionary fighter in the heroic struggle for the national liberation of Algeria, you combine the skill, competence and prestige needed for such a delicate and responsible position.\n2.\tHowever, we must recognize that the meaning of the unanimous election that brought Abdelaziz. Bouteflika, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, to the presidency of the Assembly goes beyond the framework of the outstanding personal qualities and abilities he brings to his duties. First and foremost, it bespeaks international recognition of the outstanding role played at this time by the peoples and countries of the third world, and, within that vast and stirring group, particularly those which have achieved their independence or are struggling to do so on the African continent. Furthermore, it symbolizes the new situation created by the growing convergence of the non-aligned nations, the democratic, progressive forces and the socialist countries in the arduous and determined under-taking to establish a just international order and to eradicate colonialism, imperialism and neo-colonialism as well as racism in all its forms and manifestations. We can conclude, therefore, that in this specific case those who honor that noble cause, by their words and by their deeds, are in themselves honored. The Cuban revolution greets the Algerian revolution for this well-earned distinction.\n3.\tWe are also very happy to express our gratitude to Mr. Leopoldo Benites for the excellent work he did as President of the General Assembly during the twenty-eighth regular session and the sixth special session which followed it.\n4.\tThe Cuban delegation wishes to renew its expression of friendship to the sister Republic of Honduras, recently beset by a devastating hurricane. My country has itself experienced the blind fury of that tragic concert of shattering rain, wind and tidal waves. From the very beginning of this sad event, Cuba, true to its Latin American and internationalist duties, offered the Honduran people all possible assistance within our means.\n5.\tThe admission to the United Nations of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, the Republic of Bangladesh and the island of Grenada is a matter of great satisfaction for Cuba. While they are all milestones on the road to the universality of the United Nations, what is more important is the significance of their constitution as independent nations; it strengthens and accelerates the process of decolonization. The advent of the people of Guinea-Bissau to independence is the glorious culmination of a long and arduous fight that earned the admiration and solidarity of all corners of the world.\n6.\tIn accordance with its revolutionary principles, Cuba is committed to the battle being waged by the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America against colonialism, imperialism and neo-colonialism and, therefore, we celebrate as our own the triumph of the people of Guinea-Bissau. The Cuban people was not merely a spectator at that memorable epic. We supported it. We assisted them. Our young fellow-country-man, Pedro Rodriguez Peralta, was one of the international fighters who personally took up arms in defense of freedom and fought shoulder to shoulder with the brave and dedicated warriors of Guinea- Bissau. Wounded and captured in combat, he faced, with the unshakable determination of a Cuban revolutionary, torture and harassment in the horrible dungeons of Portuguese fascism.\n7.\tAm Hear Cabral, the supreme guide and national hero of the people of Guinea-Bissau, was our friend, our comrade and our brother. He died, vilely murdered on the very threshold of victory. But today, crowned with laurels, he is reborn in the thoughts, hearts and will of his people. He will continue to point the way even though he is dead. Let us not mourn his death. Those who lead peoples receive a lasting tribute by having their work carried on.\n8.\tThe people of Mozambique, led by the Frente de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] is also now in the process of total decolonization through a fixed- term agreement signed with the new Government of Portugal, which is to a large extent the result of the struggle for national liberation in its colonies. Yet we must be alert to the maneuvers and the plots of reactionary white settlers in connivance with South Africa and the imperialist powers to frustrate the freedom movement in Mozambique, Cape Verde and Angola.\n9.\tWe must in all fairness rely on the commitment proclaimed in this hall by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal [2239th meeting]. The new Portuguese Government has, by its actions, confirmed its anti-colonialist and anti-Fascist policy. As a consequence of the onerous legacy it received from the outmoded regime overthrown by the armed forces of the people, the new Government of Portugal faces difficulties and problems. But it is obvious that after the recent changes in the structure of power resolutely supported by the broad masses and by the revolutionary and progressive political parties, it is cleansing and strengthening its foundations and, among the harassments and resistance of an outmoded economic order that is still intact, it appears to be heading towards democratization of the country.\n10.\tThe admission of the Republic of Bangladesh war* a long-delayed act of justice. Cuba fully supported the inalienable right of that people to national independence and was one of the first States to recognize it as a free and sovereign country.\n11.\tGrenada is an island near to our own and, like Cuba, forms part of the same Caribbean historic constellation, a dialectic synthesis of races, languages and cultures and struggles which dovetail and fertilize each other. A common colonial and neo-colonial past generated our under-development and our dependency. But that same past gave birth to our rebellion and to our determination to be free. Cuba offers its friendship, its support and its co-operation to that island.\n12.\tThe establishment of Grenada as an independent country means one link less in the colonialist chain of the Antilles. But there are still fetters to shatter and therefore freedoms to win. Among the other nations of the area Puerto Rico is still subjugated and under the colonialist domination of the United States, against the sovereign will of the people. But, sooner rather than later, it will be completely independent and thus entitled to enter the United Nations. Fulfilling the mandate it received from Jose Marti, Cuba will never cease to help the people of Puerto Rico in their patriotic aim.\n13.\tProviding undeniable evidence of the fact that the struggle for national liberation is invincible in Africa, Asia and Latin America, these three new States which have acceded to independent life wilt give a lasting impetus to completion of the process of decolonization in the world. Some African* nations are still living under the yoke of colonial oppression and racism. It is our bounden duty to contribute to their immediate liberation through material, political and moral assistance. Africa cannot be a free continent as long as countries are suffering from colonialism, neo-colonialism or racism, as Latin America and Asia cannot be independent as long as vestiges of colonialism or neo-colonialist regimes are to be found there.\n14.\tIt must be clear to everyone that the process of international detente - taking place in Europe is of vital importance to every country and every people. The basic liquidation of the aftermath of the Second World War and the recognition of the international personality of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have helped to add oxygen to the somewhat rarefied atmosphere of the old continent. The fruit of the  Security and Co operation in Europe are now starting to emerge. The agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union to prevent nuclear war and the negotiations by both countries on the limitation of strategic weapons and the mutual reduction of their armies stationed in Europe obviously tend to create conditions conducive to avoiding confrontation and replacing it by co-operation.\n15.\tThat process, tenaciously fostered by the Soviet Union as a complement of its policies of peaceful! coexistence among different systems, strengthens and encourages the age-old aspiration of peoples to security and peace and makes it possible to develop the struggle of the peoples of all the other continents to achieve political independence, economic emancipation and social progress. Detente is indivisible and therefore its benefits should be extended to the world at large.\n16.\tIt is equally clear that the promising reverberations felt all over the world are in dramatic contrast to the tensions and conflicts that still lie over the horizons outside the European continent itself. In Latin America the policy of cold war is still with us. Cuba is a nation under blockade. The Cuban delegation renews its strong condemnation of this aggressive measure and states once again that no official negotiation of the dispute between Cuba and the United States can begin until that criminal, arbitrary and anachronistic blockade is lifted for it is in clear contradiction with the detente applied elsewhere. There is no peace in the IndoChinese peninsula. The Agreement ending the war and restoring peace in Viet Nam, signed in Paris on 27 January 1973, has proved to be completely ineffective. United States imperialism has blocked every effort aimed at the peaceful reunification of Korea and foreign troops are still stationed in the south of the peninsula, sheltered under the flag of the United Nations. The agreements so arduously achieved in Laos are constantly jeopardized. With two thirds of its territory in the hands of the people's army of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, the seat of that country at the United Nations is still occupied by the puppets of Lon Nol and we still avoid discussing this burning question here.\n17.\tBeyond the coast of Europe, in the Mediterranean area itself, the Middle East crisis, which is already threatening world peace and security, daily becomes worse. Today the Middle East subsoil is the potential epicenter of an explosion that will affect the whole world. The urgency of a definitive solution is obvious.\n18.\tit would be helpful to realize that, whatever method or means may be used, there can be no just and lasting peace in the area until Israel returns the occupied Arab territories and recognizes the national rights of the Palestine Arab people. Cuba advocates the participation of the true representatives of that people in this session of the General Assembly when we discuss the question of Palestine and in any matters dealing with its existence as a nation. Without a solution to the problem of Palestine, any settlement of the crisis in the Middle East is illusory.\n19.\tThe bitter events in Cyprus, closely interlinked with the stormy situation in the Middle East, have thrown a dark shadow of concern over the fate of small nations. I shall not repeat here what is known to all. Suffice it to say that the people of Cyprus was the sacrificial victim of Yankee strategy in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and its allies in the disputed zone of the eastern Mediterranean.\n20.\tThe cunning overthrow of Archbishop Makarios, the constitutional President of Cyprus, was plotted by United States imperialism in connivance with the Greek Fascist junta, the reactionary forces of the region and the agents of the two communities in that country. The armed conflict that followed the coup d'etat led to foreign intervention which, despite the cease-fire agreement, is still causing severe losses, outrage and intolerable harassment to the inhabitants of the island. The people and the country of Cyprus have paid a very high price to remain independent and honor their adherence to the Movement of Non-aligned States.\n21.\tCyprus, the second non-aligned country to be attacked in less than a year by the concerted forces of reaction and imperialism, is at this moment at the mercy of NATO and of the invaders. The crude way it was contrived to impose this situation by force and foreign intervention is a challenge to the international community and to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. If an end is not put to it, it will throw wide open the gates for new aggressions by Israel against the Arab countries and endanger peace and security in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East. The Movement of the Non-Aligned States has most severely condemned the international plot against the independence of Cyprus and actively supports the struggle of its people to reconquer its independence.\n22.\tThe Soviet Union has proposed the convening of a world conference within the context of the United Nations in order to resolve the dangerous situation which has been created and to safeguard the independence of Cyprus.' Cuba supports any other proposal tending towards the same end. Therefore, we feel that to that end any formula for solution should contain at least the following conditions: withdrawal of all foreign troops; absolute independence; territorial integrity; freedom to maintain the policy of non-alignment; and the solution of the problem of the national communities on the basis of the principle of territorial integrity and without foreign interference.\n23.\tIt is almost futile to specify that Chile was the other non-aligned country that in the past year has been the victim of a reactionary intern0' plot planned in collusion with imperialist intervention. The armed forces of Chile acted as the implacable weapon of those anti-national interests and they are directly responsible for the overthrow of the constitutional Government of Chile and the death of President Salvador Allende, who fell in combat clutching the flag of his .country and whose democratic and socialist convictions have lighted a torch that can never be extinguished.\n24.\tAn American hero, Salvador Allende is also a hero of the third world and of all peoples. As the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba, Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro, said in a iwcent address:\n\\\"The great flame of solidarity now burning in all the nations of the world kindled in the heat of the Chilean tragedy has not died down with the passage of months. On the first anniversary of the death of President Allende his stature grows ever greater in the eyes of world public opinion, and the peoples redouble their condemnation of and contempt for the\nFascist junta. Nothing in the past few years has so deeply wounded moral sensitivities and produced such unanimous revulsion in all corners of the world. There is no government that stands in lower esteem or is more morally isolated than the Fascist Government of Chile.\\\"\n25.\tFrom this very rostrum at the twenty-eighth session [2148th meeting], I denounced the participation of the Government of the United States in the overthrow and death of President Allende. That Pinocchio of a Pinochet tried futilely to prove sue wrong but today that participation is known to inter-national public opinion through the cynical confession of the Government of the United States itself, which at that time so obstinately denied its intervention.\n26.\tI believe it most useful to mention those para-graphs of our Prime Minister's speech relating to these matters. He said:\n\\\"The authorities of the United States at that time hastened to deny what all the world suspected, namely, the responsibility of the Government of the United States for the events in Chile. A year later we learned in minute detail that the CIA has intervened flagrantly in Chilean affairs on the direct order of the highest authorities of the United States throughout the last 10 years in order, first, to prevent the triumph of popular unity, then to hinder the transfer of power following its triumph, and finally to work actively for the overthrow of President Allende.\n\\\"We now know, from the publication of the report of the Director of the CIA, William Colby, to the Intelligence Sub-Committee of the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives on 22 April 1974 and from other evidence given by CIA agents and published in the United States press, that in the 1964 elections the CIA gave the Christian Democratic Party $3 million to support their candidate, Eduardo Frei, in his campaign against Salvador Allende; that in the 1970 elections the CIA invested considerable funds to prevent the triumph of the Popular candidate, and that same year when the victorious Popular forces had gained power, invested $350,000 to bribe the Congress of Chile so that Allende's election would not be ratified; that, immediately after the constitution of the Government of Popular Unity, the CIA spent $5 million between 1971 and 1973 to disrupt and sabotage that Government; that in the parliamentary elections of 1973 the CIA spent $1.5 million to support the opposition candidates and to influence the information mass media; and, finally, that in the summer of 1973 the CIA financed the counter-revolutionary riots, the truck drivers and trades-men's strikes in which tens of thousands of Fascists participate, and other acts which led to the criminal and treasonable coup of 11 September of that year. These vast amounts were negotiated on the black market, above the official rate, thus contributing to speculation and increasing monetary difficulties. \n\\\"Without entering into consideration of the close relations that the Pentagon had with the Chilean armed forces, to which it was still supplying weapons at a time when all the credits \\\"of the Popular Government were cut off in the United States and in the international financial bodies controlled by it, it is clear that the CIA played a decisive role in creating suitable conditions and paving the way for the Fascist coup which has caused the Chilean people so much affliction, blood and tragedy. The CIA and the highest authorities of the United States who encouraged and supplied this policy bear direct responsibility for all the thousands of Chileans who have been tortured, murdered, imprisoned or exiled, and for the terrible conditions of oppression, unemployment and misery that millions of people are suffering in that fraternal country today. The pure, revolutionary and heroic blood of Salvador Allende that was shed on 11 September when he was murdered must leave an indelible stain on the history of those who govern the United States.\n\\\"Is it not in flagrant contradiction of all the rules of international law and the fundamental principles of the United Nations? Is it not against all the international conventions and treaties imposed by the United States on the peoples of this hemisphere?\n\\\"It is not surprising, therefore, that\\\" -so Fidel Castro pointed out in his speech -\\\"with this basic lack of respect and consideration which the United States shows towards our peoples, it should have owned to and justified its intervention in Chile at the same time as it was threatening Venezuela and Ecuador, among other oil-producing countries, with reprisals in the form of starvation and even worse if they did not bow to its demands and reduce the price of petroleum.\\\"\n27.\tFacts, like fists, repeatedly used, must inevitably lead us all to set up as soon as possible a genuine regional organization that will assure our position in the world and defend the peoples of Latin America, bring them together and unite them politically against the domination and over lordship of the United States. We are learning a worthy and useful lesson from the African nations. South Africa, Rhodesia and Europe are excluded from their regional organization.\n28.\tIn the statement to which I referred earlier, the Prime Minister of Cuba placed this question in the right context:\n\\\"The United States, on the one side and the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean on the other, form two worlds as different as are Europe and Africa; they do not fit within the same com-munity. There the separation is made by the very narrow straits of Gibraltar; here it is by the Rio Bravo and the Florida Straits. In both cases there is a technological gulf, and entirely different cultures.\n\\\"The United States is already a great community; the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean have before them the historic task of forming their own, as the essential condition for freedom, development and survival. And that can never be achieved through unworthy and promiscuous contacts with the United States. United, our people will have sufficient strength to provide themselves with the security guarantees, in confronting the aggression, interference and domination of the United States, that can never be provided by the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, or the OAS.\\\"\n29.\tA few days ago the ex-Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army, Ex-Minister of Defense and ex-Vice President of the Republic in the Government of Popular Unity, Mr. Carlos Prats, was murdered by typical Fascist means in the City of Buenos Aires, where he had been living in exile since 15 September 1973. His wife died by his side, blown to pieces by the force of the explosion.\n30.\tPrats was a military man of honor and an upright citizen who remained loyal to his constitutional obligations and to the sovereign will of the Chilean people. Living, he represented an accusing finger pointed at the great betrayal, and a ray of hope for the soldiers and officers who are still the hidd n reserves of the Chilean people. In a letter addressed to Mrs. Hortensia Busst, widow of the late Salvador Allende, he said:\n\\\"With regard to the conduct of Pinochet, I can tell you that his treason is without parallel in the history of Chile.\\\"\nIn another letter to one of Allende's daughters, Beatriz, he said:\n\\\"I have suffered much for the it justices inflicted on me, but more for the sorrows that are now tormenting the Chilean people.\\\"\nHe also let her know that he was writing his memoirs. And in his last letter to Allende's widow he said:\n\\\"I have remained aloof from political and press contacts: but nevertheless my every act is closely watched by a strange and involved network of informers, and every effort is being made in Chile to find some evidence that could be used to besmirch my honor.\\\"\n31.\tPrats assassination, by a strange coincidence, occurred at the same time as the CIA's secret admission in the House of Representatives, and the public admission by the Government of the United States, of the brazen interference in Chile's internal affairs. No great brilliance is needed to draw the logical conclusions: the alleged beneficiaries of this ghastly crime have betrayed themselves. But the noble blood of Carlos Prats will be fused with that of President Salvador Allende and the thousands of other murdered men and women to become the fount for the inexorable victory of the people of Chile. There can be no doubt that they will crush fascism. To that noble foundation has now been added the blood of Miguel Enriquez, Secretary-General of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, who, when he was most needed, fell in a skirmish with the henchmen of the junta. The delegation of Cuba pays a revolutionary tribute to that valiant fighter.\n32.\tA glance at the lengthy agenda of the current regular session of the General Assembly shows that there are not only many questions still awaiting solution, but also many problems that have emerged during the past year. It is obviously not possible for me to deal with so many questions. My delegation will consider them in detail in the appropriate Committees. \n33.\tHowever, I consider it necessary to draw attention brief to the problem raised by the crisis of the old international economic order and some of its most important aspects. At the sixth special session Cuba made known its position on the matter [2227th meetingJ. We pointed out the imperative need to replace that unjust and obsolete structure by a new international economic order, to encourage and ensure the development and liberation of the under-developed nations, which are most ruthlessly discriminated against and exploited by the highly developed capitalist countries -the very countries which today threaten them with drastic reprisals, and even war- after having despoiled them for centuries. ''Truth will make the stones speak\\\", says the old proverb. And today the very stones must cry out at this clumsy effort to fob off on the under-developed, oil-producing countries the responsibility of the capitalist countries for the growing inflation, the international monetary crisis and the depression which is threatening us phenomena that have been created exclusively by the economic and financial machinery of their own obsolete system.\n34.\tOne of the main problems we face at the Assembly is, in fact, not the so-called crisis born of the increase in oil prices, but the real crisis that is undermining the very foundations of the capitalist system. No such situation has been seen since the end of the Second World War. But the characteristic signs of a new depression are clearly visible: cutbacks and unemployment. It is obvious that the boom in the market economies that began in 1971 has lost its momentum and that an alarming decline is now beginning. The financial upheavals of the international monetary crisis have been one of the propellent factors in this process. The foundations of the system established at Bretton Woods have been fatally eroded. The anti-cyclic maneuvers employed to halt the process have thus far failed entirely. The inflationary spiral is still soaring out of control.\n35.\tThe significant increase in the prices of raw materials has served as a pretext for some highly developed capitalist countries to organize a campaign to sow disagreement, confusion and disarray among the underdeveloped countries by laying the primary responsibility for what is happening to them on the shoulders of the oil-producers.\n36.\tThe underdeveloped countries are not responsible for this situation; they have been and continue to be its victims. The highly developed capitalist countries have for long imposed price increases on the world market, by exporting manufactured goods at prices that uncontrolled domestic inflation forced upwards at an outrageous pace. At the same time, the underdeveloped countries have been compelled to sell their raw materials at steadily falling prices, while purchasing equipment and manufactured goods at steadily rising prices: in brief, the familiar process of the constant deterioration in the terms of trade.\n37.\tIt is true that in recent years the prices of raw materials, and above all oil, also rose. But it is also true that that increase, except for oil, was due to purely episodic or temporary factors, ranging from climatic conditions in agricultural production to speculative movements, some linked to inflation and others to the international monetary crisis. It is also true that those who benefited most from the higher prices of raw materials, as the figures show, were some of the highly developed capitalist countries And it is equally true that the underdeveloped countries tried to organize themselves to take joint action for a legitimate improvement of their position vis-a-vis the colonialist system of unequal terms of trade.\n38.\tThe total values of the increase in exports of raw materials between 1972 and 1973 amounted to $40,000 million. Of that increase, the highly developed capitalist countries absorbed $29,000 million and the underdeveloped countries $11,000 million. It is demonstrably false that the third world derived any substantive benefits from the recent rise in commodity prices. But there is another point to be considered. The meager surplus obtained by the underdeveloped countries was in many cases wiped out by the deficit side of their foreign trade balances. They have had to face the devaluation of the dollar and the effects of inflation on their imports of manufactured goods and food.\n39.\tIn 1973 many Latin American countries had large deficits in their trade and service balances, as well as the outflow of funds represented by foreign private investments. In 1968-1972 almost $8,000 mil-lion was sent back to their main offices by United States firms that operate in Latin America. We would be justified in assuming that Yankee imperialism has assigned to our continent the function, among others, of helping it to solve its international balance of payments deficit.\n40.\tThe raising of oil prices by the underdeveloped producer countries has provoked a storm of lies, calumny and threats. There have even been veiled accusations against those countries responsible for inciting a possible world conflict. Cuba's position on this burning question was stated very clearly by our Prime Minister in his aforementioned speech; it is the position of an underdeveloped, socialist but non- aligned Latin American nation; and I shall, if you will allow me, read out a few paragraphs from that speech relative to this problem and the political strategy called for in these critical times:\n\\\"As raised, in unusually harsh terms by the President of the United States and other leaders of that country, both at the United Nations and at the nineteenth World Energy Conference being held in Detroit -where, obviously, the Yankee authorities, by denying Cuba's representative a visa, prevented our participation -the oil question assumes dramatic proportions.\n\\\"Through a concerted and perfectly prepared action, the leaders of that country demanded that the oil-producing nations reduce their prices, holding them responsible for any imminent world economic crisis that might arise and threatening them with possible and varied kinds of reprisals. Indeed, the American news agencies undertook to stress the dramatic nature of those pronouncements, and they were justified in so doing.\n\\\"The statements of the President of the United States were added to by similar declarations by the United States Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\\\"The United States strategy is very clear: to group under its aegis the developed capitalist nations, to divide the nations of the third world and isolate the oil-producing nations in order to impose its conditions upon them. In so doing, it threatens them, in reprisal, with putting a stop to the export of food, and even with war.\n\\\"It is unjust, first of all, to blame the oil-producing countries for world-wide inflation and the inter-national monetary crisis. Responsibility for those problems falls on the United States itself. It is the United States which imposed on the community of nations the monetary system that gave the dollar a privileged position over all other currencies; it was the United States which flooded the world and the reserve banks of nearly all countries with American banknotes, that by far exceeded their gold backing; it was the United States which blockaded and isolated the socialist community from international trade; it was the United States which started the cold war and unleashed the arms race; it was the United States and its allies which, through their military pacts for a quarter of a century, invested thousands of millions of dollars yearly in armaments; it was the United States which launched the war in Viet Nam, which cost more than $150,000 million. The United States war budget exceeds $80,000 million a year, and the CIA alone spends thousands of millions yearly. In this scandalous imperialist policy lie the roots of inflation and of the monetary crisis that emerged long before the oil price rises. It was the United States which established the consumer society and the limitless squandering of the natural resources of the world's peoples. The rise in oil prices, in any event, only worsened an already critical situation unleashed by imperialist society itself.\n\\\"Secondly, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) emerges as a just reaction on the part of the producer countries of the underdeveloped world to defend themselves against unjust prices, unfair terms of trade and the exorbitant earnings of the great multinational companies, which, for the most part, are United States-owned. Those who invented monopolistic oil prices way above production costs were not the producer countries, but rather the large oil companies, which thus obtained fabulous earnings for imperialism.\n\\\"For many years oil suffered the same fate as that of other raw materials produced by the under-developed world. But oil is a very special raw material, because iron, aluminum, tin, copper, nickel, uranium, chrome, manganese and many other products are consumed almost entirely by the developed nations; oil, on the other hand, is a product that, to a greater or lesser extent, must be consumed by all countries of the world. Of all raw materials, it is the most essential and most irreplaceable. Therein lies the strength, but also the weakness, of the countries that produce it, in this confrontation with imperialism.\n\\\"No sooner had oil prices risen after the last crisis in the Middle East than the developed capitalist countries forced a break-neck rise in the costs of equipment, technology and industrial products, far exceeding what the energy costs may have added to production costs. The United States responded immediately to the oil price rises by increasing the prices of its own exports. But while it has that resource with which to face its difficulties, there are many countries in the world that neither are industrialized nor possess oil, and whose agricultural products or raw materials do not fetch adequate prices to compensate for the tremendous increase in the costs of industrial products and energy.\n\\\"Imperialist strategy is therefore aware that in many poor countries a call for reduced oil prices must fall on receptive ears. Such a reduction could lead to a serious split between the countries of the the third world and, with it, to the ruin of the oil- exporting countries a ruin which, in the long run, would also befall all other producers of raw materials and would spell an aggravation of the already unequal terms of trade imposed on our peoples by imperialism.\n\\\"Oil enjoys a privileged position among the various raw materials and hence stands in the van-guard of this struggle. But this places an enormous responsibility on the oil-exporting countries. If we want all underdeveloped countries to take part in the oil battle, the oil-producing countries must shoulder their responsibilities in the struggle of the underdeveloped world. It is not by investing oil income in the industrialized countries or in inter-national financial bodies controlled by imperialism that the support of the underdeveloped world will be obtained. Those resources must be invested in the third world itself, in the struggle against under-development, so that the oil battle can be a true banner and a hope for all the needy peoples of the world. Otherwise, much of the underdeveloped world will have nothing to gain from that struggle, and will only have to pay more for energy and manufactured goods and resign itself to further impoverishment in an already critical situation.\n\\\"Neither the oil producers nor the underdeveloped nations can allow themselves the luxury of missing this historic opportunity. This is the moment when all countries of the third world must unite their efforts and face the imperialist challenge. If the oil producers remain united and firm, if they do not allow themselves to be intimidated by the threats of the United States, if they seek to ally themselves with the rest of the underdeveloped world, the industrialized capitalist countries will have to accept as inevitable the disappearance of the shameful, unjust terms of trade that they have imposed on our peoples.\n\\\"The non-aligned countries could meet and give a firm, united and categorical reply to the threats and pressures of the United States. Faced with the imperialist strategy of divide and conquer, what is required is even more resolute solidarity; and thus international co-operation, which is so indispensable, would be based not on terms dictated by the imperialists, but on the aspirations and legitimate interests of all peoples of the world.\n\\\"The Government of Venezuela has replied with determination and dignity to the speech of the President of the United States. Yet only a very few Latin American countries, some of them oil producers or potential exporters, have given Venezuela their support; many Governments have remained silent. When Venezuela nationalizes iron and oil, as its Government has proclaimed it will do soon, the imperialist policy towards Venezuela can be expected to harden.\n\\\"This is an historic hour in which Venezuela needs the support of all peoples of Latin America, and Latin America needs Venezuela. We must recognize its battle as the battle of all our peoples.\n\\\"At the same time, Venezuela, with the extra-ordinary financial resources that it can mobilize as the fruits of a firm and victorious oil policy, could do much for the solidarity, integration, development and independence of the peoples of Latin America, as did the soldiers of Simon Bolivar a century ago.\n\\\"Cuba, which, thanks to the generous assistance of the Soviet Union, has not suffered an energy crisis, and whose development is progressing despite the imperialist blockade and the cowardly behavior of many Governments of this continent, has no hesitation in proclaiming its support for the sister Government and people of Venezuela in their just position vis-a-vis the claims and contentions of the United States.\n\\\"Let the Venezuelans learn from the example of the Cuban revolution, which under the most unbelievable conditions of blockade, hemispheric solitude and isolation, firmly and unhesitatingly resisted the assaults of imperialism, and which, today, 15 years later, emerges victorious and unscathed -an irreversible fact in this continent.\n''Venezuela will not, however, stand alone in this hemisphere as did Cuba. Perhaps destiny holds anew for the people of the illustrious Liberator an outstanding and decisive role in the final attainment of independence by the nations of Latin America.\\\"\n41. In his message to the Secretary-General, President Houari Boumediene of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria very cogently refers to the grave responsibilities that fall on the developed industrialized countries.\n\\\"Feeling, no doubt, that they were unable by their own means and with their own resources to curb the inflationary process, some industrialized countries are trying to attribute the problems which they are experiencing and which they have managed to extend to the rest of the world, exclusively to the price of oil sold by a group of developing countries. In actual fact, far from bringing about inflation, the oil-producing countries, like all countries producing raw materials, have been the first victims of inflation. The true cause of inflation must be sought in the very foundations of the economic system of the developed countries.\n\\\"This system, which for centuries enabled the Western countries to build up and expand their economies, has its real roots in the permanent exploitation of the poorest by the richest and of the weakest by the strongest. Some developed countries have gone so far as to refuse humanitarian assistance to the most impoverished of the third world countries, while others have made their assistance contribution contingent on the assistance provided by other countries, and particularly the oil-producing countries.... such conduct... is intended to exert pressure on the member countries of OPEC, threatening to exacerbate the plight of the disadvantaged to the point of despair. Most developed countries have failed to learn any lessons from the discussions which took place at the recent special session of the General Assembly and they persist in believing that they can settle the problems now confronting mankind outside the framework of the United Nations.\\\" [AI97S7, annex, pp. 2 and 3.]\n42.\tPresident Boumediene stresses in his message that \\\"questions of energy, raw materials or of inflation can be settled only by the establishment of genuine international co-operation\\\". But he warns that that co-operation can only occur on the day \\\"when the international economic order ceases to be dominated by the developed countries\\\".\n43.\tOnce again Cuba reaffirms its profound con-viction that the basic problem confronting the third world today is that of its liberation and development. The foundation of its relations with the developed capitalist countries rests on the privileges, strictures and subterfuges of imperialism and neo-colonialism - the machinery that props up and promotes perpetuation of the system was set up during the era of colonial expansion. Their hegemony over the raw materials market, their virtual monopoly of the manufacture of goods, capital assets and the control of the international financial institutions have allowed them at will to impose their unfair terms of trade and to subjugate the evolution and the trends of international trade, which have been characterized by a discriminatory and obstructionist policy to the benefit of the great consortia and transnational corporations and to the grave detriment of the developing countries. Expansion of world trade in these conditions has therefore served primarily to lead to the undue enrichment of the highly developed capitalist countries at the expense, proportionally, of the impoverishment of the underdeveloped countries.\n44.\tThe time has come to unite our efforts until we enforce the sovereign right that we possess over our natural resources and thus replace the unjust and anachronistic international order in economic relations by the new international economic order which will encourage and strengthen the development and liberation of the third world. The maturity of our conscience now cries out for coherent action in the effort to reclaim what was ours, which we have determined to carry out without respite and without hesitation, in alliance with the democratic, progressive and socialist countries which share in the same battle. Fatherland or death! We shall prevail!\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset of my remarks, I wish to associate myself with all those who have expressed sorrow and sympathy at the disaster which has befallen Honduras.\n213.\tNext, a special word of congratulations to the new Members of the United Nations\u2014Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. The Jewish people, which was deprived of its independence for hundreds of years, is, perhaps more than any other, in a position to value the significance of national sovereignty and spiritual freedom. In the name of Israel and its people I wish them prosperity and progress.\n214.\tLikewise, I cannot refrain from extending my warm greetings to Portugal, which has chosen the path of decolonization and of its own liberation from the burdens of empire.\n215.\tAnd now, turning from those who have gained their freedom to those who have not, I am in duty bound, both from a human and a Jewish point of view, it draw the attention of this Assembly, and, thereby, that of world opinion, to the suffering and distress of a small Jewish community numbering 4,500 souls, all that is left of the ancient Jewish community of Syria, which is subjected to unceasing oppression.\n216.\tHuman rights are indivisible, and the freedom of the individual concerns us all. I am \\\"my brother's keeper\\\": it is in this spirit of international solidarity that I express the hope that the Jewish community of Syria will, as an act of humanity, be finally allowed to go.\n217.\tIn turning now to the situation of another Jewish community -the Jews of the Soviet Union, numbering more than 3 million\u2014I voice the hope that the Soviet Government will recognize and respect the national rights of this Jewish group and permit those who so wish to leave for Israel and be reunited with their families and their people. The Jewish people, divided a? it is between East and West, has always been the first and principal victim of wars, both hot and cold, and is second to none in its yearning for peace and detente. Conflict with Powers great and small is not our desire, but we can neither keep silent nor rest until the right of every Jew to go to Israel is recognized.\n218.\tThe Soviet Union, as a multinational State, cannot indeed it has no right to ignore the aspirations of members of the Jewish national group to full national life in their historic homeland. It is not possible to solve the problem of the rights of the Jewish people in the Soviet Union, a problem anomalous from the national point of view, by means anomalous in human and moral terms. The granting of permission to go to Israel to those who want to go will not only solve an agonizing Jewish problem which is unique in human history, but, I believe, will also provide the solution for a Soviet problem with which the Soviet Government has struggled for many years.\n219.\tIn expressing appreciation for what has already been done, I appeal to the Soviet Government to show greater generosity, to cease harassing those who have applied to emigrate, to release the prisoners of Zion, to open the gates, and they will earn the praises of civilized men everywhere for their humanity.\n220.\tOur world is at a crossroads: on the one hand, affluence, waste and indifference; on the other, starvation, short expectation of life and untold suffering. Each of the States Members of the United Nations, and the Organization as a whole, must, as soon as possible, base its economic, technological and political cooperation on the concept of one world, all of whose parts and policies are interconnected. If not, the most gloomy of prophecies on the fate of humankind will be realized, and this at a time when man has reached the heights of scientific and technological advance. Unlimited resources to eliminate starvation and sickness are at hand. What is lacking is the goodwill, human responsibility and governmental understanding to establish a new international system which will advance mankind to lives of greater dignity and happiness, lives without war, lives of plenty and spiritual satisfaction. To this end it would be well to examine anew the existing international in order to see whether it is able to cope with these great and urgent tasks.\n221.\tSocial justice is a concept which is no longer confined to the boundaries of States. Our world is now faced with stark alternatives: to proceed along the false path, whose end cannot be seen, of a widening gap between rich and poor nations; or to embark on constructive international cooperation.\n222.\tAs Jawaharlal Nehru so wisely put it: \\\"The law of life should not be the competition of acquisitiveness but cooperation, the good of each contributing to the good of all.\\\"\n223.\tThe alternatives faced by our generation are cooperation or decline. {Let us cooperate. Israel, though small in size and limited in resources, and itself still in the stage of development, is doing its best to cope with the manifold problems of a poor and semiarid land, and with the integration of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Nevertheless it has in the past provided such assistance as it could to other developing countries in all continents in the fields of science, education and economic and social development, and will gladly extend such aid in the future.\n224.\tOne year has passed since the Yom Kippur War -a bloody encounter started by Egypt and Syria, reinforced by contingents from other Arab States, and enjoying the material and political support of the Soviet Union. More than 2,500 Israeli soldiers lost their lives in that war, more than 12,000 Egyptians and more than 3,000 Syrians and others. Most of them died in the bloom of youth and left bereaved parents, widows and orphans behind them. Israeli prisoners were savagely maltreated in Syrian and Egyptian prisons. More than 40,000 men were wounded, and many permanently disabled. The agony of bereavement of the widows, of the orphans and of the disabled is shared equally by the peoples on both sides of the lines.\n225.\tFollowing this war the Security Council adopted resolution 338 (1973), paragraph 3 of which reads:\n\\\"The Security Council\n\\\"Decides that, immediately and concurrently with the ceasefire, negotiations shall start between the parties concerned under appropriate auspices aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.\\\"\n226.\tIt is not to the credit of the Security Council that it was only in October 1973 -24 years after the signature in 1949 of the General Armistice Agreements between Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria- that it specifically called for peace negotiations. That, at any rate, was progress and it is better late than never. But why did so important and essential a resolution have to wait until the end of the sanguinary war of October last?\n227.\tThe disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt, and between Israel and Syria, also represent a measure of progress. Since the 1967 Arab Summit Conference in Khartoum, with its triple negatives -no peace, no recognition, no negotiations- this was a first positive step. It was taken in the light of the experience of the war, and as a result of the constructive initiative of the United States and of the remarkable efforts of its Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger.\n228.\tBut here, too, the same grave question presents itself: why did that come so late, and why only after bloodshed? After all, partial arrangements could have been reached without war, and before the war, both in the Suez Canal area and on the Golan Heights. In 1971 Israel responded affirmatively to the American proposal for proximity talks for a partial agreement with Egypt, and there was no reason why, as time went on, we should not have responded in the same way to proposals for similar talks with the other neighboring States. It was the other side that rejected the proposal and thus killed that constructive initiative for no good reason. In the event we did finally have face-to-face talks, that is to say, something more than proximity talks, at the first session of the Geneva Conference, at the negotiations between Israel and Egypt at kilometer 101 on the CairoSuez road, and on the occasion of the signature of the agreement with Syria in Geneva. Why then should this have been done at the cost of tens of thousands of casualties on both sides?\n229.\tIf further proof were required, the October War showed clearly that there is not, there cannot be, and there never will be, a military solution of the ArabIsrael conflict, which persists beyond all reason and beyond all political realism: a conflict which saps the very marrow from the bones of all the peoples of the area and, despite the extensive resources of our area, debilitates their economies and their societies.\n230.\tLet us look at the facts. In this war the aggressors enjoyed three marked advantages which, under normal circumstances, should have been decisive: first, overwhelming strength in manpower and modern sophisticated weaponry; secondly, initiative; and, thirdly, surprise. Yet despite these great advantages the citizen army of Israel rapidly overcame the effect of the surprise, halted the forward movement of the attacking forces and passed over to a bold counteroffensive which brought Israel troops well beyond the former ceasefire lines in the Golan Heights and into large areas to the west of the Suez Canal, thus surrounding the Egyptian Third Army. I do not think that any particular military expertise is required to realize what would have happened to the aggressors' forces if, at that stage, the Security Council had not hurriedly called for a ceasefire, which, of course, it did not do earlier, before it became clear that the wheel had turned in Israel's favor.\n231.\tThat is the essential difference between an Israeli victory and an Arab victory. If the Arab armies had triumphed, the world would have witnessed an act of genocide, whereas the Arab defeat was limited to the field of battle, and in fact opened the window to the beginnings of reason and to a small step, a very small step, in the political sphere.\n232.\tIf, despite the advantages which the Arab armies had in manpower, armaments, initiative and surprise, these were the results of the October War, what could another war bring, besides more victims, and more suffering? Another war like that would only create new complex problems the solution of which will be infinitely more difficult.\n233.\tI do not mention these things with joy, but with sorrow. I do not wish to exult in the Israeli victory nor to embarrass Egypt and Syria. On the contrary, at this time when it is the duty of us all to make a special effort to advance towards a political settlement, it is incumbent that all refrain from provocative statements and disparaging slogans. I recall these things only because I want to repeat, and to emphasize, that there can be no military solution to this pernicious conflict. Reinforcement of the armaments of the Arab countries might encourage new aggression but it cannot decide the issue in a new war.\n234.\tAfter the October War, there can again be no doubt that not a single one of the problems encompassed in the ArabIsraeli dispute can be solved by war, and that, in the same way, there is no problem, including the question of the independent identity of the Palestinians, which cannot be solved by sincere negotiations between the parties. Let us therefore do our utmost to ensure that the unnecessary war of Yom Kippur 1973 will be the last war ever to be fought between Arab and Israeli.\n235.\tIsrael has naturally drawn its conclusions from the last war. But we wish to continue to progress along the political road, which opened after the war. However, if a new war is forced on us, we shall be ready. I hope and pray that our neighbors have also drawn conclusions from October 1973, and that they agree with us that it is time to finally abandon the course of armed force so as to devote their efforts consistently, patiently and seriously to the political option.\n236.\tThe disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt on the one hand and between Israel and Syria on the other, in which the emergency forces of the United Nations under the leadership of the SecretaryGeneral are playing a praiseworthy part, may provide a suitable opening. These agreements are not only military in character; they also have their political aspects.\n237.\tFirst, the very fact of negotiations, sometimes indirect and sometimes direct, is a political and psychological step forward for all those who desire peace in our area and in the world.\n238.\tSecondly, an emended period of tranquility at the fronts has also made a contribution to the creation of the new climate and also possibly of a new dynamic for a political solution.\n239.\tThirdly, the disengagement agreements include the following paragraph:\n\\\"This agreement is not regarded by Egypt and Israel as a final peace agreement. It constitutes a first step toward a final, just and durable peace according to the provisions of Security Council resolution 338 (1973) and within the framework of the Geneva Conference.\\\"5\nThere is a similar paragraph in the IsraelSyria agreement.6\n240.\tBut the disengagement agreements and mutual observance of the ceasefire are not enough. We must go forward with negotiations, without prior conditions, keeping constantly in mind the idea of peace and mutual tolerance in order to plant the seeds of trust which are vital for the creation of an atmosphere of conciliation, compromise and understanding.\n241.\tThis objective is at cross purposes with the continuation of a state of belligerency, which not only contains within itself the dangers of renewal of hostilities, with all their horror and suffering, but also diverts the major part of the human resources and the wealth of the area to the buildup and maintenance of huge armies at the cost of its social and economic development. This useless aberration has already held back an entire generation, and its persistence will cause further suffering to millions.\n242.\tThere is a historical paradox here. The Middle East is one of the richest areas of the globe. It has natural wealth, fertile soil, abundant water for irrigation, international lines of communication, incomparable sites for pilgrimage and tourism and old, historic peoples possessed of ancient cultures and modern skills alike. But this bountifully endowed area is still, from the social and economic point of view, one of the most backward in the world.\n243.\tIt would not be difficult to prove that the expenditure of vast treasure on weapons of war and on the maintenance of huge armies is one of the main factors in this backwardness. The Soviet Union is doing no service to the people of the area when it counts weapons of war among its main exports to some of the countries of the Middle East as if these, and not means of production and technological agreements, can raise these nations from their misery. This Soviet policy, which is inspired by a one-sided, antiIsrael attitude and by incitement to intransigence and inflexibility, is one of the principal causes of tension in the Middle East and is used deliberately as a major means of Soviet implantation in a number of the countries of the area at the expense of their sovereignty. It is a policy that stands in stark contradiction to the spirit and objectives of detente, on which the hopes of all of us rest.\n244.\tI am bound to state with emphasis that either detente will be global and apply to the Middle East as well, or there will be no detente at all. Detente which does not include the Middle East is without political or strategic meaning.\n245.\tPeace and cooperation between the peoples of our region are needed not only to strengthen our economies and develop our societies but, not less vitally, to ensure the true independence of all peoples of the Middle East. There is no validity in a peace which serves the interests of one side only; and there is no substance in a peace dictated by one side to another or by a third party extraneous to both. Such a peace will always be precarious and temporary. As Albert Einstein once said: \\\"Peace cannot be kept by force; it can be achieved only by understanding\\\". Only a peace founded on respect for the interests of both parties can be genuine, stable and durable. The geo-strategic conditions which have evolved in the Middle East make such a peace possible, that is to say, a peace which will provide on the one hand a satisfactory solution for the interests of all the Arab States and also for the needs of the Palestinians, and on the other a solution for Israel's vital need for defensible borders.\n246.\tIsrael would be prepared to give favorable consideration to a significant territorial compromise, but it cannot compromise on its security. In short, I sincerely believe that it is possible to achieve peace agreements which will serve the reasonable interests of the parties to the dispute and will open a new chapter in the history of each of the States of the Middle East and of the whole region. But up to now the Arab States have, regrettably, pursued a sterile policy of \\\"not an inch\\\", while Israel has set her face towards peace, a peace of equitable compromise, even though it might be painful to both sides. In order to reach this lofty objective we would prefer negotiations for a full and integral peace agreement. But, if it transpires that the conditions are not yet ripe for this, the possibilities might be examined of reaching interim agreements, based on compromise, which will put an end to belligerency in its various components, that is to say, interim agreements providing for effective mutual security arrangements that in the course of time will lead to negotiations for a peace treaty which will determine, inter alia, the final borders.\n247.. Israel is cognizant of the existence of the question of Palestinian identity. It holds that it can and should be resolved in the context of the settlement of the dispute with its neighbor to the east. It is there, on both sides of the Jordan, that the great majority of the Palestinian population is concentrated. Moreover, most of the citizens of Jordan are Palestinians and most of the Palestinians are Jordanian citizens. It is also a fact that the area east of the Jordan is an integral part of the historic land of Israel or Palestine and that it is already the national home of the Palestinians. If there is any ethnic significance in the Palestinian concept it applies equally to the peasant, the townsman and the Bedouin east of the Jordan and to the peasant, the townsman and the Bedouin to its west. It is in the light of these considerations that the Israel Government, on 21 July 1974, resolved that:\n\\\"The Government will work towards negotiations for a peace agreement with Jordan.\n\\\"The peace will be founded on the existence of two independent States only\u2014Israel, with united Jerusalem as its capital, and a JordanianPalestinian Arab State, east of Israel, within borders to be determined in negotiations between Israel and Jordan. In this State, the independent identity of the Jordanian and Palestinian Arabs can find expression in peace and good neighborliness with Israel.\\\"\n248.\tHowever, the Palestinian community in general must in no way be equated with the terrorist organizations. From my own personal acquaintance with this community I refuse to identify it, or at least its great majority, with the terrorist group known as the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], which is not a national liberation movement but the roof organization of disunited and splintered terrorist groups whose pretensions are not supported by the broad masses of the Palestinian population. It is a fact that more Arabs than Israelis have been killed by these organizations. It is also a fact that more terrorists have been killed in the armed clashes between regular Arab forces and the terror gangs and between the rival terror gangs themselves than by Israeli security forces.\n249.\tThese facts are obvious to anybody who cares to examine them. We refuse to recognize the PLO and we will not recognize it, because of its doctrines and of its deeds alike. The charter of Palestine, which embodies the political ideology of the PLO, stands in direct contradiction to the Charter of the United Nations. It denies absolutely the right of Israel to exist and postulates its destruction as a principal objective.\n250.\tThis ideology is accompanied by the criminal methods of warfare used by the organizations which make up the PLO, methods such as indiscriminate terror, deliberate murder of women and children, pupils and teachers, athletes at the Olympic Games, passengers on a Sw.ss airliner, chance visitors and Jewish and Christian pilgrims at airports, and Arab women workers in Galilee. In reality the situation here is not that of a subject people trying to liberate itself with its own underground forces, but of gangs of desperadoes imposing themselves on a people and attempting to form and dominate it by means of the destruction of another people: this at a time when there is ample room for two States, Jewish and Arab, to coexist in peace in the historic land of Israel or Palestine on both sides of the Jordan, their common border to be determined by negotiations.\n251.\tIt is of course no secret that with the* parliamentary situation existing in the General Assembly, the preconceived ideas held by a great number of those taking part here, and the irrelevant considerations which guide many delegations, a majority might concede the PLO demands. A resolution that would do so will be regarded by Israel as an arbitrary resolution, one impinging on its fundamental rights, illegal and not binding in any way. Every representative here would reject a resolution which strikes at the foundation of his country's being. One cannot ask of any nation to agree to its own elimination or to commit suicide.\n252.\tUnderstanding for the needs of the Palestinians -certainly; satisfaction of the demands of arch murderers who appoint themselves as saviors- decidedly not.\n253.\tI regret that many Members of the United Nations do not delve into this problem thoroughly, with the consequence that, either deliberately or through misunderstanding, they reward these murderers and in so doing stoke the fires in the Middle East. Israel will not submit to violence and terror. Terrorism is an infectious disease which knows no national frontiers. Many States have already paid the price of submission to terrorism, and I am afraid that the last word has not been said on the subject. Following the latest terrorist attacks in Paris and at the Hague, President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said: \\\"Violence, which is sometimes presented and justified as an avant-garde act, is nothing but the rising to the surface of those depths of barbarism and primitive cruelty of which humanity has devoted all its efforts to rid itself.\\\" These are trenchant words, but there is need for action and for courageous cooperation in order to put an end to manifestations of terror before further disasters occur.\n254.\tThe essence of the PLO is terror. It is no coincidence that whenever a concrete proposal for a political solution is put forward, the PLO leadership rises up against any such peace initiative. Its insistence on including the question of Palestine in the agenda of this General Assembly session is designed, above all, to destroy the prospects of the political efforts at the very beginning. A debate on this matter cannot fail to poison the international atmosphere. Acceptance of the PLO demands may well condemn the prospects of the negotiating process to failure, just when the first ray of light has been glimpsed on the horizon.\n255.\tPalestinians who wish to give constructive expression to their independent identity can be helped to do so in the context of the negotiations with Jordan. Moreover, I would not agree to a genera! settlement without including in it the satisfaction of the needs of the Palestinians. It is, after all, not Israel which has prevented the crystallization of what is known as \\\"Palestinian identity\\\". To the extent that such a desire existed among the Palestinians, it is the Arab States that have frustrated it during all these years. If not, how can one explain the fact that during 19 years of Arab rule in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank, this identity never achieved any definite form or full expression?\n256.\tThe joint communique by Egypt, Syria and the PLO in Cairo, on 21 September 1974, also deals a blow to the prospects of a constructive solution to the issue of Palestinian identity. In the same way that the PLO bends all ,ts efforts to prevent political progress in the area, certain Arab States are whittling down the hopes for a solution of the Palestine question by granting the terrorist organizations the monopoly of representation of the Palestinians, when they know perfectly well that these organizations are not able to be a party to negotiations because of what they are.\n257.\tThere is no sadder example of the heartless attitude of the Arab Governments than the freeze they have imposed on the status of the 1948 refugees. It is true that many of them have been absorbed in the economies of the Arab States in which they now live, but there has been a deliberate policy to prevent a constructive solution to this sore problem in order to exploit human suffering for political and propaganda ends. If the problem in itself were not so sad I would say that there is nothing more ludicrous than the annual fundraising efforts of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to make up the deficit in its budget, and this at a time when the Arab oil States command the biggest monetary reserves in the world.\n258.\tIsrael did not adopt this course-not towards the 600,000 Jewish refugees who fled the Arab States stripped of all their possessions and not towards the survivors of the millions of Jews destroyed by the Nazis, with the blessing of the Mufti Haj Amin el Husseini, who found refuge among his own kind in Nazi Berlin and Fascist Rome. All of these were fully absorbed in Israel -economically, socially and culturally.\n259.\tIn the light of the vast economic opportunities which now exist in the Middle East, the refugee problem must and can be solved. Far more difficult refugee situations in other parts of the world have been solved long ago. Given goodwill -without which no problem can be resolved- the question of compensation for both Arab and Jewish refugees can be settled. Israel is contributing and will continue to contribute its share in the solution of this painful human problem.\n260.\tThere are those who foresee the approach of war on this or that front in the Middle East. As far as Israel is concerned, we shall faithfully observe the ceasefire and the separation of forces agreements, on a reciprocal basis, until they are replaced or supplemented by new agreements. But in the same way as we shall display the utmost goodwill in seeking to achieve balanced and constructive progress in the political sphere, we shall neither submit nor lend ourselves to the blackmail of threats of war or even of war itself.\n261.\tWe want to see progress in the efforts to achieve a political solution, both as an end in itself and as a means of avoiding war. In the face of the rapid rearmament of the other side, we shall strengthen our forces in order to prevent war or to gain victory if, God forbid, it should break out anew. At the same time, we shall continue to seek a settlement of the conflict by peaceful means. In other words, we shall prepare for the worst and hope and work for the best.\n262.\tIn one of his recent speeches, President El Sadat said that our generation must be satisfied with the end of belligerency and that the treaty of peace would be signed by the coming generation. I am astonished that so distinguished a statesman should renounce the great and historic opportunity to bring about peace and cooperation. I trust that this was not his last word. Peace should not be postponed to the next generation. It is the duty of the generations which have taken part in the war to overcome their differences and to assure peace for their descendants. Let us all do our best to secure peace speedily in our time. It is possible. In order to achieve it, one needs perhaps more courage than is needed for the decision to go to war. Let us all demonstrate both wisdom and courage for the benefit of all the peoples of our region.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. You have the distinction of being the youngest person ever to occupy that august position. Your youth is, however, a deceptive quality, for you have enormous experience both in the world of diplomacy and in the field of battle. You were a valiant soldier in Algeria's armed struggle for independence. You have been the Foreign Minister of Algeria for more than 10 years. You have also played an important role in the leadership of the group of non-aligned States.\n50.\tI should also like to pay a deserved tribute to Mr. Benites, who has earned our respect for the efficient and impartial way in which he presided over the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n51.\tMy delegation would also like to extend its welcome and good wishes to the three new Member States: Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau.\n52.\tI should also like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, for the manner in which he has discharged his onerous duties during the past twelve months. I should like to single out two examples of his positive contributions to the cause of international peace and security. In the case of the Middle East, we all owe him a debt of gratitude for the efficiency and speed with which he organized the United Nations Emergency Force. The Force has played a crucial role in enforcing the cease-fire agreement and the subsequent disengagement agreements. In the case of Cyprus, Mr. Waldheim has also played an important role in bringing about a cease-fire between the belligerents and in the field of humanitarian relief to the more than 200,000 persons who have been displaced by the fighting. The decision of the Secretary-General to order UNFICYP to take over the airport at Nicosia, in order to prevent it from becoming a point of contention between the two opposing force was a good example of his initiative and for courage.\n53.\tIt would appear, to judge by a number of speeches made at this session of the General Assembly and the reactions to them, that we may be moving away from a long era of political and military confrontations, which for three decades provided the major issues of international relations, to one of economic confrontation. True, what we have heard so far are only the distant rumbles of an approaching storm, but whether it will gather force and break over us or mercifully pass away will depend on the measure of rationality we bring to bear on our mounting economic problems.\n54.\tWe should, however, first recognize that the potentialities for economic confrontation undoubtedly exist. Even our overriding preoccupations with problems of decolonization and cold-war commitments during the past three decades did not prevent economic conflicts obtruding from time to time, though for the most part these were treated as tedious distractions from the more pressing political and military issues.\n55.\tUp to early this year the great industrial Powers, which, until recently, between them accounted for some 70 per cent of the world's income, were supremely confident that they had their economic problems licked into good shape. They sincerely believed that they had established an international economic order capable of indefinite expansion and of providing them with unlimited affluence. A whole new branch of learning called \\\"growth economics\\\" provided the ideology to sustain this optimistic vision of the future.\n56.\tThe newly independent countries of the third world, too, had their own grand fallacy. It had for long been their contention that the injustices and poverty which afflicted them were wholly attributable to imperialism and that, therefore, once foreign rule was ended, they would automatically enter an era of plenty and fair shares for all.\n57.\tThere were, however, those who questioned whether either of those optimisms was justified and whether rich and poor nations were wise in assigning a low priority to economic problems. They questioned the prevailing conviction that some 138 sovereign States could best promote world prosperity simply by developing strong, independent national economies. They questioned the belief that purely national solutions could overcome domestic economic difficulties.\n58.\tEven as late as last year confidence in the essential soundness of the international economic order was as firm as ever. Such doubts and fears as may have momentarily crept in were dispelled by the unexpected boom of the years 1971 to 1973. It confirmed the prevailing belief that the international economic system had an infinite capacity for self- correction.\n59.\tToday, however, there is a growing feeling that the ups and downs of the world economy are not temporary lapses but symptoms of the gradual breakdown of the economic order put together some three decades ago at Bretton Woods. It is now becoming increasingly clear that unless the Bretton Woods system is replaced by another which more fully accords with the economic realities of today, the next three decades could well be given over to bitter and destructive economic confrontations. Nothing short of a fundamental re-evaluation of the world's economic problems will redeem mankind from distress and upheavals far more universal and more violent than anything we have seen hitherto.\n60.\tAll this is not mere rhetoric. The first casualties of the breakdown of the old economic order have already appeared. Many of us do not find it incongruous at all that in this age of affluence and high technology we should be able to start our breakfast every day with a cursory glance at news of thousands of people dying of starvation. Many knowledgeable experts state that the age of famines has returned but this time on a world-wide scale. Only a few days ago the Secretary- General drew our attention to the fact that today some 32 countries are running out of food and facing economic collapse. Another estimate by Dr. Norman Borlaug, the Nobel Prize-winning American scientist, states that something like 50 million people will die of starvation this year a larger number than the populations of many countries represented in this Assembly. The actual figure is, of course, open to dispute but what is not in dispute is that millions will die and there is apparently very little the nations of the world, victims of outmoded economic doctrines, can do to save but a fraction of the doomed millions. And there is very little that this Assembly can do to offer these 50 millions any ray of hope, by our speeches or by our actions.\n61.\tThis is because, it is claimed, the vast food surpluses of the 1950s and 1960s may not return for a long time those days are over, so the experts tell us. A major contributing factor one of the major factors is that today's population is increasing faster than we can provide food by some 70 million people a year. Even if there were to be a more equitable distribution of the world's food resources, starvation or near-starvation will still be the lot of millions of people. The claim that modern science and technology can cope with an indefinite population increase is, in my view, cruel, wishful thinking. Generous though nature has been, it has not provided us with infinite resources. There are definable limits to the amount of food that this planet can provide. We have already reached a point where the economic cost of extracting additional food is increasing, partly because of higher production costs. I am told that in the United States, where farming is perhaps the most efficient and most technologically advanced, it has been found that it is more expensive to raise yields from 90 to 100 bushels per acre than from 50 to 60 bushels per acre. Any additional increase in grain yield must cost more.\n62.\tThe population problem is more crucial to developing countries than to developed countries and the formers ability to cope rationally with population growth will determine whether they make it into the twenty-first century as free, viable and prosperous States or remain festering, disintegrating areas of despair and violent unrest. It is no accident that famine today stalks and claims its victims only in developing countries. Because those countries have done very little to successfully regulate population growth and that means regulating population to resources nature therefore seeks to restore the balance and to be the corrective force, as it has done in ages past, by resorting to famine, pestilence and war. These have traditionally been nature's cures for overpopulation.\n63.\tIn the likely event of the world sliding into an indefinite period of economic confrontation, the in-ability of third-world countries to control population growth will make them particularly vulnerable. Countries with large surpluses of grain for export are limited to a few rich and developed countries like the United States, Australia and Canada. Hitherto, and for many years, these countries have mitigated acute food problems in developing countries through food aid under various programs. But it would be optimistic to hope that they will continue to shoulder the whole burden of feeding the ever-increasing hungry peoples of the world.\n64.\tIt is my submission that, in an era of unbridled economic confrontation, food could become a weapon, especially if other commodities, too, are converted into weapons in an economic war. It may well be that threats to use food and other commodities as weapons in an economic war may at the moment be nothing more than rhetoric born out of exasperation. But if rhetoric is indulged in often enough and economic frustrations mount, then the temptation to translate it into reality might prove irresistible. And we should remind ourselves that the most devastating of all commodity weapons would be food and the most vulnerable would be countries with large populations and poor food resources.\n65.\tI hope that the recent use of oil as a weapon against industrial countries will not be cited as a precedent for the conversion of other commodities whether raw materials or industrial products into weapons in an economic war. The reasons which led oil-producing countries to use oil as a weapon were not altogether invalid or immoral. In a way, the wealthy industrial countries forced the decision. For three decades commodity producers, including* oil producers, pleaded with industrial nations to pay more equitable prices for their raw materials. The raw- material producers pointed out, quite justifiably, that year after year for the last 30 years they had been trading on less favorable terms against increasingly expensive manufactured products. The consequence was that poor countries were, to some extent, subsidizing affluence in the wealthy countries. The wealthy nations for their part listened to these appeals with great sympathy and dutifully expressed amazement and concern over what was called the widening gap between rich and poor nations and that was about as far as they were prepared to go. Three decades of pleading did not move the rich nations simply because the poor nations so the rich nations were convinced had no leverage more persuasive than verbal and moral exhortations.\n66.\tAnyone rereading the proceedings of the various meetings of UNCTAD would come away with the strong impression that industrial nations had accepted the kind of Calvinistic doctrine that God has already selected for all time the nations that were to be rich and those doomed to be poor and that any action by man to reverse this judgment would be blasphemy.\n67.\tWhatever our other reservations on the use of oil as a weapon, there is no denying the fact that its users managed to get the industrial countries to grant what gentlemanly arguments failed to elicit. It would be understandable if other raw-material-producing countries, whose pleas for equitable prices still go unheeded, should ponder hopefully over the possibilities of forging similar weapons to enhance their bargaining position.\n68.\tHowever, in my view, the use of commodities as weapons in an economic war would be a disastrous course for the countries concerned and for the world economy. What I should like to do is to draw the attention of the wealthy, industrial countries to the growing economic frustration of developing countries over the failure of the former to deal equitably with those that produce raw materials. Equally, the producers of raw materials must be conscious of the fact that prices must bear some rational relationship to what the international economic system is capable of supporting.\n69.\tTrue, many of the economic difficulties en-countered by developing countries can be attributed to sins of omission and commission on their part. But what is equally undeniable is that the policies of industrial nations, short of their pious platitudes, are basically designed to make rich countries richer and poor countries poorer. As far as I know, no industrial nation has come forward with any systematic policy or plan deliberately to bridge the widening economic gap between it and the poor nations, however much it may deplore that gap in theory. This may be because the industrial countries feel that, except for the oil- producing countries, primary producers have no leverage against them.\n70.\tIn my view, such complacency is both shortsighted and unwise and shows an abysmal and dangerous ignorance of the international economic system. It is my contention that, even if poor countries do not have the necessary leverage, such leverage is being applied against all of us by the new kind of international economic system which has today come to maturity. This new system which envelops us all can function smoothly only if the wealth of the world is more rationally distributed. All national economies, even the most powerful and the most dynamic, can survive and flourish only by coming to terms with the international economic system that today is the foundation on which national economies rest. Basic to this system is the acceptance of the interdependence of nations, not as a pious aspiration or piece of rhetoric but as a cold reality. The smooth functioning of this global system today depends on some 138 national units working in a co-ordinated fashion for the common good. If the international economy can be compared to a chain made up of 138 sovereign nations, then, I submit, the economy cannot be stronger than its weakest link.\n71.\tIt was the fact of the economic interdependence of nations which made it possible for the handful of relatively underdeveloped oil-producing countries to throw th? world economy, and in particular the powerful industrial countries, into disarray. This economic interdependence has grown without our noticing it or even planning it over the past 30 years. Despite intense economic nationalism, nation States have been drawn willy-nilly into a complex network of economic relations world-wide in scope. All but the most primitive of national economies develop and grow more and more through international trade, international exchange. The present crisis into which we are drifting stems largely from the reluctance of national economies to come to terms with the imperatives of the international economic system.\n72.\tThat, I believe, is why the present economic crisis into which we are moving is qualitatively different from the great depression of 1929. We cannot hope to get out of this crisis by short-term national solutions founded on a spirit of beggar-my-neighbor. That is why so far the application of remedies tried out in 1929 and in the 1930s is not only proving to be ineffective but appears to be exacerbating matters.\n73.\tWhat distinguishes this crisis from the earlier one is that it is far more international in scope, involving not, as in the past, a handful of imperial units and a few industrial Powers but some 138 sovereign nations. Since all nations are struggling with inflationary problems, it is clear that we are dealing in fact with a world economic problem. The more we seek to cope with a world problem and a world system in national terms, the worse becomes the crisis, the sharper the conflict between nations, the more inevitable an economic crash.\n74.\tHowever, given the reality of interdependent economies, the clearer should become the futility of economic confrontations. The use of commodity weapons to hurt foes would be an irrational response simply because it would, in the long run, hurt everyone foe, friend and eventually the user himself. Like the atom bomb, such a weapon, in an economically interdependent world, would not distinguish between the innocent and the guilty, between the rich and the poor, between the weak and the strong. But if, for want of imagination and courage, we should blunder into economic confrontation, then the first victims must be the weak developing countries. This is already the case. They do not have the resources to stand up to the strains of what must be a long and bitter economic confrontation. Eventually, all nations will be drawn into the struggle. The devastation will be great and only a few battered countries will emerge the nominal victors.\n75.\tThat is why it is imperative that we cease trying to put the blame for the approaching economic crisis on this or that country or on the specific action of any one of them. That is the surest road to economic confrontation which, once begun, cannot be halted or reversed.\n76.\tThe fault lies with all those who refuse to face the fact that, unless national economies are made more responsive to the imperatives of an international economy, we must continue to flounder hopelessly. If the crisis should persist and worsen, then there is a strong probability that desperation and fear of an inevitable economic collapse could, as in ages past, drive nations to seek the most dangerous and hopeless of all remedies: military confrontation.\n"

        "file_text": "Coming from a region of destruction and death, I speak from this rostrum in pain, with the single purpose of appealing, on behalf of a people who today owing to a natural disaster is living the most tragic moments of its history, to the humanitarian feelings of the States of the world represented here.\n2.\tLast week, a tropical storm of devastating force was unleashed on the Atlantic coast of Honduras, sowing destruction and death. The consequent climatic changes led to torrential rains, uninterrupted for several days, which caused violent and extensive floods, spreading damage over the entire national territory and leaving in their wake mourning, desolation and loss.\n3.\tThe very dimension of the tragedy makes it impossible for us to give exact information on human and material losses. Suffice it to say that so far it is estimated that 10,000 persons have died and that of the 600,000 persons inhabiting the areas most affected by the storms, and who are deprived of their means of livelihood, more than 100,000 are homeless.\n4.\tTo see these figures in the right perspective, it is necessary to bear in mind that the total population of my country is less than 3 million.\n5.\tThe backbone of the economy of my country is broken; 85 per cent of the harvests of the main exports and consumption products have been destroyed and water covers and will continue to cover for some time what used to be the fertile fields that constituted the greatest wealth of my country, making it virtually impossible to restore them for a long time and in some cases causing irreparable damage.\n6.\tHonduras is essentially an agricultural and cattle raising country, and a very high percentage of the national production in these areas was concentrated in the affected region.\n7.\tAs though this was not sufficient mortally to wound a poor and small country, our industrial centers are located in the area of the greatest destruction and in many cases they will have to close down, while in other cases they will have at least to reduce the rate of their operations for a long time, thus aggravating the already high rate of unemployment.\n8.\tThe damages to the infrastructure -roads, bridges, railroads, power-lines, drinking water systems, port facilities and so on- are simply catastrophic. The effort required for reconstruction is still incalculable.\n9.\tPreliminary technical estimates set the losses at approximately $1,000 million. And this in a country whose gross national product is far below that amount.\n10.\tIn the face of the Honduran tragedy, the international community has demonstrated its solidarity and responded with alacrity. From the four corners of the world we have received contributions which have helped in meeting our enormous need for food, clothes, medicines and supplies. To all the nations and organizations which, in one way or another, have come to our assistance, I should like, on behalf of Honduras, to extend our profound and lasting gratitude.\n11.\tThe people and Government of Honduras are stoically doing all that is humanly possible, devoting all their efforts and resources and working 24 hours a day to meet the most urgent needs brought about by our tragedy. And we are unshakably resolute in facing the responsibility of reconstructing our wounded homeland with total devotion. Unfortunately, we understand that our own efforts, intensive as they may be, will not suffice and that we urgently need massive assistance on the part of all States of goodwill.\n12.\tThis is the reason for my presence on this forum. I am grateful for the special opportunity granted to me to address the Assembly. I come as the representative of a poor and proud people who need help. We have confidence in the international \\\"organizations and in the feelings of human solidarity of all nations and we hope that assistance will be speedy and generous. I am profoundly encouraged in that hope by the fact that the group of Latin American States has authorized me to tell you that it feels the tragedy afflicting Honduras as its own and as one of continental scope.\n13.\tGod's will, which puts us to the test, at the same time gives us strength to bear this test and the confidence that in the world there are sensitive people ready to extend a friendly hand to us. I appeal today to their consciences since in supreme moments of anguish and pain a wounded people can only offer its unshakable will to survive and its endless gratitude to those who accompany and assist it. \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I be permitted to express to you the sincere congratulations of the Government of the Republic of the Ivory Coast on your brilliant election to the prestigious post of President of the General Assembly. We are certain that you. will carry out the burdensome task entrusted to you with total success and that you will place your rich and great experience at the service of the world in general and of Africa in particular -our Africa, which is so much in need of genuine and lasting peace.\n60.\tWe would request the delegation of Honduras to transmit to its Government the sincere condolences of the Government of the Ivory Coast on the catastrophe which that country has recently suffered.\n61.\tInternational relations are characterized today by economic insecurity. The \\\"Yom Kippur war\\\" has revealed a process which goes largely beyond the framework of the conflict and has had serious repercussions upon the internal and external policies of our countries, repercussions which have to be brought under control.\n62.\tThe cause of galloping inflation lies not only in the rise of energy prices but in numerous factors of the world economy. The development and the extraordinary growth of the industrialized countries of Europe, America and Asia rested upon the progress of science and technology, but also upon a false illusion which is now beginning to be dispelled: the very low price of raw materials and the weakness and the poverty of the countries producing those materials. It is against this state of affairs that our countries are now fighting. And the petroleum- producing countries have demonstrated that this undertaking had meaning. Of course, it is indeed because the prevailing international situation left them with no other option that the well-off countries were obliged to accept what they claimed to be unacceptable, namely, a substantial increase in the price of the raw material which they could not do without petroleum.\n63.\tAnd we consider that the success achieved by the petroleum-producing countries is also our success; but we must be careful that it is properly co-ordinated with our fragile economies so that we can avoid being led to assume false positions. This success is a positive factor in the struggle for greater economic justice throughout the world.\n64.\tIndeed, under our eyes an extraordinarily important fact is being brought about. From now on, in the case of this product there is at least a reversal of trend: it is the end of the buyer's market and the beginning of the sellers market; it is the latter now who sets the price for his merchandise and no longer the buyer, as is still the case in the present structure of international trade. It is for this new state of affairs that we have been struggling for more than a decade with respect to all commodities. The action undertaken by the petroleum-producing countries must assist in the thorough transformation of the present world economic system, which provides for industrialized countries a prosperity that is largely founded upon the deterioration of the terms of trade, which in turn leaves a very small margin for maneuver with respect to our own development.\n65.\tThe institutions which typify the current economic order pass over an unbearable situation, because they make it possible for some to live upon the negation of others. Their transformation and the establishment of new economic relations will be difficult to anticipate as long as the countries of the third world have not admitted the essential need for union and solidarity.\n66.\tBut in the meantime, and since the balance of power is unfavorable to us, it is necessary for us to install within the present system a certain number of escape valves. The best and the most efficient, in our opinion, is the one which involves the establishment of associations of producers on a product-byproduct basis, with the participation and unqualified support of all of the victims of the existing economic system, even if some of them are able now to fix the price for their raw materials. That is the only way that would make it possible for us to stake a claim in the economic field and emerge from this role of marginal and rival micro-groups, and together find a common and effective response to the essential question of commodities.\n67.\tOf course, we do not intend to radicalize our positions. However, the continual impoverishment of our countries is becoming unbearable. It would truly be a catastrophe if the petroleum producers were to accept the position that their action should be dissociated from that of the remainder of the developing countries that produce raw materials and commodities. It is therefore important that following upon petroleum, which is an energy product of primary strategic importance, identical action be conducted with respect to other raw materials so that it might be possible to develop a policy that would be the reflection of a permanent and strengthened solidarity among the proletarian countries.\n68.\tThat solidarity must take concrete form. For that it is necessary for the developing countries to unite, but it is also and above all necessary for the richer among them to remain very close to the poorer and least fortunate among them so as not to neglect the fundamental influence of the political factors of solidarity.\n69.\tIn this respect we believe that an equitable and realistic solution for rearranging the world economic order that has been so strongly disturbed now would be the implementation of the close cooperation advocated in the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)].\n70.\tWe, the Members of the United Nations, must recognize that the slogans in our resolutions which frequently conceal our shortcomings must give way to pragmatic methods of approach to problems, because all, large and small, are living through the most disturbing economic adventure of our times. Together we can master the world economy, galloping inflation and the consequences of the energy crisis. Over and above all this there remains, in the case of each of us, a margin which may be opened to reciprocal concessions; otherwise, more than one of our leaders will have his sleep haunted by the nightmares brought on by the cries of the hungry.\n71.\tThe political future also remains gloomy. Indeed, since the Second World War our planet has never really known genuine peace. None of the conflicts shaking the world has been resolved. Those who are so skillful at producing these conflicts proceed to circumscribe them, to regionalize them and to localize them far from their own frontiers. In Viet Nam, in Cyprus and in the Middle East, we have been able to do nothing other than to accept an impasse in which we enclose ourselves more and more.\n72.\tIn Viet Nam men continue to die by the thousands and life remains unbearable for all as a result of the virulence and intolerance of irreconcilable ideologies which have confronted each other for more than a quarter of a century.\n73.\tIn southern Africa life continues to take the form of an injustice and a monstrous moral indignity, and the frailty of peace in that part of the world is quite obvious for all.\n74.\tIn the Middle East, the hope born of the Geneva Peace Conference is evaporating. The earlier situation of \\\"no peace, no war\\\" has reinstated itself. The ubiquity of the cannon merchants is again to be observed in the region. And the great ones are responsible for the infernal escalation of the arms race. It is even claimed that it is possible thereby to curb the inflation that is at present rampant throughout the world.\n75.\tThe Middle East constitutes one of the numerous impasses into which we have been led by the confrontation of the great Powers for more than a quarter of a century. Yet they all agreed to propose and vote in favor of resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947 which imposed the partition of Palestine.\n76.\tBut there is more. Twenty-one years later one of those great ones, a friend of the Arabs, declared again, on 18 November 1968, in Budapest:\n\\\"We consider that any acceptable solution in the Middle East must include recognition of the right of Israel to lead an independent national existence. This opinion is also shared by the Arabs.\\\"\n77.\tOne year, later, in chorus, on 20 September 1969, in a collective declaration made at United Nations Headquarters, those great Powers reaffirmed \\\"the right of the States of the region, all the States of the region, to exist\\\". At the same time they proclaimed with equal conviction \\\"the recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people\\\". And the whole of this imbroglio stems from Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, which, in order to avoid the eternal right of veto, was drafted in terms sufficiently equivocal to allow of as many contradictory interpretations as the oracle of Delphi.\n78.\tTruth to tell, no enigma exists. These declarations are made deliberately and at the cost of the grossest contradictions. We, in the Ivory Coast, are convinced that any peace strategy which may 5K devised will be doomed to failure if, setting aside fanatical formulas, it is not based on certain facts which flow from the analysis we have just made and which cannot be ignored.\n79.\tFirst, Arabs and Jews lived side by side in Palestine for centuries. Even if the latter were less numerous, one thing is evident: Christians, Jews and Muslims lived together in perfect .harmony and underwent foreign occupation.\n80.\tSecondly, there was a historic vote -but a vote with stories about it too - the General Assembly vote of 29 November 19473 by which the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian question, embodying the report of its Sub-Committee was adopted. That Sub-Committee included, among others, the United States and the Soviet Union. The result was a national home, a single one, for the Jews: Israel. Why? The chain of events, the complexity of the diplomacy Of the time, the dexterity of the actors of the time, lead the ivory Coast to stop here and not exhaust itself by looking for the responsibilities involved.\n81.\tThirdly, since then we have all been confronted directly by the rigorous and passionate violence of the men who created this conflict and by the violence which the conflict in turn brought about. Intermittent wars, short, but cruel and useless, in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, were sorry incidents of these events. The destruction of the State of Israel appears to be a mythical hypothesis since the four great Powers are unanimously in favor of guaranteeing the existence of that State.\n82.\tFourthly, the other inhabitants\u2014Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims and Christians -no longer have a fatherland, however. Yet our era has adapted itself rather well to the existence of divided countries: the two Germanys, the two Koreas, to mention only those. Thus it is no longer astonishing that the radicalization of Palestinian nationalism, which needs no further definition, is becoming frenetic and hortatory and that this struggle has become the governing element of the Middle East.\n83.\tFifthly, the return of the* territories occupied by Israel since, the six-day war will not resolve the problem of peace in the Middle East. The Palestinian problem antedated the six-day war.\n84.\tSixthly, the already complex problem will be further complicated if we continue to leave it at the level of the solidarity of all the Arabs against the solidarity of all the Jews, including those of the Diaspora throughout the world. Moreover, the problem is more a problem of the major Powers responsible for partition than an Israeli-Arab problem.\n85.\tIt is on the basis of the desire to know what must be known that we have recapitulated these facts. But, since everything is linked together, everything is interconnected, everything is there, the Ivory Coast asks your indulgence, your tolerance and your understanding, that of all of you in general and that of the great Powers in particular, in letting me present the position of my country on this crucial problem. In order to do this, the Ivory Coast will abide by the main constant features of its diplomacy.\nOUr country seeks neither to please nor to offend, to contribute with all its efforts to the pursuit of a just, equitable and durable peace in this part of the world which is so dear to the whole of mankind.\n86.\tThere is a saying current in my country: \\\"A man cannot hide the sun with his hand\\\". Thus, if the Jews of Palestine have a national home, Israel -and few today would seriously challenge this- the other Palestinians, the Christians and the Muslims remain without a fatherland. Therefore we must recognize that they are no longer simple refugees: they constitute an organized community. And there will be no peace in the Middle East as long as that community has not found its fatherland.\n87.\tWhat can I tell you, the great ones of this world, if not that you must have the honesty to recognize your errors and to correct them, instead of continuing in them, as you are doing now, to the misfortune of the whole world?\n88.\tIn this region you only want to avoid a fierce confrontation among yourselves. Your concern is to  principle and your interests at each base of the development of the situation. Your interventions are based more on the appropriateness possible control of the Mediterranean than on the step for genuine peace. Indeed, constantly to reaffirm legitimate rights of the Palestinian people without applying legitimate rights is\ndeliberately to turn your back on peace. Gentlemen, see to it that the Palestinians recover their part of Palestine, which you partitioned, and you will save world peace. Then you will also be bringing about the conditions necessary for a fruitful dialog between Israelis and Palestinians and our hopes for fruitful co-operation between the enemy cousins will be realized. Meanwhile, if we do not do this, we shall be setting out on a course of no return which, because of the ebb and flow of the situation, will slip out of our control.\n89.\tThe same drama, born of the mania for partition imposed by the political psychology of power, is also being played out in the same area in the case of Cyprus. The crisis through which the Republic of Cyprus is at present passing derives its origin from a fear felt in common by both the Greek and Turkish communities: the fear that the island will be attached to Greece, that it will be partitioned, that there will be intervention at any moment on the part of one or another of the guarantor Powers in the internal affairs of the country. Perhaps in place of these so-called treaties of guarantee, which are inadmissible for a sovereign State and which add to the confusion, it might be possible to write into the constitution of Cyprus the principle of the inalienability of any part of the territory of the Republic, a clause that appears in all of our constitutions.\n90.\tBe that as it may, the right of intervention which Great Britain, Turkey and Greece have arrogated to themselves is unacceptable, not only for Cyprus, a sovereign State, but also for the United Nations. It infringes on the fundamental principle of the Charter. Used as it has been used, it will result in a guerrilla-type resistance internally and, externally, will bring about reactions with unforeseeable and incalculable consequences for the island and for the entire world as well. Thus, we must not become accomplices in this sense of global power that is felt by each of these States, this desire to impose on another State Member of this Organization its way of life. We must rid Cyprus of its tunic of Nessus, that truly lethal garment represented by those treaties.\n91.\tFor 10 years Cyprus remained s able. Archbishop Makarios, with his keen sense of national and international political realities, succeeded in remaining the guarantee for the genuine independence of the island. In Cyprus, the praiseworthy goal he pursued was the establishment of a system of integration of the two communities within a unitary State, one in which authentic democratic procedures would guarantee, without discrimination, the totaT safeguarding of individual rights. But the Republic of Cyprus is a victim of the redistribution of realities in this complex game of chess that is being played in the Mediterranean. Must we admit the necessity for violence in the taking of power? We do not think so. And that is exactly why we reproach the advocates of the theory of \\\"necessary revolutionary violence\\\". Such a climate is dangerous and offers no guarantee for anyone.\n92.\tAll those -instigators, actors or accomplices- for whom the coup d'etat has become an institution that is an end in itself, bear a grave responsibility in this deadly and immoral provocation. They have on their consciences thousands of innocent dead and the despair of tens of thousands of refugees.\n93.\tWe proclaim once again that force must net prevail and must not count as a paying proposition. In this tragic Cyprus affair that causes us so much concern, we believe that we must entrust the requisite powers to the Secretary-General for the purpose of achieving the evacuation of foreign troops. After that, we must attempt to reconcile two necessities: that of compromise between the parties, and that of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus, in the absence of which we shall be consolidating a state of permanent insurrection that would result in a turmoil that would postpone for ever any peace in the region and pose a terrible danger to peace throughout the world.\n94.\tIn sustaining this position, we shall be loyal to our ideal which rejects discrimination in all its forms. Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, Christians, Muslims, Jews, blacks, whites or yellows\u2014we shall never accept any classification of human beings on this abominable basis. We must help to bring about the birth of a national pan-Cypriot feeling.\n95.\tIt is because we are convinced of our anti-racist position that we reject the policy of apartheid in South Africa and that of the illegal regime of Ian Smith, together with all other forms of racial discrimination in the world.\n96.\tThe physicist Jean Debiesse is right in affirming, with mathematical proof, that racism is all the more stupid in that we are all, absolutely all of us, of the same blood. One can laugh at this demonstration; some will because they are skeptics, others because they are believers and regard this as a truism, a truth already affirmed by the revealed religions. And yet it is these latter who are fighting in Cyprus, in Ireland, in the Middle East, and who, in the name of religion, practice apartheid in South Africa.\n97.\tThe economic future is gloomy. The political future is likewise gloomy. But there is a ray of hope that has appeared. The right to self-determination and independence has been recognized in the case of the Territories under Portuguese domination. This phenomenon is quite different from the cases, so frequent in politics, where happenstance finally becomes reality. At the 1253rd meeting of the Security Council, held on 8 November 1965, the Ivory Coast expressed its conviction that arms would never prevail against what that old man in Cabinda called \\\"novas ideas\\\" (new ideas).\n98.\tWe had to touch the sensitive heartstrings of Portugal and bring it to reason. What nation, however fierce it may be, cannot be brought over to political virtue and reasonable human feelings? The right of peoples to govern themselves is the foundation of all civilization, and the winds of nationalism blowing through Africa are a feature of that genuine civilization. Thus, progressively, thanks to the action of all, the idea of liberty has won Portugal over. Portugal is to be credited with having found realistic truth, most fortunately, by coming closer to reality with us, and it is for that reason that we are most gratified at the important decisions that have recently been taken by the new Portuguese Government to grant independence to all its Territories. Africa is seeking neither revenge nor retribution, and the independence granted will make it possible for Portugal's presence in our continent to be fraternal, adopted, accepted and desired.\n99.\tWe celebrate the independence of Guinea- Bissau. This new nation, and those that will yet accede to independence, are and will be Members of this Organization. They represent its future and what it will become. Our financial and technical assistance will be essential to them for binding up the wounds they have incurred in their struggle and for establishing themselves as independent and viable countries. To that end, we propose the establishment of a fund, through voluntary contributions made by States Members of the Organization and by all countries that have recognized or that will recognize them. The precedent already exists and can be repeated in their favor.\n100.\tI would not wish to conclude without addressing, on behalf of my country, our most heartfelt congratulations to the gallant people of Guinea- Bissau and its courageous freedom fighters, nor without respectfully - and devotedly saluting the memory of the one who gave his life for the liberation of his people, Amilcar Cabral.\n101.\tI would also wish to pay a special tribute to President Leopold Sedar Senghor of Senegal, who made discreet use of dialog so much maligned to complete the freedom fight, thus confirming the virtues of dialog.\n102.\tThe new Portugal has realized that the time of colonialism is over. It has shown itself strong enough to make a fresh start. We believe it deserves our congratulations and encouragement.\n103.\tThe settlers in Mozambique sought to distract the decolonizing forces of Portugal. They mutinied. They machine-gunned the African quarters at random and left almost 100 dead behind them. That scenario is a well-known trap, filled with rancor and tragic reminiscence, which always turns against its authors. Those settlers do not, understand that the phenomenon which they are experiencing results not from the abandonment by metropolitan countries of their empires but from the irrepressible force of nationalism. Nothing justified that Lourengo Marques crime, which brought them to absurdity. The nationalists have shown as much sang-froid as realism in the face of the obsessed hatred of the settlers.\n104.\tThe Frente de Libertao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] advocated a harmonious and democratic multiracial nation. All it received by way of reply was a show of chauvinistic fanaticism from petty settlers who are part of the aberrant designs of world colonialism.\n105.\tThe continuing and unavoidable disaster of colonialism in all its forms is so eloquent that it would not have been necessary for us to dwell upon its last throes if it were not significant to note that the supercilious chauvinism of those settlers and their frenetic colonialism, feeding on the fantasy of the past, might lead them to a dead end, an ill-conceived escalation, a bluff as in the case of the Organization de l'armee secrete [OAS] in Algeria with the sorry consequences of an exodus without return. But we have every confidence in the great wisdom of FRELIMO, which will not allow itself to be drawn into devastating hatred.\n106.\tWe shall continue to applaud Portuguese decolonization. The arrival of General Spinola has brought about important changes in our relations with Portugal. We are ready to establish proper diplomatic relations with that henceforth friendly country.\n107.\tBefore Spinola, de Gaulle, too, experienced a similar situation during the process of the decolonization of Algeria the OAS. Unfortunately, colonization abounds with such retrograde minds, just as imbued with a somewhat faded imperial elegance as those of the Mozambique settlers. De Gaulle settled his problems with the honor of the great soldier having the creed of the pledged word and a clear vision of the future. We note which satisfaction the statement of the French Minister for Foreign Affairs relating to the forthcoming accession to independence of the Comoro Archipelago [2238th meeting], a declaration which is part of the noble traditions of France.\n108.\tThe Lusaka agreements cannot and must not be called into question, and to prevent this all precautions must be taken so that those anarchists, those camouflage racists and they are prolific in that region shall not play the role of termites in the works of the institutions born of Lusaka.\n109.\tGeneral Spinola has already shown proper understanding of the goals of the Organization. We have made the necessary distinction between the former leaders and those who today have courageously and resolutely embarked upon the course of democracy and decolonization. We look with considerable sympathy on their efforts and we are ready to help them, if necessary, to break the dark forces which are still prevalent among them and in Africa seeking to block the accession to independence of Mozambique, Angola and the Cape Verde Islands.\n110.\tThe United Nations must, without locking itself into a complacent alibi \\\"internal affairs\\\" help Portugal in crushing the last depraved advocates of colonialism so that they will for all time lose their last illusions.\n111.\tIn spite of the very legitimate complaints against South Africa, it is nevertheless fair to recognize that its refusal to be mixed up in the affairs of Mozambique and Angola now makes impossible the establishment of a new Rhodesia in Southern Africa. Let us hope that, on the basis of the Portuguese example, South Africa will show an equal comprehension vis-a-vis the United Nations and grant independence to Namibia.\n112.\tMr. President, it is truly symbolic that it is under your presidency the presidency of one of the gallant sons of Algeria that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples is thus being implemented.\n113.\tWe ask Bangladesh and Grenada to accept our warm congratulations. May we, after Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau, soon see Mozambique, Angola, the other Portuguese Territories and the Comoros assume their rightful place among us, while we await with impatience, as you know, the arrival of Zimbabwe and Namibia.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me first to join the previous speakers in congratulating you on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. I have the pleasure also to bring to you and, through you, to the Assembly the greetings of my President His Excellency Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, who is a distinguished fighter for freedom and justice in the continent of Africa, and also of the Government and the people of Kenya. He, like the leaders and the people of your country, found after many years of reasoning and logical debate that the freedom of a people could not be recovered from colonialists peacefully. Your country and mine have a lot in common, and we therefore share the pleasure of your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. In conferring this high office on you and on Algeria, the General Assembly has manifested its confidence in your wisdom and distinguished qualities of leadership and experience. This year's agenda is heavy and the whole session is bound to produce developments with far- reaching consequences for the future. This is why we feel that a heavy burden is placed on your shoulders, and, therefore, my delegation will fully co-operate with you and give you all support possible in order not to make that burden heavier than it already is.\n2.\tMay I also take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, the Permanent Representative of Ecuador to the United Nations, for the able, dedicated and forthright manner in which he guided the affairs of the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly. The success of the two sessions in no small measure depended on Mr. Benites.\n3.\tIt is also fitting that I should pay tribute to the Secretary-General and the staff of the United Nations for the good work they have done in the past year.\nThe organization of the sixth special session and the efforts made to deal with the crises in the Middle East and Cyprus, in addition to the normal schedule, must have added extra demands on the Secretary- General and his staff. They all deserve our thanks and commendation.\n4.\tIt is my pleasure to salute and welcome in our midst, on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Kenya, the three new Members, namely, the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. My country has many affinities with these new nations. It has been Kenya's special pleasure heartily to subscribe to the Security Council's recommendations for their admission to United Nations membership. This is a major step towards the goal of the universality of the United Nations.\n5.\tGuinea-Bissau deserves particular mention for its heroic struggle for independence and freedom, which ultimately had the result of liberating the peoples of metropolitan Portugal and setting the stage for what is happening now. We urge the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as well as individual Member States, to give Guinea-Bissau all the assistance possible in its effort of national reconstruction.\n6.\tThis year the General Assembly is meeting in changed circumstances with regard to the decolonization question. We have noted with satisfaction the attitude of the new Portuguese Government towards the evil of colonialism. What has taken place in Africa in the last few months leads us to believe that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of colonialism in that long abused continent. The new Government of Portugal deserves congratulations for what it has achieved so far and encouragement and support to complete, in the next few months, the task it has embarked upon. A delay may damage the good work and give the forces of exploitation and oppression a chance to show their ugly head again.\n7.\tThe irony of the situation facing Africa today is that, on the one hand, independence is on the horizon in respect of the Portuguese-occupied Territories, but, on the other hand, racist minority regimes still ruthlessly, blindly and fearfully entrench themselves in the belief that the misguided systems they champion have a future in Africa. That is the case with the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. !n that colony the rebel regime continues with impunity and glaring defiance to uproot, herd and displace the African population and forcibly to take their remaining lands, pass discriminatory legislation and faithfully and blindly copy South African crimes of apartheid.\n8.\tThese extreme measures of folly are blindly undertaken contrary to enlightened public opinion within and outside that Territory and in utter disregard of the norms of a civilized international community. The rebellious clique which champions the so-called independence in Southern Rhodesia should not delude itself. Those who have sustained that rebellion are to blame for the unpleasant consequences that their misdeeds will unleash in that part of Africa. The combination of support from the South African regime guilty of the crime of apartheid and other well-known nations is worthy of condemnation by all peace-loving nations of the world.\n9.\tMy delegation is pained that key nations with which Kenya enjoys valuable international co-operation in trade, commerce and political and economic relations are so deeply involved in the affairs of such widely unacceptable regimes. We call on them to support the United Nations in its endeavors to rehabilitate Southern Rhodesia and South Africa.\n10.\tI wish to reiterate that my delegation is firmly of the following views. First, the United Kingdom remains the administering Power of that colony of Southern Rhodesia and must, by word and deed, exercise that power to stop the South African regime from slowly annexing that colony. Secondly, the principle of \\\"no independence before majority rule\\\" should be adhered to before a change in the status of the colony is effected. Thirdly, the African leaders and all political detainees must be released immediately and consulted before the eventual formation of a Government representing the majority of the peoples of Zimbabwe. Fourthly, all Member States of the United Nations should apply mandatory sanctions, as called for by the Security Council. At present, many Member States either openly support the breach of sanctions, as is the case with some known States, including those which initially called for them as an alternative to the use of force to quell the rebellion, or plead all manner of excuses as to why the sanctions cannot be enforced.\n11.\tA dangerous situation persists in the southern part of the African continent, one that has been under the consideration of the United Nations since its inception. We have the oppressive, imperialist and expansionist regime of South Africa, armed to the hilt by its known collaborators, expending untold resources on arms from some well-known Member nations of the Organization. That regime is still scornfully occupying the United Nations Trust Territory of Namibia, in defiance of law and reason. It is extending its tentacles to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, for purposes both of security and of economic and political expansion. The recent rail link between Southern Rhodesia and South Africa has the obvious effect of integrating the two regimes economically and evading the United Nations sanctions imposed on the colony of Southern Rhodesia. Internally, the regime is tightening its ruthless grip on the indigenous peoples, who are stripped of all human dignity and human rights and used as profit-production machines to fill the coffers of the interests currently brazenly defying the United Nations sanctions against the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.\n12.\tIn such circumstances of oppression, defiance and expansion and veiled discouragement of decolonization in southern Africa, the African States and the international community are in duty bound to review the implications of the arms buildup there. We have urged all nations that value human life to halt their sale of arms to South Africa, and to cooperate with the United Nations in taking corrective action by terminating commercial, diplomatic and consular relations with that country.\n13.\tThe voice of reason has gone unheeded. Many well-known nations from all corners of the earth not only continue to expand their financial and other relations with South Africa but also sell armaments to that country, which has continued to defy the United Nations with regard to Namibia and Southern Rhodesia. In our view, the time has come for the rest of Africa to pose the question? who indeed is a friend of Africa? Has the time not come for the African countries to shape their destiny in the light of the general interests they all share with the other Members of the international community? Is it not time that they chose either us or those regimes? These are legitimate questions to raise in the General Assembly for all to ponder.\n14.\tSome Powers distinguish between arms for external defense and arms for internal defense. This is a meaningless distinction, in terms of the peace and security of the African continent. Such devious ways of avoiding their duties to the international community are not, however, confined to the sale of arms. In the field of trade, parent companies in many well- known countries have been giving franchises to local companies. Can anybody doubt that the profits derived from such transactions reach those countries that are at the forefront in denying that they have dealings With Southern Africa?\n15.\tAs I have already stated, the time is ripe for us in Africa to know, through deeds and not through empty words, who are the friends of Africa. Indeed, my delegation will spare no effort directed towards the removal of the delinquent racist regime of South Africa from the community of civilized nations. I must quickly add, however, that the primary aim of any international action should be to correct and rehabilitate South Africa, since we adhere to the principle of the universality of the United Nations.\n16.\tEvery nation, large or small, has the right to expect to live in peace and security. To every nation, therefore, the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security are of paramount importance. The small nations may not have a button to push to destroy the entire human race; but, if they are not at peace with one another, the threat to international peace and security is just as real, since, in the event of conflict, each nation has friends and enemies. The maintenance of international peace is therefore of cardinal importance to all, and is not the exclusive preserve of one or two mighty nations.\n17.\tDespite the avowed intentions of all Member States to preserve peace and security, in the last few months the world community has been shocked: we witnessed in the middle of July an overt attempt to destroy by force of arms a Member of this Organization. I refer to the attempt by some Members of this Organization to destroy by force of arms the Republic of Cyprus, a non-aligned country whose makeup and history show many parallels with Kenya's, and with which Kenya has maintained close relations for many years.\n18.\tIn dealing with the problem of Cyprus, my delegation takes as a starting-point the fact that Cyprus exists as an independent, sovereign and full Member of the United Nations. We are happy to note that the Security Council has unanimously affirmed this [resolution 353 (1974)]. We believe that Cyprus will be assisted if all Member States respect its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n19.\tThe problem of Cyprus is made to appear complex. However, at the root of it all is the fact that the people of Cyprus have not been given a chance to develop a sense of nationhood. They have been encouraged by external forces to accentuate their differences rather than to harmonize their common interests. We believe, therefore, that the first and cardinal step towards the solving of the Cyprus problem is non-interference by outsiders. I note in this regard that the Security Council has called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the island [ibid.]. This is a basic requirement. We are confident that, encouraged by the international community, the Cypriot people will be capable of discussing their problems and solving them.\n20.\tMy delegation is aware of the territorial claims to parts of Cyprus made by outsiders. We are also aware of the treaties or guarantees imposed on Cyprus by the agreements of Zurich and Geneva of 1960 and would like to reiterate that we consider those Treaties to be inequitable and one of the underlying causes of the present crisis in Cyprus. We were doubtful of the sustained ability of those Treaties to form the basis of negotiations for the return of peace and constitutional government in Cyprus. Kenya was among the first countries to call for a more direct participation of the United Nations in assisting the Republic of Cyprus to solve its problems. We believe the communities should be encouraged to have more direct talks under the auspices of the United Nations, and that nothing that would aggravate the already delicate situation should be done in order to avoid the possibility of renewed hostilities that would lead to further loss of life. We are confident that with the support of the United Nations the problem of Cyprus will be solved.\n21.\tOne other area that continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security is the Middle East. This year, we meet hopefully in happier circumstances than was the case a year ago. A shooting war erupted then in that unhappy region. The Assembly and the Security Council were put under severe pressure. Fortunately, the joint efforts of all Member States, and especially those directly concerned, prevented the situation from becoming a major world disaster. A framework of negotiations to normalize the situation and to bring about a just and lasting peace was born.\n22.\tOver the past 10 months, the international community has witnessed slow but positive signs of the will of the nations in that region to achieve peace. The disengagement agreements and the talks in Geneva are a welcome development. Kenya hopes that the experience gained over these months will not have been in vain. Rather, it will give the momentum required to intensify the search for ways and means of settling the outstanding problems on the basis of law, justice and mutual respect. Kenya believes that for a lasting peace the implementation of the following principles is essential: first, the recognition by all the States in the region of the right of each State to exist in conditions of peace and security; secondly, the recognition that the acquisition of territory by force of arms is inadmissible, and thirdly, the recognition that the rights of the displaced people of the area should under no circumstances be abused, overlooked, sacrificed or minimized, and it is for this reason that we consider that all the people and parties concerned in the problem of the area should be consulted and should participate in any discussions designed to produce a permanent solution.\n23.\tRecent developments in the arms buildup cause some concern. They pose the question as to their intention. Is this buildup to strengthen international peace and security or is it intended to threaten peace and security? A comparison of the resources employed by many nations in the military buildup and in the social services paints a hopelessly lopsided picture. Over half the national resources are consumed in military arsenals. Yet, populations go without food, without education, without employment, without proper and adequate housing, to mention but a few social amenities. If the goals and principles enshrined in the Charter are to be achieved, then nations must take collective and individual acts to limit this dangerous buildup.\n24.\tKenya is committed to the ideals of peace and friendly relations with all nations. Kenya realizes that in order to meet the many challenging social, economic and political developments, a climate of tranquility in international relations is basic. It is for this reason that my delegation will encourage and support all moves towards achieving the ideals of disarmament.\n25.\tOur commitment to peace and security leads us to refer to the situation in the Indian Ocean. This ocean is neighbored by an overwhelming number of small States whose basic goal remains peace and security. The increased appearance of the naval fleets of certain nations not famed for their love of peace causes general disquiet in the area. The competition between them in an area that is desirous of peace poses a serious threat to the survival of the nations of the area. Recent events in other parts of the world cannot but convince us that the presence of these fleets in our area constitutes a veiled threat to the independence of the small nations in that area.\n26.\tWe cannot fail to realize that, in the event of tension between these Powers in the area, many of the African States on the eastern seaboard would be paralyzed. We have a crucial stake in the peaceful state of the ocean. Kenya urges all without exception to support the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean.\n27.\tAlthough on balance the situation regarding peace and security has been unsatisfactory, there have been some encouraging developments in the Organization during the current year. One of the most welcome of these developments is the conclusion of the work of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression [see AI9619 and Corr.l]. All the members of the Special Committee, and particularly its Chairman and Rapporteur, deserve our congratulations for managing to conclude the work of defining \\\"aggression\\\", which has eluded the international community for the last 50 years. Although far from perfect, we believe that the definition that has been achieved will go a long way towards deterring potential aggressors and would assist the Security Council in its difficult task of determining the \\\"existence of any threat to peace, breach of peace or act of aggression\\\" as required by Article 39 of the Charter of the United Nations.\n28.\tWhile the definition by itself will not end aggression, we believe that States will now have a yard-stick applicable to all Members of the Organization, big or small. While my delegation is not entirely happy with the provisions of the definition, we are well aware that it has been the result of a compromise. We shall, nevertheless, be able to support it as it stands in the hope that the General Assembly will be able to adopt it.\n29.\tAs we are assembled here, the international economic situation is the one most serious problem exercising the minds of the majority of the world community. The international economic problems created by the 1971-1972 balance-of-payments upheavals, the problem of galloping inflation and the problems precipitated by oil questions remain unsolved. As for us in Africa, the impact of these international problems has been even further compounded by the very real problems of drought, food shortages and desertification, thus presenting us with an eve l more ominous picture for the future.\n30.\tAlthough it is true that economic problems and especially inflationary forces are rampant all over the world, it is important that the world community not lose sight of the fact that the ones who have been hit hardest by the recent international economic ailments are the peoples of the developing countries.\n31.\tAt the bottom of our problems has, of course, been the continued and acutely unfavorable trend in our terms of trade. The prices of our essential imports of manufactured goods have been increasing year after year in the wake of the inflationary processes domestically generated in the industrialized countries. On the other hand, the price our exports and of primary sources of development finance have been either stagnant or declining. We have raised this particular issue at numerous international meetings over and over again during the last decade and will continue to do so in the hope that the world community will one day address itself to the problem. The problem is the unrealistic prices of raw materials in relation to the price of manufactured products.\n32.\tThe economic interdependence of the present world has been more than underscored by the events of the last 12 months. The trade or monetary policies followed by individual or groups of Governments to deal with their economic, social or political problems can now no longer be ignored by the rest of the world community. The convening of the sixth special session of the General Assembly last April was a belated but very welcome manifestation of the international recognition of this very basic fact of our times.\n33.\tAs for us, the developing countries, the convening of the session and the subsequent adoption of the two milestone resolutions the Declaration on the\nEstablishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)], in which the world community solemnly proclaimed its united determination to work urgently towards that goal, and the Pro-gramme of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)]- were seen as the advent of a new era of genuine economic co-operation with the rest of the world for the good of all. We very much welcomed the Program of Action especially in the fields of trade liberalization, inter-national monetary reforms, food and fertilizer production, transfer of technology, industrialization and flow of development finance.\n34.\tUnfortunately, and it is. a matter of deep concern and disappointment to us, we have over the last few months been progressively confronted with vigorous efforts aimed at either frustrating or altogether preventing the implementation of that very pivotal Program of Action. We are well aware of the fact that certain nations did express reservations after General Assembly resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) had been adopted. We accept their sovereign right to enter those reservations. But we do not accept those reservations as being of such importance as to nullify the decisions taken by the world community last April.\n35.\tWe appeal to those nations to re-examine once again their declared positions. The realities of our economic interdependence in the trade and monetary fields have already entrenched us in an era where we can no longer post-pone the development and implementation of new concepts, new options and an entirely new range of ground rules with which to tackle our current and progressively 'increasing economic predicaments. We are all collectively responsible for our common destiny, and it is therefore imperative that we make a more positive effort to perceive our interdependence and common destiny in a more en-lightened perspective. A civilization that guarantees enough food and drink and shelter to only a third of its people cannot survive.\n36.\tDuring this session, food, or rather the lack of it, has been uppermost in the program of many Member States. Kenya will make its modest contribution towards the solving of this problem during the World Food Conference in November. Africa, which suffered from severe droughts last year, droughts that brought untold misery to many in the continent, cannot forget the lessons learned from that tragedy. We are thankful for the massive aid that poured in from all over the world, co-ordinated by th.e United Nations. As the lessons of that tragedy showed, Africa needs more than the ad hoc massive drops of food in the affected area. Africa, like most of the other developing areas, has sufficient rich productive soil. What it lacks is technology and resources to revolutionize its subsistence agriculture. Kenya, therefore, hopes that the developed countries will, during the Conference in November, in billing to consider the possible transfer of correct technology and make enough resources available to the developing countries so that they can achieve the aims of the Conference enough food for each person in the world in the shortest possible time.\n37.\tThe oil crisis concerns the entire international community. But, as I have stated earlier with regard to the general world economic situation, it is the small countries, like my own, that have been hit the hardest. The price increases have disrupted the development plans of many countries and, if not checked, could well result in total collapse of the economies of those countries. The solution to the oil crisis, therefore, is not of interest to the major consumers and producers alone, but to all of us. It is for this reason that we favor the solution of the problem within the context of the United. Nations. We believe that the collective responsibility in solving this crisis correctly falls under Article 56 of the Charter.\n38.\tThe first step towards the global approach to the solution of the oil crisis is not to indulge so much in apportioning blame. We cannot gain anything by distributing blame when the crisis continues to grow worse. What we need is for the oil-producing countries and the corporations that deal in oil to get together with the oil consumers under the auspice? of the Organization to formulate ways and means of solving the crisis urgently. The most dangerous way of handling this oil crisis is to do nothing now thus leaving all the parties to seek their salvation by hurting others. In the end we shall all be losers.\n39.\tIn order that the Organization could adequately assist Member States in solving the energy crisis, it is essential that new approaches and machinery be established within the system. We call, therefore, as an initial step, for the strengthening of the section which deals with energy in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. This would put the Organization in line, indeed make the Organization take the lead, in what is already happening at the national level.\n40.\tThe second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was held at Caracas. I should like to take this opportunity to express the gratitude of my delegation to the Government and the people of Venezuela for the excellent arrangements they made to host the Conference which, as many have remarked, was the largest international Conference ever held. The fact that no final results were achieved should not in any way detract from the importance of the Conference and particularly of that session. A lot of progress, on which the successful conclusion of the immense task depends, has already been made at Caracas. The general debate on all the issues has been finalized. Concrete proposals on all the items are now before the Conference. What remains now is serious and business-like negotiations by all States with a view to harmonizing different positions and ai living at a generally acceptable convention.\n41.\tI should like, however, to point out that we from the developing countries cannot afford the leisure of continuing these negotiations indefinitely. The Confer-ence heavily taxed our financial and manpower re-sources. We are determined t'.iat the next session of the Conference, scheduled for March to May 1975, should be the final one. Though a great deal of work remains to be done, we are convinced that with good will and a serious negotiating spirit, the Conference can bring its work to a successful conclusion.\n42.\tWe would be prepared to support a final ceremonial session. We shall not be willing, however, to support an endless series of sessions while some of the States represented engage in what appears to be a filibuster designed to block all efforts at changing the existing status quo on the exploration and exploitation of the wealth of the sea, which favors a few developed countries at the expense of everyone else. Changes inevitably are going to come. It is up to all the States represented to engage in a serious dialog in order to ensure that the changes will be equitable and fair to all; otherwise the changes may have to come from the unilateral action of States, which can lead only to further confusion in this field and will continue to be a dangerous source of international conflicts. The Kenya delegation will not be found wanting in making determined efforts to arrive at a generally acceptable convention during the forthcoming session of the Conference and we hope that all other States will co-operate in a similar spirit.\n43.\tThe whole world has been shocked and grieved at the terrible disaster that has afflicted Honduras, and, only yesterday, Peru, countries which have very close ties with my own country. On behalf of the Government and the people of Kenya, I convey our deep sympathies to the Government and the peoples of Honduras and Peru. These disasters underline once again the necessity for a more vigorous approach by the international community to the problem of emergency assistance in cases of disaster. Developing countries have been continuously at the mercy of natural disasters because they lack adequate machinery for pre-disaster warning or the means to combat disasters when they occur. We urge the speed-up of programs to train personnel from developing countries for pre-disaster warning, and the strengthening of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordination, so that loss of life and property can be minimized.\n44.\tThe events of the last few years, more so the events of the last 12 months, have shown how inter-dependent the international community has become. No longer can States sit back and say of an event happening in another part of the world, \\\"It does not concern us.\\\" Technology has brought us so close to one another, yet paradoxically, old attitudes and prejudices have not disappeared. The pursuit of narrow national interests at the expense of wider international interests has at times brought the world to the brink of war. Rigid adherence to instructions has stifled constructive discussion in international forums.\n45.\tDespite all these shortcomings, Kenya has faith in the United Nations. We hope that Member States will take appropriate actions to see that the structure and the orientation of the Organization encourage more harmony and co-operation for the benefit of all man-kind. Kenya, for its part, will continue to make its modest contribution in this direction.\n"

        "file_text": "I am very happy to be able to associate myself with the previous speakers from this rostrum in conveying to the President, Mr. Bouteflika, my warmest congratulations on his unanimous election to the Presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Under his impartial direction and because of his distinguished statesmanlike qualities, our debates will certainly be conducted in the necessary atmosphere of tranquility, thus enabling the Assembly at the present session to achieve its objective of bringing peace and stability to the world in keeping with the role of the Organization.\n3.\tI should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose tireless efforts for peace are familiar to everyone.\n4.\tIt is a particular pleasure for me to be able to repeat our feelings of profound admiration for Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who conducted our proceedings last year with such efficiency, such tried competence and total impartiality. His long experience in the United Nations and his warm-hardheartedness guaranteed the success of the work of the twenty-eighth session and the work of the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n5.\tFaithful to the principle of universality of the Organization, and thereby faithful to our fundamental policy of maintaining friendly relations with all countries without any distinction as to regime or political ideology, my Government is happy to welcome the three countries just admitted to membership in the United Nations\u2014Grenada, Bangladesh and Guinea- Bissau.\n6.\tI am sure that you will permit me, as Prime Minister of the Khmer Republic, to deal exclusively today with a question which for me and for all the Khmer people is one of the highest priority, that of the representation of Cambodia in the United Nations.\n7.\tA draft resolution introduced last year by 33 nations asks the Assembly\n\\\"to restore the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations, recognizing its representatives as the sole lawful representatives of Cambodia, and to expel the representatives of the Lon Nol group from the seat they illegally occupy in the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.\\\"1\n8.\tThis draft resolution, which was not considered at the last session, will soon be discussed here. What the sponsors of the draft resolution in derogatory terms call \\\"the Lon Nol group\\\" is the Government of the Khmer Republic, which in 1970 succeeded what was then the Royal Government as a fully fledged Member of the United Nations, and, as everyone will acknowledge, it has fully complied with all the obligations of membership.\n9.\tAs we approach a debate unique in the annals of the Organization, a debate which may have incalculable consequences with regard to the credibility of the Organization and to the subsequent fate of other Member States, the Republican Government considers it its duty to draw the attention of all nations of good will to the extreme gravity of the decision which the Assembly will soon have to take.\n10.\tIndeed, never has a State, because it has changed its regime something which is a purely domestic affair seen its representation in the United Nations come up for discussion. In recent years in fact, in the last 12 months regimes hitherto considered as legitimate have collapsed under the pressure of the people or of the army. Who in this Assembly has asked that representatives of new regimes be kept outside the United Nations and that representatives of outgoing regimes should be kept on or called back?\n11.\tThere are many Members of the United Nations, in all parts of the world, which have to confront attempts at armed subversion whose main instigators are living abroad. This is the case, in particular, of some of the sponsors of the draft resolution sponsored by 33 countries, which calls for the expulsion from the United Nations of the Khmer Republic. This is also the case of a number of other Governments which, having \nrecognized for many different reasons that we shall examine later the so-called \\\"Royal Government of Cambodia\\\", feel obliged to promote its entry into the Organization.\n12.\tDo not the regimes which have taken this position realize that the precedent they are about to create may one day be used against them? If the United Nations were to reject a regime which, like ours, is in control of its capital, all the major and medium-sized towns, most of the economically important regions and much more than three fourths of the population of the country and this for more than four years, in spite of all the pessimistic forecasts made out of malice or misinformation by the self-styled specialists then what regime, I ask, even among those that criticize us, could be sure that, if in its turn it had to combat a substantial attempt at subversion, some heterogeneous coalition favorable to its enemies would not one day exclude it from the United Nations?\n13.\tWould it not be playing with fire to deal such a blow to a Government which has been defending itself with ever-growing success against an unprovoked aggression and which is doing everything in its power, politically and diplomatically, to restore peace at home?\n14.\tThere has been no lack of warnings to this effect in the Assembly, the most significant perhaps coming from nations of South Asia, which understand the problems of the Khmer Republic better than most. All these friendly neighboring countries have urged their colleagues not to try to impose a Government in exile on a State. To act in this way, they have argued, would be to jeopardize the very structure of the United Nations.\n15.\tThe reference made by these Powers to a Government in exile is perfectly valid in so far as concerns the so-called \\\"Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia\\\". It is true that a certain number of Khmer Marxist leaders, although in 1970 they were in the anti-Sihanouk camp, obtained without any difficulty from the deposed Prince, who was anxious for vengeance, the title of \\\"Minister\\\", and are living somewhere in Cambodian territory, in the shelter of the forests and moving around constantly in order to avoid discovery. Yet they have nothing more to fear than our very small national air force. They claim, in order to explain the absence of any fixed residence, that only Phnom Penh would be an appropriate capital for them. But perhaps to make an impression on the United Nations, they may very soon decide to set themselves up in a provisional capital which they will proceed to abandon as soon as the debate is over.\n16.\tThe so-called Royal Government cannot, for all that, avoid being described as a Government in exile, since its top leaders at least according to their titles continue to reside outside national territory. First and foremost, this is the case with its \\\"head of State\\\", Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who has been in Peking for over four years; in spite of his representations and claims, the Khmer Marxists have been obstinately refusing him the right to return and live permanently in his own country. This is also the case with its \\\"Prime Minister\\\", Mr. Penn Nouth, who, in order to explain why he is staying in the Chinese capital, is invoking \\\"reasons of health\\\". This is also the case with its \\\"Foreign Minister\\\", Mr. Sarinn Chhak, and also the \\\"Minister of State for Special Affairs\\\", Mr. Chau Seng, and some others, who have never set foot in Cambodia since 1970.\n17.\tYou may recall that last year a spokesman for Governments in exile stated in the Assembly that, when a country is occupied by foreign troops, popular resistance is very often headed by a Government in exile. This representative obviously was thinking of the provisional Algerian Government which led the struggle against the French troops in Algeria from outside the country. However, one might point out, on the one hand, that the only foreign occupation forces in Cambodia since 1966 have been those of North Viet Nym and the Viet-Cong, and that, on the other hand, to our knowledge, Algeria was only admitted to membership in the United Nations after its Government had set itself up in Algiers pursuant to the agreements concluded with France.\n18.\tIn the case of the entry of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations a case in which certain delegations sought a precedent which could be used against the Khmer Republic we cannot but stress the fact that, when the People's Republic of China occupied the seat which up to that point had been occupied by the Nationalist regime of Taiwan, it had long been in occupation of all continental Chinese territory, including, of course, its capital, a situation which would not be more different from that of the so-called \\\"Royal Government\\\".\n19.\tAmong the nations which have recognized this \\\"Government\\\", some have done so out of ideological solidarity with the Khmer Communists, or because of great-Power ambitions with regard to IndoChina; others, again, out of sympathy towards a movement which, disguising its true nature, has awarded itself the resounding title of \\\"non-aligned and anti-imperialist\\\"; others, again, because their leaders had friendly personal relations with our former head of State, Prince Sihanouk. There are many critics from every side against the regime of a small country like ours! So many worries for a Prime Minister who, in spite of all the respect owed to the representatives here, would have preferred not to have had to leave his capital where so many urgent, even tragic, problems beset him every day!\n20.\tAnd for a Khmer, that is to say, someone who is anxious for understanding, friendship, good and cordial relations with everyone for a Khmer it is extremely painful to see his Government and people perpetually in the dock before the highest court of nations to which the unfortunate Khmer Republic has done no harm except perhaps in that it exists. It is true that in the international community our Republic does have many faithful friends, and we cannot express too much gratitude for their courage and their faith. We even have some in the third world itself, friends who have bravely resisted 'he pressures exerted upon them to abandon our defense. Unfortunately, we also have in the same third world enemies, some violent events at least the others much less heated, and who, I am convinced, would only come out against us reluctantly. Is there any need to remind you that among the sponsors of the draft resolution which would expel us from the United Nations there is only one Asian Power, precisely the one which is the protector, the financer and the harborer of the so-called \\\"Royal Government\\\"?\n21.\tAs to the other Governments which are against us, they know us, above all, through the very black portrait which the vast propaganda machine of our enemies has painted of our Republican regime. Beset by numerous difficulties, perhaps we have not done enough to try to create a better image of ourselves abroad. However, we do not underestimate the intense diplomatic activity which has been carried on abroad by our former head of State, who has, to the benefit of the so-called Royal Khmer Government if only to show that he can still make himself useful drawn on the capital of the connexions which 15 years of authority and international meetings enabled him to accumulate. Thus, last year, at the non-aligned conference at Alger a conference from which we were banned, of course most of the participants voted, in spite of the reservations of our friends who were there, for a motion favorable to recognition of the so-called Royal Government. Some of the representatives to the conference told us later on that they would have much preferred not having to be involved in the Khmer dispute, but that somehow the heated spirit which prevails at major international meetings caused them to act as they did. We hope that, in the more tranquil atmosphere of the General Assembly, nations which are in that position will give more consideration to the fate of a people than to that of a single man.\n22.\tThe Khmer Republic has, as we said, been painted in very dark colors. In the eyes of Governments who have no observers on the spot, it has been described as a retrograde regime without any popular support and, of course, as a \\\"lackey of the American imperialists\\\". Furthermore, that regime has been pictured as being at the end of its tether militarily, incapable of defending what is claimed to be the small part of the national territory it has left against the irresistible assault of the so-called liberation forces. The latter description has succeeded in disturbing several Foreign Ministries, which, believing in the imminent victory of the \\\"Khmers rouges\\\", did not wish to be the last to recognize their \\\"Government\\\".\n23.\tThat caricature of the Khmer Republican regime has done it a great deal of harm. We should like here calmly to state the true position, anH we shall start with the military situation.\n24.\tThe real difficulties we encountered up to the middle of 1973 have now been entirely overcome. Totally reorganized, better commanded, with an appreciable improvement in its material position, our national army has for more than a year now been repelling all the assaults of the enemy: Khmers and communist Vietnamese. In September 1973 one month after United States tactical air support had been discontinued the Republican forces repelled, in hand-to- hand fighting, the major attack mounted by the Reds against the large economic center of Kompong Cham.\n25.\tThis year, after having lost control for a short time of the large rural center of Oudong the former Royal capital our forces, by means of a strong counter-attack, drove out the occupiers and re-entered the neighboring regions. The violent attacks later mounted by the communists against other large centers the port of Kampot, the provincial capital of Takeo and the provincial capital of Kompong Chhnang\u2014 ended in resounding defeats for the aggressor. Around the capital and the provincial towns formerly under enemy pressure, the situation has greatly improved.\n26.\tUnlike the Khmer communists, who imprudently boasted of crushing the Republic during the last dry season, we have no intention of setting a date, even an approximate one, for the complete liberation of our territory. There may still be some disappointments or failures here or there. But what is certain today is that it is no longer possible for the enemy to win a military victory. We believe that sooner or later and sooner rather than later the enemy will draw the necessary political conclusions.\n27.\tWe should like the United Nations, which for years now has been discussing the very complicated problem of disarmament, to undertake to encourage, by all its political and moral means, the disarming of minds in countries like our own where for years now the worst kinds of acts of violence have been committed. We are of course happy to note the Organization's interest in the events in the Middle East. But should it not be as vigilant and active in matters of concern to us? The Khmer people firmly believe that the United Nations can contribute to ending their troubles. Before I left for New York, I myself received a delegation of Khmer farmers, refugees, who said this to me: \\\"When you are there\\\" that is, here at the United Nations \\\"tell those important people that all of our people are suffering; tell them that they must help us to make peace and, in the mean time, assist those who have lost everything\\\".\n28.\tThe representatives of a large community, the Islamic Khmers, our country-men of the Moslem faith, also spoke to me in moving terms. Refusing out of religious and moral conviction to espouse the cause of our enemies, they have suffered reprisals: their most beautiful mosques have been destroyed in five provinces and a large number of their hakims and imams have been murdered. Other mosques have been profaned by North Vietnamese troops, who sacrilegiously raised pigs there for food. Faced with the hostility of the Khmer Moslems, the communists have thrown old men into concentration camps, from which they have never returned. Healthy men and women have been subjected to a re-education program in which atheism is taught. Daily public prayer has been banned.\n29.\tThe venerable Hadji, the leaders of the Islamic religion in the Khmer Republic, said to me: \\\"Tell our brothers who represent the Moslem States in the United Nations about our deplorable plight\\\". Well, the message has been delivered, and it has been delivered by the Khmer Republic, which has recognized the Islamic religion.\n30.\tIt goes without saying that our enemies have not spared the large number of Buddhist monks in our country, either, whenever those monks have refused to be used as instruments for propaganda among the masses. Many monks in all the provinces have been arrested, persecuted and sometimes executed; their pagodas have been burnt as an example to others. The Christian religion, although there are very few persons of that religion in our country, has not been treated any better. We view that offensive, sometimes underhanded, sometimes brutal, against all the religions represented in Cambodia as the result of the particularly evil influence of the North Vietnamese officials who are the mentors of the Khmer communists.\n31.\tThe policy pursued by the Khmer Republic can be understood only if one bears constantly in mind the fact that, since 1966, its regions bordering Viet Nam and, since 1970, the major part of the territory east of the Mekong have been occupied by North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong forces; the number of such forces has varied, but it has never been less than several tens of thousands. Operating from the protection of our territory, those forces are mounting operations against the regime of the Republic of Viet Nam. A rather large part of our country has served and is still serving this time against our will as a rear base against a neighboring country, and that is in violation of our neutrality. The occupiers, whose presence Sihanouk had tolerated and who were receiving from their friends military material through Cambodian ports, ended up by acting in our country as if they were conquerors, driving out our peasants whose presence hampered their activities and openly mocking our powerless provincial authorities. What independent nation, devoted to its sovereignty and anxious to remain truly neutral, could have accepted the perpetuation of this intolerable and constantly worsening situation?\n32.\tEven before the overthrow of Sihanouk, who bears a great responsibility in this matter, the Khmer Government which was then the Royal Government, but whose principal leaders were for the most part the same as they are today warned the Vietnamese communists to withdraw from our territory without delay. They gave a very swift reply: they attacked our forces in several provinces in the east and south of the country. We had at that time no more than about 30,000 ill-equipped men under arms. However, this handful of fighters, swiftly reinforced by young patriotic volunteers, gave a good account of themselves against these Vietnamese communist forces which were superior in numbers and in armaments when they, immediately after 18 March 1970, spread throughout the country in an attempt to overthrow in the briefest time possible the Khmer Republic, which was guilty of refusing them \\\"sanctuary\\\".\n33.\tOur national army, our citizen volunteers, and our peasants valiantly resisted for 43 days, absolutely alone, the worst attack that Cambodia has ever sustained in this century. It was only and this is a date to remember on 30 April that United States troops from South Viet Nam entered Cambodian territory to a depth of less than 30 kilometers, less to save our Government than to clear the frontier regions neighboring on South Viet Nam, which was threatened. These troops remained for exactly one month in Cambodia, from 30 April to 1 June 1970. They never came back. This is the truth about the so-called occupation of Cambodia by foreign troops. For more than four years now there have been only Khmer troops in Khmer territory. We are harboring no foreign force or military base, contrary to what certain malicious Powers, who are confusing our country with other countries, persist in claiming. The number of Americans in Cambodia, including the entire civilian and military personnel of their embassy in Phnom Penh, does not exceed 200. To put an end to the charges made against us in this respect we are ready to receive in our country those of you who have in good faith been misled by the mendacious propaganda of our enemies. They can discover for themselves what the real situation is in our country, and we undertake, in advance, to facilitate the visit of United Nations envoys to any part of the territory controlled by the Khmer Republic, to open to them our military bases, our camps, without any reservation or limitation. They will be able to talk with whomever they like and to check on anything they consider important.\n34.\tWe would be curious to know if the other side is in a position to make such an offer of inspection by the United Nations. The so-called \\\"Royal Government\\\" has not, so far, allowed any foreigners to penetrate the zones which they claim to be liberating except, of course, for the North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong occupiers. The only foreign journalists there are those who have been captured when, side by side with our troops and at great risk to themselves, they were making an attempt to inform international public opinion honestly. About 20 of them disappeared in this way, and we are very worried about what has happened to them. It would, however, be interesting to see at first hand whether in the Khmer communist zones there are not any foreign troops or foreign bases. Our enemies will claim that they are being vilified when they hear me say such things. Well, they have an excellent opportunity to show their good faith by proposing, as we have done, an \\\"open door\\\" operation in their own territory, offering the same facilities to our Organization. Will they take this opportunity? If they do not, nations of good faith will be able to judge in what part of Cambodia there really are foreign troops.\n35.\tIt is true that until 15 August 1973 we enjoyed American tactical air support. It enabled our army to organize and to equip itself, and to grow to 250,000 men. It prevented the south of the IndoChina peninsula from falling to the Vietnamese communists. It is indeed clear that if a regime favorable to Hanoi had installed itself by force in Phnom Penh it would have assisted in every way that it could the communist forces operating in South Viet Nam as well as the subversive movement in Thailand. It was not cheerfully but out of harsh necessity that we accepted this air support, for those on the other side who were falling under these bombs were our own brothers. In the \\\"red\\\" zones there are many <people who do not even know what Marxism is, and who wish for nothing so much as the end to inhuman fighting and the return to peace and a decent life. Among the so-called liberation armed forces, how many fighters have been press-ganged into service and feel closer to the Republicans, who are defending traditional Khmer ideals, than they do to the intolerant and fanatical officers commanding them? But, I am afraid, bombs do not discriminate among their victims. \n36.\tDoes the fact that we have accepted United States assistance make us their lackeys? The so- called \\\"Royal Government\\\" is very ill-placed to make this claim, being a \\\"Gpvernment\\\" which would not exist at all without the unconditional support and the \\\"loans\\\" that are really gifts from Peking; whose armed forces would be here guerrillas hopelessly making sporadic raids if^ they did not regularly receive an abundance of arms, ammunition and modern war material from certain socialist countries, primarily China.\n37.\tThe truth is that from the very depths of our heart we wish for nothing more than a rapid end to the conflict which is ruining our economy and destroying our villages, and which has created more than 2 million refugees; a conflict which has killed or crippled for four years now hundreds of thousands of our countrymen out of a total of 7 million. This blood bath, if it goes on, will finally wear out our country, which is so poor and weak that it would then inevitably be-come an unimportant satellite of either the East or the West, losing finally its very national identity. It is tragic to note that the predictions of all the Republican leaders are shared by our former head of State in Peking, where the press has taken up and reported words almost identical with our own just a few months ago. Surely it is paradoxical and tragic that the same man who so loudly approves the Khmer communists' rejection of any of our proposals to discuss the Khmer problem without conditions does not conceal from those around him that the \\\"reds\\\", as he calls them, are ready to fight for years longer to avoid a compromise solution that would prevent them from exercising power over all Cambodia.\n38.\tIt should be stressed that the obstinacy of the Khmer communists in rejecting any offer of talks with the Government of the Republic can be explained for more than a year, not by the prospect of an early military victory which they now know to be beyond their grasp but by the fact that they are waiting for a decision in their favor by the United Nations which will enable them, they believe, to win diplomatically a resounding victory that they can no longer win on the battlefield.\n39.\tIt is our duty to issue a solemn warning to the Powers which have an interest in Cambodia that, in such an event, as in the very worst moments we have been through in more than four years, our Government will never throw in its hand. On the contrary, with the support of its heroic armed forces and the vast majority of the patriotic people who do not want to see installed in their country a regime beholden to foreigners, it will strengthen its resistance. And not only will there be no return of peace, but for our unfortunate country there will open up the gloomy prospect of a cruel and interminable war in the course of which, I should like to point out, we shall not lack friends on the international or regional level. And, however much we love peace, we will never give in.\n40.\tIn a speech which he is making on this very day to mark the fourth anniversary of the Republic, our President, Marshal Lon Nol, after having expressed his hatred of the war which has imposed so much sacrifice on our people, states:\n\\\"But let there be no doubt in the minds of our adversaries: we shall continue to fight, if necessary, to prevent ideas and concepts alien to our traditions being imposed upon us. In our struggle for our liberties, we enjoy the support and sympathy of many foreign countries.\\\"\n41.\tPeace will be restored to Cambodia only through conciliation, never by force. That is why, in his speech, the President of our Republic repeated the governmental appeal of 9 July \\\"to all Khmers and to all countries that love justice and peace for a dialog to be established which will put an end to this conflict\\\". It must be possible, he added, \\\"to agree on ideas, values and concepts which could guide the future of this country\\\".\n42.\tA just peace for Cambodia, that is the desire of the vast majority of the nations represented in this Assembly. There are few who really wish to impose upon it a regime that its population does not want. Many still believe, however, that the so-called \\\"Royal Government of National Union\\\", which they are reminded on every possible occasion is \\\"headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk\\\", is truly a broadly based Government, really headed by the Prince, and able, if it came to power, to pursue a policy of neutrality and of true non-alignment. That belief is particularly widespread among friendly nations in the third world, although they have nothing but good intentions towards the Khmer people.\n43.\tBut it is not just because we deem it to be unlawful that, in this statement, we have constantly described the enemy Government as \\\"so-called\\\". And certainly not just out of an attempt to demean it, which would be petty. It is because we have every proof that behind this lofty title there lurks a different reality, a reality which all friends of an independent Cambodia\u2014beginning with statesmen who have some personal friendship for Sihanouk\u2014must realize.\n44.\tFirst of all, there is no longer, if there ever was, a \\\"Royal Government\\\". The only person who is royal in this is our former King and former head of State who was deposed in 1970. Now he, who remains the titular head of this Government, plays no other part than that of a surety for the Khmer Communists. Not only have they never authorized him, in spite of his claims, to come back and establish himself in his own country, but in fact they never take into account his views and recommendations. Thus, set aside and humiliated, under surveillance by his Chinese hosts, spied on by certain Khmer members of his entourage, he has made it known that he will no longer co-operate with those he calls the \\\"Khmers rouges\\\" after the end of this conflict, that he will never return to Cambodia and that he will end his days in a foreign country.\n45.\tIt suffices to read certain statements of the Prince to journalists who visited him statements that he has never denied to understand that everything I have just claimed is the strict truth. Sihanouk and he knows it is now a figure of the past. He has understood but rather late in the day that a \\\"nationalist\\\" Prince, even if he considers himself progressive, has no place in a \\\"people's democracy\\\". We shall leave it to history and to our compatriots, whose misfortunes he is prolonging, to be his judge. It will be noted, however, that he persists in promoting the accession to power, in his country, of a regime under which he himself would not be willing to live. \n46.\tThe Government-in-exile set up in opposition to us not only is not a royal Government, but is even less a Government of rational union. How could this union exist when most of the population lives in the territory of the Republic, where they gave their support to the national Government, and the self-styled \\\"United National Front of Cambodia\\\", dominated by the most extreme Marxists, is itself the best example of rivalry and divisiveness? That is why, incidentally, most of the former supporters of the Prince, seeing that their former master cannot command respect, have abandoned the cause which he was no longer defending and have rejoined the ranks of those who are fighting to protect the national ideals of the Khmer Republic.\n47.\tSuch is the \\\"Government\\\" by which some people would like to replace us in Cambodia's seat in the United Nations, a \\\"Government\\\" which, in order to win as much sympathy as possible, has always concealed its true colors, thus gravely misleading all nations of good faith in a word, a \\\"Government\\\" which could not represent the Cambodia of yesterday and today, a country which is open to all opinions, eager for knowledge of the outside world, and profoundly desirous of maintaining friendly relations with all nations whatever their ideology or governmental system provided they harbor the same desire in regard to us.\n48.\tWhen our adversaries call us to war, we call them to peace. We know that in this way we are responding to the deeply seated aspirations of all our people, in whatever area the fighting has placed them. We also know that, on the other side, there are good brave men who do not want to fight for \\\"another 10 years\\\" for the triumph of an ideology, but who are weeping to see their country ruined and suffering. And there will be more and more of them in the future who will help us to bring about a peace where there will be no victors and no vanquished, but simply brothers who have been reunited.\n49.\tThe Government which I head undertakes to spare no effort, to pay whatever price is necessary, to bring an end to hostilities; in the coming months that is the wish of our nation and that is your own wish so that, finally, our people, reconciled, on begin the long march towards the goal of repairing the tremendous damage inflicted on our country, as the only path to a better life for all.\n50.\tWe therefore call upon the United Nations to help us achieve this noble objective before hundreds of thousands more of our compatriots fall on the desolated soil of our ill-starred country.\n"

        "file_text": "My first words are addressed to you, Mr. President, to congratulate you on your well- earned election to preside over this, the greatest forum of the peoples of the world, to guide it with your recognized wisdom and boldness at this particular moment in history.\n171.\tMy next words are of welcome to the three new States that have emerged from colonial status into full sovereignty and independence. I greet Guinea- Bissau, Bangladesh and Grenada, whose heroic presence among us gives us cause for rejoicing.\n172.\tI must say a few words regarding the grief of Latin America at the ravages suffered by Honduras, our sister Republic, struck by adversity in the form of a hurricane. This is the time for us to show our solidarity with that small but great nation, and to give prompt and decisive help in its reconstruction.\n173.\tRarely in the history of this Organization has the period between two regular sessions of the General Assembly been so filled with events, or shown a deeper and more extensive transformation in the conditions of human life and the relations between peoples. There is an atmosphere of expectancy, of dissatisfaction and of tension between the industrial countries and the developing nations. The latter have been waging an almost vain struggle to achieve higher standards of living, and to close the gap between them and the economic and technological Powers. The unequal terms of trade are the common denominator of the problem. The Algerian proposal to hold a special session to study the question of raw materials and development resulted in the sixth special session? and served to pinpoint that tension which had been dramatically exacerbated by what was termed the energy crisis, that is, by the decision of the oil-exporting countries to re-price their obviously non-renewable resource and to serve notice that their reserves were limited and that their management had entered a radically new phase.\n174.\tThe effects of these measures have touched all nations of the world to a different extent and in different ways. The bases for industrial production of wide areas have been changed, and many articles have been subject to unavoidable readjustments. Obviously, that measure was not the cause of the monetary troubles which were already being felt, nor can it alone be held responsible for the phenomenon of global inflation. But it is linked to imbalances in the world market, to the financial crisis and to the changes in many prices, which were earlier referred to as equitable but which now appear suddenly capricious in their response to the new oil price levels, which the producers quite justifiably consider as having been set belatedly.\n175.\tGoing beyond the specific and immediate debate on oil, the sixth special session issued a Declaration which might wall be termed the Magna Carta of economic equity and then went on to adopt its Program of Action. Despite some reservations, consensus was the order of the day and for the first time it became obvious that world solidarity was more than an empty phrase. The interdependence of all peoples of the earth was a fact of pristine truth and it was made clear that the needy and the wealthy were components of a single whole that must be reviewed with justice, with courage and with wisdom in order to advance towards a more egalitarian and secure world. It was also made clear that, besides peace, collective security, the urgency of disarmament and the prohibition of aggression, economic development and social welfare were also objectives of equal importance and inseparable from the others.\n176.\tAmong the lasting benefits derived from that sixth special session was the fact that the third world, once an amorphous collection of peoples with neither close contacts nor clear-cut goals, became a consolidated body. That session opened wide the doors to dialog and a gate to the future and set in true motion the principle of the sovereign equality of States. The voices of the strong and the weak acquired equal resonance. These are irreversible achievements; and we can as of this moment assert that the symbol of the United Nations for the next long years will be an economic symbol, or, more specifically, the systematic and courageous search for the way in which three quarters of the world's population are to move towards standards of development, or at least are to be given conditions whereby to achieve such standards; so that contrary to the usual effect, their efforts to progress will not bring about a relative regression.\n177.\tIt is, however, clear that the historic session of April last in this same hall did not possess magical virtues or automatic means, and we cannot confuse our intentions with the long-range results. That session was accompanied or immediately followed by dark economic omens: monetary instability and uncertainty regarding ways of stabilizing currency exchanges; poor harvests and grave warnings about the world's food reserves. But over and above all, there was a global inflation whose levels and speed of growth were practically unprecedented in scope. Many industrial economies that had a mere few months earlier appeared prosperous and sound suddenly showed signs of weakness and sank to near bankruptcy levels. Money had lost some of its purchasing power and became more difficult to obtain. The situation of most developing countries went from bad to critical because of the trend among the industrialized nations towards cutting down on their purchases in the third world and concentrating on raw materials that were essential for subsequent manufacture. Those raw materials did not have the benefit of the necessary emergency machinery to impose conditions of sale and prices; what is more, they bore no relation to the capital goods which those less advanced countries had to import, with their enormous surcharges due to the high standard of living in the manufacturing countries now further increased by the inflationary spiral.\n178.\tThus many peoples not only feel that they have drifted far afield from the minimum well-being and development targets set a few months earlier in New York, but now face critical situations in the procurement of food for survival. A feeling of urgency and an awareness of the gravity of the moment seems to hover over most of the items on our agenda. The peoples who have had control over the possibility of peace or war, of collective security and control of trade, as well as those nations which have enjoyed sudden boom conditions, now have the chance of using their resources, not in charitable works, but in an enlightened effort of self-defense against the boomerang of an untenable economic situation. The political stability of the world is threatened by the rising waves. A new type of society, one that is desperate and skeptical regarding all forms of government and of opposing ideologies, may supersede the more stable, peaceful, traditional and organized national communities. One need not stretch one's imagination too far to foresee, among the poor peoples who are being robbed of their hopes for improvement, calamities which will engender further calamities.\n179.\tThe moment is ripe to prove the capacity of the United Nations. No bilateral arrangement, nor agreements between blocs, will have sufficient influence to alter the economic course or to arrive at global policies that will offer true safeguards. It is only world-wide agreements, arrived at here by dialog, through reason and in the assurance that we are living in a united world, that will give adequate answers to the complex and threatening challenge. All countries, some in more orderly fashion than others, are turning to the task of domestic therapy. More than ever before, Governments are aware of the need to assess the possibilities of their respective peoples, and many of the latter are responding with dedication and fervor to the sacrifice of a more than precarious existence. But there is a limit to the ability to perform miracles, and facts, as we well know, are stubborn. Beyond the national effort there is still that great battle to be fought.\n180.\tPersonally, I am optimistic regarding the human ability to adapt in order to meet unforeseen circumstances and almost instinctively to organize in the face of the common threat. Herein lies the greatest reserve of the United Nations: that it is a state of mind and spirit that transcends cultures, ideologies and customs. More than the isolated generosity of some countries, it is a community effort which, with .some sort of occult wisdom, leads us to an equilibrium, to a restoration of peace, to the preservation of order, to a sense of foresight, and to acts that start beyond individual and specific interests. This does not mean adopting a passive reliance on providence, or a giving-in contrary to the strength of reason organized into systematic thinking. It is an act of faith in values that we hold in common and that find in this Organization their most propitious outlet.\n181.\tEvents do not pass by the United Nations without affecting and changing it. The sixth special session is a good example of how the concept of economic development crystallized, despite the vagueness with which Article 1, paragraph 3, of the Charter refers to \\\"promoting and encouraging respect for human rights\\\", which is an entirely different matter. That statute, the result of the post-war period, was based on outmoded notions of sovereignty which were unconnected with natural resources. Yet it has been in force since 1946, so that it is high time for 138 associated nations to revise it, to bring it up to date, making it more operative and dynamic.\n182.\tAt the twenty-fourth session of the Assembly in 1969, Colombia proposed just this. It was then that our then Foreign Minister, now the President of the Republic, Mr. Lopez Michelsen, from this same rostrum, called for the need to rejuvenate the San Francisco Charter that had been drafted \\\"25 years ago to operate for geopolitical conditions which have been surpassed\\\".8 We advocate not its demolition but a change of some of its parts. No one can deny the services that this venerable legal instrument has rendered. But by the same token, no one can blind himself to the slowing down, the artificial obstacles and duplications it has caused, or to the vagueness and lack of precision it has created. Those who fear that a revision of the Charter implies a break-down of the spirit of the Organization and a jump into the unknown are mistaken.\n183.\tParadoxically, it is far more in keeping with tradition to ensure that institutions retain their creative dynamism than to preserve their facades intact. The British writer G. K. Chesterton contended that it was far more traditional to keep painting the white mast white than to wait until it had lost the last traces of its whiteness on the pretext of preserving it intact. Notions such as the common character of the seabed, of outer space and their multiple uses cry out for a place in our Charter, as do those of biological balance or those of the campaign to safeguard the environment against pollution, for the right to ecological balance is not the heritage of a single generation isolated in time, and we are in danger of being adjudged by posterity as the destroyers of the planet. \n184.\tColombia is honored this year as being the site for the first International Women's Conference at Bogota. The two main phenomena that characterize the social changes of the twentieth century have been the rapid urbanization which brought about the mass exodus from the countryside and the creation of innumerable huge cities. The other feature of our time has been the emergence of women into economic, social and political life. This has led to changes in the structure of the family and of culture itself. Obviously, that leads to a change in mentality, in attitudes and tasks in the life of man. It is the human couple as such that has changed. To assess the alterations in the domestic and social functions of both, their influence on the home and the community, and to discern the new trends will be among, the tasks of that Conference. The Conference will also have to examine the obstacles that still stand in the way of the harmonious integration of the efforts of women and men jointly to grapple with such tasks and responsibilities as are posed by under-development. Furthermore, the Conference will have to gage the results of the World Population Conference held recently at Bucharest. Responsible motherhood and the right to control fertility within the framework of women's freedom and beliefs are indissolubly linked to their rote in modern life and to women's identity, dictated by their biological and psychological nature.\n185.\tWe are well aware that no assistance will suffice to shatter the fetters of underdevelopment unless it is linked to an orderly and systematic internal effort. But it is equally true that the distances between some societies and others are so great that in order to bring many peoples into the modern era a veritable race against time is required. This is typified in the field of technology. In the solidarity and inter-dependence of the present-day world, the right to use or abuse specific knowledge is not too well under-stood. There are some areas, such as health, where the preventive vaccine cannot be the exclusive property of any if it can be used to save the lives of millions of beings. Thus, too, certain discoveries and improvements in key areas, such as energy or the exploitation and preparation of basic products, must be termed the collective heritage of mankind. We must consider that the so-called transfer of technology should be operated not bilaterally through more favorable conditions or counterpart benefits between countries, but, rather, by a gradual but massive transfer as the poorer countries require it. This leads to the idea of a world pool of technology which should be administered or monitored by the United Nations.\n186.\tOne item that certainly does belong on our agenda is the \\\"Examination of the functions of the International Court of Justice\\\" [item 93]. This subject was discussed at the twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh sessions and should cast some light on the functions and priorities of the main legal organ of the United Nations. The subject also dovetails with the concern over the review of the Charter. Colombia believes that it would redound to the benefit of the international community if the sphere of the advisory opinions and decisions of the Court were to be widened. The surprising evolution of international law today, which is rich in new issues, should benefit from the clear decisions of the Court, as the nature of the matters brought to the consideration of that supreme tribunal warrant.\n187.\tDuring the last few years, the growth of war material of all kinds has been virtually unaffected by arms control or disarmament agreements. Limited or localized wars, such as those of IndoChina, Cambodia or the Middle East, have a markedly experimental character. They affect military criteria and planning. Technological progress in certain tactical and strategic weapons is so rapid that the great Powers are constantly beset by the terror of being irremediably left behind by their peers. This explains the lag and delay in bilateral agreements on mutual reduction of forces and the vagueness of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. It also explains the meager results obtained at the summit talks to find a balance in the possession of multiple independently target-able re-entry vehicles [MlRVs).\n188.\tThus, the rate of military technological production has only grown. Even in the fields of chemical and bacteriological warfare there is no sign of a reduction or destruction of existing arsenals, but, rather, it is believed with some justification that more sophisticated progress is being made in these destructive fields.\n189.\tThe nuclear-weapons tests in the atmosphere, which in 1973 shook the world and particularly those countries that border on the Pacific Ocean, are far from ended, and they systematically coincided with the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmoshpere, in Outer Space and under Water, signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963. This proves the paucity of success obtained in this vital field by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament which, doubtless and despite all, is the most important forum for world arms control. Blocked by the negotiations of the super-Powers, it has turned, us attention to the noble, albeit more limited, objectives such as the prohibition of the use of needlessly cruel and indiscriminate weapons, for example, napalm, and acts of war against civilian populations.\n190.\tI quote from the S1PR1 Yearbook 1974 of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute:\n\\\"SIPRI has shown that world military expenditures [for 1973 and 1974] are running at about $207,000 million per year\\\" which is over 6 per cent of the gross national product of the countries of the world and equal to the total income of the 2,000 million persons living in the region of the third world with the exclusion of China. \\\"The military expenditure of those countries which provide development aid is estimated at approximately 6.7 per cent of their gross national product, which is 30 times greater than the official development aid they provide.\\\"\n191.\tWe can safely say that, aside from the imbalance between the prices of raw materials and those of manufactured goods, no other factor acts as such a drawback on the life of peoples representing 70 per cent of the world's population as does the arms race.\n192.\tSo, for reasons of world security as well as of pure economy, it is only just that we aspire to a world peace conference whose agenda will include all types of weapons and systems of mass destruction, and whose conclusions will be guaranteed in advance by the great atomic and military Powers by means of forms of verification open to and exercised by the United Nations. This hope, which might appear a Utopian flight of fancy , is, nevertheless, the corner-stone of our Organization, and to its achievement all our efforts must be directed all the more so since the danger is growing and we stand on the threshold of a second generation of countries that are capable of nuclear warfare, \n193.\tColombia is a country, dedicated to peace, that is eager to work and, by its own efforts, to obtain what is indispensable to it in a framework of world commerce that will exclude the imperialism of trade, tied loans and inflation built into the goods it imports. During the last decades, we have watched with anguish the systematic erosion of coffee prices, which represent 50 per cent of our export trade, while seeing a radical increase in the prices of agricultural machinery, inputs and fertilizers. The national effort has been gigantic in order to cover the coffee deficit with manufactured goods and to meet the needs of the national growth and the peaceful revolution to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth and more equality for all Colombian citizens. We believe that at this time the situation of coffee is alarming. We believe in the advisability and the need for a climate between producers and consumers not of confrontation but of dialog and progressive under-standing. The President of Venezuela, Mr. Carlos Andres Perez, in a recent message to President Ford of the United States, denounced this situation in the following terms:\n\\\"At this very time, we are seeing how the refusal of the developed countries, including the United States of America, to agree to just and fair prices for coffee has resulted in the inaction of the Inter-national Coffee Organization, which was established precisely to achieve a satisfactory and just equilibrium between producers and consumers. The coffee-producing countries of Latin America and Africa will lose roughly 30 per cent of their foreign- exchange earnings, while manufactured goods from the developed nations have doubled or tripled an price.\\\" [S^ AI9784, annex.]\n194.\tIt is obvious that, confronted with this picture, we should feel ourselves as allies of all the countries that face similar obstacles in Africa or Asia. Colombia considers Latin America to be an extension of the concept of the nation and is united with each and every country in that region of brothers. We are aware that in this planetary world of ours Latin America is a bridge that links other areas culturally and economically. We offer our friendship indiscriminately to all the peoples of the world, regardless of their ideology, so long as they respect our institutions and the democratic system of Colombia.\n195.\tWe are here to perform an arduous task, and to perform it together. We are not unaware of the obstacles, but we possess the faith born of our tradition that ideas become the weapons that no wall is sufficiently high to keep out. Freedom is something as real and tangible as the air we brent he. We believe that freedom hungers for bread, for security and for well-being and ultimately identifies itself with them.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating you warmly on your election to this high and responsible office. Your unanimous election is proof of the confidence placed in you and in your country and of the certainty that you will make this particularly important General Assembly session a success. To these congratulations I should like to add our sincere thanks to your predecessor, Ambassador Benites. We were very happy to be able to begin our co-operation in the United Nations under his wise and experienced leadership.\n36.\tI also wish to welcome most warmly the three new Members: Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea- Bissau. We are looking forward to co-operating closely and trustfully with these countries in the framework of our Organization.\n37.\tThe twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly is being held against a background of international events and developments which must be regarded as a challenge to political reason. We share the deep concern that permeates the introduction to the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization despite intensive efforts to achieve detente, the number of conflicts involving the use of force is not on the decline; the global network of economic relations is in many places damaged, in some already torn: there is a shortage of raw materials, a struggle over prices; inflation and monetary fluctuations are driving us towards a crisis; the economic situation in some parts of the world has continued to deteriorate dramatically; hunger is still spreading. There are still people who are denied their elementary rights; the gap between the proclamation and the realization of human rights continues to be unbearably wide. Many people no longer believe that their problems can be settled by mutual agreement. This feeling of desperation not only breeds resignation and fatalism; it also generates action that is unjustifiable from any point of view, acts of individual terrorism in the shadow of which no country can feel safe - a terrorism that also leaves its mark on countries not involved.\n38.\tBut our chief concern must be to prevent any further breaking up of international solidarity and to reverse the process of disintegration.\n39.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany has gone through certain experiences which distinguish it from many other countries represented, here and which determine the nature of our participation in the work of this great world Organization. With your permission I will mention those experiences, in order to illustrate that what we need today is not less but more international solidarity.\n40.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany emerged from a separation into states of the indivisible German nation. We are therefore more deeply conscious than others of the fact that States, however great may be their need for existence, are imperfect entities. Our citizens are less inclined to think in terms of nation-States, to regard their Government and their political institutions as the source of all wisdom and to believe that those institutions alone can cope with the massive problems inherent in the pursuit of peace, freedom, human dignity and welfare. We therefore view with concern the re-emerging tendency in some parts of the world to overrate oneself as a nation and the attempts of some countries to increase their prosperity at the expense of their neighbors' procedure that has always resulted in the weakening of all. The Federal Republic of Germany therefore trains its policy on the objective of European unity. We are convinced that only a united Europe can effectively solve the existing political, economic and social problems confronting the member States of our Community. That Community is also willing to share responsibility for solving problems beyond its frontiers; the more closely it is knit together, the more it will be able to do in this respect. This morning [2238th meeting] my French colleague mentioned the request for the granting to the European Community of observer status in the United Nations. This request is further proof of a determination of the European Community to co-operate actively in the solution of world-wide tasks.\n41.\tThe other experience of the Germans has been that force, rather than solving problems, in fact makes them all that much more difficult to settle. Once reconciliation had been achieved with the neighbors in western Europe, especially with the French people, the Federal Government under the then Chancellor, Willy Brandt, and under my predecessor and now Federal President, Walter Scheel, concluded agreements on the renunciation of force with those countries from which we have been separated by a sorrowful past characterized by force and conflict. The Federal Government and I can say this also on behalf of all responsible political forces in the Federal Republic of Germany bases itself on the principle of the renunciation of force. As the United Nations Charter expressly lays down, peoples may and should, in the exercise of their free self-determination, manage their own affairs. This also implies, in our view, that divided countries may reunite if that is their own free decision and that nations may join supranational communities. But if force enters into the conduct of international relations, then it will be the seed from which ever more conflict and violence will spring, and consequently will be the source of distress, want and disaster.\n42.\tBoth these experiences, the imperfection of our States and the senselessness of force, have led the Federal Republic of Germany of necessity on to the road taken by this world Organization. Only by means of a well-structured international order can the people in our State systems find the framework within which they feel confident they can live in security.\n43.\tOn behalf of my country I speak up for the form of co-operation embracing all mankind, the most important model of which is the United Nations, a form of co-operation which, though it is certainly a laborious and tedious way, is the only worthy one and promises to be more successful in the end. Peace, freedom, human dignity, welfare and a reliable system of international relations are indivisible.\n44.\tToday more than at any other time in the past it is the political will for co-operation that counts. The international institutions cannot be stronger than that political will. This is a question not merely of being willing to play a constructive part in bringing about international treaties, but also of being resolved to comply with them.\n45.\tThis is the prerequisite for the working of that new form of international relations the development of which has governed the period since the Second world war which, we may hope, will also have been the last world war. It is a precondition which will have to be established in all countries, but not only on the part of governments.\n46.\tI am deeply convinced that it is also the individual citizen in our countries who will have to develop a willingness to act in a way which I have tried to describe as international solidarity. The problems that have been the subject of United Nations conferences in past months and will be the subject of other conferences in the months ahead for instance those on commodity and developing problems, population trends, the use of the high seas, and the world food problems are matters which concern every individual. A government's sense of the common responsibility and its willingness to play a constructive part in resolving these problems depend on the degree of understanding of their peoples.\n47.\tInternational co-operation in its multifarious forms has created a framework within which it has been possible to bring about extraordinary changes in the world in the past two and a half decades. Let me mention only two of those changes: the process of liberating the former colonial nations which is reflected most strikingly in this very Assembly where the original 51 members have now become 138; and the development by the United Nations of a peace-creating and peace-preserving policy, which has helped prevent the spread of local and regional conflicts.\n48.\tIncreasingly, doubts are being voiced today about those same international rules and organizations whose often quiet work in the background has made such developments at all possible.\n49.\tOn behalf of the Federal Government I would like to state the following.\n50.\tWe want to strengthen the United Nations and enhance its possibilities of action. Whatever its imperfections, there is no alternative to the United Nations. Those who have the peaceful development of mankind at heart must support it.\n51.\tThe tasks of the many regional groupings are complementary to the universal tasks of the United Nations. For us, the standing of the United Nations is not in any way lowered because of the fact that we are a member of a defense alliance, and that, together with others, we seek political and economic union in Europe. This diversity of international groupings is commensurate with the diversity of international relations. This pattern is useful as long as no organization turns against others and as long as all respect the rules we have all agreed upon within this widest framework. My country will abide by both these principles.\n52.\tOrganizations are the work of men and, as such, imperfect; moreover, times and problems change. For the Federal Republic of Germany there is no reason to question the foundations of the existing international order. Rather, we have to develop its rules and institutions and adapt them to the new requirements, Let us join in studying all aspects of the United Nations system and considering where the Organization itself or the rules upon which it is based can be improved and its problems thus resolved. The Federal Republic of Germany will assist in such a review in the same spirit in which it is seeking within other organizations, especially GATT and IMF, to bring about an organic reform of the international system.\n53.\tWe shall have to examine very closely the forms of international co-operation we have developed to see whether they are suited to removing the causes of the crises that have arisen in many parts of the world. In the United Nations Charter the solution of world-wide economic, social and humanitarian problems receives the same priority as the aim of safeguarding peace. Both realms are indivisible. We know that peace is more than a state in which fighting may have stopped for a while. An international economic order embracing the principle of equality and partnership in trade relations also will in itself help to safeguard peace.\n54.\tThose who still doubt the need for rapid action will have had their eyes opened by developments in the past 12 months. The prices of many major primary commodities have escalated in hitherto unknown proportions; energy prices have risen vertically. You all know the consequences: alarming balance-of-payments deficits on the one hand; vast surpluses on the other. This has piled plenty of additional fuel on the fire of world-wide inflation. Data which had served as a valid basis for economic planning were called into question overnight. In many countries there is a growing feeling of uncertainty in the face of an economic trend which appears less calculable than ever in the past. The consequences affect all. The difficulties facing the industrial countries are considerable, but they are not to be compared with those of the least developed countries, which are lacking in natural resources and whose very existence is threatened. We have to tighten our belts, but for them it is a question of survival.\n55.\tThis is a challenge which does not distinguish between different systems: it affects all nations, rich and poor, developing and industrialized.\n56.\tI place very much weight on this point. An exacerbation of the conflict of interests between commodity-producing and industrialized countries not only creates problems between those directly concerned, but also strikes first and most tellingly at third countries. This kind of situation results in new tensions, and many countries would be sorely tempted to try to save their own skins without consideration for others. Let us guard against such a temptation.\nTerrible experiences of the past have taught us that seeking refuge in economic isolationism does not remove the difficulty. On the contrary, world economic relations are so intertwined that action which is felt to be egotistical is bound to produce counter-measures. Consequently, the \\\"every man for himself' approach leads straight to economic chaos and creates tensions between States and their peoples. What we want is just the opposite: we want to remove existing disparities, especially the gulf between developing and industrialized countries; we want to quell further conflicts; and we want to avoid the situation of some being entirely dependent on others. To achieve this aim we shall have to bring about a world-wide improvement of our economic and social structures; we shall have to boost productivity and encourage sensible growth without neglecting the task of protecting the environment a task which has lost none of its urgency since the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in 1972. When the commodity-producing countries seek to obtain higher market prices for their raw materials, they must be assured that there will be no excessive price fluctuations in the commodity markets. At the same time, we must seek to ensure long-term supplies of those commodities. But in the interest of all we must make sure that the bigger proceeds from energy and raw materials are reasonably used and thus fed back into the international economy. The money should be used where it is most urgently needed.\n57.\tWe are prepared to help find solutions, both regional and world-wide, that will prevent any threats to the international monetary system.\n58.\tAt the sixth special session of the General Assembly last April the important dialog on world-wide economic problems was begun. We shall have to continue that dialog with much patience and resolution and with a good sense of judgment. No one will benefit from decisions that are not supported by all the world's major trading partners; no one will benefit from resolutions that question the world economic order based on division of labor and freedom of trade or that represent an attempt to replace such an order by a system of global dirigisme.\n59.\tTrue, the present world economic system is not without defects and weaknesses. We must therefore develop it still further, improve it and adapt it to the needs of all nations. The Federal Republic of Germany has made specific contributions towards this end and is willing to carry on along this road.\n60.\tWe appreciate the need for the industrial countries to make their markets more accessible to products from the less-developed countries. The European Community, of which my country is a member, has been catering to this need for a good number of years by granting general tariff preferences. It is currently negotiating a comprehensive system of mutual economic relations with 44 African Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n61.\tThe Federal Government supports co-operative projects also by private companies in developing countries. It is trying by appropriate measures to steer investment activities towards the least-developed countries.\n62.\tIn recent years the Federal Government has constantly increased the share of its development aid that goes to those countries that are in special need of international solidarity, and it will continue to do so.\n63.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany has declared its readiness to provide, as a member of the European Community, a substantial contribution towards the emergency operation of the United Nations for the benefit of the most seriously affected countries, as soon as, the other countries involved have agreed to play a corresponding part.\n64.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany is taking part in the fight against hunger in the world and in efforts to solve the world food crisis. Within the European Community, too, our contributions are sizable. We help supply fertilizers. The President of the United States of America [2234th meeting] and his Secretary of State [2238th meeting] have rightly re-emphasized before this Assembly the importance of this problem.\n65.\tHigher commodity prices and the problems they entail confront us with tremendous economic difficulties. Nevertheless, the Federal Government will make special efforts to continue to ^increase its development aid. In the years ahead it intends to increase that aid at a higher percentage rate than the national budget as a whole. For 1975 this has already been decided. Multilateral aid will continue to feature prominently in our development-assistance program.\n66.\tWe are making efforts to increase and intensify exchanges in the field of science and technology. All countries should have access to the scientific and technological resources of this world, so as to become more and more able to solve their problems on their own. This, too, is the aim of our projects in the sphere of educational aid. We welcome the idea of a United Nations conference on science and technology, and we shall do our best to encourage the promotion of that project.\n67.\tLast year's events have once again thrown into relief the interdependence of the world economy and have made clear to us how sensitive the complex economic mechanisms of highly developed countries are. Even their capacity has its limits. Their economies can function only under their own laws, and domestic stability plays a great role in this. Only countries with a well-functioning economy can be good trading partners to developing countries; only they can help and, over the long term, attend to the problems of others beyond their own frontiers. Industrial countries with economies shaken by inflation are bound to lose in efficiency.\n68.\tHence, the results of the Federal Republic of Germany's consistent policy of domestic stability benefit others as well.\n69.\tWe are aware that the solution of economic and social problems is possible only When the political prerequisites are there, the most important being an all-out effort to ensure peace. This task remains^ the prime mission of the United Nations. We can note with satisfaction that in many parts of the world hard work is being done to eliminate conflicts and tensions. To encourage and support those efforts is important.\n70.\tWith regard to peace and security, the obvious cases today are two areas whose conflicts have a direct bearing on us Europeans particularly; they are the Middle East and Cyprus. The conclusion of the disengagement agreements in the Middle East has generated new hopes for a comprehensive peaceful settlement of the conflict.\n71.\tSuch initial steps must be followed by others, in order to establish an equitable and lasting peace ensuring the existence of all States and peoples in that region while taking into consideration the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The progress; made so far is an indication that even among the parties to the conflict the conviction has grown that a genuine solution can be attained by peaceful means only. The Federal Republic of Germany welcomes this development, in which the efforts made by the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger, played a decisive part.\n72.\tPeace in the Middle East will set free powerful forces that can be harnessed to the reconstruction and development of the whole eastern and southern Mediterranean areas. The Federal Republic of Germany and its European partners will not fail to co-operate. By initiating a European-Arab dialog, the nine members of the Community have already laid the first foundations for that great task.\n73.\tThe Federal Government most deeply deplores the recent events in Cyprus with its tragic consequences for the country and its people. We hope that those involved in the conflict will succeed soon in finding a negotiated settlement securing the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and restoring to that country external and internal peace.\n74. Both in the Middle East and in Cyprus the United Nations used its instruments to help in the efforts to bring about a cease-fire and make negotiations possible. I wish in this connexion to emphasize the valuable work done by Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, to whom we owe appreciation and gratitude.\n75.\tWe thank the soldiers of the peace-keeping forces for their dedication in the service of the United Nations, and we pay a tribute to those who gave their lives in that service.\n76.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany recognizes the important functions of the peace-keeping forces and has therefore been supporting the actions in the Middle East and Cyprus by voluntary additional contributions. The efficiency and possibilities of action of the United Nations forces could be further enhanced if we succeeded in agreeing on general guidelines for peace-keeping operations. We should increase our efforts to bring about such an agreement.\n77.\tWhat concrete contribution can we make to an active peace policy? The foreign policy of the Federal Republic of Germany is geared to furthering detente. Detente in itself will not remove existing differences, nor automatically provide more security. But the policy of detente is an effective instrument in the efforts to eliminate old conflicts and prevent the emergence of new ones and it is only.\nin an atmosphere of detente that efforts at arms limitation and arms control with due regard to security interests will make any sense at all.\n78.\tThe Federal Government includes in its policy of detente the most difficult and burning problem prevailing in Germany itself the division of our country with all its painful consequences for the people. I wish to repeat what the Federal Government made clear at the twenty-eighth session [2119th meeting] from this rostrum. We cannot and will not accept the division as history's final dictum on the German nation. That dictum will be spoken by the German people themselves. The Federal Government sticks to its policy of working for a state of peace in Europe in which the German people will regain its unity in free self-determination.\n79.\tThis does not prevent us, however, from exhausting the full measure of co-operation attainable in the, circumstances. This, our policy, has paved the way for contractually, settled relations with the other German State, the German Democratic Republic. It has since been seen that co-operation between the States of a divided country in the United Nations is possible despite fundamental differences of political views, that it is beneficial for all, andI should think for the world Organization too.\n80.\tDetente in Europe had to begin Where differences clashed their hardest., that is, in Berlin. The Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971 opened the way. Hence, one of the criteria by which to measure detente is the manner in which that Agreement works in all its parts. Berlin's secure future is an indispensable element of detente in Europe, and it remains a vital interest of our policy.\n81.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany wants to see the policy of detente effectively continued. It is in this spirit that the Federal Government cooperates actively and constructively in the Geneva Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and in the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces and Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. We do not seek advantages benefiting just one side; we seek a way that will facilitate the coexistence of nations on the crowded European continent, and it is our hope that these conferences will bring us nearer the time when, in Europe, a highly armed East and West will no longer confront each other.\n82.\tWe cannot and will not reconcile ourselves to the thought that the arms race in which not only the great Powers participate is being carried on and on. The economic resources of mankind must increasingly be used to put an end to hunger and misery in the world, but they should be concentrated on that task now, not after there has been a winner in the arms race.\n83.\tThat is why I feet that, even more that hitherto, we must seek practical, controlled measures of disarmament and arms control. As before, the Federal Republic of Germany is determined to contribute actively to this. Disarmament and arms control are an integral part of our policy. We are prepared to assume additional responsibility also in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and are certain that we will have an opportunity to do so in the near future.\n84.\tIn this connexion I wish to underline the great importance which we attach to the policy of the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Federal Republic of Germany intends to participate in the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons scheduled for 1975. It hopes that this will provide it with another opportunity to help oppose anything that might jeopardize the policy of non-proliferation.\n85.\tIn this General Assembly the Federal Republic of Germany focuses its special attention on three sets of problems of world-wide co-operation, namely, the strengthening of the international order and its institutions; the improvement of international economic relations in the spirit of partnership and solidarity; and concrete contributions to detente and disarmament with a view to ensuring a lasting peace. It does so in the awareness of, and with respect for, the expectations, the wishes, the hopes and longings of the people of the German nation and all other nations. All our endeavors are ultimately aimed at enhancing the welfare of each individual human being.\n86.\tThis idea leads us to a central aspect of the United Nations work to which this General Assembly should also devote its full attention. I mean the question of individual human rights, of the protection of the individual within the community, and I should like to warn against the illusion that it would suffice to guard the outward order by outward means against war and destruction. What we need is not just the formal recognition of human rights but also their universal acceptance and application so as to endow the outward measures for the preservation of peace with inner firmness and the power of conviction.\n87.\tThese are elementary rights which must be respected and applied all over the world: in Europe and I mean all parts of Europe less than on other continents.\n88.\tWe expect that the entry into force of the two International Covenants on Human Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI)] which the Federal Republic of Germany ratified in December 1973 will spark off fresh impulses.\n89.\tAs a new member of the Commission on Human Rights, we want to co-operate responsibly in that body's efforts to give effect to human rights. We want to help and do our best to ensure that the individual shall be protected both from arbitrary treatment by the State and from want, and that population groups shall be protected from discrimination on racial, religious, political and other grounds.\n90.\tWe welcome the decision of the Commission on Human Rights and its bodies to prepare studies on the subject of self-determination. The rights of self-determination is a regulative principle to be applied not only in the sphere of decolonization or to one particular continent but in all parts of the world.\n91.\tSelf-determination and human rights are the central issues at stake also in southern Africa. The problems of decolonization and the elimination of racial discrimination in that region will again be occupying the attention of this General Assembly. We have left no doubt about our attitude; we demand that any remaining colonialism be eliminated. We condemn all forms of racial discrimination. We can note today with satisfaction that since the last session of the General Assembly fundamental changes have begun.\n92.\tWe welcome Portugal's historic decision to recognize the independence of Guinea-Bissau and to open the road to independence for Mozambique and Angola. We see in this a confirmation of our view that courage, energy and wisdom can solve these problems too.\n93.\tThe guarantee of individual human rights, the total ban on racism in any form or place, and the achievement of the self-determination of nations are tasks which my people, prompted not the least by its own historic experience, would like to help to accomplish sincerely and energetically.\n94.\tIn his treatise Of Eternal Peace, written in 1795, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, whose two hundred and fiftieth birthday we celebrate this year, drew up principles for international co-operation. These universal aims are also pursued by the United Nations. The principles which this Organization established for international coexistence almost three decades ago are today sure of world-wide recognition. However, white solemn declarations and resolutions are a good thing, we must do more. It will be the task of the General Assembly at the present session to give practical impetus, to point the way for our future work, so that by concrete measure seven if they are only small steps ahead we come nearer to achieving the aims of the United Nations. At the end of this session of the General Assembly we shall be judged by the progress we have made along this path.\n"

We accordingly reaffirm our adherence to the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV), annex] and to the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. Chile believes that today more than ever we must respect the basic principles of international coexistence.\n167.\tProhibition of the use or threat of force, prohibition of intervention of any kind in the internal affairs of any nation,\\\" respect for the rights of peoples to self-determination, as well as unlimited respect for international treaties, are some of the basic principles that inspire our participation in this Assembly's general debate, as well as in the study of the many subjects that will be considered by the Committees.\n168.\tWe have attentively followed the efforts of the United Nations for the maintenance and restoration of world peace. The current negotiations in the Middle East, thanks to the intelligent role played by the Secretary-General as well as by the dynamic Secretary of State of the United States of America, clearly demonstrate that the United Nations is an effective instrument for the solution of international conflicts when the political will exists voluntarily to adhere to its standards. The disengagement agreements are an essential first step toward the achievement of a just and lasting peace in that part of the world.\n169.\tRecent events in Cyprus have caused my Government concern. This is not the proper moment to examine the causes, which sure already so well known to this international body. In our judgment, what matters is the survival of that United Nations Member State, which currently finds its integrity and independence so seriously threatened.\n170.\tWe consider that this General Assembly should give maximum priority to the problem of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and obtain the cessation of tests, whether underground, at sea or in the atmosphere. The fact that a number of countries are now able to produce devices of this type, along with the temptation of some nations to become atomic Powers, might lead to a nuclear race that is as risky as it is absurd, and which could develop into a war so destructive as to affect the whole human race. The gradual proliferation of members of the nuclear club thus poses a grave danger for international peace and security.\n171.\tWe believe that the best way to achieve these objectives would be to extend geographically denuclearized zones. In this regard, I should like to declare that the Government of Chile is completing the internal legal arrangements for the ratification of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, which was signed at Tlatelolco. Within a very short time we shall deposit the relevant instrument of ratification.\n172.\tSome South American Governments have expressed the desire to reach a regional arms limitation agreement in order to allow for a more accelerated economic development of their countries. Chile has declared its outright support for this initiative and believes that, in general, offensive weapons should be especially limited, while those needed to fulfill the defensive aims of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance should be maintained.\n173.\tEver since the time of the League of Nations, Chile has supported the principle of the universality of international organizations. We consider that the ability of the United Nations to accomplish its basic goal -to secure a just and lasting peace in the world- depends upon the strict application of this principle. Thus we rejoice at the admission into our Organization of the States of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea- Bissau. We extend our warmest welcome to them and we feel certain that they 'will make a timely and active contribution to our deliberations. I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate Chile's support for resolution 1514 (XV) concerning the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples.\n174.\tThe Republic of Honduras was recently the victim of a catastrophe bringing desolation and ruin to thousands of homes. My delegation wishes to reiterate to the Honduran delegation the warmest and most heartfelt feelings of the people and Government of Chile. At the same time, we should like to request the Secretary-General, whose dedication and skillful action merit our fullest support, to invite the relevant specialized agencies of the United Nations and other institutions to grant our sister nation their swiftest and most ample co-operation.\n175.\tThe world economic situation is certainly not encouraging. The crisis the world faces probably has no parallel in history. Deep-seated problems exist which have been developing for a long time and which, far from being solved, tend, on the contrary, to become dangerously acute. I refer to rapid population growth, the food crisis, ecological destruction, the deterioration of the environment and the gradual extinction of non-renewable natural resources.\n176.\tWe are going through what the experts call \\\"international economic turbulence\\\", most visibly and probably most dramatically manifested in the energy crisis. The old post-war order, characterized by the Bretton Woods Agreements and the traditional trade patterns associated with GATT, has demonstrated its total inefficiency in our time and, as repeatedly pointed out, has turned into a new international economic \\\"disorder\\\". Both institutions and mechanisms created nearly 30 years ago have demonstrated their inability to cope with the problems of today and have jeopardized the objectives of the International Development, Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. At the same time, the industrialized nations have not given priority to financial co-operation for the benefit of developing countries, nor have they fully opened their markets to the exports of developing countries. Peace and economic prosperity together constitute the guiding principles of our Charter. Therefore it is regrettable and dangerous that the results achieved in the economic, financial and commercial sectors are not comparable with those achieved in the political and military areas.\n177.\tA number of recent new developments call for a re-examination of current economic policies. Industrialized countries have suddenly been faced with the fragility of the structure of their economic systems, while the developing countries have seen their negotiating potential unexpectedly raised. For the first time a certain symmetry of interests and benefits has emerged between those two groups of nations, which affords a unique opportunity for negotiating fair agreements.\n178.\tThe foregoing impels me to insist that we urgently adopt specific measures that will accelerate multilateral trade negotiations on a preferential basis that will apply to tariff as well as non-tariff trade barriers. At the same time, it is necessary urgently to accelerate decisions for the reform of the international monetary system that would give the developing nations a much larger participation than that afforded them so far.\n179.\tChile believes that Latin America has something to say and something to offer in all those areas. Our region can rely upon existing co-ordinating mechanisms, and these should be used fully. An example is the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination. This body expresses the genuine Latin American personality. Likewise, we have organizations such as the Latin American Free Trade Association and the Andean Subregional Integration Agreement (Andean Group) to the improvement of which Chile is fully committed.\n180.\tLatin America's efforts towards establishing a guaranteed international economic order are borne out by the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States by Venezuela's valuable contribution to the Inter-American Development Bank, and by our countries' active participation in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The second session of this Conference, recently held at Caracas, should be viewed in terms of both the successful organization of the Conference by the host country and the effective and useful work undertaken. The Conference defined what could be called the basis of, or key to, international solutions, particularly the 200-mile economic zone and the formulation of the concept of the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction being the common heritage of mankind.\n181.\tChile, the first country in the world to proclaim, in 1947, a 200-mile marine zone, was joined by Ecuador and Peru in a later defense of this doctrine in some memorable diplomatic battles. While at that time we seemed isolated in our position, new we are gratified to note that we are supported by the great majority of nations. Conceived as an economic zone or patrimonial sea, that doctrine has become fundamental to an international solution. It is not. only a triumph for the developing countries; it is also an expression of the justice of the fundamental relationship existing between a country and the resources of its adjacent sea,\n182.\tOne proof of Latin America's commitment to overcoming the most urgent problems of our time was the efficiency and dedication with which the representative of Ecuador, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, presided over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We wish to pay him our warmest tribute for the brilliant manner in which he discharged his lofty duties.\n183.\tThe people of Chile recently celebrated with spontaneous joy the first anniversary of its liberation from the Soviet-oriented totalitarian regime that had tried to impose its dictatorship on the country and its people, and in multitudinous rallies held throughout the land the people reaffirmed its support for the present Government of national reconstruction.\n184.\tThis year, with the enthusiastic support of all sectors, healthy economic foundations have been laid and are already yielding initial results. Central Bank reserves, which were only $3 million a year ago, now exceed $300 million. Exports between January and May of this year increased by more than 200 per cent over the same period in 1973. In spite of higher import prices, Chile's balance of trade has ceased to show a deficit, and now shows an appreciable, surplus. Agricultural production will increase significantly this year, since essential planting is 50 per cent greater this year than in 1973. This increase is a result especially of the fact that the Government has turned over rural land, which had been nationalized by the previous regime, to authentic peasant farmers. Particularly noteworthy has been the increase in copper production, total output being 46 per cent higher this year than last year.\n185.\tThe recovery of our economy has created confidence abroad and made it possible for Chile to renegotiate its external debt within the framework of the \\\"Paris Club\\\", on mutually acceptable terms. The runaway inflation we were suffering is being controlled, and a program for the gradual reduction of the inflation rate is under way. In order to avoid dislocations, it is based on increased productivity and reduced government spending.\n186.\tSocial development is and has been one of the Chilean Government's fundamental concerns. The difficult anti-inflationary campaign is being carried out as fairly as possible, with benefits accruing to the workers through long overdue substantial pay rises and social improvements. So, for the first Time in our country's history, the dilemma of the most helpless groups of people has been confronted squarely and in depth through a complete study of the factors involved and a program of action designed to. put into effect urgently needed solutions.\n187.\tWithin this brief summary of my Government's efforts, special mention should be made of the children's nutrition program now being carried out in Chile with the full knowledge of UNICEF and other international organizations. We are confident that the success of our studies and accomplishments in this area will enable our country to co-operate usefully with other nations. We are pleased to offer them our experience for mutual benefit.\n188.\tThe Chilean Government has passed a new law, the Foreign Investment Statute, which establishes rules to attract foreign capital but, at the same time, clearly protects our national interests. This foreign investment law has already produced a significant increase in the number of requests to expand current investments or to invest in new industries, and has attracted numerous national and private groups from abroad, which have all been anxious to co-operate in our development on fair, serious and well-defined terms.\n189.\tWhile laying the groundwork for the economic reconstruction and social development of the country, my Government has assigned top priority to the rehabilitation of the judiciary, which is a spiritual and moral legacy of the people of Chile and the very essence of their historical identity. Upon taking office, my Government acknowledged its patriotic obligation to revive the fundamental attributes of the Chilean character, and to restore justice, and the institutions that had been violated, destroyed or negated by the previous Government. It gives me great pleasure to be able to describe how the Government of Chile is fulfilling the promises made to the citizens of our country.\n190.\tThe fully independent Judicial Branch administers justice without any interference whatever from the Government, which accords it the most absolute and total respect and prompt implementation of its sentences and resolutions. This situation is in contrast with the violent and defamatory attacks against the High Court which occurred under the preceding Government. At that time the judicial Branch's constitutional powers were disregarded and its sentences and judgments were not carried out, all of which conspired against the independence of the Judicial Branch. It is enough to point out that at the time there were more than 7,000 sentences handed down by the courts which were never carried out.\n191.\tThe Comptroller General's Office, an autonomous institution responsible for confirming the legality of the acts carried out by the Executive Branch, fulfills its fiscal responsibilities with total autonomy and efficiency. It has been enlarged and strengthened in its attributes. The Comptroller Genera's observations and administrative notices are no longer scoffed at as they Were under the procedures that operated under the preceding administration.\n\n192.\tAlso, in line with a legal tradition of more than 150 years of republican life, the Government of Chile a few days after assuming power named a Commission to draw up a new political Constitution. The Commission is made up of distinguished university professors with vast judicial experience and ample knowledge of public affairs. More than 70 distinguished professional experts co-operate with it, representing a varied spectrum of activities. The work of this important Commission is carried out in an atmosphere of complete freedom and along the lines of certain general principles proposed by the Commission itself and approved by the Government prior to publication and dissemination throughout the country.\n193.\tThe new Constitution will encompass the basic principles that derive from our Chilean legal tradition and from the historic cultural identity of our homeland. It aims at the improvement of institutions to the fullest extent possible and in accord with universal experience and Chilean specific realities, and will institute a representative and democratic system, with authorities whose power will originate in the law and who will be elected by the people in free, pluralistic, secret and informed elections.\n194.\tThe legal reorganization in Chile and the intense task of effecting legislative renovation which are currently under way are inspired and determined by the principles and values which the Government of Chile proclaimed and published last March. It would be rather lengthy to refer at this time to the declaration of principles. Suffice it to say that the declaration encompasses the highest human values and is consistent with the highest Western and Christian philosophy. In my country this document has been widely published and I can assure this Assembly that these are-the principles that inspire Government action, as well as the principles that are defended and guaranteed in Chile today.\n195.\tSome politicians or institutions, whether misinformed or in bad faith, have sustained a media campaign designed to create the impression that the Government of Chile upholds repressive measures and ignores both legal rules and human rights. For the most part, these attack* originate with individuals who see the flaw, in others but do not wish to recognize their own flaws.\n1,96. The truth is that Chile is a country with borders open to any representatives of official international institutions and to private persons who wish to visit our countryside and cities in order freely to converse with our people and. understand the reality of a people that is marching with unity towards a better future.\n197.\tThe International Committee of the Red Cross, ever since the advent of the current Government, has maintained a permanent delegation that has received ample authority to visit those who have been detained and tried and, from time to time, found guilty. This delegation periodically reports to its headquarters in Geneva as well as to the Government of Chile.\n198.\tThe Office of the United Nations High Com-missioner for Refugees has conveyed to my Government its appreciation for the co-operation extended in the solution of problems deriving from the presence of over 14,000 foreigners who are in the country illegally. The majority were individuals who had been expelled from their home countries and who had gone to Chile to continue their subversive and terrorist activities.\n199.\tWe have invited a commission of conciliation and investigation of the International Labor Organization so that it may observe how Chile is complying with its international obligations and how the law protects the social progress achieved by workers.\n200.\tChile fully agreed to the granting of asylum in foreign diplomatic missions, although many of them exercised that right for the first time, with no claim to do so since the Governments concerned are not parties to the Conventions on the subject. Regardless of the fact that in many instances asylum was not warranted, the Chilean authorities agreed to grant all the requested safe-conducts. It gives me pleasure to announce that no refugee remains in asylum in foreign embassies. In view of the scope which some have tried to give to diplomatic asylum and which Chile de facto did not want to deny, my delegation assigns top priority to the discussion and approval of a universal convention on the subject.\n201.\tThe Government of Chile authorized the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights to hold an extraordinary session in my country in order to study on the spot the status of such rights. We granted all the facilities that were requested. Have our detractors allowed international committees into their countries in order to carry out an in-depth investigation of human rights, permitting them to visit detention centers and to hold conversations unobstructedly and privately with detained persons?\n202.\tOn 1 of September the Chief of State of Chile, General Augusto Pinochet, made the following statement:\n\\\"The Government wishes to announce that, in spite of serious legal or moral charges for which persons arrested under the state of siege and those facing trial have been held responsible, it is ready to authorize such persons to leave the country for good, should they so desire, with the sole exception of particularly grave cases.11\nSubsequently, he called on other nations which have attacked us violently to act similarly under the super-vision of the'International Committee of the Red Cross. The Committee has offered the Government of Chile to undertake the necessary steps to implement this initiative, and we have given it full support in this noble task. We are drawing up the list of those persons who voluntarily wish to take advantage of this offer, and there is nothing to prevent them if they so wish it from leaving the country with their families.\n203.\tIn brief, we can guarantee with deep conviction that today Chile is one of the countries where every person whether a national or a foreign resident has complete personal security and where human rights are fully respected.\n204.\tthese past few days, efforts have been made to associate Chile with interventionist acts from abroad. My Government did not hesitate to denounce the impudent involvement in Chilean internal politics during the past administration by several Communist countries. Such acts were intended to unleash civil war in my country. Now, in accordance with the traditional attachment to independence which is characteristic of our policy, and the authentically Chilean roots of my Government, we firmly reject, irrespective of their aims and their place of origin, any acts of intervention that directly or indirectly entail foreign entanglement in the internal or external affairs of Chile.\n205.\tSocial justice, solidarity and the participation of every Chilean in the common effort to reconstruct our motherland a demonstration of how we have overcome artificially engendered hatreds and an illustration of a new mechanism aiming at the efficient and prompt solution of the problems confronting the people of Chile. This is the path we have chosen. We have committed ourselves to this endeavor with austerity and sacrifice but also with dedication and faith in the future of our land.\n206.\tThe Chilean delegation is present at this session of the Assembly with the intention of extending this very same spirit of co-operation and solidarity to the accomplishment of the tasks incumbent on the international community. In so doing, we trust that the over-all result will be the attainment of positive agreements worthy of the fundamental goals of the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Before I begin my address, I wish to express to our sister Republic of Honduras the great grief and solidarity of the Government and people of Peru in connexion with the enormous natural catastrophe which has afflicted that country in the last few days. We trust that the United Nations will take immediate action to contribute to the recovery of the brave Honduran people from this disaster.\n165.\tMr. President, on behalf of the Revolutionary Government of Peru and the Peruvian people, I wish to express to you my sincere congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly. The high responsibilities entrusted to you are merely an undeniable recognition of your qualities as a statesman and of your dedication to the cause of non- alignment and the third world and your efforts in support of that cause.\n166.\tI should also like to express a cordial greeting to Mr. Leopoldo Benites, from our sister Republic of Ecuador, for his outstanding and very effective role as President of the General Assembly at its last two sessions the regular session and the special session.\n167.\tSimilarly, I should like to express to the Secretary-General the appreciation of my Government for the' devotion and spirit of sacrifice with which he has contributed to the solution of the difficult problems which affect the peace and security of the world.\n168.\tIt is with particular satisfaction that my Government welcomes Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada, new States Members of the Organization, whose participation will greatly contribute to the fulfillment of the purposes and principles of the\nCharter and a concrete expression of the universality of the Organization.\n169.\tAllow me to consider first the framework of the international situation. Detente between the great Powers has continued; new dialogs and new agreements during the year so far are proof of this. The danger of a nuclear war is no longer with us and the years of the cold war seem to be a thing of the past. However, detente at the summit has neither eliminated nor diminished conflicts at the periphery. On the contrary, the countries of the third world face even mo violence these days. Suffice it to mention the continuing wars of liberation in Viet Nam and Cambodia; the persistence of a tense situation in the Middle East and the emergence of a new such situation in Cyprus; the policy, which is a remnant from the past, that has been maintained against Cuba through a partial blockade which has clearly proved to be an anachronism and a failure; and the fact that the Indian Ocean, far from being a zone of peace, grows day by day as an area of rivalry.\n170.\tThus, the international situation rests upon a fragile and precarious state of peace and security. That is so because the hegemonic designs of the great Powers continue to be their everyday practice. There is an obvious contradiction between the detente being sought at the level of the great Powers and the fact that the developing nations are being thrust, socially and economically, into an increasingly marginal situation, and such a contradiction leads to ever more pronounced radical trends in the revolutionary potential of these nations.\n171.\tWe are living at a moment of critical stock-taking in which the world status quo is being increasingly questioned. We are witnessing a qualitative break in the course of history resulting from a social upheaval which has its origins in the sharp increase of poverty caused by relations of domination and dependence.\n172.\tThe present international situation is very fluid and very revolutionary. It becomes apparent in the multidimensional struggle of the countries of the third world to create a new international economic order which takes concrete form in the defense and recovery of natural resources; in the affirmation of the right to explore and exploit the riches of the seas adjacent' to their coasts; in the effort to regulate and control the excessive power of the great multinational corporations; in the general struggle for liberation from imperialism, colonialism and neocolonialism; and in the endeavor to achieve authentic revolutionary models without foreign interference, bolstering national culture and identity.\n173.\tIt is in that vein that the President of Peru, General Juan Velasco Alvarado, said: \n\\\"We are also aware of the radically new meaning of the present moment in the history of mankind; this is more than a mere rhetorical expression. It is a proven description of reality, for we must all understand that the old system of domination and dependence must be abandoned and the categories which served in the past to express the political reality of the world must now be redefined. The concepts of peace, security, and international co-operation, among others, must be profoundly revised. And, in the deepest sense of the expression, the moral order which was the foundation for international relations in the past must also be substantially altered.\\\"\n174.\tCyprus and the Middle East are contiguous areas of grave international tension, which require preferential consideration in this forum. Cyprus is occupied and divided, and it is the task of the United Nations to bring about the restoration of its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Direct dialog under the auspices of the Organization might constitute a procedure that would allow a peaceful solution capable of reconciling the interests of the two communities inhabiting the island and lead to the withdrawal of the foreign forces that are there today. In that same spirit, the non-aligned movement, which the Government of Cyprus helped to found, must play a substantial role in achieving those objectives.\n175.\tThe Middle East continues to be a zone of conflict, although the conflict has now acquired a new form. The use of oil as an instrument of negotiation has become an effective means of securing compliance with the resolutions of the Security Council, which have been so often reiterated by the non- aligned countries. The cease-fire and disengagement of forces, though only provisional measures, must constitute a necessary basis for the achievement, through the negotiations at Geneva, of a just, lasting and definitive peace, based on the principles of respect for the existence, integrity and sovereignty of all States in the region, the non-acquisition of territories by force and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n176.\tThe Revolutionary Government of Peru, with a firm pacifist conviction, has contributed to achieving the relaxation of tension in the area by sponsoring resolutions of the Security Council and by sending a battalion as part of the United Nations Force, which initially carried out a mission in the Sinai and at present has as its sphere of operations the Golan Heights, as part of the disengagement observation force in that critical area.\n177.\tWithout any doubt Africa is the area where a considerable change for the better has taken place with regard to the fulfillment of the purposes of this Organization. The tenacious struggle of liberation movements, with the political support of the non- aligned countries, has resulted in a positive change in the colonial situation. The new Government of Portugal and its progressively oriented armed forces have participated decisively in the change, thus permitting the confirmation of the independence of Guinea-Bissau and the taking of steps towards the emancipation of Mozambique and Angola. The heroic feat of Amflcar Cabral, who set in motion the liberation of his people, has achieved a happy and a just result. His spiritual presence remains with the young nations that have joined and strengthened the ranks of the third world in the movement towards justice and for the continued struggle against all forms of colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination.\n178.\tPeru, as one of the first countries to recognize Guinea-Bissau, welcomes that valiant nation on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations and offers its fraternal co-operation.\n179.\tWe also view with pleasure the formation of the Provisional Government of Mozambique and trust that that country will achieve its full independence as soon as possible.\n180.\tIn Latin America a unified conscience is clearly emerging which will not allow exclusions and which is founded on ideological pluralism, nonintervention and the sovereignty and equality of all States. Historical experience underlines the fact that the achievement of unity within our plurality is essential in order to define and defend our true interest, deepen our interrelationship and reach our common destiny within the overall global context. \n181.\tDecember of this year will mark the 150th anniversary of the epic feat of liberation which occurred at Ayacucho, where armies from South American countries, as brethren under the leadership of the liberator Simon Bolivar, put an end to colonial domination, thus consolidating the emancipation of America. The Government of Peru wishes to celebrate that historic anniversary with the presence of the presidents of those countries which were represented on the battlefield at Ayacucho, where the first kind of independence, political independence, was achieved. At that summit meeting we must lay the foundations for the reaffirmation of the imperative need to preserve our unity and solidarity in order to achieve, once and for all, true economic independence for our peoples, which is the second kind of independence.\n182.\tThe Revolutionary Government of Peru, which participates actively in the search for formulas to help in bringing about peaceful coexistence and co-operation for the development of the region, firmly rejects and condemns intervention in the internal affairs of other States, whether it be political or economic, military or paramilitary, overt or covert intervention. Peru reaffirms that respect for the principle of non-intervention, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and with the charter of the Organization of American States, must be one of the basic foundations for bilateral, inter-American and global relations.\n183.\tLatin America shares an identity of structural situation with the countries of the third world and therefore its struggle for liberation acquires a universal scope. My country has made a contribution to a review of existing international relations by offering Lima as the site of the forthcoming ministerial meeting of non-aligned nations to be held in 1975, so that that review may take place. The meeting will serve to co-ordinate the efforts of countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America to achieve a new international order which will ensure the effective democratization of international relations. In that way the Peruvian revolution, which is ideologically autonomous, humanist and essentially Latin American, and imbued with a third-world policy, will contribute once more to the constant improvement of the international situation in America and in the world.\n184.\tThe United Nations is still the most visible international stage, as it were, where it is possible\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library\nto observe with t'.e greatest clarity a world situation characterized mainly by the persistent struggle of the third world for liberation. That struggle is taking place not only in the military and politico! fields but also in the economic and technological fields, wherein lie the main factors for obtaining full and total independence. In that sense it is no mere coincidence that the three major conferences of the United Nations held this year have addressed themselves to the defense of human potential and natural resources both from the land and from the sea. The sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the World Population Conference dealt essentially with one and the same problem the inexorable need to modify the anachronistic and unjust system of domination and dependence.\n185.\tThe sixth special session showed, in the light of the energy crisis, that the wealth and growth of opulent industrialized consumer societies depend on the extraction of natural resources from developing countries. This in turn shows clearly that the relationship between the industrialized countries and those of the third world has entered upon an era of interdependence, which must take the form of an effective equality in the political relations of States, based on a new technological and financial co-operation, geared towards the full development of the developing nations and respect for their sovereignty.\n186.\tThe sixth special session also showed that the international economic order which has been in existence since the first capitalist industrial revolution is fragile, does not make economic sense and threatens to worsen the world economic crisis. That experience demonstrates the need to change the present unjust international economic structure. For this purpose we feel that one of the tools of change is the establishment of associations of developing countries which are producers and exporters of raw materials, in order to create the negotiations power necessary to defend their prices, setting aside sterile confrontations, and also to correct the imbalance of economic power which is so unjustly weighted against us.\n187.\tThe existence of multinational corporations which exercise enormous economic and political power is a contemporary phenomenon which has a world-wide dimension and has of late become a serious means for imperialist penetration, responsible to a large degree for the economic crisis and the pollution of the environment which is detrimental to human life itself. I therefore believe that one of the greatest challenges facing us is that of limiting once and for all the uncontrolled freedom of action of those corporations in order to safeguard the sovereignty of States and the heritage of mankind.\n188- The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States has not been finalized because of the lack of political will shown by certain industrialized States. This important document must include legal and economic rules which, while ensuring the rights of States to full development, must also include the basic principles of the historic Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic\nOrder adopted by consensus at the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n189.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Caracas, has also called into question the system of domination and dependence, and rejected the old order. At that Conference the 200-mile limit was virtually accepted as an irreplaceable symbol of the new law of the sea, for the recognition of which Peru, together with other nations of Latin America and Africa, has struggled unflinchingly. Peru has defended for 27 years, in a firm and dignified manner, the position of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the sea, its subsoil and soil up to 200 miles as a substantive element in the new legal order and the recognition of a cause that is indissolubly linked to the security, welfare and development of peoples.\n190.\tAnother event of singular importance is the consolidation of the principle of universal social ownership of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, the administration of which should be carried out by an international authority to be established with the equitable participation of all States. In accordance with the consensus of the Group of 77 developing countries, the exploitation of the resources at the bottom of the sea should not be carried out for the purpose of mere profit. Rather, it should be truly placed at the service of the peoples of the whole world as the common heritage of mankind.\n191.\tAt Caracas, thanks to the cohesion of the third world, the formulation was begun of a new law of the sea, which, in its humanist inspiration, must become an instrument of justice, co-operation and peace, and no longer a tool for hegemony at the service of the great Powers.\n192.\tContradictory positions were put forward -\\t the World Population Conference, held at Bucharest last month. The theses which link underdevelopment solely to the population explosion and its solution to birth control were rejected by numerous developing countries, because population growth beyond resource supplies reveals a social and economic imbalance originating in structures of domination and dependence which prevent a proper balance between population and resources. The solution lies not in birth control, but rather in a structural change which would allow for true economic development. Today the problem of the population explosion may be seen as a consequence of a poor distribution of wealth, which, in turn, gives rise to unequal levels consumption.\n193.\tAs long as opulent consumer societies, which constitute a minority, absorb 40 per cent of the total natural resources and energy produced in the world, there is no justification whatever for the attempt by those societies to impose population policies and measures on an international scale because, really, all they reflect is their own interests. For these reasons, my country, together with other States of the world, has stated the need for each country to set its population policies independently, and has supported the World Plan of Action on Population.\n194.\tAn industrial development which will permit a just distribution of wealth, while ensuring at the same time the protection of the marine environment, is a great challenge to today's civilization. Peru has endeavored to contribute to meet this challenge by offering Lima as a site for the Second General Conference of UNIDO. That Conference will have to consider, with imagination and audacity, the type of industrialization most advisable for the different developing countries. Hence the need for all Members of the Organization to lend their full support and co-operation for the success of the conference.\n195.\tThe United Nations must reflect institutionally the new international situation, as has been stated by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [AI9601I Add.I]. We need a more dynamic, critical and creative Organization, that is to say, an instrument for change, uninfluenced by the trappings of bureaucracy. This creates the need for a more effective participation of the Secretariat in order to give more force and effectiveness to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n196.\tThe rule of unanimity in the Security Council, also known as the right of veto, was based on an international order in which the risk of conflict arose principally between the great industrialized Powers. This was the result of the experience of the Second World War. Today, new forces have emerged on the international scene, requiring a review of this institutionalized way of wielding power. The countries of the third world, to which international conflict has shifted, are those which have to withstand the critical situations, and in most cases, they suffer the consequences of an arbitrary veto and have no option in that situation.\n197.\tIt is therefore an imperative necessity to reach a formula that will limit this excessive prerogative, which simply reflects a past realism and violates the principle of the sovereign equality of States. Accordingly, we feel it is advisable to consider a possible solution. A veto by a great Power could be superseded or neutralized when a large majority of the General Assembly came out against it. Thus the hegemonic interference of a great Power in a conflict affecting small or medium-sized Powers would be neutralized and the prevalence of a single will over that of the international community would be avoided.\n198.\tAs we have stated, international peace and security, which are elements of the same reality, demand institutional change in view of the new world structure of power. It has been clearly demonstrated that for the third world the absence of major conflicts between the great Powers is not the same thing as peace. Hence the need to widen the concept of security by injecting into it an economic content.\n199.\tFor a developing country the use of economic pressure can have effects which are as deleterious as armed aggression. Therefore, since it threatens international security it constitutes aggression in itself. Security Council resolution 330 (1973) created precedents in this new context in calling for an end to economic measures of coercion by States or multi-national corporations. As a corollary to this we feel\nit is necessary to stimulate efforts towards the establishment of a system of collective economic security to preserve the sovereign right of States to self-sustained development.\n200.\tThe strengthening of the United Nations as an organization capable of creating a framework of political confidence among States is closely related to the problem of general and complete disarmament. At present, the fragility of peace in all regions of the world is the result of the development of the destructive power of sophisticated weapons, which threaten the very existence of the peoples of the world. Fear and uncertainty have generated an alarming arms race both among the great Powers and among the developing countries. According to United Nations studies on the subject, about $270,000 million are spent on weapons annually that is to say, 20 times more than is spent on development cooperation. This is a sum greater than the combined gross national product of Africa and Asia and far greater than that of all of Latin America. Hence it is necessary to establish the requisite control machinery and to formulate a disarmament policy directly related to a new philosophy for development co-operation.\n201.\tPeru, which has recently been invited to participate as a member of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, is extremely interested in contributing to an acceleration of the work of that Committee. Our deep pacifist convictions have been properly expressed in the initiative of the head of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru, General Juan Velasco Alvarado, who has proposed that in Latin America the acquisition of armaments be limited for a period of 10 years in order not to divert resources needed for development. The proposal has earned the determined support of many countries of the Andean Pact. We are sure that by these means we shall establish the confidence needed to facilitate integration and development in Latin America.\n202.\tIf we want a new world order in which justice will prevail we must help to create it. We can hardly call for international change and participation in it if we do not transform the obsolete structures of our own society. Consequently the Peruvian revolution humanist, just, libertarian, socialist and Christian builds its doctrinary base on a permanent awareness of our own reality and formulates an authentic ideological and political concept of a social democracy with the participation of all. In Peru today the profile of a new revolutionary society is clearly emerging. Large sectors of the population, fully conscious of their historic role, are rising and participating in solidarity in the process of the social creation of wealth and in its benefits.\n203.\tAn important step in this direction has been the creation of social ownership a sector which will enjoy priority and preponderance in the economic organization of the country. This form of social and common ownership is different in essence from a system of private or State property and will be exercised through the workers themselves organized in free production associations, which in our concept of revolutionary humanism makes man a profound creator and doer. In this context and as a necessary step towards the future Peruvian society, the revolution has freed the press from the minority circles of private and family ownership and handed it over to the organized sectors which are truly representative of the Peruvian people.\n204. Freedom of the press in Peru will no longer be mistaken for the biased freedom of private publishing companies or the manipulatory concentration of the publishing industry in the hands of the State. Today in our country freedom of expression is a right extended to all the people. These measures are in conformity with Economic and Social Council resolution 756 (XXIX), which states that the information media must be at the service of the people.\n2051 I cannot fail to stress in concluding that the emergence of the peoples of the third world constitutes a new, dynamic force which is transforming contemporary international relations. Our nations have abandoned the status of petitioners, which flourished in the paternalistic atmosphere of the past, in order to follow the path of autonomous development. Liberation for the third world is development, and there is no development without liberation. The order of the day for them is to make unity a principle and solidarity a strategy so as to transform our peripheral and marginal status and achieve, in dignity and justice, the position in the international community which is rightfully ours.\n206. There will be no peace in the world until we see the end in our countries of conflicts which originate in different forms of imperialism, the remnants of colonialism, distorting cultural penetration, intervention and pressures of all kinds, no matter how subtle. In a word, peace in opulence is not the peace of the third world. This forum, which is so familiar with conflicts, must become familiar with justice. To that end we, the peoples of the third world, demand respect of our right to be masters of our own destiny, to achieve our full development, and especially to eradicate, in this way and forever, uncertainty, social unrest and poverty.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I have the great honor of congratulating you, on behalf of the Finnish Government, on your election to the office of President. We know you as a highly respected representative from the continent of Africa. Algeria has, over the years, assumed an active role among the developing countries and within the group of non-aligned States. It was at the initiative of President Houari Boumediene that the General Assembly was convened last spring in its historic sixth special session, a session devoted, for the first time, exclusively to development and economic problems. It is therefore most fitting that the Assembly, has elected you to preside over this regular session.\n160.\tI have referred to the special session on raw materials and development. That event was indeed a milestone. It was above all a manifestation of the interdependence among all nations and the necessity for co-operation. This was plainly recognized in the Declaration proclaiming the determination of the Members of the United Nations to work jointly for the establishment of a new international economic order. The Finnish Government has stated its adherence to that Declaration. It also strongly supports the Prpgram of Action, which contains a long- term framework for the achievement of a new economic order. We furthermore consider it imperative to assure that sufficient resources, both material and human, are made available to the Secretary- General to meet the new demands now being made on the United Nations itself.\n161.\tThe most important result of the special session was that it forced Into the open a. thorough re- evaluation of the whole foundation of international economic relations and the staggering problems that face mankind today. It is now generally recognized that only through intensified co-operation and by taking into account the interests of all nations can we save the World from political and economic disruption. The United Nations must now respond swiftly, effectively and in a co-ordinated fashion.\n162.\tThe convening this year of three major United Nations conferences one on the law of the sea, one on population, and one on the world's food problems is proof of the need to give to the most pressing questions the' thorough consideration and worldwide attention they deserve all these issues are, however, interlinked and can no longer be dealt with in isolation. A feature common to all of them is their vital importance to each nation. We must- find a common solution which, regardless of the basic nature of the problem concerned, must be a political one.\n163.\tAgainst the background of these profound changes and challenges in political, economic and social relations among States, it is obvious that the special session of the Assembly next year will be of very great significance. It is therefore urgent that the preparations for that session be now initiated. The Finnish Government considers that the work of the United Nations to meet these formidable challenges is an integral part of our efforts to achieve the primary goal of the Charter, the preservation of international peace and security. The United Nations has indeed become indispensable in our striving to avert the scourge of war, to guarantee fundamental human rights and to promote economic and social progress.\n164.\tFinland has consistently stressed the importance of improvements in relations between the major Powers. At the same time, we have stated that detente, in order to be genuine, must take into account the interests of all Members of this Organization. In order fully to exploit the existing momentum of detente, it is necessary to define and develop new methods and approaches for the further relaxation of tensions in international relations.\n,165. In this context, the Finnish Government is gratified to see that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe that is now in its second stage in Geneva has already made important headway. Although much remains to be done, we believe that we can already see emerging an outline of a new set of rules of conduct to guide relations among the participating States. The fact that all the participants recognize each other's equality and that they pursue their common ends, not with the aim of isolation but with full awareness of their responsibilities towards all Members of the United Nations, should constitute an important contribution to world peace and security. The Conference is, we believe, now approaching its conclusion and it is our hope that its results will be greeted as a significant step in the development of relations among the participating States. That would, in our opinion, fully justify the holding of the final stage of the Conference on the highest level.\n166. A main area in which detente should bring new potentialities is disarmament. Nevertheless, in the past year no major step forward has been taken. The important work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has regrettably not been translated into draft agreements on a comprehensive test ban or the prohibition of chemical weapons. On the other hand, we have been encouraged by the resumption of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the USSR. We earnestly hope that the basis for agreement in this area can soon be broadened. This would in turn create new impetus for other measures in this crucial field to bring world peace and security.\n167.\tThe Finnish Government has carefully followed the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference. We welcome the fact that all nuclear Powers have made their contribution to this work. We have noted with satisfaction that the Committee has succeeded in adopting realistic working methods, and we hope that our deliberations during this session will in turn lead to further progress.\n168.\tIn searching for ways further to relax inter-national tension, the Finnish Government considers the idea of creating nuclear-free zones a constructive one. In fact, several years ago President Kekkonen of Finland advanced the suggestion that the Nordic countries could form such a zone. His initiative was based on the fact that at present the Nordic countries remain free of nuclear weapons and that all of them have adhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I have noted the words of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization that the initiatives concerning nuclear-free zones are not only a useful but a necessary part of our search for universal disarmament [sec Al960IIAdd.l, sect. X], In this context, my delegation welcomes the two new initiatives on nuclear-free zones presented to this Assembly [see AI9909 and AI99II]. Likewise, the proposal on the prohibition of action to influence the environment and the climate for military and other purposes merits constructive discussion, as it widens the scope of disarmament efforts.\n169. The international community has not been spared wars and human suffering. The situation, especially in the Middle East, remains potentially dangerous. Therefore, my Government urges the parties concerned and the great Powers to do their utmost to create the necessary conditions for a just and lasting political settlement, taking into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.\n170.\tOn the question of Cyprus, the Finnish Government appeals to all parties concerned to abandon the use of force and, instead, to choose the road of negotiation in order to achieve a peaceful solution based on the independence and sovereignty of Cyprus. As an immediate step it is necessary that all parties, in accordance with their obligations under the Charter, fully respect and comply with the resolutions of the Security Council. Equally important is the full respect on the part of all concerned for humanitarian values.\n171.\tThe Finnish Government gives its full support to the efforts made and services provided by the Security Council and the Secretary-General, both in the Middle East and in Cyprus. United Nations peace-keeping activities in both areas have been indispensable for the implementation of the Security\nCouncil resolutions and the agreements negotiated between the parties.. The latest developments in peace-keeping activities give us some hope that broad guidelines for United Nations peace-keeping operations may soon be agreed on.\n172.\tMy delegation is seriously concerned that the necessary firm arrangements for the financing of the United Nations peace-keeping operations are still lacking. As a small nation, we Finns strongly believe that peace-keeping is the common responsibility of the entire membership of the United Nations. This, fundamental and fair principle should be the starting-point when we try to agree on the financial aspects of peace-keeping.\n173.\tMy Government is concerned that serious violations of basic human rights still occur in various parts of the world. In particular, I would address a strong appeal to the Chilean Government to cease the persecution of political opponents and to set political prisoners free.\n174.\tOn our road to decolonization, the independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and the agreed, future independence of Mozambique are great achievements. The firm and resolute will for independence on the part of the African liberation movements, and also their willingness fully to use all possibilities for peaceful settlement\\\", combined with the policy of the new Portuguese Government, have opened the way to full sovereignty for these Territories without further violence. We sincerely hope that the same attitude will prevail in the case of Angola, so that the people of that Territory may accede to independence without further delay and in a peaceful manner.\n175.\tDespite these positive developments, southern Africa remains a potential crisis area. Again, I became aware of this during my recent visit to several African countries. The Finnish Government has consistently condemned the policy of apartheid practiced by the Government of South Africa. Likewise, we deny the legality of the Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia. The United Nations must now turn all its efforts against these last remnants of colonialism and racism in Africa. On behalf of my Government, I pledge our full support to these efforts.\n176.\tSpecial ties and feelings of sympathy link Finland to the Namibian people. My Government has always been active in seeking ways and means by which the direct responsibility of this Organization for Namibia could be exercised and the cause of the self-determination of the Namibian people advanced. We shall continue our efforts in this regard. It is in this spirit and yet another step in our consistent support for decolonization that my Government has decided to Seek membership on the United Nations Council for Namibia.\n177.\tThis year we have again advanced towards the universality of this Organization by admitting three new Members to the United Nations. The Finnish Government welcomes the membership of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. We are convinced that the participation of these States in our work will be of greatest value. That these three States, as one of their first international actions, applied for membership in the United Nations strengthens our conviction that this Organization is an indispensable forum where nations together can seek solutions to common problems in the spirit of true interdependence.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is a pleasure to congratulate your excellency on your unanimous election as President of this session which, in itself, is a sign of respect for the continent you hail from, which contributed greatly to the field of learning. Please allow me to congratulate you personally on this great confidence, which you rightly deserve, since I have /or many years known your personal qualities and abilities which qualified you and our beloved sister country, Algeria, to obtain the highest level of international recognition. I am sure that under your wise leadership we will bring the work of this session to a successful conclusion.\n287.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor for the untiring efforts which were crowned with success during an eventful year.\n288.\tI should like to sincerely thank our Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his continuous efforts for the observance of the principles of the United Nations.\n289.\tI should like on this occasion and from this rostrum to welcome the new Members which have joined the family of nations of this Organization thus taking their natural place among us. We are sure they will contribute their share to implement the noble purposes which all members of the international community endeavor to achieve. It is our hope that before long all other countries which have not yet attained their full right to freedom and sovereignty will also be able to participate with us in the work of this Organization.\n290.\tAs we review the events that have occurred in the past and still confront us during this session, I find myself much more optimistic in believing that the majority of Member States which co-operate with one another in upholding the Charter will continue in their effort to carry out their obligations in fulfilling their responsibilities and in meeting the aspiration of peoples and countries of the world. Those are the obligations enshrined in the Charter.\n291.\tAs you know, Saudi Arabia was a founding Member of this Organization, and His Majesty King Faisal Ibn Abdul Aziz was amongst those who played a praiseworthy role in giving full support to this Organization and to its noble principles of peace, hoping thereby to raise the standard of moral values of postwar society in conformity with those prescribed in monotheistic religions and those spiritual values which are vital to the promotion of co-operation in a better world civilization.\n292.\tDespite the fact that we have been disappointed on more than one occasion when the principles of the United Nations were violated, it has not in any way diminished our faith that the truth will eventually prevail and justice will triumph. I should, therefore, like to express the hope of His Majesty's Government, while we examine our agenda containing various very important items relating to world peace and security, that we might be able to deal with these matters in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter so that oppressed people will be able to achieve their political, economic and social freedom, and to curb the aggression of those who have not heeded United Nations resolutions and have consistently refused to recognize the right of peoples to live in their own homeland peacefully and in security.\n293.\tSince 1948, people in our region have been living in the shadow of constant unrest and upheaval due to the violations of the Charter by the aggressor and his non-compliance with various United Nations resolutions. On many occasions our region has been subjected to military incursions of the racist Zionists with the result that Arab Palestine was occupied by those alien forces. As if this were not enough, the Zionists embarked upon an expansion by occupying territories belonging to neighboring Arab States in total violation of the principles of international law, which prohibit the acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force, challenging thereby the authority of the United Nations and disregarding its various resolutions.\n294.\tAt this stage, I do not wish to go into all the details of the Palestine problem, at the heart of which lies the question of Jerusalem and the rights of the Palestinians made homeless and stateless by the Zionists. These Palestinians have been living nurturing the hope that they would be able to return to their homeland to exercise their right to self-determination. There have been many victims of this occupation.\n295.\tHowever, I should like to mention here the unremitting efforts exerted by Arabs, coupled with those of well-intentioned friendly countries, to find a solution and to co-operate with friendly States in their search for a solution to the Palestinian question which would ultimately bring peace in the region based on equity, justice and self-determination in our region. The position of Saudi Arabia on this question has, on many occasions, been made known from this rostrum.\n2%. We continue to proclaim it. In other words, there should be a total Israeli withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied as a result of repeated Israeli aggression. Arab Jerusalem should be returned to its rightful Arab inhabitants since this Holy City is sacred to hundreds of millions of Arabs and non-Arabs whether they be Moslem or Christian. We must also make it abundantly clear that the Palestinian people should exercise their right to self-determination.\n297.\tThe position of Saudi Arabia is in conformity with that of other Arab and Moslem countries, as expressed at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers, from 5 to 9 September 1973, and also at the Islamic Summit Conference in Lahore in 1974.\n298.\tThe non-aligned countries and the countries of the third world, as well as the OAU, have made their position clear by condemning Israeli aggression and have called upon the aggressor to withdraw from all the occupied territories. The large majority of countries in the world have taken a stand on this question. Some even went to the extent of warning Israel to abandon its aggression.\n299.\tIsrael persisted in defying the will of the inter-national community and the resolutions of the United Nations, and has thus become a symbol of aggression, like those remaining regimes which base their policies on racial discrimination, such as South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. It is therefore not surprising that Israel has found itself isolated from the international community blinded, as it were, to the impact which its aggressive acts has had in arousing the conscience of mankind. We believe that if total withdrawal from all Arab territories is not carried out, it will be extremely difficult to establish peace in the Middle East. That is the kind of peace which all regard as being essential for the broader peace and security in the world.\n300.\tWe also hope that Spain will adopt the Arab position as regards the situation of occidental Sahara, to consolidate the good relations which exist between Arabs and Spain. We abide by these relations and we hope that they will be strengthened as far as possible.\n301.\tThe world is in the midst of severe trials and tribulations. The policy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia may be summed up as follows.\n302.\tFirst, Saudi Arabia, as a member of the inter-national community, is deeply conscious of all its responsibilities to that community. It has aided some countries, and will contribute to the development bank funds; it has also granted contributions to IMF and to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, so that they may be able to finance development projects in developing countries. I have informed the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, of this. I should also like to state on behalf of His Majesty King Faisal and his Government that we shall also be making a grant of $30 million to the emergency fund. In this connexion, I attended the meeting last Friday on the invitation of the Secretary-General, for which I should like to thank him.\n303.\tSecondly, aware of its share of these responsibilities to the international community, Saudi Arabia hopes that all the countries of the world will appreciate its position and not make oil-producing countries a target for unjustified criticism and covert threats.\n304.\tThirdly, the position of Saudi Arabia as regards the price of oil is well known by all. While adopting this position, Saudi Arabia hopes that the big Powers and industrial and non-industrial countries alike will do their utmost to put an end to the rampant inflation and control the spiraling prices of finished products, raw materials and foodstuffs, so that the developing countries are not adversely affected.\n305.\tThis is not the time to go into the other items listed on our agenda, which we will deal with when they are discussed in the General Assembly and its main Committees.\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed a pleasure and a privilege for me to take this opportunity to join all those colleagues who have spoken before me to express the deep satisfaction and sense of fulfillment which we all share in Ambassador Bouteflika's assumption of the high and responsible office of the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His unanimous election is a clear testimony to the high personal regard, esteem and confidence which he enjoys in the Assembly, as well as the recognition of the great respect and consideration which we all have for his great country and people. We are proud indeed of the leading role which Algeria, a sister African country, has always played and continues to play with tenacity and devotion in the cause of freedom, justice and peace for all mankind. We are fully confident that with his experience and background, and his total dedication to peace, freedom and justice, his term of office as President of this august Assembly will be crowned with success.\n264.\tMay I also pay tribute to and congratulate his distinguished predecessor in office, Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador, for the efficient and successful manner in which he directed the work of the twenty eighth session of the General Assembly as well as the historic sixth special session.\n265.\t\tOn behalf of my Government, I would also wish to pay tribute to our able and distinguished Secretary General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whom we had the pleasure of welcoming in the Gambia earlier this year, for his unswerving dedication to the principles and purposes of the Charter and his constant and untiring efforts for peace and justice throughout the world.\n266.\tIt is with great satisfaction that my delegation welcomes the admission of three new Members to the Organization during this session. Considering the close proximity between the Gambia and GuineaBissau, and the affinity and complete solidarity between our peoples, I take particular pleasure in welcoming the Republic of GuineaBissau. Throughout their struggle for freedom and national sovereignty, we have always stood by our valiant brothers and neighbors. I am certain that our two small but determined countries will continue to cooperate in every field for the advancement of our peoples and for the maintenance of peace and justice. As we welcome GuineaBissau to the United Nations, we cannot help but express our hope that very soap Angola and Mozambique will also take their rightful place in the community of nations.\n267.\tI also wish to welcome Grenada and Bangladesh, two sister countries in our great Commonwealth, and look forward to closer relations and positive cooperation between our countries and peoples for creative works of peace and progress for all mankind.\n268.\tWe extend our deep sympathy to the Government and people of Honduras in the disaster which has brought distress and suffering to that country. We sincerely hope that timely assistance by the world community will enable the brave people of Honduras to surmount their present difficulties and that life will soon return to normal in that great country.\n269.\tI should like to reiterate here today the abounding faith which the Republic of the Gambia places in the United Nations for achieving, maintaining and guaranteeing global peace. At the same time we realize that world peace is hard to attain without freedom and justice for all. But freedom and justice cannot be realized in an international economic system fraught with inequities, exploitation and indifference. We therefore believe that the present world economic system needs to be drastically restructured to reflect the aspirations and expectations of the vast majority of mankind, particularly the peoples of the developing world.\n270.\tThe recent sixth special session of the Assembly, which met to discuss raw materials and economic development, demonstrated the growing concern with which those problems are viewed. The United Nations has a vital role to play, not only in ensuring world peace and security, but also in redressing the present inequitable world economic system. In effect, the two things are inseparable, for without doing the latter we cannot succeed in the former.\n271.\tThe developing countries are struggling to build up their economies with a view to improving the standard of living of their people; but inequitable terms of trade, imported inflation and, recently , the energy crisis are together neutralizing all efforts in that direction. More needs to be done to find lasting solutions to those problems; and while the search for such solutions goes on, let us not forget the plight of the least developed countries, which are the hardest hit of all.\n272.\tIn these days, when war has become so costly and destructive, so terrible in its impact and so unpredictable in its results, it is incredible that Members of the Organization still resort to it to settle their disputes. My Government is totally opposed to the threat or use of force for the settlement of disputes, believing as it does that in the United Nations we have the machinery for the peaceful settlement of differences among nations.\n273.\tWe welcome the change in attitude evinced by the new regime in Portugal towards the liberation of the Portuguese territories in Africa. The recognition of the inalienable rights of the peoples of those territories to freedom and self-determination has not been achieved without much suffering and sacrifice. But the suffering and sacrifice have not been in vain. It is to be hoped that the United Nations and its specialized agencies will in due course rally to the call of those countries for assistance in the difficult task of nation building.\n274.\tThe freedom and independence of Angola and Mozambique will, of course, create a new situation in the southern part of Africa. The struggle against the bastion of racial repression, apartheid South Africa, is bound to be intensified and a confrontation between black and white appears to be inevitable unless South Africa changes its apartheid policy in time. It is sincerely to be hoped that the leaders in South Africa will see reason before it is too late. Similarly, the racist regime of Ian Smith in Rhodesia should take stock of the situation and come to honorable terms with the African majority, to avert a holocaust.\n275.\tThe international community has a heavy responsibility in ensuring that the fundamental rights of peoples everywhere are respected. Enslaved and oppressed peoples will always fight to assert their freedom and their rights. The theater of hostilities could therefore shift from IndoChina and the Middle East to southern Africa. My Government accordingly believes that the struggle against racism and oppression is a global responsibility which no Member of the United Nations can escape.\n276.\tIn referring briefly to the situation in the Middle East, I would again call for a speedy solution to the problems of that area. The present state of uneasy peace in that part of the world should not divert our attention from the necessity for Israel to withdraw from ail occupied Arab lands, and to respect and restore the rights of the Palestinian people. A people cannot be forcibly ejected from its territory and be expected to acquiesce in the illegal and immoral acquisition of that territory. So long as the basic cause of the conflict in the Middle East -the forcible ejection of the Palestinians -remains, the region will continue to be a hotbed of hostilities, war and destruction.\n277.\tWhen the sixth special session convened, thanks to the farsighted vision of the President of the great country which the President of this Assembly represents, there was a glimmer of hope that at last the consciences of Member States had been awakened to the array of grave economic and social problems which threaten the very existence of the third world. It was expected that this would impel the developed world to demonstrate a greater moral and political commitment to the realization of our development goals. Despite those hopes, the international monetary crisis, imported inflation, the deterioration in the terms of trade and aid, and prevalent drought conditions continue to pose grave problems to the third world. No one will deny that the least developed countries are having to bail out fast in order merely to keep afloat. For the developing countries it would appear that aid will have to be accompanied by a disproportionate amount of high-quality technical assistance, to execute rather than to advise. Emergency aid must also go hand in hand with broad development efforts. Such development efforts, if immediate, will have to be based on inadequate data, with relatively high risks. But for many of us poorer nations it is that or nothing.\n278.\tOn the question of inflation, it is unfortunate that in the industrialized countries this phenomenon is not only showing signs of gaining renewed strength but may well be accompanied by a sharp slowdown of economic activity -in other words a general recession in the industrialized world. The consequences of a persistent fall in export earnings, coupled with soaring prices for imported commodities, could be disastrous for the economies of many of us.\n279.\tThe Gambia, along with the other members of the SudanoSahelian subregion and other parts of Africa, has been facing for the past few years the problems of severe and prolonged drought conditions. In the Gambia, annual rainfall has decreased to an alarming extent over the past three years. This has resulted in reduced yields in some parts of the country and complete crop failure in others.\n280.\tWhile local food production has drastically decreased, it has been revealed by our recent population census that approximately 10 per cent of the population are nonGambians, representing a rapid increase in migrants from surrounding countries over the last three years. That increase, which has no doubt resulted from the drought, has compounded our problems of procuring food, precipitated land problems relating to settlement and farming, and put an immense strain on our social and medical facilities. While friendly countries have been responsive to the critical and urgent needs of our drought stricken populations, continued and intensified international effort will be needed for the foreseeable future if those populations are to be brought back on the road to recovery. The drought conditions in certain parts of the world today must be regarded as a global problem, thereby strengthening the sense of solidarity and genuine good will that is required if we are to meet the challenge of such natural calamities.\n281.\tIn Caracas, a little over a month ago, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea adjourned its work at the end of a 10 week session. I am pleased to reiterate our sentiments of admiration and gratitude to the friendly Government and people of the Republic of Venezuela for the warm hospitality, solicitude and attention which characterized the stay of our delegation in that country.\n282.\tThe Gambia is a developing country, dependent predominantly on an agrarian economy and under difficult constraints of Sahelian soil and unfavorable climatic conditions over the last few years. Nevertheless, my Government continues to ensure that the resources available to support our dense population and to provide for its material progress and protection are utilized to the full. Thus, we attached a great deal of hope to the deliberations and outcome of the Caracas Conference. The reports we have received so far on the work of the Conference have given us cause for guarded and cautious optimism. I regret to say, however, and without prejudice to the positive achievements of the Conference, that we have been persuaded to suspect that noble and well-intended declarations made at the Assembly were not given full practical effect at the Caracas Conference. It is the view of my delegation that the rich industrial and technologically advanced nations, which for so long dominated the world and commanded its resources, aimed at maintaining at Caracas a virtual status quo between the rich and the poor countries, thus serving to perpetuate the domination of the disadvantaged by the rich and powerful. My delegation regrets this attitude, but hopes that when the Conference resumes its work in Geneva next spring the rightful aspirations of the developing countries for a balanced and just regime for the exploitation of the resources of the seas and oceans beyond territorial limits will be matched by the appropriate political will of the rich, technologically advanced and privileged nations. If these hopes are fulfilled, the result would then augur handsomely for peace, justice, and the orderly exploitation of the resources of the global sea and for the equitable sharing of the proceeds for the benefit of all mankind.\n283.\tThe problems of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, however, do not rest here. There is also the situation among the developing countries: the coastal vis-a-vis the landlocked and other geographically disadvantaged States. It is therefore the view of my delegation that, with regard to the proposed exclusive economic zones, the only sensible and realistic approach would be to adopt the OAU Declaration on the Law of the Sea adopted by the Council of Ministers of the OAU at its twenty first session, held at Addis Ababa in May 1973, and at its twenty-third session, held at Mogadiscio in June of this year. This Declaration not only recognizes the sovereignty of the coastal States over the proposed exclusive economic zones and all their resources but will also allow the full participation in the exploitation of the living resources of the zones by neighboring landlocked and other geographically disadvantaged States.\n284.\tWe remain confident that in the present circumstances the continued efforts of the United Nations under its noble Charter represent a fountain of hope. The tenets of the common heritage of mankind, the equal sovereignty of all states and peoples, and the peaceful, orderly settlement of disputes, if given full rein, will surely bring peace, progress and prosperity to all. It is in this context that the Gambian delegation welcomes and supports the proposal, put forward by Morocco [2249th meeting, para 204] and Mauritania [2251st meeting, para. 162], that the problem of Spanish Sahara be referred to the International Court of Justice.\n285.\tFinally, I should like to register my Government's support for the untiring efforts that are being made to usher in a new era of international peace and understanding. It is my conviction that the prevailing spirit of detente between the superPowers will be further extended to cover the politico-economic relationship between the developed and the developing worlds. Global peace cannot endure in the midst of affluence for the few and poverty and penury for the many, and it behooves us all to rededicate ourselves to the search for solutions to the vexatious problems confronting the international community.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, it is a source of particular satisfaction and a great honor for me to start my statement in the general debate in this Assembly by expressing to yoU, on behalf of my Government and my delegation and on my own behalf, our warmest congratulations on the significant manner in which this supreme body of our Organization elected you President of its twenty-ninth session. Your vast knowledge, experience and diplomatic skills constitute the best guarantee for the successful conclusion of the work of this Assembly . May I also avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Leopoldo Benites most sincerely on the most skillful manner in which he presided over the work of the last regular session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n135.\tIt is with similar satisfaction that I express my most affectionate welcome to the States of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau, which have now entered the United Nations. We are convinced that their participation in this world forum will make an effective contribution to the cause of maintaining and strengthening world peace.\n136.\tIn the present general debate, as it has done in past ones, the State of El Salvador wishes, through me, to state its views on some far-reaching aspects of contemporary international realities so as to contribute to the efforts exerted by the United Nations in its struggle to achieve a better world for all mankind.\n137.\tThe economic problems which beset the world society have become a grave crisis, and the present channels of co-operation and exchange do not meet the needs of a mankind which is in the process of unparalleled economic and social change. The widening gulf between developed and developing countries makes it urgently necessary to seek effective, practical, generally-accepted solutions. Adequate ways can be found if we manage to determine the reciprocal advantages which the developed and developing countries would derive if the latter improved their level of economic progress.\n138.\tThe establishment of points of common interest may be the basis for the developed countries to manifest the political will to co-operate in the efforts to develop the backward countries. That political will is necessary for the viability of measures taken in response to the shortcomings of the world economic system. But we believe that there is at present no such political will of sufficient magnitude.\n139.\tIn connexion with the foregoing, it is most important to mention the results and projections of that great international event, the recently-held second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held in Caracas from 20 June to 29 August of this year. The facilities for that Conference were provided by the Government of Venezuela, which also created an atmosphere of confidence and friendship propitious for the success of its work. It was in Caracas that we started work on matters of substance, since the first session, held in New York in December 1973, was devoted to organizational and procedural questions.\n140.\tThe 10 weeks in Caracas resulted in the establishment of the bases for negotiation, which, we hope, will culminate in a general agreement in 1975. Indeed, it must be remembered that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction had to pass over the preparatory work for the Conference; accordingly, in Caracas not only was that gap filled, but, furthermore, the channels of dialog were vastly improved as we delved more deeply that ever into the thorniest subjects, observing in the process that positions which had been very divergent in the past tended almost to converge. More eloquently than is reflected in its records, the Conference proved that in the years that have elapsed since 1967, when the United Nations launched the great theme of the international zone of the seabed as a common heritage of mankind, there has been a ripening of the general conditions necessary to produce a general agreement establishing a new regime for the seas based on the equality of States, their real claims to their marine resources, and the linking of these to the great problems of development which the international community has yet to solve.\n141.\tIt must be pointed out that the purpose of the Conference is not to alter the bases of the 1958 Conference but to establish a new regime for the seas which will be in accord with the principles of justice as required in the present-day world.\n142.\tAmong the achievements of the Caracas Conference there is the broad support which, regardless of geographical groupings, .was obtained for the concept of the right of the coastal State to a zone adjacent to its coast not to exceed 200 miles. The battle waged for three decades by the Latin American countries is thus about to bear fruit. With that prospect, we are warranted in trusting that the third and fourth stages of the Conference, in which we have high hopes, will recognize not only the interests of the great maritime Powers but also the just aspirations of the developing countries.\n143.\tPraiseworthy too are the repeated efforts of the United Nations in other areas to contribute to the reformulation and eventual solution of the most important world problems. Thus, this year it went into the population problem in depth and in breadth at the World Population Conference, 1974. This is of the utmost importance, since the real effects of the problem have not yet been fully evaluated.\n144.\tPopulation growth, to a considerable extent, determines the process and strategy of development. World-wide co-operation is indispensable so that the effect of this phenomenon on social life will be positive and not constitute a barrier. Population policy must be based on respect for the freedom of man and on the particular circumstances of each country.\n145.\tEl Salvador reiterates its special interest in the progress of the work of formulating a Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, the main objective of which will be the rule of justice and equity in international economic relations. That instrument could contribute to bringing about a more rational distribution of wealth among countries, on the basis of possible common benefits and the elimination of barriers to international trade. In that line of thought, El Salvador considers it important that we study the desirability of setting up a council of economic security which would promote international economic justice as the supreme good.\n146.\tThe year 1974 has been marked by events with delayed and complex consequences in international relations and in the life of each and every one of the States grouped together under the aegis of the United Nations. The holding of the sixth special session of the. General Assembly was the organized response of the international community to the energy crisis, to the growing deterioration in the terms of trade between the industrialized and developing countries and to the export of inflationary elements by the highly developed countries.\n147.\tThe energy crisis started with a shortage of fuel, that almost instantaneously rose in price, draining the foreign exchange reserves of many countries and producing a radical imbalance in the balance of payments, which in turn forced a readjustment in imports and the adoption of extreme economic measures of austerity. A chain of repercussions shook to the very core the economies of many countries: social disquiet, development plans which became mere good intentions, growing disorder in monetary parities and new elements in the vertiginous growth of inflation.\n148.\tOn 1 May 1974, the General Assembly adopted two most important resolutions: the Declaration [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. These resolutions are significant milestones in the process of readjusting international economic relations. Yet, the lack of support on the part of key countries for their implementation that appeared at the 2231st meeting, the last of the sixth special session, jeopardizes the results.\n149.\tWhat is to be obtained as a result of that special session is as yet uncertain. Nevertheless, the Ad hoc Committee on the Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI), which is charged with implementing the resolutions, can play a valuable role in obtaining the needed support to make of these resolutions a real basis for international economic relations.\n150.\tTwo facts are to be emphasized in connexion with the sixth special session of the General Assembly: the maintenance of solidarity among the Group of 77 developing countries which sustain their community of interests vis-a-vis the industrialized countries, despite recent imbalances that were rendered more acute by external pressures on petroleum importers; and the negotiation, of an almost bilateral character, between the Group of 77 and the industrialized countries, which is proof of the enormOus importance in world politics of co-ordination among the developing countries.\n151.\tWhile the General Assembly opens the way to economic relations, positive political achievements have lessened tensions and indirectly assisted in the formation of new international economic relations. Among these positive achievements, which are so promising in 1974, the agreement on the disengagement of troops in the Near East and Portugal's correction of its African policy should be noted. No one can reverse the process of decolonization. An end to the practices of apartheid and discrimination has been emphasized in General Assembly resolutions as a political condition for new international economic relations.\n152.\tSince nuclei of colonialism still exist, it is appropriate for El Salvador emphatically to proclaim its support for the cause of anti-colonialism. Within the colonial system are included both the direct expressions of colonialism, which are clearly becoming fewer and the more subtle forms disguised by various methods and strategies. Claims against colonialism, in their focus, must assume various forms. It is to be hoped that in those regions where the burden of colonialism subsists, the principle of liberty will be claimed without losing sight of the fact that in every case and circumstance the idea of liberty without an economic basis lacks meaning, because it is only a liberty to enjoy what one has not and what, if the present international economic relations are maintained, one will never have.\n153.\tOn the other hand, in General Assembly resolution 2919 (XXVII) of 15 November 1972 the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination was proclaimed, and its activities were inaugurated on 10 December 1973, when we commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That resolution is of historic significance because it clearly states the will of all peoples to eliminate racial discrimination. Such discrimination is an anachronism which denies freedom and can only be overcome if we turn our eyes towards the full observance of human rights and direct international action to that end. We know that this is a responsibility with which the United Nations has been charged since its inception. But we must renew our faith in so laudable an objective.\n154.\tSince the United Nations is committed in various provisions of its Charter to attain and preserve human rights throughout the world, it must have the necessary instrument to discharge this duty fully. It is true that it is a valid legal concept that the establishment or restoration of human rights calls for priority in international action\u2014action on whose effectiveness the establishment of a firm peace throughout the world largely depends.\n155.\tWe must single out the praiseworthy work of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression, which has submitted its final report to the General Assembly [AI9619 and Corr.l]. Aggression has been a subject for study almost since the very beginning of the United Nations, first under the responsibility of the International Law Commission, and later under the aforementioned Special Committee. It should be pointed out that the Special Committee, for methodological reasons, restricted itself in its work to direct aggression, as it indicated in one of its annual reports. Accordingly, there is lacking any consideration of the type of aggression most frequent in the twentieth century, namely economic aggression.\n156.\tWe recognize the progress achieved in this delicate matter, but we note that at present there are ever fewer cases of armed aggression and more and more cases of economic aggression. To reduce agreement to something which is historically in a process of debilitation while ignoring something that is increasing would be to perform something less than a service to the international community. Achievement of this end must be considered a first step, one to be completed with steps that will give real dimension and content to the first one.\n157.\tThe draft definition of aggression submitted to the General Assembly by the Special Committee on the Question of defining Aggression [ibid., para. 22] makes no reference, not even the slightest, to the very important circumstance that aggression includes two types, direct and indirect, as the Special Committee itself took into consideration in the course of its labors and as is evident in its previous reports. The proposal is conceived in terms which suggest that direct aggression is the only possible type of aggression. It was to be expected that the final report of the Special Committee would be consistent with the methodological principles that it had adopted for the discharge of its mandate. It could have recalled what happened with indirect aggression, particularly with economic aggression, in the course of the agreements among the contact groups representing the three principal proposals that were submitted to the Special Committee. The concept of the articles proposed, presented in apparently unconditioned and exhaustive terms, converts all possible aggression into direct aggression consisting in the use of armed force, and, taking a part for the whole, weakens the positive value of the agreement obtained. That outcome favors the great Powers, because in the present state of international relations the cases mentioned in the report have almost Ceased to occur; meanwhile indirect aggression, in its various forms and gradations, remains in the shadows, in a sort of political limbo. It seems necessary to draw the attention of this Assembly to the fact that the definition proposed should be set out in dimensions appropriate to its nature and purposes.\n158.\tI conclude these words by pointing out that the grief at this time being felt by all the countries of Central America serves to awaken feelings of solidarity that at times are momentarily forgotten. Though the enormity of the disasters varies, El Salvador shares with its sister Republics of Central America the same sufferings, a point which may itself be regarded as a promising factor for better understanding.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to begin my statement with congratulations, on behalf of Nicaragua and of my delegation, and on my own behalf, to Mr. Bouteflika on his election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Mr. Bouteflika  distinguished gifts as a statesman and his prudent strength as a young diplomat assure us that he will fulfill his duties with skill and intelligence.\n214.\tTo his no less illustrious predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, I wish to extend, through our President, the expression of our deepest appreciation for the wise and effective manner in which he conducted the work of the General Assembly during the last two sessions. It brought great credit to his country, Ecuador, and to all of our Latin America.\n215.\tI wish also to ask that our greetings be conveyed to the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim. We have followed with interest all he has done for the cause of peace and co-operation among peoples, and his efforts to maintain the Organization at the service of the lofty interests of mankind.\n216.\tThe disaster that recently struck our sister Republic of Honduras, which also to a lesser degree struck Guatemala and my own country, prompt me to give public expression of our condolences to the delegation of Honduras. The thousands of victims who lost their lives in the fury of the hurricane, the tens of thousands left homeless, and the material damages that have already been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, are for Honduras a most grave and distressing blow that can have very serious repercussions in the life of that Republic in the future.\n217.\tIn the area of Central America, there tan be no country which appreciates better than Nicaragua the gravity of the natural disaster that our sister Republic of Honduras has suffered, inasmuch as in 1972 an earthquake destroyed our capital city, causing great loss of life and material damage and leaving behind it problems which even today we are still trying stubbornly to overcome. We have had two years of constant work by the National Emergency Committee and of exemplary dedication on the part of the present President-Elect of Nicaragua, General Anastasio Somoza Debayle. But in spite of everything and in spite of the efforts being made day after day by the people of Nicaragua to overcome such painful realities, the mark of the tragedy still re-mains present in the economic and social life of our people.\n218.\tIn keeping with the fraternal bonds that unite the peoples of Honduras and Nicaragua, the Government and the people of my country have mobilized their effort while attending at the same time to those parts of our own country that were affected by the hurricane to bring our modest but relatively generous assistance to our brothers in Honduras. And in that task of assistance several heroic Nicaraguans have given their lives.\n219.\tThis new natural disaster that has struck the area of Central America brings out the special importance of the allocation to the Second Committee of the item entitled \\\"Assistance in cases of natural disaster and other disaster situations\\\" [agenda item 60], the humanitarian aspects of which could be considered by the Third Committee during its consideration of item 12. Unfortunately, it would seem that the international community has failed adequately to understand the fact that the problem of natural disasters cannot continue to be treated as one involving only mercy and charity.\n220.\tThe concentration and the ever more rapid growth of population, the greater areas being brought under cultivation and incorporated in the economic life of communities, and the complexity of the economic and social system all mean that natural disasters produce massive problems which, through the disturbances and disruptions they create, affect not only the economic aspects but also the social, political and institutional aspects of national life.\n221.\tHere we should like to refer to the third resolution adopted by the Committee of the Whole of the Economic Commission for Latin America.*1 It was adopted at the seventh extraordinary session to consider what action should be taken to help Nicaragua after the 1972 earthquake. It recommended the preparation of a regional plan for Latin America that would promote effective and orderly action in dealing with the disruptive effects, over the short term and medium term, of natural disasters.\n222.\tThose countries which are situated along the so-called volcanic chain of the Pacific, particularly those countries of lesser economic and social development, and those with coasts on the Indian Ocean and in the Caribbean, as well as the countries of the Sahel, have been hit by an awesome number of natural catastrophes and have shown great vulnerability to the social and economic effects of these disasters.\n223.\tThe delegation of Nicaragua, with conviction born of our own distressing experience, cannot be satisfied with mere expressions of condolences for Honduras; urgent problems of a humanitarian nature must be tackled. I wish today to appeal to the international community, and particularly to Latin America, to confront the problems of Honduras and promote a broad program of reconstruction and development for the vast area affected; and I have instructed my delegation to remain open to whatever initiatives may be proposed to this end:\n224.\tWe also hope that the study of the item on natural disasters allocated to the Second Committee will lead to conclusions and positive action going beyond the mere passing expression of humanitarian sentiment.\n225.\tThere is another problem of ominous dimensions and serious consequences that directly afflicts societies whose land has been convulsed in the way described, although, perhaps, this problem is not limited only to them. I am referring to hunger, not to problems of nutrition, which can be an offshoot of affluence. I am speaking of the physical reality of eating to survive the elementary problem of existing and not the qualitative problem of living humanely. Indeed, hunger is a daily reality for one fifth of the population of the world.\n226.\tThe secretariat of the World Food Conference has recognized that the present food crisis is the most serious that mankind has faced in the past 40 yeafS. The immediate effects of this crisis have been shortages and higher prices of all foodstuffs and increases in the costs of services necessary to produce and market food. To that must be added the growing seriousness of the situation of the workers, the sharpening of tensions and difficulties in society, and the growing, widespread inflation, with all the social problems that it entails.\n227.\tThe situation becomes a tragedy when one appreciates the fact that the sectors most directly affected are not the affluent, but rather the less advantaged, sectors in all political systems: small landowners, small farmers and those who rent land, the rural landless, the unemployed of the cities and the countryside, and generally those with the least buying power in society, including a high percentage of infants and children.\n228.\tHere again, my delegation hopes that this session of the General Assembly will put forward effective recommendations and that it will talk about the causes of the problem, about which something can be done. We must not content ourselves with merely saying that the artificial increase in the prices of raw materials has led to the higher prices of fertilizers which are necessary to produce food; we must also take a hard look at scientific research which is focused exclusively on these two choices; moreover, we must think about the decision-making process which has led to that situation, and we must also consider the economic problems and the cultural climate that produced the consumer habits that have created the problem. Just as the consideration of what may seem to be the cause of the problem leads to its underlying causes, so it might well be that remedies for these underlying causes may prove to be the best solution to the problem itself.\n229.\tWe are all well aware of the fact that the world has been living through a period of economic instability with serious repercussions. The persistence of under-development and the growing gap between the wealthy and poor countries are a noticeable result. The interminable escalation and succession of crises in the political, economic and social areas are symptoms. The energy crisis is one of the most dramatic, and it has indeed become the new villain on which the blame for all the ills of the latter part of the twentieth century has been heaped.\n230.\tIn discussing this crisis it is also necessary to talk about all its components. On the one hand, it is not entirely true that the crisis is due to the fact that the oil-producing countries have created a bloc and have tried to impose their economic views by taking advantage of their monopoly on one raw material. On the other hand, it is not entirely true either that the main reason for the crisis is that the producing countries could no longer tolerate the constant deterioration in the prices of their basic raw materials in the face of the constantly increasing prices of products they were importing, and, therefore, had to take defensive action for which they are being blamed today.\n231.\tTo our way of thinking, other equally important aspects of the problem must be pondered. Throughout the decades, international co-operation has been such as to make petroleum a fundamental element of modern civilization, and the production of energy has been a sector requiring high concentrations of capital and technology. For some time now\nwe have been laying the groundwork for a very expensive monopoly, neglecting the development ; of alternative forms of technology that might use traditional sources of energy, such as hydraulic energy, which would have prevented a concentration of power in one sector where monopoly was possible.\n232.\tIn our view, alternatives to be sought in the future must not create an undue dependence on certain sources of energy that can be monopolized, such as oil and nuclear power; we must not concentrate on sectors requiring excessive concentrations of capital or technology. The important thing, however, is that we take an overall approach to the problem of development. At the sixth special session of the General Assembly held this year, the groundwork was laid for a program of international action, and consideration was given to the problems of development and international co-operation. We must realize that a major effort must be made to create a radically new economic order.\n233.\tOne of the corner-stones of such a new order, with which the Government of Mexico and the peoples of Latin America are so deservedly associated, should be the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which must enshrine norms and principles ensuring and orienting this new universal economic order: the integrity and inviolability of the physical and cultural heritage of peoples, effective sovereignty over national resources and economic development leading to tangible benefits for the people of the world; the regulation of foreign investment, particularly the investments of transnational companies, which must be a. tool for co-operation and progress and not a means of domination; the banning of economic pressure as a political weapon to be used against the sovereignty of States; and the right of nationalization and expropriation of property existing on national territory, regardless of the nationality of the owner.\n234.\tThis is a difficult task. Let us have no illusions about what we can achieve at one session of the General Assembly. There have been few occasions in history so fraught with danger and challenges, but it is in the very nature of things that the United Nations should confront these situations, and no one expects it to act hastily. The interests at stake are great indeed, the consequences of failure are serious, and we must not act with undue haste.\n235.\tA very telling example of all this is what happened at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. From the time it was convened we realized that the Caracas meeting would not be the end of the matter. We realized that it was not possible to reach decisions on substantive issues when practically 50 per cent of the participants had not taken part in the work of the Preparatory Committee, and the complexity of the task made it impossible for the Preparatory Committee to issue sufficient documentation and undertake the additional work of fully distributing it. However, there are those who clamor for speedy agreements and already speak in terms of the \\\"Caracas failure\\\".\n236.\tI believe that it is appropriate to express here the gratitude of the Government of Nicaragua to the Government and the people of Venezuela for their invaluable efforts to create a propitious climate\nfor the important deliberations of the Conference, and to extend to its President, Mr. Amerasinghe, and the other officers of the Conference a vote of confidence and the congratulations of my country on the wise way the work was conducted.\n237.\tIt is my Government's firm belief that a mature approach, prudence and a knowledge of the facts alone can serve as the major elements in the work of reaffirmation and creation of law governing a more equitable international order. That is and was the framework of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It must promote the deliberations and efforts of the international community, which have already been begun, to regulate the proper use of the sea.\n238.\tThis cautious approach should not be abandoned in dealing with any of the other problems which beset mankind. The population problem is obviously a cultural problem which goes far beyond the sovereign authority of States and is closely related to individual human rights. International co-operation in this area must not be aimed at speedy results. While it is true that the immoderate growth of population creates economic and social problems which afflict our nations, it is also true that certain spiritual and political sectors say that not only should a brake be put on the growth of population, but its causes should be studied and uprooted and a more equitable order created.\n239.\tInternational co-operation must not be aimed at perpetuating the status quo. It must be aimed at the genuine development of institutions. It must replace confrontation by procedures which will promote the action of the peoples of the world. After a quarter of a century of considering aggression solely in terms of military aggression, we now find that economic aggression and the attendant use of resources and financial institutions have moved to the forefront of international relations. There can be no doubt that, given its dangers and the risk of armed struggle to which economic aggression leads, the way to deal with it is not simply to define it but to proscribe the acts which express it.\n240.\tThat was, in fact, the course chosen by the major Powers in order to avoid the risk of armed confrontations among them. There were agreements such as those relating to disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear tests, increased co-operation in the peaceful use of a growing number of technological developments which had been used for the purpose of war. These are all practical measures which, while making it possible to avoid confrontation, created and strengthened a new sense of international morality which has become the hallmark of international relations.\n241.\tThere is no reason why the smaller countries of the world should adopt a different approach or different procedures. We must realize that confrontations have tended to shift to the smaller countries and have created an unnecessary market for armaments, diverting resources which are needed for the progress and well-being of our peoples and maintaining a climate of tension which in no way assists the principal tasks of development and progress.\n242.\tThe general situation in the Middle East deteriorated seriously last year with the outbreak of the crisis in Cyprus and the recrudescence of the Palestine question. My Government has always advocated a slow, cautious approach to the various points of view. We advocate careful negotiation and the use of peaceful procedures. In particular, in the case of Cyprus, my Government believes that the international community should do more than offer simple declarations of good will. Every aspect of the problem of Cyprus involves the risk of a confrontation and a violation of a basic principle of the Charter which cannot be ignored by our Organization. The right to self-determination, non-interference in the internal affairs of a country, territorial integrity, proper protection of minorities, and so on, are alt principles which must be maintained and protected, and that is the view which we must firmly uphold.\n243.\tMy delegation has noted with pleasure that the number of countries which wish their areas to be nuclear-free areas has increased. We welcome pressure to prohibit nuclear tests. We welcome restrictions on harmful military activities or other activities which alter the climate or have an adverse effect on the quality of the environment. We share these hopes and fears and we are firmly convinced that the smaller peace-loving countries of the world must make a major effort to ensure that atomic power is not increased or used and that the nuclear Powers respect the firm determination of those countries which wish to proscribe its use and keep their areas of the world free from this terror.\n244.\tIn particular, we should consider the application of earlier resolutions of the General Assembly relating to the signing and ratification of Additional Protocol I of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), and we hope that all the nuclear Powers will respect the nuclear-free zone agreed upon by the countries of Latin America. Together with many other countries of our continent, Nicaragua has sponsored a draft resolution which will be circulated at a later date.7\n245.\tThis community of nations, with so many formidable challenges and opportunities ahead of it, has recently welcomed the new States of Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. With their admission we have gained the enthusiasm and fighting spirit of new nations which have recently acquired statehood and have values that will serve to enrich the human treasure.\n246.\tParticularly, we wish to welcome the delegation of Grenada, which has joined the family of Latin American countries. Grenada has been very much concerned to promote the development of our regional institutions. We believe that because of our common history and geography there will be many opportunities for us to co-operate and we extend our very best wishes to this new Member from the Caribbean.\n247.\tFinally, may I express confidence in our President's abilities and skills and may I pledge to him the frill co-operation of my delegation in the joint effort to see to it that this session of the General Assembly is productive and fruitful.\n"

Let me therefore join with other speakers before me in offering you my own sincere congratulations as well as the felicitations of the Tanzania delegation for the honor and confidence placed in you by the General Assembly. I should also wish to take this opportunity to extend to you and to the great people of Algeria fraternal greetings of good will and best wishes from the Government and people of Tanzania, not only because you come from Africa but also because your country's struggle for freedom has inspired many a gallant freedom fighter throughout the world.\n141.\tIt is also with great pleasure that I extend on behalf of the Tanzania delegation and myself my deep appreciation to Mr. Benites for the great services he rendered to the Organization in the exemplary manner he presided over the twenty-eighth and sixth special sessions of the General Assembly.\n142.\tIt is with a great sense of satisfaction that I join those who have preceded me in welcoming Guinea- Bissau, Grenada and Bangladesh as Members of the United Nations. To these new Members my delegation pledges its readiness to co-operate at all times in our common struggle to realize the noble objectives so eloquently enunciated in the Charter of the United Nations.\n143.\tThe independence of Guinea-Bissau came after many years of bitter fighting and among those who lost their lives is the great son of the revolution, brother Amilcar Cabral. It is terrible that he should have been assassinated on the eve of victory. But as his martyrdom propelled his people to greater victories, so will his memory for ever remain as a guiding torch in the reconstruction of Guinea-Bissau and the consolidation and protection of its hard-won independence, for which he dedicated his entire life. We equally pay homage to the memory of that great Mozambican, Mr. Eduardo Mondlane, who lost his life in similar circumstances and for a similar noble cause.\n144. In welcoming the new State of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations, Tanzania, and indeed the entire international community, cannot but express its profound sense of relief that at long last the Portuguese colonial system that brought so much terror and suffering to the people in Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola and other colonies under Portuguese rule on the African continent is coming to an end.\n145.\tIt is naturally gratifying that the new leadership in Portugal has accepted the right to independence of the former Portuguese colonies. In this connexion the Tanzania Government is highly encouraged by the agreement between Portugal and the Frente de Libertaao de Mozambique [FRE LI MO] which will provide for the establishment of a transitional Government in Mozambique leading to the independence of that country on 25 June 1975. It is the fervent hope of the Government of Tanzania that an agreement will soon be reached for the total decolonization of Angola, enabling the people of that country to realize their long-cherished and legitimate aspirations.\n146.\tJudging from the uncertainties that followed the change of government in Portugal on 25 April this year, it can be admitted that it was not an easy decision for the new Portuguese leadership to accept the principle of decolonization. But there could be no other alternative. For the inevitable collapse of the Caetano colonial tyranny was irreversibly guaranteed by the unflinching commitment of the gallant struggle of the oppressed masses in the colonial territories.\n147.\tTanzania takes particular note of the. declaration by Portugal that there will be no room for neo-colonialist relationships with the new emerging States. This is as it should be. There is no reason why the people of Portugal should feel any sense of loss or humiliation. On the contrary, there is every reason to be satisfied. For the new relationship now emerging between Portugal and its former colonial territories will certainly contribute to a climate of mutual trust and better co-operation not only between Portugal and the new States, but also between Portugal and the rest of the world. At any rate, we in Africa have always stated that the struggle for freedom and human dignity on the continent has never been based on racist concepts; rather it has been a struggle against oppressive political systems, a struggle which draws its inspiration from an uncompromising commitment to the defense of the sacred dignity and worth of the human person.\n148.\tI wish to note with particular appreciation the important statement made by the Foreign Minister of Portugal, Mr. Mario Soares, in this Assembly at this session [2239th meeting]. That statement was a clear reaffirmation of the policies of the new Portugal in favor of decolonization. It is important that nothing be done to frustrate this commitment. For any nation or group of nations which endeavors in any manner to reverse the present trends in the colonies will stand for ever condemned in the eyes of the African peoples, and indeed of the entire world community, as a betrayer of the cause of freedom in Africa. I take this opportunity to wish the present Government of Portugal most sincerely every success in its efforts to eradicate the smoldering remnant forces of fascism, which have for over half a century oppressed the people of Portugal and for over 500 years caused untold human suffering on the African continent.\n149.\tThe progress towards freedom achieved in Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau stands in sharp contrast to the tragedy of Namibia, Rhodesia and the non-white population in South Africa. In recent months developments in Namibia have burst upon the outside world as a harsh reminder of the nature of South African colonial rule. For in Namibia the African people have resolutely rejected continuing to live under terror and have taken up arms under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] to defend their dignity. Neither South Africa nor the apologists of apartheid can deny that, in spite of the overwhelming might of the South African armed police State, bitter fighting has been going on in Namibia against South African colonialism. Because of this struggle and its successes, the colonial authorities in Namibia have embarked on savage and brutal torture. Hundreds of thousands of people are being arrested, imprisoned, and sometimes shot on the spot. The brutal floggings of women, children and men in Namibia must shock every man and woman of conscience. The unfortunate faithful allies of South Africa -and we saw some of them yesterday -ought to hang their heads in shame, or else they must be completely devoid of compassion and human feelings.\n150.\tThe situation in the British colony of Rhodesia is no less tragic than that obtaining in Namibia and South Africa. Nearly 10 years after the racist minority settlers rebelled against the United Kingdom there seems to be no hope of an end to this problem. And as the years go by the settlers in Rhodesia, actively assisted in all fields by the South African racist regime, intensify their oppression of the black majority in that colony. The people of Zimbabwe, however, have taken up arms to fight to regain their freedom and human dignity. And they are doing so in spite of the great odds against them. That they have scored great victories is no longer a matter of doubt, for the panic and the fear now handing the settlers in Rhodesia are a clear indication of the great victories of the freedom struggle. It is incumbent upon every Member of the United Nations to ensure that no action is taken by its nationals or its institutions to frustrate the struggle for freedom in Rhodesia. It is in this respect that my Government, and indeed the entire African continent, have become distressed and angered by the behavior of many countries, and the companies operating under their jurisdiction, in breaking the economic sanctions against Rhodesia, these violations by companies , and certain States Members of the United Nations, in particular the United States, constitute open support of the evil oppressors of the people of Zimbabwe.\n151.\tIt must be pointed out again that the problem of Rhodesia is legally a matter within the competence of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. Since the rebellion in 1965 the United Kingdom has conducted numerous negotiations with the rebels to try to end the rebellion. The African majority have always regarded these negotiations with deep suspicion because for the most part they have been based on the assumption that the rebellion can be legalized by giving independence to the colony On the basis of a constitution which will leave the African majority at the mercy of the settlers. That is why the United Nations has insisted and must continue to insist that there should be no independence until majority rule has been achieved. The African people have rejected all other alternatives, as has been evident since the fate of the 1971 proposals for a settlement and the Pearce Commission. The African people in Zimbabwe will never participate in attempts to find solutions which in essence amount to asking them to legalize their state of subjugation. Therefore, any agreement that is not based on majority rule can only be regarded by the African people as a criminal betrayal. The responsibility of the United kingdom in this matter is therefore heavy. The United Kingdom must not commit a double betrayal. More specifically, there can be no meaningful negotiations without the full participation of the legitimate leaders of the African people in Zimbabwe, and in particular Joshua Nkomo and the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole. It should be pointed out that, in a joint communique issued in 1973 in Ottawa at the last meeting of Commonwealth Heads of State and Government, the Government of the United Kingdom gave an undertaking to work to secure the release of those two leaders. The Government of Tanzania is anxiously waiting for Her Majesty's Government to fulfill that undertaking.\n152.\tIn South Africa, the oppression and humiliation to which the African people have been subjected for decades become more intense. The millions of the non-while population in that country have suffered too long, and their agony must constitute an acute moral challenge of immense proportion to every member of this international community. For here is a situation in which millions of innocent victims remain perpetually condemned to a state of abject misery. They cry and weep, and their bitter tears are an indictment of the conspiracy of silence and neglect by those who have been largely responsible for encouraging South Africa in its unrelenting rule of terror. We in Tanzania have protested and will continue to protest against this criminal conspiracy.\n153.\tMy Government has viewed with distress, and has unequivocally condemned, all attempts to have any relations with South Africa. We have, for example, called for the total isolation of South Africa from all sporting events. That is why Tanzania condemned the recent tour of South Africa and Rhodesia by the rugby team from the United Kingdom. My Government has equally vehemently condemned the military collaboration that exists between some Western countries, especially France, and South Africa. The recent joint naval maneuvers by the United Kingdom and South Africa are also a case in point.\n154.\tWe call on the Security Council to examine, as a matter of urgency, the question of imposing economic sanctions against South Africa and of re- enforcing the arms embargo against that country. At the same time, a vigorous and more co-ordinated campaign should now be mounted by the United Nations and its specialized agencies to dissuade foreign companies from investing in the South African economy. Arguments that economic investments in South Africa by foreign companies bring anything other than increased misery to the majority of the African people are wholly fallacious. Such argumentation is definitely meant as a campaign to mislead the world. The fact is that, as the economy of South Africa has expanded, so has the misery of the non- white population in that country.\n155.\tTo make matters worse, the development of South Africa by foreign companies has enabled that country to embark on the manufacture of deadly weapons to be used not only for internal repression but also for external aggression. My Government has been seriously concerned at persistent reports that certain Western countries have now started to purchase South African arms. An example of this type of armament is the Crotale or Cactus air defense missile system made in South Africa with the help of a French electronics firm. It is the earnest hope of the people and Government of Tanzania that those countries will find it possible to desist from such purchases, for to do so simply amounts to a criminal collaboration with South Africa in its efforts to increase and refine its oppressive armaments industry. \n156.\tThe Government of Tanzania is now convinced that the time has come for the United Nations to reconsider seriously its relationship with South Africa because of the racist policies of that country. South Africa and its supporters have* often claimed that the outside world has been unfair in its condemnation of the apartheid regime. But what is the truth? There is no place in the world, except in South Africa, where racism forms the basis of the philosophy of the State and is entrenched in the constitution of the country. Secondly, in South Africa we have the equivalent of a State church, the Dutch Reformed Church, whose faith includes as one of its fundamental doctrines the teaching of racial hatred. Because of this situation, the African people in South Africa cannot go to the State for redress as they could do if racial discrimination did not form part of the constitution of that country. South Africa has deliberately refused to heed the call by the international community to change its racist policies,\n157.\tThose reasons alone sufficiently disqualify apartheid South Africa from being a Member of our Organization. For the principles of freedom, racial equality and human dignity enshrined in our Charter cannot and should not be allowed to coexist with the obnoxious policies of the perpetual humiliation and degradation of humanity so notoriously embodied in the doctrine of apartheid. But there are other factors equally powerful which make the continued presence of the apartheid delegation in our Organization both an anachronism and a serious liability to the United Nations. South Africa has chosen the path of consistent violation of the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations. It has shown nothing but utter and absolute contempt and disregard of this Organization.\n158.\tThe record of such violations is well known to all and needs no further elaboration. What, then, is the basis of apartheid South Africa's continued presence in our Organization? What sort of values are the racist authorities attaching to the principles of the Organization? Is it not obvious that, by allowing the Vorster representatives to continue ridiculing our Organization, we are only strengthening those forces wishing to erode the credibility, effectiveness and the prestige of the Organization? We submit that every single day that apartheid South Africa continues to enjoy the rights and privileges of a Member of this Organization, while completely ignoring and violating the corresponding obligations of membership, makes a mockery of the United Nations.\n159.\tFor those obvious reasons, Tanzania considers the continued participation in our Organization of the racists from Pretoria as a serious anomaly needing immediate rectification by the expulsion of apartheid South Africa from this Organization. We strongly believe that by such action the United Nations will be reaffirming the noble objectives and ideals of the Charter. There will be those who will ask us what cause will be served by that act. To them we say, What cause has been served, since the United Nations started, by South Africa's being a Member of this Organization for all those years?\n160.\tThere is no doubt that the developments in the Portuguese colonies have ushered in a new era of hope in southern Africa. The struggle for freedom and human dignity in that area has acquired new momentum. Is it not time for the racist regime in Zimbabwe to see the writing on the wall? Is it not time for the South African colonialists to pay heed to the demands of the international community and immediately to end their illegal occupation of Namibia? Those are not idle questions. Either the South African racist and the Smith regimes draw the necessary conclusions and thus avoid further bloodshed or they continue to behave like ostriches and in the process prolong a confrontation in which they will inevitably be the losers.\n161.\tThe economic and social conditions of the majority of the world's population have never been as grim and desperate as they are at the present moment. While a minority of the world's population seems to be faring better in material welfare and continues to enjoy incredible wealth furnished by unprecedented industrial development, the rest of mankind remains without the basic needs for survival. Admittedly, there are economic and social problems in those countries commonly referred to as the developed countries. But there is absolutely nothing comparable in the developed countries to the mass poverty and the utter destitution in the rest of the world.\n162.\tFor decades, many developing countries have tried hard\u2014I repeat, have tried hard -to escape from their appalling economic and social condition. There can be no question that they have tried very hard. They are still trying and they will continue to do so as long as it is humanly possible. The records of their efforts, whether at the international or the national level, speak for themselves.\n163.\tThe international institutions, especially those working under the auspices of the United Nations, which have sprung up during the last decade or so bear testimony to the efforts by developing countries to try to obtain solutions to their economic ills. The setting up of UNDP, UN I DO and UNCTAD and the creation of development funds such as the United Nations Capital Development Fund are good cases in point. At the national level, our Governments and peoples have been trying desperately by various ways and means to break the chains of backwardness afflicting our nations; but, in spite of all these efforts, the economic and social conditions of developing countries have worsened\n164.\tThe fundamental cause of the present lack of development on the part of the developing countries can be found in the unjust relationship that governs the economic and technical co-operation between the minority rich and the majority poor of the world. The developing countries have been toiling to produce more but they have been deprived of the full worth of their products. With few exceptions, the sweat and labor of our people are utterly disproportionate to the price imposed on what they produce. Com-pounding this problem is the problem of currency instability and galloping inflation which are causing great havoc and extreme hardship, especially to many small developing countries. Tanzania believes that the time has come to reject the assumption that all some countries have to do is to act as pawns in the intricate game of international monetary and fiscal policies which are determined by a select group of countries. We completely reject as unacceptable to our people that they should endure misery and deprivation on account of currency upheavals, which in some cases are deliberately set in motion by greedy speculators, ruthless tycoons and capitalists whose major concern is simply to amass a fortune for the sake of a fortune. \n165.\tThis brings me to the problem which is one of the central issues in the present discussion of the current world economic situation. I refer to the question of oil. There can be no doubt that the power to set fair prices of raw materials produced in a country is part of the logical consequence of the acceptance of the principle of sovereignty of the producing country over the raw material in question. But, I repeat, for a developing country like Tanzania to recognize and accept this principle and to express concern at the soaring prices of oil are not incompatible. To many of the developing countries the current high oil prices amount to near economic strangulation.\n166.\tTanzania appreciates some of the limited steps taken to try to alleviate this problem. We feel, however, that oil-producing countries have to consider very seriously how to co-operate much more effectively with many of the non-oil-producing countries to avoid grave economic instability and unnecessary hardship to millions of people throughout the third world. I may add that we hope the oil-producing countries will realize this as an item that could very well spell division in the third world.\n167.\tHaving said that, we in Tanzania must emphatically reject any tendency to distort the real economic issues facing the world by resorting to implicit threats or covert blackmail. Any solution to the present world economic crisis in which many developing countries are the greatest victims must be predicated on a system based on just, fair and equitable arrangements that should guarantee to all nations a fair return for the labor and the product of their people. A precondition to the achievement of this objective is the necessity on the part of all countries to stand ready and to be willing to adopt measures which will bring justice and equity to all international economic relations. But first there must be the political desire to be fair. Without this, our hope for a new international economic order will be a hopeless illusion.\n168.\tThe cease-fire in the Middle East of last October brought a sense of temporary relief and a hopeful expectation that at long last a way could be found to end years of bloodshed and confrontation which have inflicted untold sufferings on millions of inhabitants in that troubled area. The uneasy peace that now exists in the Middle East and the deceptive air of tranquility along the Suez Canal must not, however, lull all parties to the dispute and the entire international community into relaxing their efforts to find a just, durable and permanent peace in the Middle East. Indeed, the reports about war maneuvers and military preparedness now regularly coming from the area clearly demonstrate the urgent need to find a quick solution to this problem.\n169.\tBut my Government believes and is convinced that no peace can come to the area unless it is based on certain fundamental principles. These include acceptance by Israel of the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of Arab lands by force and the need to find a just, fair and lasting solution to the Palestinian problem. To ignore these two elements will be to run away from reality, and any arrangements made without proper cognizance of these principles will produce just another shaky peace. In this connexion, a number of countries, including my own, Tanzania, have requested the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of an item entitled the \\\"Question of Palestine\\\".\n170.\tThe gravest error that this Organization has made is to ignore the Palestinian people, as if they did not exist. Since 1948 we have discussed the question of the Middle East in a manner which ignored the original cause. It is our belief that it will be almost impossible, if not futile, to solve the Middle East problem without first settling the Palestinian problem. Unless the existence of the Palestinian people is recognized and their fundamental rights assured by this Organization, all the debates in the halls of the United Nations will be an exercise in futility. It is the hope of the Tanzanian delegation that the inclusion of this item will afford the General Assembly a greater opportunity to address itself to this question with a view to redressing the injustice done to the Palestinian people and, indeed, with a view to ending the Middle East crisis.\n171.\tIt is a matter of deep concern to my delegation that, while the great Powers issue declarations about detente, fierce rivalry in various forms continues for hegemony in many areas of the world. Thus in areas such as the Indian Ocean, \\\"which has been solemnly declared by the General Assembly as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)], steps continue to be taken for the establishment of military bases with weapons of mass destruction.\n172.\tFurthermore, the much publicized spirit of detente has meant very little to millions who have to endure the consequences of wars of aggression and are perpetually subjected to imperialist intervention. In Viet Nam, even though a peace agreement was signed two years ago, the United States and the puppet Thieu regime continue to frustrate effective progress towards an end of the fighting which has brought so much suffering to the peopEe of Viet Nam. In Cambodia, where the people have rejected the corrupt Lon Nol clique, the United States has committed itself to ensuring the permanent survival of that decadent regime. In Korea the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the total reunification of that country have been frustrated by the Park regime and foreign intervention.\n173.\tAll this confirms our fears that detente may after all be used as a camouflage for continuing aggression, intimidation, sabotage, the subversion of foreign. Governments and even the callous assassination of leaders whose only crime is their desire to defend the freedom and independence of their countries.\n174.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, preparations for which we taken a number of years, is in itself a recognition the necessity of changing the existing international maritime law in order to avoid the chaos which that law admittedly tends to promote. But change of law alone cannot guarantee peace, let alone justice. The emerging law must be equitable as well as precise. The so-called freedom of the sea must give way to precise rules of law which are designed to protect the interests of all nations, developed and developing, and to promote international co-operation for the benefit of all mankind in the exploitation and utilization of the resources and other benefits of ocean space.\n175.\tAlthough we have noted the seriousness with which all States are approaching the matter, we wish to express our regret that antiquated attitudes favoring the chaos-oriented traditional maritime law continue to guide the policies of some States, in total disregard of the interests of the vast majority of States and peoples, and in spite of the dangers to international peace which those attitudes are promoting.\n176.\tIn this connexion, it is not enough to make repeated statements, in the name of negotiations, about a give-and-take spirit, as if all sides had something to give, when in fact it is only the few privileged nations that must pay a great debt to the rest of the world; for the transaction of the law of the sea is not between equally privileged States: it is largely a transaction between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"ambitious- to-continue-to-have\\\", on one side, and the \\\"have-nots\\\", on the other. If peace rests on justice, as it should, and if all the parties share the goal of justice in their work, it cannot but be accepted that the bulk of responsibility for the success of the Conference lies with those who are enjoying privileged positions at the present moment, it is on them, rather than on the others, that the success of the Conference depends. It is they who have the choice between justice and injustice concerning the sea, and between peace and international conflicts. It is a question of good faith and political courage. The absence of these factors will inevitably spell a failure to .achieve a meaningful convention. Their acceptance is therefore a prerequisite for the success of the Conference and of a convention that will do justice to all mankind.\n177.\tI cannot conclude my statement without referring to the recent tragic events in Cyprus. We do not see the need at this stage for apportioning blame. My delegation certainly joins those who have earnestly called for an end to the present sad and intolerable situation in Cyprus. Common sense demands that humanity and compassion prevail, and that the parties responsible for the suffering of the Cypriot people should immediately address themselves not only to the burning refugee question but to the more intractable problem of finding a permanent solution to the Cyprus issue. It is the view of the Tanzania delegation that any solution to this problem must entail the withdrawal, as a matter of urgency, of all foreign troops and the restoration of the full independence of that country. We believe that as an independent and sovereign nation the people of Cyprus will be able to find the way to solve their own problems in complete freedom.\n178.\tThe problems of colonialism and racism in southern Africa, the problems of the dispossessed people of Palestine, and the divided peoples of Korea and Viet Nam are all challenges that can easily break their geographic confines and engulf humanity in a hatred of unimaginable proportions. Thus if we are deaf to, or we evade, redressing the injustices visited upon the millions of people of those areas, the inevitable bloodshed and suffering will erode the very fabric of our civilization. If we fail to evolve just and equitable solutions to the grave economic situation facing the world, we shall be responsible for an economic disorder that will undoubtedly doom not only our present generation, but future generations as well. Our great and grave responsibility is firmly to ensure that human progress based on justice is achieved.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my Government and my delegation I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Bouteflika, a courageous and illustrious son of Africa, on his unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of this Assembly. His country, under the inspired leadership of President Houari Boumediene, has played no mean role in the affairs of our continent, and indeed in the affairs of the world. We assure him of our co-operation in the discharge of his onerous responsibilities.\n129.\tIt gives us special pleasure, as a small country, to welcome the new Members of the Organization Grenada, Bangladesh and Guinea-Bissau each of which will, we are sure, contribute positively to our search for peace and social justice. Their different and varied social and political backgrounds will add to the sum total of our knowledge and understanding of the problems that beset our world. Their presence will not only increase the number but augment the voice of the world's small countries in their fight against all forms of neo-colonialism.\n130.\tPrevious speakers have spoken succinctly and eloquently about the world's political and economic problems, to which we shall therefore allude only briefly. In Africa, we intend to underscore some of the problems of economic under achievement , and the implications, in terms of human relationships, of colonialism and racism. In this regard, we wish to support the informative and authoritative statement made this morning [2262nd meeting] by General Mohamed Siad Barre, President of the Somali Democratic Republic, whose voice is the voice of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and which we request this Assembly to heed.\n131.\tWhile we appreciate the steps taken by the super-Powers to reach understanding on various international issues, we do not\u2014I repeat, we do not believe that only they are capable of bringing peace and security to the world. In fact, we are suspicious and fearful of discussions and agreements reached outside the ambit of the United Nations because the interests of the super-Powers are not necessarily the interests of mankind.\n132.\tIn our opinion, only the United Nations can safeguard the interests of the many small countries that have no political, economic or military ambitions. It is only through the United Nations that the hopes and fears of the majority of the world's inhabitants can be expressed. In other words, detente between the super-Powers is meaningless because it guarantees neither peace nor security, as witness the failure of disarmament talks, the continuing wars in Indochina, and the tensions in the Middle East. To us, superPower detente looks like mutual accommodation rather than a search for permanent peace.\n133.\tThe situation in the Middle East remains volatile because the super-Powers are using Israel and some Arab countries as pawns in the international power game. There can be no peace in the area until Israel abandons all occupied Arab lands and recognizes the legitimate rights of the Palestinians who should be involved in all discussions and negotiations. This, we believe, can be done without prejudice to Israel's existence as a State. Israel cannot claim to exist at the expense of the Palestinian people.\n134.\tThe people of Indochina should be encouraged to work out their own destinies through dialog. Political interference or military intervention by outsiders can only aggravate the situation and prolong division and strife in Korea, Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia. Wherever and whenever possible, only the United Nations should be allowed to mediate or intervene, because, as we have indicated, those who intervene as individual nations do not necessarily have the interests of the whole area at heart, and we therefore feel that the United Nations is the only body that can represent the small Powers, which are often used as tools by the great Powers.\n135.\tThe violation of the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus, a member of the non-aligned movement, can only be viewed with anxiety and fear for the existence of small countries that refuse to be drawn into existing power blocs. Interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign, independent State, under whatever pretext, cannot be condoned or Excepted. All concerned are therefore requested, in the name of peace, to accept the decision of the Security Council on this matter and to restore the legitimate constitutional rights of Cyprus.\n136.\tThe international economic situation can only be described as perilous. Inflation has gone out of control and threatens the economies of all countries industrialized and non-industrialized, capitalist and socialist. Coupled with inflation is the unstable international monetary system, and both factors have a deleterious effect on international trade. The Western economic system based on free enterprise has become a Frankenstein monster, consuming not only its creators but all who are associated with it. No remedy seems to be in sight. The economies of small countries are being threatened as a result of the actions of the world's major trading partners and the moguls of the international monetary system.\n137.\tThere is as yet no evidence that the sixth special session has produced any change in the attitudes and methods of the major trading countries of the world. In complete disregard of the signs of the times, die hard capitalists are clinging to the old economic order with its inequities and iniquities. The poor people of the world, ruthlessly exploited for generations, are asking for a fair share of the world's economic cake. If their appeal for justice and equity goes unheeded for long, then they should seek their salvation through their own devices and, if necessary, through new economic alliances. We do not understand why the 80 per cent of the world's population who control the major resources of the world keep on moaning about bad treatment by the few and, in the mean time, allow themselves to be oppressed. It is our view that the developing countries of the world should reject economic exploitation just as unequivocally as they have rejected political oppression and subjugation.\n138.\tWe participated fully at the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Caracas, and are pleased that the international community has accepted the principle that the seas and the resources therein are the common heritage of mankind. We hope this will prevent the colonization of the seas by those who have the technology and the financial power to do this. It is our hope that the next session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea will reach agreement on draft articles of an international convention that not only will guarantee to land-locked States the right of free access to the sea but also will ensure that the seas and the oceans are protected and exploited for the benefit of all mankind.\n139.\tWe have already indicated that the President of the Democratic Republic of Somalia has spoken authoritatively on the problems of Africa. We shall therefore allude to only a few.\n140.\tThe social, economic and political problems of Africa are due to many causes. But first and foremost is the shortage of food, in both quality and quantity, due to ignorance and lack of funds, in that order. Time, effort and money should be spent on the education and training of African farmers in the basic principles and techniques of crop and livestock production.\n141.\tThose of us who know Africa know that large areas of that continent are ecologically suitable for the production of high-quality livestock and crop products. What we lack is the technical know-how. But the techniques required are profoundly simple. It is not the machinery that we need; it is simply the devotion and self-application of our people that will enable us to produce our own food and stop going cap in hand, complaining about the destruction of crops by those who use their own crops as methods and means of twisting the arms of those that we should control.\n142.\tIn many parts of Africa agricultural production could be appreciably increased through the application of approved methods and techniques. The availability of funds for the purchase of such agricultural inputs as fertilizers, seeds and insecticides will not by itself result in increased production. What is necessary is knowledge and a new outlook based on hard work and self-reliance, which has been repeated time without number by African leaders who have tried to urge their people to go back to the land and produce the food they require. Rural development in the agricultural sector should aim first at self- sufficiency in basic foodstuffs, for only when people are happy and healthy can they become productive and receptive to new ideas.\n143.\tIn accordance with the Declaration on Economic and Technical Co-operation, adopted by OAU last year at Addis Ababa at the tenth anniversary of\nOAU, African States should strive to accumulate their own food reserves and encourage trade among themselves and this is possible. Only in this way could they reduce their dependence on uncertain supplies from foreign countries which are themselves experiencing serious shortages of grains and livestock products, or which are using their food surpluses as political weapons. We hope African delegations to the forthcoming World Food Conference at Rome will give serious consideration to these issues and stop com-plaining that Africa is not being given food by those who do not want to give it food.\n144.\tOn the political front, Africa has registered some progress but much still remains to be done before the continent is finally rid of all vestiges of colonialism and racism.\n145.\tThe successful struggle and independence of Guinea-Bissau under the leadership of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC] gave impetus to the events in Mozambique where there is now a transitional Government led by the Frente de Libertao de Mozambique [FRELIMO]. Just a week ago, we visited Lourenzo Marques for the purpose of expressing solidarity with and giving encouragement to the forces of liberation there. In the context of southern Africa, this was not a mere gesture but visible support for Prime Minister Chissano and his colleagues, who are living and working in an atmosphere poisoned by centuries of racial oppression and discrimination. For this is a disease of southern Africa racial oppression, racial discrimination, racial exploitation and those who live there know what it means to live in our own continent where we are oppressed by minority regimes. We were impressed by the happy working relationship between the FRELIMO Government and the Portuguese High Commissioner, but vigilance is necessary to thwart the nefarious activities of reactionaries within and outside Mozambique. In fact, in Rhodesia and South Africa, the talk is that the Portuguese have let the side down. This is the attitude that the racist minority regimes are adopting instead of facing facts as they are and changing their policies.\n146.\tAs far as Namibia is concerned, we associate ourselves unreservedly with the decisions of the Organization. The people of the Territory must be allowed to determine their own destiny on the basis of one man, one vote, and not on the basis of \\\"population groups\\\", which is another name for apartheid. Let us not be fooled by the stratagem that has come from the Pretoria regime that the people of South-West Africa will be called together to decide their own destiny. The idea is that they should meet as populations rather than as individuals in a free country, and the basis of apartheid is population division.\n147.\tWith the imminent independence of Mozambique and, we also hope, of Angola, the days of the rebel.racist regime in Salisbury are numbered. To continue to resist progressive change is to court disaster, for no degree of oppression and brutality will discourage or deter the people of Zimbabwe from their determination to become free men in their own country. With the moral and material support of the international community they are bound to win.\n148.\tI turn now to apartheid, which is one of the perennial problems facing the United Nations. Our opposition to apartheid derives from our belief in fundamental rights as enunciated and understood by the international community not from a hatred of white people. As the Chairman of OAU indicated this morning [2262nd meeting], Africans are not vindictive, and, after 300 years of white habitation in southern Africa, we do not believe anybody is thinking of forcing the white man out of southern Africa; he is being simply asked to allow other people to live their own lives without let or hindrance and not to arrogate to himself the political and economic power to decide the destinies of a majority of people. We have never believed in the superiority of one race over another and, as Christians, we believe in the worth of the human person. Apartheid is unacceptable because it is based on fear and is therefore unjust. It degrades and brutalizes both its protagonists and its victims. We live cheek by jowl with the system and cannot, therefore, be accused of speaking from ignorance or malice. It is a vicious system, and to cite just one little example when we tell you that it degrades even those who apply it: recently, three white men, whose ages range from 18 to 48, murdered an African woman by forcing methylated spirits down her throat. Now, these are the degradations of apartheid.\n149.\tUnless and until South Africa shifts from its rigid position on racial matters, there can be no constructive dialog between it and most independent African States. The longer it delays in making such a move, the greater is the danger of a racial conflagration in southern Africa and, as its closest neighbors, we cannot look at such a prospect with equanimity. We speak, not because we hate South Africa, but because we are surrounded by South Africa. We live next to South Africa, and if there is any confrontation of any kind military, economic or otherwise Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland cannot escape unscathed, and therefore we cannot keep quiet. In their relationship with the new progressive Portuguese Government, Africans have proved to the world that they are opposed not to white people as such but to injustice and oppression. Will South Africa learn from the Portuguese experience or will it continue to defy international opinion in the misguided belief that everybody is out of step except itself?\n"

        "file_text": "215.\t Mr. President, I should like first of all, on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Mr. Moro, and of the Italian delegation, to congratulate you upon your unanimous election. There are many reasons for my sincere congratulations: the ties which friendship and a common Mediterranean civilization have forged between our two countries; my Government's appreciation of the foreign policy of the Algerian Government; and admiration for your personal qualities as a statesman and a diplomat.\n216.\tOn behalf of the Italian delegation, I should like to pay a tribute to Mr. Leopoldo Benites and to thank him for having presided so ably and successfully over the proceedings of our twenty-eighth session as well as those of the sixth special session. In his person, the Italian delegation wishes to pay homage to the qualities of all the peoples of the Latin American countries, with which my country also has profound ties of friendship. And it is with feelings of solidarity that today I single out among them Honduras, which has just been struck by a tragedy which has deeply moved the Italian Government and people.\n217.\tThe Italian delegation also takes great pleasure in paying a tribute to the outstanding personality of the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, and in expressing its appreciation of his wise and persevering efforts, particularly in the search for just solutions to the crises which recently have again obscured the international political horizon.\n'218. .As many other representatives who spoke before me pointed out, we are confronted with an international situation which gives cause for serious concern. The Middle East question is still full of grave unknowns; the Cyprus crisis has exacerbated the problems between the two communities on the island and has made, relations difficult between two countries which are nevertheless bound by political ties; and the agreements on Viet Nam have not yet-yielded the peace which was expected.\n219.\tFurthermore,, the disarmament negotiations have not so far fulfilled the hopes of mankind, which aspires to live in a world free from fear.\n220.\tFinally, the economic situation- the seriousness of which was drawn to our attention by the President of the United States of America- has led the Secretary-General, in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, to speak of problems \\\"which now confront the world community with a global crisis of extraordinary dimensions\\\", of \\\"upheavals\\\" and ominous \\\"portents\\\" which, far from being isolated events, are \\\"the symptoms of a profound malfunctioning of the global economy\\\" [AI960II Add.l].\n221.\tFortunately, we can also mention some encouraging events. These include, first of all, the admission of three new Members to the Organization, which gives us cause for great satisfaction because the United Nations is thereby drawing closer to one of its chief goals, namely, the universal representation of mankind.\n222.\tThe admission of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau has a special significance, because it is a sign both of improvement in the political situation on the subcontinent of South Asia- which gives good reason to hope for the future -and also of the acceleration of the process of decolonization, especially on the African continent.\n223.\tIn this connexion I should like to refer in particular to the Algiers Agreement between Portugal and Guinea-Bissau and to the Lusaka Agreement concerning the independence of Mozambique. These Agreements are important not simply because they will avert further bloodshed. The chain of events that brought to an end the authoritarian regime in Portugal and the joint communique concerning the implementation of United Nations resolutions issued at the end of the Secretary-General's visit to Lisbon, as well as the Algiers and Lusaka Agreements, show that freedom is an indivisible benefit which cannot be denied to others if it is sought for oneself. It shows, furthermore, the role played in the process of decolonization by the United Nations as a whole, by certain groups of States and by certain individual Member States.\n224.\tIn this respect I should like to mention three recent Italian statements.\n225.\tOn 10 June, the Italian Government indicated that it viewed as a positive development the opening of negotiations between Portugal and the liberation movements in its overseas Territories and pledged Italy's contribution \\\"aimed at ensuring the speedy realization of the right of the African peoples to self-determination and independence, in conformity with the principles of the United Nations\\\".\n226.\tOn 12 August, in announcing its recognition of Guinea-Bissau, the Italian Government issued a statement stressing that it had \\\"always expressed its support for the decolonization of the .Non-Self-Governing Territories and for the grafting of the right to self-determination and independence of peoples still under colonial rule\\\".\n227.\tOn 15 September, the Italian Government issued a statement which concluded with the following words:\n\\\"Italy is glad to have contributed to the process of negotiations between Portugal and FRELIMO, thus facilitating contacts designed to help towards a better understanding of the objectives and the viewpoints of the interested parties. This clearly reflects the full and constant adherence of Italy to the objectives of self-determination and independence of peoples still subject to colonial rule, and also Italy's recognition of the role that can be played in bringing about peaceful decolonization by political forces which express the aspirations, of the peoples.\\\"\n228.\tAll these statements were prompted by events connected with the decolonization of the Territories under Portuguese administration; but they have a broader significance because they reflect Italy's conviction that the gradual process of decolonization must be completed as soon as possible.\n229.\tSimilarly, Italy rejects all ideologies or policies based on racial discrimination, particularly apartheid. At the 2248th meeting, held this morning, again the Italian delegation demonstrated this rejection by voting in favor of the draft resolution in document A/L.731/Rev.l, although certain parts of its text give rise, in our opinion, to doubts of a legal character. My country reaffirms its commitment firmly to support the efforts of the Organization aimed at ensuring, as required of us by the Charter, \\\"respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\\" .\n230.\tMany changes, have taken place in the almost 30 years of the life of the Organization. The Assembly will have to take account of these changes when it considers the proposals concerning the revision of certain provisions of the Charter, submitted by many Member countries, including Italy, with a view to enabling the United Nations better to face an international situation that is very different from the postwar situation, and which is evolving at an ever-increasing pace.\n231.\tMeanwhile another useful, although more modest, objective could be attained, namely, the achievement of the maximum degree of rationality and efficiency in the use of the human and financial resources that the Organization already has at its disposal, paying special attention to the proper selection of staff and the prudent use of the Organization's funds.\n232.\tI should now like to refer to the international economic situation. It is beset, as I have said, by disturbance of alarming proportions. On the one hand, per capita and national income are being eroded by a rate of inflation which the world has not known for more than a generation; on the other hand, we are facing the threat of a world-wide recession.\n233.\tThese developments are upsetting the political and social equilibrium of all countries and damaging their prospects of development. Furthermore, this could mean that, if everyone tries individually to limit the consequences of this situation or to escape them, we would all find ourselves exposed to a danger that might perhaps be even more serious: the danger that, as in the 1930s, international co-operation may give way to narrow self-interest and bring about a reduction in world trade which would be harmful to all countries without distinction.\n234.\tTo counter such a serious threat we must rely on the awareness we have today of the ties of interdependence which link the different economic systems. That interdependence, we must not forget, implies also a joint responsibility in the decisions we must take, either collectively or within the framework of our respective national policies, in order to \u25a0 build a world-wide commercial and monetary order which will enable us, on a more stable and above all a more just basis, to go forward together along the path of development.\n235.\tThe initiative taken by the President of Mexico for the elaboration of a charter of the economic rights and duties of States is based on these fundamental principles of justice and stability. Italy Welcomed this initiative with great interest, and the Italian delegation hopes that the contacts that will take place during this session will enable substantial progress to be made.\n236.\tThe need for a more stable and just basis for international economic relations was, moreover, recognized by the General Assembly when it held its sixth special session last April.\n237.\tIn the absence of a new commercial and monetary order, the present Situation severely affects mainly those peoples who have not accumulated financial wealth and natural resources of their own, or have far top few, and so can offer, in terms of exports, nothing but their work. This is true of many developing countries, and especially the poorest among them. It is these that are most in danger of suffering from the irreparable consequences of the energy crisis, the monetary crisis and, perhaps, tomorrow, even from a serious economic depression. Italy has a feeling of solidarity with these countries because, while being at a different level of development, it is also lacking in natural resources and the world crisis is causing it problems out of all proportion to its own financial resources.\n238.\tThe future will depend on the extent to which genuine international co-operation and solidarity can be achieved in confronting the structural problems of the world economy with a view to ensuring a better and fairer distribution of the world's wealth, a more effective and better balanced utilization of resources and a better relationship between man and his environment. I am thinking in particular of such problems as energy, population, food, development financing, technological progress and the transfer of technology.\n239.\tIt was this conviction that prompted Italy to contribute, within the European Economic Community, to a positive response to the appeal by the Secretary-General for an emergency program for the benefit of the countries most affected by the present economic crisis. Italy views in the same light the relations between the European Economic Community and the countries of the Third World, whether they are associated with or eligible for association with the European Economic Community, or whether they are other countries with which my country maintains ties of traditional friendship.\t\n240.\tOnly recently [2238th meeting] the representative of France, speaking as a representative of the country holding the current presidency of the European Economic Community, requested the inclusion in the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly of an item on the granting to the European Economic Community of observer status at the United Nations. This is an initiative which, among other things, will facilitate the task of associating the European Economic Community with the Organization in the quest for solutions acceptable to all.\n241.\tAs for the energy problem, the Italian Government has always felt that any confrontation between the oil-producing and the oil-consuming countries must be avoided by guaranteeing, on the one hand, the right of each country to dispose freely of the resources of its own territory, and by avoiding, on the other hand, a crisis in prices and supplies whose consequences would ultimately disrupt the economies of all countries.\n242.\tThis was the spirit in which Italy participated in international meetings on the energy problem, such as those of the Co-ordinating Group of Twelve, whose objective remains the rapid initiation of a constructive dialog with the producing countries. It was also in the same spirit that Italy supported the Algerian initiative for the convening of the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n243.\tItaly, which depends for its energy resources almost entirely on foreign countries, and whose economic progress is closely linked to the development of international trade, is particularly sensitive to the needs of the developing countries, without whose co-operation and agreement no permanent solution to the economic problems of the world will ever be found.\n244.\tTo sum up: the right of the producing countries to utilize their own resources in a more rational manner; the need to stabilize prices at just and profitable levels for all; the channeling of earnings from oil exports into productive uses; stable economic co-operation between producers, industrial consumers and non-producing developing countries -these, in the Italian Government's view, are the principles that must guide us.\n245.\tThe need to adopt a global approach to these problems has, in any case, been recognized by the United Nations, as is shown by the three major initiatives which it decided with foresight to take this year. I am referring to the World Population Conference, the World Food Conference, and the Second General Conference of UNIDO to be held next spring.\n246.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, whose second session was recently held at Caracas, is part of the same pattern of international co-operation. It is to be hoped that in this field, which is so important to mankind, equitable solutions can soon be worked out which will reconcile the legitimate interests of different States with those of the international community.\n247.\tIt is quite clear that an appeal for international economic co-operation wilt be possible only if the maintenance of peace in the various parts of the globe is assured. In this respect, we are well aware that the question of the Middle East and the Cyprus crisis are a source of particularly grave concern to my country in view of the geographical position it occupies in the Mediterranean.\n248.\tIn the Middle East the tensions persist, and even seem to be growing more acute, despite some progress made, thanks to the efforts of the United States Secretary of State; this progress has led to the establishment of a negotiation framework situated, appropriately, within the United Nations system and to the conclusion of agreements on military disengagement, the observance of which is guaranteed mainly by the United Nations, I believe that a new and decisive effort will have to be made to overcome the differences which divide the parties directly concerned: this calls, first of all, for a courageous contribution from these same parties, in the conviction that their real interests require that a just and lasting peace, advantageous to all the peoples of the region, may be established through negotiations.\n249.\tThe purpose of such negotiations must be to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in its entirety. In this decision the Security Council laid down the principles for a settlement of the Conflicts that would ensure the sovereignty and the peaceful coexistence of all countries in the area, within secure and recognized boundaries. The withdrawal from all the territories occupied after 4 June 1967, in accordance with the principles Of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, is a, basic requirement for the restoration of peace. The security of all States in the area even more than the military equilibrium, which can never be adequate must be sought in a political agreement based on the conviction that coexistence between those States is not only necessary but also possible.\n250.\tThe other main aspect of the crisis in the Middle East concerns the Palestinian people, who cannot and must not be further deprived of the opportunity to decide their own future. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Mr. Moro, already had occasion to state in 1970 that this is a problem of a political nature, since the Palestinian people cannot be denied the right to a land of their own. Hence the importance of the debate on the Palestinian question, which the Arab countries have placed before this session of the General Assembly. Let us hope that the debate will be constructive, that is, inspired by a sense of fairness and realism, and that really useful suggestions for the peace negotiations may emerge from it.\n251.\tIn any case, it is essential^ as of now, that the progress of these long-awaited negotiations should not be jeopardized by military moves. In this context, we feel it is imperative to extend the mandates of the United Nations forces stationed in the Middle East, whose functions have been defined in the disengagement agreements. Italy hopes, moreover, that there will be no recurrence of terrorist acts which the international community cannot allow, whatever the motives behind them or of reprisals or preventive action, which we also strongly condemn, not only because these acts also cause innocent victims but furthermore because they mostly take place in the territory of Lebanon, whose integrity is an essential factor in the stability of the situation in the region.\n252.\tAs for Cyprus, the tensions which have punctuated the crisis with outbursts of violence -while this crisis was still latent were aggravated by the tragic consequences of the coup d'etat on 15 July. It is more important than ever to work out a solution that will take account of the legitimate aspirations of the two communities, affording each of them effective protection that will enable them to live together in peace and thus securely guarantee the maintenance of the island's sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. This is the Wish of my country , which has always lent its unconditional support to the efforts of the United Nations in Cyprus, and which has given its backing to the action of the Security Council  most opportunely seized of the matter by the Secretary-General as reflected in resolution 353 (1974), which forms the basis of subsequent recommendations,\n253.\tIn spite of the intervention of the United Nations, and the parallel intervention of various countries, the Conference held at Geneva did not produce the hoped-for results and we witnessed the recurrence in Cyprus of a tragedy which compelled tens of thousands of people to abandon their homes.\n254.\tThe talks recently stalled by the representatives of the two Cypriot communities, following inter alia the intervention of the Secretary-General, in order to remedy this tragic situation, deserve our encouragement, as there is reason to hope that political developments will emerge from them.\n255.\tAs to the substance of the problem, the nine countries of the European Community have made numerous efforts, both collectively and individually. These nine countries attach special importance to the speedy solution of a crisis affecting a region so close to Italy in consideration of the ties between the Community and the countries involved, which the nine members would like to see further strengthened. It is thus to be hoped that the parties will do their utmost to ensure the resumption of negotiations, with due respect for national dignity, on both sides, bearing in mind the changes that have occurred on the island since the Zurich and London Agreements on the understanding that the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the island are beyond question.\n256.\tThe problem of peace is not confined to its restoration in the areas in which there are conflicts or latent crises. It is, in fact, far broader in scope, being linked to the problem of security, which would be precarious if it continued to be based on the tenuous balance of mutual fear.\n257.\tOn the subject of disarmament, I have already spoken of the none-too-satisfactory results achieved thus far. It is to be hoped that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament will be more successful than it has been so far in devising further disarmament measures, especially as it can count on the contribution of five new members.\n258.\tWith regard to the problem of nuclear weapons, the Italian Government reaffirms its support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It is still preoccupied by the obstacles which seem to impede the attainment of the goal pursued by the Treaty, that is, the non-dissemination of atomic weapons. It considers it both possible and necessary to safeguard the prospects of a fuller utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes; to this end it hopes that, at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty ,'the most careful consideration will be given to the possibilities of adapting the Treaty to the new international realities so that it convey the universal support which is an essential prerequisite for its success.\n259.\tWhile on the subject of the non-proliferation Treaty, I should like to Call attention to its article VI, which places in an overall perspective the problem involved in arriving, through measures in the nuclear and conventional fields, at general and complete disarmament under rigorous and effective international control, which the entire international community wishes to attain! That is still a distant goal, and it would\nbe naive to underestimate the obstacles to be surmounted before reaching it, although a major step has already been taken in that direction with the establishment of a climate of detente in East-West relationships.\n260.\tWorld detente presupposes detente between the great Powers, but detente cannot achieve its full significance unless the understandings between them are accompanied by persevering and constructive contacts with all other countries. Conceived, as it was, as the only possible alternative to the appalling danger of a nuclear conflict, the detente is slowly but surely acquiring a fuller political content. As a result of that development, it's  the longer simply a policy aimed at stabilizing international coexistence. The time has come to progress to an active phase of co-operation between States to seek a new model and new rules for the conduct of all international relations.\n261.\tThose are the motives underlying the two major multilateral Conferences being held in Geneva and Vienna -the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Conference for a Reciprocal and Balanced Reduction of Forces in Central Europe. At those two Conferences, the countries of Europe given a common destiny by history, but so often made antagonists by the same history are playing a leading role in the conviction that a way must be found to overcome the artificial barriers of mistrust and hostility.\n262.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe aims at an in-depth discussion of the common problems of a group of countries whose understandings cannot be based on solid foundations unless they are accompanied by an improvement in relations between peoples and individuals. That European meeting, which is taking place as the first contacts are being made between the European Economic Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, is the outcome of an awareness of certain realities that are now established and whose recognition constitutes the basis for a lasting peace. In that spirit, which implies the intention to end the state of political uncertainty that has prevailed since 1945, there can be no doubt that the provisions of Articles 53 and 107 of the United Nations Charter must be considered obsolete.\n263.\tSecurity and co-operation in Europe cannot be dissociated from security and co-operation in the Mediterranean, which is a natural political and economic extension of Europe. Italy has consistently, maintained that there is a link between the security of those two zones. It reiterated that view in June 1972, and particularly in November of the same year -that is, at the beginning of the preparations for the European Conference. That action resulted in the introduction into resolutions adopted at Helsinki of several paragraphs which, in referring to that link, enabled some non-European Mediterranean countries to state their views at the Geneva Conference.\n264.\tIn this statement, which is already quite lengthy, I shall not touch on other topics, such as the Atlantic Alliance, in which Italy loyally participates, convinced that it still plays an indispensable role in the maintenance of international stability and in the progressive opening-up of broader and more fruitful prospects for co-operation between peoples, including peoples with different political systems.\n265.\tSpecial mention should be made of the opening of a Euro-Arab dialog, an initiative which resulted from the Arab Summit Conference of Algiers and the Copenhagen meetings in which you, Mr. President, and the country you represent played an important role. In encouraging that initiative, the European Community adopted an approach which is in keeping with its open character and which represents a logical development of the Mediterranean policy. The purpose of the dialog is to concentrate efforts to bring about ever fuller understanding and more active co-operation within a framework both organic and complete. The new relationship resulting from it can thus be viewed in a long-term development perspective, taking account of historical, cultural and social ties and economic complementarity -or, in a word, of the interests shared by the two groups of countries.\n266.\tI should like to conclude this statement by pointing out that the fact that I have referred to these many international problems proves that the European Community is a concrete and active reality in both the economic and the political spheres. The results achieved should encourage further achievements. In fact, Italy is convinced that continued efforts should be made to bring the process of European unification, begun 25 years ago, to completion so that a new political order can effectively emerge in Europe and so that the union of Europe may become an even more decisive factor in the stability and harmonious economic development of the international community as a whole.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of Chad welcomes the election of Mr. Bouteflika as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Chad, which has always had friendly and close relations with Algeria, is pleased at this happy event and expresses its sincere congratulations. Even though Mr. Bouteflika is young, he has for 12 years vigorously expressed in this Assembly and elsewhere his faith and ideal in the advent of a better world where peace, freedom and justice will triumph. His positions were just, even though they ruffled the feelings of some, and he has accumulated a store of experience which fully justifies his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We trust, therefore, that with his experience as an Algerian and a diplomat he will bring the work of the twenty-ninth session to a successful outcome. In particular, we hope that, if by way of compromise we often manage to adopt grandiose resolutions here, we will now find the ways and means to implement them.\n151. I also wish to pay a special tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, for the devotion and competence with which he guided the work of our last session, as well as the sixth special session on raw materials and development.\n15.2. We also express our congratulations to the Secretary-General and to his assistants. Mr. Kurt Waldheim has been outstanding in the discharge of his functions as a genuine apostle of peace. His name is closely linked to the liberation of Guinea-Bissau, to the end of fighting in Cyprus, to the beginning of a solution to a very difficult problem in the Middle East, not to mention his firm determination to come to the assistance of suffering and deprived peoples.\n153.\tFinally, we joyfully welcome the admission of new States to our Organization: the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. The admission of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations is a brilliant victory for PAIGC and for the brave fighters who waged the sacred battle for independence under the high political command of the late Amilcar Cabral. We also wish to pay tribute to the memory of Mr. Eduardo Mondlane and all those who gave their lives in the struggle for African liberation.\n154.\tThe representatives who preceded me have eloquently spoken about all the problems before the international community, namely: decolonization, human rights, the emergence of the third world on the international economic scene, which so far has been dominated by a few privileged countries, the energy crisis, inflation, the law of the sea, population and food. The recalling of these problems by each of us simply confirms the need for all of us to find concrete solutions.\n155.\tThe delegation of Chad takes satisfaction in the recent statement by the Government of Portugal that it recognizes the right to independence of all the Territories which are still under its domination. Our satisfaction would be greater if Portugal's intentions were to be reflected in a concrete act enabling the Territories concerned to recover their freedom and sovereignty without delay and without conditions.\n156.\tSpain, too, must liberate the Sahara in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and in consultation with the neighboring States which are directly concerned. We welcome the agreement between Mauritania and Morocco jointly to submit a request to the International Court of Justice to decide on their dispute with Spain.\n157.\tDecolonization cannot be limited to Territories under Portuguese or Spanish domination. In fact, the situation in other occupied Territories does not leave us indifferent. My country, consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the charter of OAU, once again reaffirms that we shall firmly support every effort for the self-determination of peoples which are still under domination wherever they may be throughout the world.\n158.\tBut how can we recall these problems without deploring the situation in southern Africa? We note with bitterness that in Rhodesia and Namibia nothing has improved, while in South Africa the racist regime is still trying to perpetrate the policy of apartheid. Those oppressive regimes and their acolytes must face the fact that the march of history is irreversible and that they must adjust to the new circumstances by exercising wisdom and reason.\n159. The situation in the Middle East remains disquieting. The peace efforts that were made some time ago disintegrated rapidly because of Israel's persistence in its policy of aggression. Israel must withdraw its troops from all the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967 so that peace efforts can succeed. The distress of the Palestinian people is, naturally, of concern to us. This question cannot, in our opinion, be the subject of a just and lasting solution so long as the Palestinian people continue to live cut off from their brothers in the region, deprived of their national heritage.\n160. We deplore the events in Cyprus which resulted in the death not only of countless Cypriots but also of messengers of peace who fell under the flag of the United Nations. This crisis, which developed because of foreign interference in the internal affairs of the island, threatens not only the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus but also international peace and security. We hope that the current negotiations between the representatives of the two communities will save the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the island where in the past Turks and Greeks lived together peacefully.\n161.\tIn South-East Asia men continue to \\\"die daily. In Viet Nam the continued violation of the Paris agreements keeps the situation tense. My delegation hopes that the integral application of those agreements will open up a way out of the deadlock.\n162.\tWith respect to Cambodia, the delegation of Chad recognizes the Royal Government of National Union presided over by Prince Sihanouk as the only representative of the Cambodian people for the good reason that it has the support of the entire Cambodian people and of more than 60 Members of the United Nations. The key to the restoration of peace in Cambodia can only be found in putting an end to foreign interference.\n163.\tIn the Far East, Korea cannot enjoy peace until the question of unification has been settled to the satisfaction of the two parties concerned. The decision of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea was a positive step in the search for a just and equitable solution of the question. The delegation of Chad, which associated itself with that decision, declares itself ready to support any initiative that can contribute to creating conditions favorable to the peaceful reunification of Korea. \n164.\tInternational security, which concerns us all, can be only an empty term until the disarmament of which we have spoken for years becomes effective. Every year resolutions adopted here recommend general and complete disarmament, yet the next year we are witnesses to underground or atmospheric nuclear tests, and mass deliveries of weapons of all kinds, with no assurance that any conflict that might arise in any part of the world would be prevented and still less that the danger of escalation, which would lead to a nuclear confrontation, would be averted. The delegation of Chad joins the delegations that preceded me to this rostrum in appealing to the conscience of the Powers producing nuclear and conventional weapons to take effective disarmament measures.\n165.\tThe year which has passed since our last session has been a period of disturbance for the world economy. The war of October 1973 gave a glimpse of the manifestations of an economic process which until then had been camouflaged under the then prevailing international economic order. The builders and advocates of that system saw their economies flourishing to the detriment of the majority of the peoples of the globe. It was only when the producers of the \\\"black gold\\\" united that the world unanimously became disillusioned: there was widespread inflation, a notable decline in the economic growth rate, and disarray in international payments. In truth, the origins of these troubles are to be found in the unjust imbalances which have persisted in international economic relations since the Second World War, which led to an accelerated growth of the industrial countries through the transfer of raw materials at low prices.\n166.\tWhen pillage attained its peak, the poor countries insistently appealed for economic interdependence and co-operation so that the imbalances and injustices could be corrected. The stabilization of the prices of raw materials, the increased transfer of real resources to developing countries, the better organization of the international financial markets all these aspirations were unheeded by the rich countries, because it cost them nothing to ignore them, or to postpone them indefinitely. But now the time has come when the countries of the third world have become a reality. No nation can be proud of having a rich society in a world where poverty, famine and disease are rampant. The President of the World Bank has just declared at a meeting of the Bank that a thousand million human beings on our planet are condemned to death in the present economic circumstances.\n167.\tAny one of the features of the present economic crisis deterioration of the terms of trade, widespread, runaway inflation, increased oil prices, or decrease in the growth rate of certain countries would alone have had serious repercussions on the developing countries. In combination they have led certain countries to the brink of disaster. The countries with a per capita income below $200 have seen that income decline in real value. The amount of aid for development, which is already limited, is not increasing enough to ' ^set the effects of inflation.\n168.\tIn this terrible situation my country, Chad, is feeling repercussions of the present crisis. Indeed, to imported inflation are added the various causes of higher domestic prices characteristic of developing economies, which are often linked to the structural shortcomings with regard to capital goods and technology. After the disturbing economic events of our time, we must jointly develop, a co-operation that will reflect a permanent and reinforced policy of solidarity. In this connexion, the equitable and realistic solution would be to bring order to the world economy through the practical application of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n169.\tThe Government of Chad would like to express its appreciation and gratitude to friendly and brother countries and to governmental and non-governmental organizations whose moral and material support made it possible to limit the consequences and effects of the drought which struck our national territory. The Government of Chad appreciates in particular the efforts made by the United Nations to mobilize inter-national opinion for the benefit of the countries that were struck by this natural disaster. In the face of this catastrophe, Mr. Kurt Waldheim expressed his fears by stating that in less than 50 years, perhaps by the end of the century, the continued encroachment of the desert might well wipe three or four African countries off the map.\n170.\tFurthermore, an English scientist, Dr. Derek Winstanley, on the basis of past cycles of rain in the United Kingdom, concluded that the drought would inexorably continue its progression until the year 2030. Does this mean that in less than a generation no more will be heard of certain countries of the Sahel? That is a frightening prospect, and Mr. Boerma, Di-rector of FAO, in discussing a solution, said, \\\"essential donations are only a short-term solution; what is needed is a permanent plan to supply the desert with water and allow the planting of forests\\\".\n171.\tThere is no lack of water in the Sahelian region. The problem is how rationally to exploit the rains and the rivers, as well as the underground sources of water. For the disinherited people of the Sahelian region, the solidarity and backing of Governments and international institutions with respect to adequate financial and technical aid are indispensable to conquer the desert. We cannot speak of these natural disasters without recalling the calamities that struck Honduras and Peru. We present our deep condolences to those delegations.\n172.\tAs against the many problems which the poor countries face, we note that not only has public aid declined by one third in proportion to the gross national product, but it is now confined to financing quick short-term operations.\n173.\tThe delegation of Chad believes that it is time to attack the structural problems of these countries, in particular the road, water and agricultural infra-structures. Going a little further, our President, our great compatriot N'Garta Tombalbaye, launched an urgent appeal from this rostrum at the commemorative session of the General Assembly on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. He said:\n\\\"... If mankind is an ocean of poverty, it is because it suffers from a lack of brotherhood; it is because, to repeat, everything is not geared to man. The day when man is brother to man, the attitude of one group towards another, the attitude of one nation towards another will be fundamentally different. It will no longer be a matter of understanding a people in order to exploit it, but of satisfying global needs, of seeking to harness technology and to institute modes of relations and trade which will bring into being the brotherhood of man.\\\"\n174.\tI should not like to conclude my statement without speaking of the recent change in our national policy following the creation on 27 August 1973 of the National Movement for the Cultural and Social Revolution under the leadership of our great compatriot N'Garta Tombalbaye, the founding Secretary- General. \n175.\tThe National Movement for the Cultural and Social Revolution is a movement for liberation which unites all the living forces of the nation, all the people of Chad without distinction of social rank, tribe or religion, in a single body and mobilizes them to struggle against underdevelopment and against moral and intellectual slavery. This movement is centered on the man of Chad, and some of its objectives are: to reconcile the citizens of Chad with themselves, enhance the value of their natural culture and return to the source to discover their real and profound identity; to continue to consolidate national unity; and to guarantee democratic freedoms.\n176.\tThe movement encourages co-operation with all friendly countries on the condition that this cooperation be based on the principle of equality, and that it respect the independence and sovereignty of the State of Chad. It proclaims that non-alignment and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States constitute two cardinal principles of our foreign policy.\n177.\tAfter all the eminent speakers who preceded me, I cannot speak further of the problems which concern us. To conclude, I believe that it is all a question of the conscience of each of us and, above all, of our faith in the future of the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "We have learned with great sorrow of the passing of Mr. Paul Hoffman, the former Managing Director of the Special Fund and Administrator of UNDP. A man of international fame and stature, Mr. Hoffman rendered great services to the United Nations, and I wish, on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates, to extend our condolences to his family and to the delegation of the United States.\n188.\tMr. President, it is with great pleasure that I extend to you, on behalf of the Government of the United Arab Emirates, our congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly reflects the confidence placed in you and the recognition by the international community of your proven abilities. We share the pride in your election, which we consider as an expression of appreciation of the important role played by Algeria in defense of the interests and rights of the third world.\n189.\tWe wish also to convey our gratitude to Mr. Benites, who presided over the previous session with great ability and wisdom.\n190.\tWe also thank the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts to strengthen the United Nations and to increase its efficacy for the preservation of international peace and security.\n191.\tIt gives us the utmost pleasure to welcome the three States that joined the Organization at the current session, namely, Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. We are confident that the admission of these new Members will strengthen and increase the effectiveness of the United Nations. We are ready to co-operate with them, both bilaterally and within the United Nations and its specialized agencies.\n192.\tWe consider the inclusion of the question of Palestine as a separate item in the agenda of the current session as an event of great importance. The question of Palestine will now be considered in all its basic and immutable elements. Implicit in this inclusion of the item is a realization by the United Nations that its previous consideration of only certain aspects and consequences of that question were inconclusive and could not lead to a just and lasting solution which would preserve peace in the Middle East and save it from any further tragedies of war and destruction.\n193.\tThe United Nations has in the past considered in different organs some of the aspects and consequences of the problem of Palestine and has adopted a number of resolutions and recommendations. This, however, did not prevent the aggravation of the problem by Israel's continued aggression against the people of Palestine and the denial of their rights in their ancestral homeland. It did not prevent Israel from attacking the Arab States adjacent to Palestine, prolonging the exile and dispersal of its people and preventing it from the free exercise of its inalienable rights, including the right to self-determination.\n194.\tImportant developments and events have taken place in our area in recent years. One of the most significant of these has been the assumption of full responsibility by the people of Palestine for the liberation of its land and the restoration of its rights. It was incumbent, therefore, upon the United Nations to respond and adjust to these new developments and events by considering the question of Palestine in all its fundamental aspects. That was achieved by the decision of the General Assembly with one dissenting voice, that of Israel to include the item in the agenda and allocate it to the plenary Assembly.\n195.\tWe view the allocation of the item to the plenary Assembly as another proof of the recognition by the United Nations of the importance of this question. We fully support the proposal of inviting the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to participate in the deliberation of the item in the plenary Assembly. No objective or realistic consideration of this item can take place without the participation of the principal party the people of Palestine through its sole and legitimate representative, the PLO. Accordingly, we shall fully support the invitation extended to the PLO to participate in the deliberation of the plenary Assembly on this item.\n196.\tWe believe that any resolution that may be adopted at the end of the debate on this item should include the following principles: first, a reaffirmation of the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine; secondly, a reaffirmation of the right of the people of Palestine to self-determination, without external interference, and the guaranteeing of its national independence; thirdly, a reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinians who were expelled to return to their homes and lands; and fourthly, a reaffirmation of the right of the people of Palestine to use all means to attain its rights, including the right to self-determination..\n197.\tIn calling for the reaffirmation of these rights, we are in fact reiterating a position of principle which we have always taken in supporting the people of Palestine, a position inspired by the fact that these rights are based upon the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and are fully in conformity with the rules of international law.\n198.\tOur position on the question of Palestine is known to all. We have often stated our views regarding the aggressive nature of Zionism and denounced Israel's aggression and occupation of Arab territories. We shall, nevertheless, state in greater detail our views during the discussion of the question of Palestine and other relevant items. We should like, however, to reiterate now our demand for Israel's withdrawal from all occupied territories. We shall continue to extend every possible assistance for the achievement of that goal .\n199.\tThe United Arab Emirates supports the decision of Mauritania and Morocco to bring the case of AlSakya Al Hamra and Wadi Al Thahab or the so- called Spanish Sahara to the International Court of Justice. We appeal to Spain to act in a manner that will preserve ArabSpanish friendship, a friendship which we, for our part, endeavor to develop and strengthen.\n200.\tWe were gravely concerned at the unfortunate events in Cyprus this year and were grieved at the tragic loss of innocent lives which further exacerbated the state of tension and instability prevailing in our area. We earnestly hope that all outstanding problems will be resolved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and on the basis of justice and equity.\n201.\tI wish to add my voice to that of my colleagues who preceded me in welcoming the policy of the new Portuguese Government which is based on the recognition of the right to self-determination and the granting of independence to its former colonies. We appreciate the resolve of the Government of Portugal to pursue that policy and, to end, once and for all, the last vestiges of colonial rule. The way has now been opened for the establishment of friendly and cordial relations between the Arab world and Portugal.\n202.\tSince the founding of our State, the policies of the United Arab Emirates have been based on the principle of support for all peoples in their struggle to attain their freedom, to exercise their right of self- determination, and to preserve their territorial integrity. This is why we have supported, and will continue to support, without reservation, the African liberation movements, and will extend all possible financial and moral assistance to them.\n203.\tWe are gravely concerned at the inhuman treatment, by the Government of South Africa, of the indigenous population of that country, and the continued denial by the racist regime in Salisbury of the rights of the African majority in Zimbabwe. The policies of apartheid and the oppressive rule of minority racist regimes are an intolerable affront to human dignity and a challenge to world opinion. All previous United Nations resolutions dealing with the problem have remained unimplemented. This failure is mainly due to th^ continued co-operation of certain States with South Africa and the racist regime in Rhodesia and their refusal to implement the United Nations resolutions calling for sanctions against them. We have imposed a total embargo on the shipment of oil and are strictly applying this policy. We renew our appeal to the States which still have extensive dealings with the two racist regimes to cease forthwith their co-operation with them and to participate in the efforts of the African States and the United Nations to deal effectively with this problem.\n204.\tWe welcome the initiative taken by Egypt and Iran to include the item entitled \\\"Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East\\\" in the agenda of the current session. We earnestly hope that the discussion of this item will lead to the adoption of a positive resolution for the establishment of such a zone.\n205.\tAs a major oil producer and exporter, my country is interested in the current debate on the world economic situation. To understand and appreciate the point of view of the petroleum-exporting countries, it is necessary to go back a little in history. Oil, a precious, exhaustible and irreplaceable mineral, has been exported in great quantities to meet the ever- increasing demands of the developed countries. The companies which controlled the international flow of this vital commodity have utilized wasteful methods of production, which resulted in the rapid depletion of the oil reserves of the producing countries. While keeping the price of crude oil artificially low, these companies made huge profits on the down-stream operations related to oil trade, that is, shipping, refining and distribution, from which the producing countries were totally excluded.\n206.\tLow prices of crude oil made it difficult for the producing countries adequately to meet the rising costs of their development requirements. This inevitably stultified their growth and seriously retarded their progress. In addition to providing huge profits for the foreign companies, cheap and plentiful energy gave substantial tax revenues to the governments of the consuming countries. It also enabled the industrialized nations to achieve a rate of economic growth which far outstripped that of the developing countries. As a result of all this, the developed countries entered into a period of mass consumption and unrestrained material indulgence, at a time when most of he countries of the third world were barely managing to stay above mere subsistence levels.\n207.\tAs far as the oil-exporting countries were concerned, any benefits which they may have derived from increased production were wiped out by the sharp rise in the prices of manufactured goods in the developed countries. Thus, the rapid growth in the industrialized countries had no corresponding beneficial results for the rest of the world. On the contrary, foreign aid lagged far behind the great increase in the gross national product of the developed countries. The gap between the developed and developing countries steadily widened. This widening gap, as we all know, had been the object of lengthy and futile discussions in the Organization and its specialized agencies for over two decades. The decision of the oil-exporting countries to extricate themselves from the vicious circle of over-production and low prices has ended an iniquitous situation and halted the exploitation and squandering of valuable resources that had been going on for decades. Now the oil-exporting Countries will be able to absorb the vast increase in the price of manufactured goods and to protect themselves against the consequences of the rampant inflation in the developed countries. We believe this new situation will be beneficial for the developing countries, and may have some indirect benefits, even for the developed countries.\n208.\tFor the developing countries, it means that some economic power and wealth will be in the hands of small countries like themselves; countries that have neither the desire nor the ability to carve up spheres of influence, countries with no imperialist ambitions and no wish for political and economic domination over others. We are confident that this shift in the balance of economic power will contribute to narrowing the gap between the developed and developing countries. Evidence of this can already be seen in the very high percentage of the gross national product of the oil-exporting countries presently allocated to assist the developing countries. Let us take the example of my own country. We have during 1974 given to developing countries in grants and soft loans no less than $700 million, which represent more than 15 per cent of our gross national product. In addition, we have increased the capital of the AbuDhabi Development Fund to $500 million to finance projects in the developing countries all over the world.\n209.\tI am now happy to announce that my Government, in response to the appeal of the Secretary- General, has decided to contribute $10 million to the Special Program of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. We have also asked the Secretary-General to allocate $500,000 of this amount to the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator to be spent on relief work in Honduras.\n210.\tMany of the exporting countries would have preferred to produce just enough to meet our development requirements and those of the other developing countries. Such a reduction of production would have helped us to conserve our precious and irreplaceable asset and would have eliminated the necessity of investing our surplus in uneconomic investments in the developed countries. But we realized that such a drastic and sudden reduction would have inflicted hardship on other countries, and might have caused a serious dislocation in the world economic order, which ultimately would have been detrimental to our interests. So we increased our production by nearly 20 per cent, in spite of the obvious economic disadvantages of such an increase.\n211.\tAlthough the Arab countries were not the ones which initiated the rise in oil prices, we, as OPEC members, are bound by the decisions of our organization. In any event, the way to deal with the problem is not by threats and counter-threats, not by hostility and confrontation, but through understanding. It is not logical to deal with the price of oil in isolation from the prices of manufactured goods and other commodities. In other words, the problem of oil prices should be considered within the general framework of the world economic situation. We have already taken steps in this direction by instituting co-operation, based on mutual friendship and respect, with Western Europe. This example is worthy of emulation, because the interdependence of the world economy leaves us no alternative but that of co-operation and mutual accommodation. This fully conforms to the attitude of the Arab nation, of which my country is an integral part.\n212.\tWe are a small country and our people, who have lived for centuries in conditions of appalling poverty and privation, are at long last looking with some optimism to a future free from the scourges of poverty, ignorance and disease. Our people, long neglected and forgotten by the world, are now lending a hand to other developing countries to help them in their difficult task of providing a decent life for their people. We do this out of self-interest, as well as out of a sense of duty towards others. Most developing countries are potentially rich in human and material resources; we have great confidence in their future. Our modest capital investments in their development will yield rich rewards for us as well as for them and will help us to work together to create a new, world, free from poverty and want.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am particularly pleased to express to you my warmest congratulations upon your election to the eminent functions of President of the twenty-ninth session of -the General Assembly. May I be permitted to recall on this occasion the fraternal ties which bind Lebanon and Algeria and which have marked with their imprint our common struggle for the defense of our national causes as well as the concerted action we are conducting so that their international relations be founded upon the principles of equality, law and justice. The expression of unanimous confidence which has brought you to the office of President is a new tribute paid to your exceptional qualities, to your dynamism and to your efficacy.\n164.\tI should likewise wish to express my fullest esteem to your predecessor, Mr. Benites, who presided with so much competence and so much skill over the last regular session of the General Assembly as well as the sixth special session. This is particularly pleasant for me as Mr. Benites belongs to a country and a region of the world with which Lebanon maintains ties of traditional close friendship.\n165.\tI should like also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the steady efforts he has been making for the benefit of world peace and the strengthening of international cooperation.\n166.\tIf we pass in review the developments which have taken place since the last session, we shall find some grounds for optimism: the continuation of a dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, are likely to increase the chances of detente internationally. The separation of the forces between Israel on the one hand and Egypt and Syria on the other hand constitutes a first step towards the search for a just and global solution of the Middle East problem. The stability which is gradually settling upon South Asia is putting an end to a conflict which had exploded between countries to which the best possible relations bind us. The positive developments in Africa and the adoption by Portugal of a new liberal policy toward its. colonies and the outside world herald the arrival of a new era which, we hope, will put an end to a long and dark period of colonialism and exploitation. The entry of the three new- States into our Organization, namely, Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada, which we welcome most warmly, expands the basis of the United Nations and strengthens our hope that it will soon be able to reach universal representation.\n167.\tAnd yet, certain problems remain in the agenda where they have been since 1946, without having led to a positive and concrete solution. By way of example we might mention first the questions relating to disarmament. How often have we not issued warnings against the unfavorable consequences of the arms race, the massive stockpiling of weapons and the perfecting of weapons of mass destruction. While the United Nations has succeeded in elaborating a certain number of international conventions designed to prohibit tests, the proliferation and the stockpiling of weapons, we are bound to recognize, however, that the distance to be traveled in order to achieve the ultimate purpose is still long and difficult. The common efforts that have been combined in this respect need to be intensified, and they require the support of all Member States and especially that of the permanent members of the Security Council. Within the context of the international action that has been taken in this respect, we hope that an agreement will soon be concluded on the prohibition of chemical weapons and on the prohibition of all nuclear weapons, pending a time where the disarmament problem will be debated as a whole within the framework of the forthcoming world conference on this subject. We also hope that an agreement will be reached on the denuclearization of the Middle East region.\t\n168.\tI do not intend to draw up a detailed inventory of the events which give us cause for disappointment and fear. I shall limit myself to mentioning a few examples from that list; first of all, the situation in southern Africa where the policy of apartheid still prevails, a policy which continues to violate the most elementary moral and human laws and which defies the universal conscience and the repeated condemnations of the United Nations.\n169.\tThe present situation in Cyprus, where tragic events have again occurred in spite of the efforts made by the United Nations through the Secretary- General and the international emergency force, gives ground for the most serious concern. We strongly hope that the efforts now undertaken will make it possible to restore peace and stability in Cyprus and to provide guarantees for its independence, unity and integrity.\n170.\tThe problem of the Middle East continues to be a source of anguish and concern, and constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The pressent session of the General Assembly is called upon today to get to the substance of the Palestine problem for the purpose of achieving a guarantee for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Any search for a just* and lasting solution must be based upon certain fundamental truths which cannot be ignored and which are as follows.\n171.\tFirst, Israel has expelled by force the Palestinian people from its fatherland and has obliged it to become dispersed in several countries.\n172.\tSecondly, the cause of the four wars which have taken place in the region since 1948 was Palestine. The tension which persists in the Middle East derives from the disregard of the rights of the Palestinian people and the hesitancy of the international community expressly to recognize those rights and to permit the Palestinian people to exercise them effectively, in spite of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n173.\tThirdly, any settlement of the conflict of the Middle East which does not respect the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and does not provide for the realization of its national aspirations cannot, under any circumstances, lead to a lasting peace in the region.\n174.\tLebanon has expressed its position on this subject on numerous occasions, in particular following the adoption of resolution 338 (1973) fey the Security Council. I reaffirm here once again that the problem of the Palestinian people is not only a humanitarian problem, but one that constitutes first and foremost a political problem. To hesitate to recognize this fact, to resort to a policy of procrastination or maneuvering in order not to face up to this reality, is to precipitate unavoidable new developments which will in no circumstances serve the cause of peace.\n175.\tIsrael ignores these truths. It continues to violate and defy the condemnations and the resolutions coming from the international community. In recent, months the Palestinian people have been the victim of a new form of a war of extermination. The Israeli forces attack Palestinian camps; they destroy their shelters, kill men, women and children in pursuit of their premeditated policy designed to sow terror and disperse the population. In the past Israel used as a pretext the acts of the fedayeen. Today it does not even trouble to invoke those fallacious pretexts. It undertakes so-called preventive action for the sole purpose of expanding the conflict and aggravating it. It is thus that the forces of Israel are constantly pursuing their aggressions against the territory of Lebanon and its air space, inflicting heavy human and material losses, particularly in the southern portion of the country, thereby violating the principles of the Charter and of international law, as well as the terms of armistice agreed upon between Lebanon and Israel in 1949, the implementation of which is supervised by the United Nations.\n176.\tThus it appears, to our great regret, that the resolutions adopted by the Security Council over the past few years and which contain, vis-a-vis Israel, repeated condemnations and censures, have not gone beyond a purely formal stager in their effect, thus promoting the acceptance of the logic of force and the rule of the law of the jungle, where order and respect for law should have been established.\n177.\tFaced with this deplorable situation, we wonder about the role of the United Nations and the usefulness of the guarantees provided by the Charter for Member States, and in particular for the small countries which view the Organization as something that should be both a shield and a bulwark behind which their independence and security should be protected.\n178.\tThe Charter expressly enumerates the means of having international authority respected and of giving effect to the recommendations and resolutions adopted by the Organization. Has the time not come to apply the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter? In compliance with the decisions adopted by the last conference of the Heads of Arab States as well as by the fifth Islamic congress, Lebanon considers that the Security Council should apply against Israel the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII so that an end might, be put to its repeated aggressions against the people and territory of Lebanon. We are calling for this action out of our attachment to the United Nations and because we wish the Organization to be strong. We are unwilling to admit its inefficacy. We wish it to remain and to be able to realize its essential goals and to fulfill its responsibilities.\n179.\tMeanwhile Lebanon considers that no solution can be provided to the problem of the Middle East without the total withdrawal from the Arab territories of the Israeli forces that have been occupying them since June 1967 and without the recognition of the national and political rights of the Palestinian people.\n180.\tSince the end of the Second World War, the international community has not gone through any economic crisis anywhere nearly as acute as the one through which we are now living and which can have devastating consequences for the whole of mankind. On the other hand, however, during the same period appeals for harmony and co-operation have never been as frequent and as urgent.\n181.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly, which was held last April thanks to the initiative and work of President Boumedienc, placed particular emphasis upon the problems of development as well as upon international economic co-operation, which has been made necessary as a result of the profound transformations that have taken place in modern international relations.\n182.\tThe economic and monetary problems which arise today have not been brought about by the October war and they have not been brought about by the restrictions applied to petroleum production or by the increase in its price. These problems are chronic and long-standing; they antedate the October war; they have been arising in the world for a number of years. The petroleum prices have merely revealed the scope and gravity of these problems.\n183.\tThe Arab States are facing urgent problems in the field of economic and social development. They are attempting to solve them in the best possible way so as to provide a better life for their peoples and to reduce the gap which separates them from the developed peoples. In spite of these historic responsibilities, those countries nevertheless remain responsive to the appeals addressed to them and are examining in a spirit of co-operation and understanding the world economic situation as well as the interests of the developing countries. These preoccupations have been expressed in decisions and actions.\n184.\tWe are convinced that the present economic imbalance and the deterioration in currencies have been made possible by the international economic order which prevails at present and which, because it no longer meets the requirements of our time, should be revised in its very essence.\n185.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly adopted resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI), which are of considerable importance and clearly reflect current economic problems and preoccupations and define the bases upon which the new economic order should be founded.\n186.\tIt is true that the action necessary for the establishment of this order has hardly begun, but it is encouraging to observe that consultations and negotiations to achieve greater justice and equality in international exchanges have been extremely active during the past year. By way of example I might mention the negotiations concerning the reform of the international monetary system, the efforts made with a view to reconsidering GATT and the new orientation which has taken place in the World Bank for the purpose of increasing the resources devoted to development and intensifying multilateral technical assistance.\n187.\tI wish to emphasize also the importance of the Euro-Arab dialog, and I should like to affirm, on behalf of my Government as well as on behalf of all the other Arab Governments, because of the fact that Lebanon is serving as President of the present session of the League of Arab States, our determination to make this dialog constructive and useful for all the parties concerned and beneficial to all their mutual interests.\n188.\tWe also hope that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will lead to the preparation of a new international act regulating maritime relations between States and providing the most appropriate means for the exploitation of the resources of the sea in the interests of mankind as a whole. We hope, too, that the World Food Conference and the World Population Conference will make it possible to draw up a plan of action that will make a positive contribution to the work of the seventh special session of the General Assembly, for which provision was made at the previous session [resolution 3172 (XXVIII)].\n189.\tIn this connexion I should like to emphasize that the Lebanese Government is gratified that the working group responsible for the preparation of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States put this draft into its final form at meetings held this year in Geneva and in Mexico. In expressing the hope that the General Assembly will adopt the draft at its present session, I should like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to Mr. Echeverria, the President of Mexico, to whom belongs the credit for having taken this initiative during the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n190.\tThe Economic Commission for Western Asia, the establishment of which was decided upon by the\nEconomic ar.d Social Council at its 55th session Resolution 1818 (LV)] on the basis of a draft presented by the Lebanese delegation, held two sessions in Beirut in June and September of this year.\n191.\tThrough the establishment of this Commission the Middle East region has recovered the natural rights of which it had been deprived during the past two decades. These meetings gave an opportunity to the countries concerned to affirm their international role and express their desire to contribute to the activities of the United Nations in the fields of development and regional co-operation. The Lebanese Government, which has established the closest ties with the United Nations Economic and Social Office in Beirut during the past 10 years, wishes to express its profound satisfaction at the establishment of this Commission. We are convinced that the activities undertaken by it will redound to the benefit of the countries of the region and contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the United Nations.\n192.\tThe United Nations was born of the suffering of previous generations and the aspirations of new generations for peace and justice. In spite of all the difficulties and the disappointment that may sometimes be felt when taking stock of the achievements of the United Nations, we continue to support this Organization, its objectives and its basic principles. Lebanon, for its part and to the best of its ability, will steadfastly continue to make its contribution to the efforts of the international community to achieve its aims and keep to its course.\n"

To see you, Mr. President, a dear and distinguished colleague and friend, seated as you are, guiding our deliberations, leaves me completely reassured that the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will conclude its work with speed and satisfaction. Your unanimous election is not only adequate testimony to your capabilities but also an acknowledgment of the role Algeria is playing in world affairs today.\n180.\tWe also wish to thank most sincerely your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Benites of Ecuador, for the manner in which he presided over the twenty- eighth regular and the sixth special sessions of our Assembly.\n181.\tCongratulations must also go to the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. In the past year, as indeed in previous years, he has been indefatigable in his quest for peace notably in the Middle East, Cyprus and IndoChina. He has traveled far and wide in the due execution of his multitudinous duties journeys which have taken him to drought-stricken areas, and to many countries throughout the world. We in Sierra Leone will long remember his very successful visit to our country earlier this year. Sierra Leone wishes Mr. Waldheim and his colleagues ever- increasing success.\n182.\tToday sees three new Members of this world body: the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. The history of the struggles, sufferings and tribulations which preceded the emergence into nationhood of these nations is sufficient indication that they will contribute in a positive way towards achieving the great ideals of the United Nations. Sierra Leone is proud to have contributed in its own modest way towards Guinea- Bissau's assumption of its rightful place among the community of nations. To all the new Members we extend our warm welcome. We also look forward to greeting Mozambique as a Member State next year.\n183.\tVictory has crowned the dynamic struggles of the freedom fighters of Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola and the Cape Verde Islands. Guinea-Bissau is now an independent State recognized by the entire international community as a full Member of the United Nations. Agreement for the granting of independence to Mozambique has been reached. We can look forward to the prospect of independence talks on Angola. Portugal itself has been liberated from 50 years of Fascist dictatorship, thus making the total liberation of all former Portuguese colonial Territories a possibility.\n184.\tWhilst we welcome all these positive trends and support the progressive elements in Portugal, which alone are responsible for the warm welcome accorded Portugal in this Assembly this year, and rejoice at the prospect of genuine co-operation between former antagonists, we cannot but note that there are substantial racist elements in that country, still bent on pursuing outdated reactionary colonialist policies of plunder and exploitation for as long , as possible especially in Angola. We appeal to them to see that by such contumacy they are bequeathing to their children nothing but suffering, bitterness, hatred, even loss of life, which are all entirely avoidable today.\n185.\tThe events in Portugal, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and Angola clearly indicate that South Africa's policy of apartheid and minority oppression is doomed to failure. Yet that Fascist racist minority regime continues its odious policy. And for the first time, in a gesture insulting to the integrity of this august body and to the intelligence of representatives, it has included non-whites in its delegation. None but Mr. Vorster and his merry men are deluded by such subterfuge. In former years when Portuguese delegations employed the same trick, did this hide from this Assembly the nature of similar noxious policies then being pursued by that country? It is significant that it is on the occasion that the South African delegation is for the first time so composed that the United Nations has at long last reached the right decision and rejected the credentials of the alleged representatives of South Africa, representatives who with unrestrained ferocity continue the systematic eradication of all enlightened opposition to their heinous policy.\n186.\tGiven the history of the situation, it is obvious that no positive voluntary response from the South Africans is forthcoming. Our only hope therefore is to repeat our appeal to the rest of humanity to redouble its efforts to eradicate this stain of apartheid and racial discrimination from the face of the African continent.\n187.\tThose States enjoying special economic and cultural relations with the South African regime have thereby a responsibility they have clearly not yet shouldered. We appeal for a total boycott of South Africa, because we are convinced that, in a world in which nations have become so increasingly interdependent, political, economic and cultural isolation is bound to make a corrective impression on even the most intransigent regimes.\n188.\tThe Government of Sierra Leone on its part pledges unfailing support for action by the Organization of African Unity, by the liberation movements in South Africa and by governmental and non-governmental organizations, and for the entire program of work of the Special Committee on Apartheid, particularly the program for intensification and coordination of United Nations action against apartheid established by resolution 3151 D (XXVIII), which my Government sponsored at the twenty-eighth session together with 42 other Governments.\n189.\tIt is unfortunate that Ian Smith and his illegal racist regime seem impervious to reason. We appeal to them to follow Portugal's example and alter their collision course before it is too late. It is no disgrace to discard outmoded policies. \\\"Only God and fools don't change.\\\" The peoples of Zimbabwe will unquestionably be freed but at what cost and with what legacy?\n190.\tWe urge Ian Smith and his racist oligarchy to release and hold immediate discussions , with the real African leaders such as Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Sithole with a view to arriving at an acceptable independence agreement with the British Government.\n191.\tIncreased racist legislation and practices will not help. Nor will the widespread detentions, the creation of \\\"protected areas\\\", the shutting down of schools- or the introduction of a system of passes. These in fact will exacerbate the situation further, making it even more unlikely that a peaceful solution of this problem can be arrived at.\n192.\tThe failure of the United Kingdom Government to shoulder its responsibilities in Southern Rhodesia one of the least creditable chapters in British history deeply saddens and embarrasses Britain's many African friends. Given this shirking of its responsibility by the British Government, it is thus only by the determined action of all members of this community, both individually and collectively, that we can hope to achieve any meaningful results by means other than conflict and bloodshed. Unhappily, the sanctions on which this Organization has decided are being imposed either partially, half-heartedly or not at all by those whose compliance is likely to make the greatest impact on the Rhodesian economy.\n193.\tOur viewpoint is that unless there is a change of heart in this direction the only other possibility \u2014a solution by force of arms\u2014with all its attendant horrors and inevitable high! jcost in terms of human life, will be the personal responsibility of each and every one of us who failed to support faithfully this Organization's call for sanctions.\n194.\tNot only do we recommend and continue to urge a strict adherence to the sanctions on which this Organization has decided but we will work for a widening of sanctions in both scope and intensity to include, in particular, travel, communications, sports and all other economic, political, social and cultural activities, because again, as with South Africa, we feel that the effects of isolation military, economic, diplomatic and cultural can only be salutary.\n195.\tThe situation in Namibia gives as much if not more cause for concern. Here we have an unrepresentative gang of desperadoes from a neighboring territory, having no right to govern even their own territory, illegally occupying and terrorizing this neighboring land for whose administration the United Nations itself is responsible. Our view is that the Namibian. issue is a direct test of the efficacy of the United Nations. No Member State therefore can treat it with indifference without betraying the principles that give this Organization its meaning. It is the sacred obligation of every Member of this Organization to co-operate fully in the search for a just solution of this problem.\n1%. Sierra Leone believes in non-interference in the internal affairs of others because it is perfectly conscious of the dangerous consequences of any contrary policy. The tragic events in Cyprus which caused untold suffering, loss of human life and property were precipitated by just such interference. We therefore not only condemned the coup which purposed to oust the elected Government of Cyprus but continue to recognize the legitimate Government of that island headed by Archbishop Makarios that distinguished head of State whose address this afternoon we eagerly await. It is our hope that the further talks between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus will solve the many problems complicated by accent actions and lay the foundations for a lasting peace on the island.\n197. The Middle East continues to be a sensitive region. The recent peace momentum appears to have decelerated. The principle that. Sierra Leone cannot support the acquisition of any territory by any country through force remains our guide-line here. We further believe that lasting peace will return only by compliance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), by the removal of legitimate Palestinian grievances, and by the recognition of the right of the State of Israel to exist.\n198.\tIn our view the tenuous semi-peace in Viet Nam will within the next 12 months be crucially tested and it is still our view that the Korean people themselves should be allowed to work together for the reunification of their homeland.\n199.\tWith regard to Cambodia, Sierra Leone supports the Government of Prince Sihanouk and recognizes his Government in exile as the legitimate Government of Cambodia, and we look forward to an early restoration of the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations, rights that were usurped after the coup d'etat by foreign troops in March 1970.\n200.\tLast year from this rostrum [2133rd meeting] it fell to me to enunciate our concept of one of the duties incumbent on each and every Member State, namely, to work towards a truly harmonized community of nations. It was suggested that it is high time we stopped talking interminably about the gap between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\" and did something about it. The reduction of this gap, it was suggested, not only is worthy of the attention of the galaxy of talent available to this Organization but should be one of our association's priority action programs. We therefore proposed, as important and urgent, item 47 entitled \\\"Reduction of the increasing gap between the developed and the developing countries\\\" and had that item included in the agenda of the present session.\n201.\tSince then the oil-producing countries took certain practical steps within this context. And if the phraseology economic co-operation and not confrontation was not born then, it was at least revitalized. Since then President Boumediene's initiative, culminating in the sixth special session, enabled all of us to agree that the establishment of a new international economic order was necessary.\n202.\tThe need to eradicate these disparities and establish this new economic order is not rooted in charity or philanthropy, otherwise throwing a few provisions into the abyss of hunger would suffice. There can be no peace where the few, by the exploitation of the many, utilize and waste the resources which the many need barely to survive, let alone have a decent standard of living. Fully to appreciate that this need is firmly rooted in respect for human dignity and welfare is indispensable to the safety of each and every one of us. Yet we are not all doing however much or however little we can to eradicate these disparities. To fail to do this, to miss establishing this new economic order as a matter of the utmost priority, is to jeopardize the future of mankind.\n203.\tWe must never forget that today wars, however local, have a global significance, and economic confrontation has profound international repercussions. We live in a tiny, ever-shrinking and organically cohesive world, wherein no-one's destiny is isolated. A world where starvation is only avoided by economic confrontation is not a healthy one; when desperation generates terrorism, who is safe?\n204.\tAnd still we fail to appreciate the urgency. We really ought not to be surprised to find in President Ford's words that: \\\"Today, the economy of the world is under unprecedented stress.\\\" [2234th meeting, para. 22.] It will remain so unless and until we tackle these problems resolutely.\n205.\tIt is for these reasons that Sierra Leone supports the Program of Action decided upon at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, subscribes to the principles of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, joins in any world-wide effort to increase food production, negotiate, establish and maintain an international system of food reserves, and looks forward to the forthcoming World Food Conference in Rome, an important initiative in the right direction.\n206.\tWe advocate and support regional, continental and other international groupings calculated to improve the socio-economic conditions of the developing countries, and join in any serious effort to support the economic self-reliance of these countries.\n207.\tWe are deeply concerned to avoid the path whereby no significant development of the third world is likely without confrontation. This is why at the outset of an era when the resources of the sea will play an ever-increasing part in feeding the world's population and in providing the necessary mineral and geological wealth, we are watching with the keenest of interest the developments at the Conferences on the Law of the Sea, the last of which was held in Caracas. We look forward to the emergence of an agreement encompassing a global strategy preserving the vast resources of the seas for the equitable use of all mankind.\n208.\tIf I have dwelt at some length on the economic aspects of the problems facing the international community as a whole, but more particularly the developing countries, it is because I am of the opinion that it would be one of the major tragedies of the world if we did not, on the economic stage, avoid the fatal and costly mistakes our forebears and we ourselves made in the political arena. We can proceed to making the world's resources available to all mankind by the road of co-operation, if we are seriously prepared to take that path today; if not, we shall proceed tomorrow not even the day after to the same goal by the much thornier and more wasteful road of confrontation, terrorism and chaos.\n209.\tOf direct relevance to the social and economic well-being of each individual is the question of disarmament. While we welcome the process of detente and acknowledge that there are signs of continuing mutual accommodation, not only between the super-Powers but in the international community generally, it is still totally intolerable that the world spends hundreds of billions of dollars every year in the arms race. Stockpiles that could destroy humanity are being amassed by an ever-increasing number of nations, but particularly by the two super-Powers. Imagine what transformation could be wrought by the application of even a fraction of those sums to the development of agriculture, the improvement of the environment, the growth of food and the fight against disease.\n210.\tThe vision of our destiny we must conjure up is that of a world geared to the availability of the fruits of the earth, to each and every individual. And the instrument for translating this vision into reality as speedily as possible is a reformed United Nations Organization.\n211.\tI reaffirm Sierra Leone's faith in the United Nations. Its past contribution to the peace and security of the world has been inestimable. Its future role in evolving a true community of nations, in harmonizing the interests of all, in utilizing the world's limited resources for the benefit of all, and in settling disputes by peaceful means is unique.\n212.\tOn behalf of my country, I speak up for the most important form of co-operation, embracing all mankind, namely the United Nations. Sierra Leone again pledges to do ail in its power to assist this Organization in achieving its full potential. To do this, we are convinced that the situation where one nation can by the exercise, arbitrary or otherwise, of a veto frustrate the wishes, and often the collective wisdom, Of the rest of the entire international community is unacceptable. It is also our position that now is an appropriate time for a review of the entire question of the permanent membership of the Security Council.\n213.\tWe shall, within and without this forum, search, along with any and all other peace-loving nations dedicated to the betterment of the lot of all mankind especially the underfed, the underprivileged and the oppressed we shall with those nations search for the solutions to our many problems, always conscious that we live in an increasingly interdependent world. But indeed in order to realize our vision we believe that it is necessary also to change even the nature of the Organization itself, and that the kind of world organization we need is one growing rapidly and steadily from a platform for propagandist slogans to an embryonic world parliament with all necessary\nancillary legal and physical powers. To this end we again pledge that we stand ready and willing to surrender as much or as little of our national sovereignty, dearly prized as this is, to such a world body as is necessary to give the latter reality and meaning.\n214.\tThese are the views of my Government that I have been privileged to present. We restate that one of the fundamental tenets of Sierra Leone's foreign policy has always been support of this Organization. We will continue to give that support in accordance with the principles enunciated above.\n"

        "file_text": "The heavy responsibility of conducting the proceedings of the General Assembly, assumed in such an exemplary fashion and with such remarkable mastery and outstanding distinction by the distinguished former President of the Assembly, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, now devolves upon Mr. Bouteflika. In associating myself with previous speakers, I should like to express to him on behalf of my delegation our warmest congratulations upon his election. His experience in international affairs, imbued With a spirit of nationalism at once intransigent, clear and open- minded, derives from his experience in the Algerian resistance. It was then strengthened during the difficult years of the struggle for the emancipation of his country, so that subsequently, attending to many matters and many people without losing sight of principles, he rose to full stature as a statesman.\n181.\tThe third world and even the international community will not soon forget the decisive role which he played at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held at Santiago, Chile, in 1972, at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers in 1973 and also at the sixth special session of the General Assembly. It has been often said of the President that he is a man of passion. Yes, he is one of those who have a passion for justice and who are able to put their heart and their talents at the service of a cause which they believe to be the noblest of alt. We would like to state here how proud and reassured Africa feels at seeing one if its best sons become President of the General Assembly.\n182.\tPermit me also to say to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, how grateful we are for the dynamic and effective action he has undertaken in his three years as the head of the Organization. We are aware of the difficulties he faces and also* of the tenacity with which he confronts them. We also appreciate his sense of initiative and we are assured that the fertile imagination he has demonstrated in the past in guiding the Organization is a guarantee of future success.\n183.\tSince the creation of the United Nations to this day, the number of Member States has constantly grown from session to session. We should like to welcome Grenada, the People's Republic of Bangladesh and Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations family.\n184.\tThe earnest desire of newly independent States to join the United Nations contrasts strikingly with the criticisms to which its operations give rise. But this is understandable when one realizes that for a young nation, membership in the United Nations is not only felt as a symbol of its succession to national sovereignty, but also, and above all, as a guarantee that it can participate more actively in the affairs of the community of nations and in the achievement of the noble ideals of that community. We, the so- called countries of the third world, particularly in Africa, endorse these ideals, and that is why we intend to strive relentlessly to maintain international peace and security, to develop social progress and to establish justice and human dignity.\n185.\tThis last year the situation in the world has undergone profound change. In some cases it is still too early to appreciate the scope of the changes. But one thing is certain, we are entering a new era in which ideas previously held to be false are being accepted and becoming established in the international community, while others once thought to be axiomatic should now be rethought, or even abandoned as outmoded. Accordingly, the world is becoming more and more aware of the obvious fact of the interdependence of nations and of the need for establishing a less iniquitous world economic system which will be more egalitarian and more human. Furthermore, we see everywhere that the forces of progress, justice and peace have won many victories over the forces of evil and oppression. It is clear now that, giving way before the defeats inflicted by the dominated peoples, and in the face of the intensification of the national liberation struggles, colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism, unmasked and revealed in their most iniquitous deeds, are now finally realizing that their time ha*> passed.\n186.\tThis is how the international situation appears to us, particularly in Africa where the liberation movements in the former Portuguese possessions have succeeded in shaking the very foundation of the regime which oppressed them. Today, Portugal, its back to the wall as a result of the irreversible process of history, is conceding, thanks to the lucidity and courage of its new leaders, the need for a political solution totally in keeping with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\n187.\tThe Togolese, united in the Assembly of the Togolese people behind their Chief, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, must also warmly welcome the hard- won independence of the glorious fraternal people of Guinea-Bissau and pay a solemn and worthy tribute to the memory of all those who gave their lives in the colonial territories for the cause of liberty, in particular Amilcar Cabral, Secretary-General of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC], and Mondlane, President of the Frente de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO], both the victims of cowardly assassinations. We also wish to express our gratification at the agreement in Mozambique -and await the turn of Angola between FRELIMO and the Portuguese Administration with a view to the early accession to independence of that Territory. The people of Togo once again reaffirm their total and unfailing support for the young republic of Guinea-Bissau and all the liberation movements recognized by OAU.\n188.\tWe cannot pass over in silence the problem of what is called Spanish Sahara. This territory must be liberated pursuant to the relevant resolutions of OAU and of the General Assembly. We are happy to note that sister States concerned by the situation in this Territory have taken a common stand vis-a-vis the colonial Power by advocating recourse to the International Court of Justice for the purpose of receiving an advisory opinion.\n189.\tThe Government of the Republic of Togo appreciates the praiseworthy efforts hitherto undertaken by the new Portuguese authorities and exhorts them to persevere in this course, at the time when they are giving the best demonstration of their good faith and their determination to do everything in their power to complete the work of total decolonization and of granting each of the peoples still under their domination their inalienable right to independence. However, there can be no doubt that reactionary elements and a conservative right, backed by the white minority regimes, are already at work trying to undermine this process, although it is irreversible. That is Why my delegation considers that instead of being unduly optimistic, the international community must remain vigilant and try to prevent and crush any attempt to bring about a Rhodesian-type of solution in any of the Territories in question.\n190.\tThe situation in Rhodesia, and indeed in South Africa and Namibia, has shown no signs of change since the last session of the General Assembly. Rather, it continues to be for my Government a constant source of concern and, in its view, constitutes a constant challenge to the international community. In spite of numerous United Nations resolutions, the racist Salisbury regime is still denying any share of power to the people of Zimbabwe, and the only thing they are offered in response to their aspirations is repression and corporal punishment. The policy of apartheid remains the form of Government in South Africa and in Namibia, where the oppressed majority are deprived of the opportunity to exercise their fundamental rights. We think that by keeping silent in the face of the conditions under which these populations suffer -people who are committing no other crime than that of claiming the most elementary rights recognized by the Charter of the United Nations as belonging to the human being- the international community is inevitably contributing to its own complicity in these atrocities. I should not like to talk of the distressing attitude of certain nations which, albeit friendly, continue to give financial, economic and military support to these racist regimes. I hope, how-ever, that the events which have occurred in the Portuguese Territories will serve as a lesson and will have the consequence of opening the eyes of the racist authorities of South Africa and Rhodesia and make them understand the futility of their outmoded practices.\n191.\tFor almost a year new events have been occurring in the Middle East. The war of October 1973 reminded the world of the precarious situation in that region. My Government welcomed with satisfaction the troop disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt and also between Israel and Syria, and calls vehemently for a continuation of negotiations with a view to achieving a global peaceful settlement in the region, with the final objective of the total withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories and the recognition of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n192.\tFurthermore, the gravity of the situation prevailing in Cyprus, which is of concern to the whole world, inspires us to reaffirm our conviction that only dialog and common effort can resolve these most thorny problems. We would venture to hope, therefore, that the various parties to the dispute will finally achieve an understanding and so bring peace to the island of Cyprus. The international community will have to try to reconcile the divergent viewpoints but at th? same time continue its appeal for help for the suffering caused by the most recent events.\n193.\tThe situation in South-East Asia remains a matter of concern and even alarm.\n194.\tOn the question of Korea, my Government very much hopes for the reunification of the two existing States and gave a favorable welcome to the consensus adopted by the General Assembly last year. We do consider, however, that the presence of foreign troops in Seoul is a major obstacle to the reconciliation so ardently desired by the Korean people, and does not contribute to the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation. That is why my country was among those which called for the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of the question of the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in South Korea [AI9703 and Add. I and 2] and was obliged to break off diplomatic relations with that country, whose stubborn attitude does not seem likely to promote this withdrawal and, in the long run, the reunification of the two States. We very much hope that, through its actions, the international community will assist the great people of Korea to achieve their reunification, and to play in the Organization a role befitting its genius.\n195.\tIn Cambodia, the persistent intervention of foreign troops in the political life of that country constitutes, without any doubt, a major obstacle to peace, security and the well-being of the Khmer people. The Togolese Government will, for its part, continue as in the past to support the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, as the only legitimate Government. My delegation therefore takes particular pleasure at the inclusion in the agenda of this session of item 25, entitled \\\"Restoration of the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations\\\".\n1%. In spite of all the changes that have occurred In the world in recent times, it is distressing for us to have to note that in many regions poverty, racism, war, and imperialist and neo-colonialist exploitation are still afflicting mankind. With faith in the noble ideals of the Organization, and convinced of the necessity to work hand in hand with other nations to establish better living conditions for all, the Republic of Togo considers that it is the duty of the international community to continue to work on the problems of co-operation and economic development in the light of what is the now obvious interdependence of nations, the principles of equity and of the protection of the interests of all States, and in particular the poorer States.\n197.\tIt is no longer a secret to anyone that the results of the sixth special session of the General Assembly did not match the hopes which the third world had so justifiably placed in it. Yet at the conclusion of the work of the General Assembly, Member States solemnly proclaimed their joint determination to work for the establishment of a new international economic order based fundamentally on equity, sovereign equality, common interest, interdependence and co-operation among all States, irrespective of their economic systems, This new economic order which is being contemplated must be able to remedy inequalities, rectify present injustices and reduce the ever- widening gap between the developed and the developing countries, and ensure for present and future generations, in peace and justice, a balanced development and economic growth.\n198.\tIn spite of declarations of intention and pious wishes, the mayor problems remain and are getting worse every day. For some years now, the situation in most market-economy countries has been characterized by an increase in economic activity, escalation of prices, intensification of inflationary movements and imbalance of payments, all at the same time.\n199.\tIn the face of the expedients to which these countries have so often resorted, the developing countries have been obliged hastily to readjust the parity of their currency, without taking account as they should of their import needs, their export trade needs, internal production prices and external aid. All these are inter-dependent factors which, upon analysis, are without any doubt of crucial importance for the growth and development of those countries and have led to the erosion of their purchasing power, export earnings and external reserves.\n200.\tAlthough the international community agrees in acknowledging that the economic development of developing countries remains the primary responsibility of those countries themselves, international action is indispensable to create a climate favorable for such development. My delegation feels that in order to lend credibility to all this, the market-economy countries should adopt a series of liberal policies in trade, and give new momentum, even a new orientation, to the whole matter of development aid.\n201.\tI am afraid that the record in this respect is not very good. What is even more worrying is that the share of our countries in world trade is shrinking more and more. This is why my country has, on other occasions, associated itself with other countries of the third world in laying stress on the need for a liberalization of non-tariff obstacles and aid measures in adjusting the structures of the affluent countries. There is no doubt that non-tariff obstacles, including quantitative restrictions, create difficulties for poor countries in their efforts to increase their trade. Everyone is aware that the small share of the least developed countries in world trade continues to fall even lower. Hence the need to resolve the problem of non-tariff obstacles in their repercussion on the economics of third-world countries. That is why I should like to repeat the hope that I have already expressed from this rostrum that the developed countries will redouble their efforts ',o improve the situation, which is constantly deteriorating, to establish a new international economic order and to implement the Program of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth special session.\n202.\tOn the subject of development aid, my delegation can only applaud the intention recently announced by some developed countries to increase their assistance. Despite that happy initiative, the general situation is overshadowed by uncertainties affecting the programs of certain other countries, particularly the United States, which would tend to restrict substantially United States subsidies to the Agency for International Development. It is ever more disquieting to note that, generally speaking, the terms for development and have a tendency to become harsher while those for government loans have remained unchanged. What is worse, export credits which our countries so often need are granted on very difficult terms. Furthermore, since interest rates are high, debt servicing absorbs much of the export earnings of those countries. If one realizes that the practice of tying aid to purchases in the donor countries is growing, one cannot fail to recognize that the real value of aid granted to our countries is proportionately reduced.\n203.\tApart from economic and trade and aid policy programs, to which I have just briefly referred, other equally urgent problems are at the forefront of the international scene today. The drought which has been raging in the Sudano-Sahelian region, and which continues, as we know only too well, to cause grave damage and to impose a very onerous burden on the populations of the region, remains a constant source of concern. Although there was an upsurge of international solidarity which was by no means negligible, the phenomenon of desertification, despite recent rains, constitutes for those areas a real sword of Damocles. Proof of this is the particularly disturbing picture presented by FAO, which confirms that this scourge continues to rage relentlessly throughout the continent, from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. We can only once again utter a cry of alarm and express the hope that concerted national and regional programs will together seek and find a final solution to this problem, which affects- the prosperity, tranquility and well-being of the people in the regions concerned.\n204.\tThe disaster in Honduras also calls for an upsurge of active solidarity on the part of the inter-national community.\n205.\tAnother no less alarming problem is that of the exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed. The position of the delegation of Togo, which is similar in this respect to that of the other third-world countries, is well known. The Government of Togo feels that an international authority, representing all States, should have absolute authority over the natural resources of the sea-bed, with a view to their rational exploitation by means of service contracts, the marketing of those resources and the deriving from them of profits which should be distributed equitably in the light of criteria to be determined.\n206.\tThe Government of Togo also endorses the view adopted by a number of developing countries particularly with regard to the territorial sea and the inalienable prerogatives of coastal States over the exclusive economic zone. It very much hopes that the developed countries, which contributed to the molding of certain concepts at a time when most third-world countries were still under domination, will revise those concepts in a spirit of equity, thus making possible the more rapid development of the poorer countries.\n207.\tAt the very time when the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was coming to an end at Caracas, another conference, devoted to world population problems, was already under way. As we know, the World Population Conference held at Bucharest was convened in order to awaken the conscience of mankind to the world population situation and to the prospects for the development of that situation and the relationship between it and economic and social development. It was also intended to work out a world plan of action with the principal objective of providing the international community with increased resources and more effective means of equipping itself to solve the population problems as a whole. If, for the developed countries, family planning seems to be a panacea for the ills of underdevelopment, for the third-world countries in general and for Togo in particular, the real solution to demographic problems is rather to place this question within the more general context of economic and social development, for, I venture to point out, in Africa particularly, a new birth does not always mean just another mouth to feed; it means two arms and an extra brain to be used for productive purposes by the people concerned.\n208.\tAware of the periodic disturbances within the international community, my country, under the en-lightened leadership of its President, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, has for many years been waging a fierce battle against underdevelopment. We are aware of the fact that our country's independence will be illusory if the sovereignty which it claims over its natural resources and raw materials is not full and total. That is why we are now engaged in a ruthless struggle for the recovery and unconditional use of our natural resources, convinced that our efforts can be crowned with nothing but success. But the recovery of our natural resources and our refusal to allow foreign Powers permanently to despoil us in no way implies any doubt of our fundamental policy, which is in favor of economic co-operation and openness to the world at large.\n209.\tIt is in that spirit that Togo has undertaken, with its sister-State of Nigeria, the task of establishing an economic community of West African States which will transcend linguistic barriers. That project is at present at a very advanced stage, and we sincerely hope that in a short time this ancient dream of our subregion will become a reality.\n210.\tThis twenty-ninth session is taking place at a time when Africa is at a cross-roads in the process of decolonization but also, we would venture to hope, of its liberation from racism and all those practices which are so humiliating to human dignity. At the same time we are witnessing a particularly rude awakening to a fundamental requirement of our time: the advent of a new economic order. Thus, the United Nations which at times, it is true, has had very good grounds for discouragement, so remote did the possibility seem of realizing the noble ideas which are its raison d'etre, can today, relying on the results already achieved, contemplate the future with more optimism. It can now derive from the results achieved sufficient strength and courage to continue its arduous task, which, let us hope, will less and less resemble the rock of Sisyphus, and also derive from those results sufficient raison d'etre so that it can deliberately, with unshakable faith and unmixed enthusiasm, continue to work in the service of mankind for the building of a just and more fraternal world.\n"

We are glad at the honor thus shown to him personally and to his country, the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. We assure him of our full cooperation in his discharge of the responsibilities of your high office.\n2.\tMy delegation would also like to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to Mr. Leopoldo Benites for his distinguished services to the General Assembly as President of its twenty-eighth session.\n3.\tOn behalf of the delegation of Burma, I am happy to extend our sincere felicitations and warm welcome to the delegations of Bangladesh, Grenada and GuineaBissau. The admission of the three new States to membership in the United Nations will no doubt contribute to the strengthening of the world Organization. We look forward to working together with them for the furtherance of the purposes of the United Nations.\n4.\tThe international situation today is characterized by acute preoccupation with economic and social problems. These problems have forced upon nations the need to review old patterns of relationships not only in the economic but also in the political field. These problems have also made nations realize more than ever before that solutions to international problems cannot be achieved except through international cooperation as envisaged in one of the purposes of the United Nations. It seems to the delegation of Burma that such international cooperation presupposes respect for the principles of equal rights and self-determination, and a greater measure of the democratization of international relations. Experience over the last two decades or so also shows that the threat or use of force in international relations defeats its own purpose, and that if nations are to live in peace and friendship and pursue their own paths of progress, it is imperative that States should strictly observe the principle of noninterference in each other's internal and external affairs. It also underlines the need to persevere in our efforts to settle international disputes by peaceful means, without endangering international peace and security, and with justice.\n5.\tRegarding international peace, it is a matter of great concern that, although there is a trend towards detente and negotiations for the settlement of international disputes, there still exist not only tension but even armed conflicts between some States. Nevertheless, the delegation of Burma is glad to note that, of late, there are signs of more positive thinking on the part of some interested outside Powers regarding these conflicts. We hope that this welcome attitude will become more pronounced in the future. We realize however that in the last analysis, the solution of these conflicts must rest with the parties directly concerned. In this connexion, the delegation of Burma notes with satisfaction that countries mo.e or less vulnerable to outside intervention have shown increasing determination to safeguard and maintain their right to self-determination. This reduces the chances for outside intervention in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of States.\n6.\tLet me now briefly refer to the problem of colonialism and racial discrimination. It is indeed a most welcome development that the new regime in Portugal has acknowledged the right of the people of its dependent territories to self-determination, and has granted independence to GuineaBissau and paved the way for independence in Mozambique and Angola. The delegation of Burma earnestly hopes that this significant trend will help bring about a speedy end to the evils of colonialism and racial discrimination wherever they still exist in Africa.\n7.\tWe live in an age of rapid change and of crises affecting the structures of society. Life in the international community is developing progressively and often old rules do not correspond to existing realities. We take heart that, in accord with Article 13 of the Charter, the United Nations is increasingly directing its efforts towards the codification of international law and its progressive development. We refer here to the conference of plenipotentiaries for the revision of maritime law.\n8.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has rightly been described as the single most important international conference held under the auspices of the Organization. Such high importance \nhas been attributed to the Conference not only because of the unprecedentedly large number of States participating in it, but because there is a universal recognition that, in a world of dwindling natural wealth and rapid population growth, the seas offer the last reserves of the natural resources on which mankind depends for survival.\n9.\tThe fundamental and paramount task of the Conference is to create a new legal system for a just and equitable sharing by all nations of those abundant but finite reserves. Its outcome is, therefore, not only of profound and direct concern to nations but it will also affect the very lives and wellbeing of their peoples for generations to come. The task of establishing a new international regime of the sea to determine the rights and obligations of States with respect to the oceans, is undoubtedly a very complex and difficult one which necessarily requires time.\n10.\tOn the other hand, the pressure of political, economic and technological realities of a fast changing world is such that it is imperative for the international community to reach agreement as soon as possible on the establishment of a just and equitable legal order in the use of the sea. The consequences of procrastination and delay will be far reaching and can jeopardize our efforts to create such an international regime.\n11.\tThe rapid deterioration of the world economic situation over the past year has been a source of major international concern and has brought economic issues to the forefront of world attention. Recent events, more than at any other time, have also made it clear that the world economic system is based on interdependence and that we can ignore this fact only at our peril. The energy crisis, which remains far from being resolved, presents a dramatic case in point. Evidently, the interests of producers and consumers will often diverge, but these differences must be reconciled in a spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding. When attempts at conciliation fail, the outcome only brings unnecessary economic instability and hardship to the entire world community.\n12.\tWorld inflation presents another important example of interdependence. In the modern world, with its complex economic interrelationships between States, it is almost impossible for a country to isolate itself from economic problems originating elsewhere. One economic problem that has received much publicity of late and which has reached worldwide proportions is, of course, inflation. Considering the relative ease with which imported inflation can spread from one country to another, it is hardly surprising that it has now become an international problem. The seriousness of the situation has been recognized by many countries and the need to supplement domestic remedies with international collaboration and coordination on anti-inflationary measures has been increasingly realized.\n13.\tWhile international cooperation provides a fruitful approach in the fight against inflation, we believe that a sound international monetary system can also make a valuable contribution to overcoming this problem. On the basis of the final report of the ad hoc Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues (Committee of Twenty),1 a large measure of agreement has already been reached on international monetary reform, including the agreement on the valuation of special drawing rights on the basis of 16 major currencies of the world.\n14.\tThe annual meeting .of IMF recently held in Washington, has approved amendments to the Articles of Agreement of the Fund designed to improve the adjustment process in balance of payments disequilibrium, to impose guidelines on floating rates and to extend the Fund's assistance to developing countries in the form of extended fund facility and the oil facility to meet the current payment crises.\n15.\tHowever, there are still fundamental issues that remain to be solved, such as the question of restoring the system of par values and the role of gold in the international payments system. It is imperative that these fundamental issues be solved through closer international cooperation, thus forestalling a division of the world into competitive trading blocs with all its undesirable consequences.\n16.\tWhile the problems associated with the energy crisis, inflation and the shortages of food and essential raw materials have caused worldwide hardship and anxiety, the burden has been particularly heavy on the developing countries. This is to be expected, as developing countries, with their weak economic structures, are more vulnerable to adverse external economic pressures. For some, the high cost of fuel and food and, for many others, the inflated prices they have to pay for essential semi-manufactured and manufactured goods, capital equipment, raw materials and spare parts, have severely strained their balance of payments. Many of those countries now have been placed in the highly undesirable situation where they have to devote so much of their energies and resources to meeting the high priorities of their immediate needs that their longterm goals of social and economic development are likely to suffer.\n17.\tThese difficulties could, of course, be mitigated if the international community has the political will to implement some of the more important United Nations resolutions on international economic development and cooperation which have been adopted after arduous debate and protracted negotiations. But, for the most part, these resolutions have been conveniently ignored, as indeed have the high hopes of the much proclaimed International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n18.\tAt the recently concluded World Population Conference at Bucharest there were opportunities to exchange views and information and to devise means of international cooperation on the question of population and food. The forthcoming World Food Conference in Rome will provide further opportunities to explore and to find answers to both the longterm and short-term aspects of the world food problem. The constructive proposals which no doubt will ensue from that Conference should form a basis for greater international cooperation in that field.\n19.\tThe world economy is now at the crossroads. Recent events, as well as new sets of circumstances and relations, have undermined its structure, its basic premises and its institutions. What is now imperative, therefore, is to replace it with a new world economic order that is more in conformity with the changed circumstances, that is more equitable, and, what is most important, that engenders a new sense of responsibility and cooperation for mutual benefit on the part of the international community. We believe that the recommendations contained in the resolutions adopted at the recently concluded sixth special session of the General Assembly have much to contribute to the creation of such a new world economic order. We would, therefore, like to reiterate our support of the principles embodied in the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (SVI)] and urge an early implementation of the provisions made in the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (SVI)].\n20.\tIt would be no exaggeration to say that the United Nations is now in a new and important phase of its development. One of the topics that will surely occupy our attention is the increasing role that the* Organization must inevitably play in the establishment of a new international economic system founded on the principles of co-determination and equality of all countries. Through the exigencies of the world economic crisis and the restiveness of States, the international community is once again discovering the United Nations as the most universal forum in which to seek solutions through concerted action.\n21.\tThe international theme today is interdependence, global participation and solutions. The talk now is for dialog and negotiations between the economically weak .developing countries, which constitute the majority, and the few industrialized developed countries. It is becoming increasingly clear that the contemporary world, more than ever, calls upon all nations to reconcile their differences and to seek joint action in solving pressing world problems through the United Nations. All this suggests that the value of the United Nations is amply being borne out by time, that it is fast acquiring a fresh lease of life and charting a renewed course for international cooperation in the pursuit of peace and progress. To realize this objective is the challenge with which the United Nations is faced today.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, in this year in which Australia has established diplomatic relations with Algeria, it gives me particular pleasure, as head of the Australian Government, to congratulate you upon your election as President of this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The Algerian experience has encompassed many of the greatest problems facing the world and the Organization today. Sir, your nation's experience\u2014and your own\u2014ensure distinction and significance to your occupancy of this high post.\n3.\tAs head of the first Australian social democratic Government since Australia helped to found the United Nations and to frame its Charter more than a quarter of a century ago, I reaffirm our loyalty to both. Such pledges are easily enough given; yet no nation makes them more sincerely, more earnestly today, than Australia.\n4.\tNo country more than Australia needs the fulfilment of the international objectives of the United Nations to reach the fulfilment of her own national objectives. There are few countries in which the paradox is demonstrated with such force that true national independence depends upon international interdependence. There are few nations to which the mirage of national self-sufficiency can be made so tempting; yet there are few nations for which that mirage can be so easily dispelled. Australia, fortunate in possession of great resources, confident in the ability of its own people to develop those re-\nsources, is nevertheless not ashamed to admit its interdependence with its neighbours and its partners across the world and its dependence upon them. We are a people without illusions; we Australians neither falsely exaggerate our strengths nor fearfully exaggerate our weaknesses. It is precisely because we make a rational assessment of our strengths and weaknesses that we recognize that we depend upon a better international order to preserve those things we most value about our national independence/In seeking a better international order, we give primacy to the United Nations.\n5.\tIt is therefore with growing concern that we witness what can only be called a drift away from international order and international co-operation at present occurring in world affairs. Australia's concern springs not just from the real difficulties created by recent events but, even more, from the feeling that there has been a weakening of will, a loss of momentum, in international determination to meet and overcome those difficulties.\n6.\tGreat hopes were born two years ago. The Australian Government whole-heartedly endorsed the movement towards detente between the United States and the Soviet Union. We whole-heartedly supported China's return to her true place in the family of nations\u2014in the Organization and in the world. We whole-heartedly .endorsed the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet Nam, signed in Paris on 27 January 1973. We therefore ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], moved our China Embassy from Taipei to Peking, and ended our own military involvement in Indo-China.\n7.\tAbove all, we have been determined to do all we can to ensure that our region and the world should not for a second time lose the opportunity for a new settlement, a new step towards peace and progress, in the way that the chance was thrown away after the war in Korea and after the Geneva meetings in 1954. Yet we have to acknowledge that the hopes springing from the remarkable events of 1971 and 1972 are beginning to sour. There is increasingly a sense of drift, a sense of events out of control. The task of this Assembly should be to help to stop that drift. Our natural preoccupation with our national problems \u2014and for most of us they are very great indeed\u2014must not lead to a loss of international concern and involvement.\n8.\tWe cannot turn inwards. Even the most immediate problems of domestic worry\u2014such as inflation, which so many of us share, the strongest, the most highly developed along with the weakest and the least developed\u2014are in essence international problems for which there can be no ultimate, no complete national solution without an international solution. No nation, no group of nations, no bloc, no alliance, can live alone, can live entirely to itself in this new world. We are all internationalists now\u2014by necessity. Australia is internationalist by necessity and by choice.. Each of us has our bilateral arrangements and our regional arrangements. Many, like Australia, through treaty or trade or tradition, have honourable alignments and valuable associations.\n9.\tIt is, however, through this Organization, its Assembly and its councils and through the specialized agencies that the enduring international settlements must ultimately be sought and the drift away from international co-operation must be arrested. So there must be no loss of nerve, no loss of will here. If we here lose our nerve, if we here allow that drift to continue unchecked, we face the break-down of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty , the break-down of world economic order, the break-down of all our high hopes and high words about closing the gap between the developed and the developing nations and the breakdown of any claims of the United Nations to be an effective peace-keeper and peace-maker. We should all stand guilty of betrayal of our peoples if we did not act now to stop the drift in these matters.\n10.\tThe special obligations which the might of the super-Powers imposes upon them should not be made an excuse for indifference or indecision on the part of the rest of us. We continue to urge upon the superPowers the need for them both to maintain the utmost mutual restraint in their relations between themselves and towards us. They can, of course, easily destroy each other; they can also destroy all of us. We are entitled to ask them to move forward to a stage of complete detente where their tremendous power can be used jointly for the betterment of the whole civilization. We are entitled to insist upon restraint in their deployment of forces overseas, in areas such as the Indian Ocean. Australia is strongly opposed to the Indian Ocean becoming a ground for competition, much less confrontation, between the great Powers.\n11.\tMutual restraint is also essential to prevent the excesses and the dangers of the nuclear arms race. Let me recall that those of us who are so far parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have given the nuclear Powers certain rights; they in turn have accepted certain responsibilities and given guarantees, as part of a two-way process. We undertook not to develop nuclear weapons in return for guarantees of protection and assistance in the development of nuclear knowledge for peace. Above all, the sponsoring Powers undertook to promote and maintain a world order based upon comprehensive disarmament. Unless these obligations are sincerely fulfilled, the incentive abroad and the pressure at home for more and more nations to get nuclear weapons will increase. A co-operative effort by all leaders must find effective means of halting the arms race and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. There is nothing more urgent facing any of us today.\n12.\tAustralia therefore sees with deepest anxiety the continuing and new testing of nuclear devices, the prospect of an ever-increasing number of nations possessing nuclear weapons and an even greater number possessing the capability of exploding nuclear devices. Where it has been open to Australia,\nwe have expressed our concern , in action before the International Court of Justice.\n13.\tAll of us face a nightmare world in which as many as 15 or 20 nations may possess nuclear weapons by the early 1980s. There is time to prevent it. We have perhaps about a year, two years at the most, in which to prevent it. Now is the time; it may be our last chance. For our part, the Australian Government pledges that it will neither develop nor acquire nuclear weapons.\n14.\tOur first aim must be to strengthen the non-proliferation Treaty and to work for its acceptance everywhere. Real and rapid progress can best be made through that Treaty. We should build on what we have. We have not time to start all over again. Six years after it was concluded and more than four years after it came into force, some States have still to ratify the Treaty or to make clear their renunciation of nuclear weapons development. Certainly we understand the difficulties the Treaty presents to some nations. We understand their reservations. We acknowledge the discriminatory aspects of the Treaty as it now stands. We would hope that the forthcoming conference to review the Treaty will remove some of these difficulties, but the conference will be more successful and meaningful if more nations ratify the Treaty and work within its framework to improve it and to apply it.\n15.\tSecondly, we should make a comprehensive treaty to ban nuclear-weapons testing an urgent priority. The treaties which have been concluded and the resolutions which have been adopted are important achievements, but they have not gone far enough towards stopping the nuclear arms race. They are only steps towards universal and comprehensive agreement on nuclear-weapons testing. We must complete the journey .\n16.\tThirdly, we need effective international arrangements to govern and to control nuclear experiments for peaceful purposes. We all recognize the promise which scientific collaboration on the peaceful uses Of nuclear energy holds for economic development in the interests of all mankind. But the world cannot afford the risks which lie in the prospects of increasing numbers of countries possessing nuclear devices\u2014even if they profess to have them for peaceful purposes only. We cannot shrug off nuclear explosions which present us with such a threat, particularly explosions conducted outside existing safeguards and without international inspection. Australia seeks support for an international arrangement by which all States could gain access to nuclear explosive services for peaceful purposes under agreed and secure international controls. We urge all nuclear States to co-operate in establishing such a service, preferably under the auspices of IAEA. I join with the Foreign Minister of Canada in this call [2242nd meeting].\n17.\tAnother approach to the goal of disarmament worth serious exploration is the concept of peace zones. Such zones are of course no substitute for comprehensive disarmament and no substitute for an effective non-proliferation Treaty. Australia, however, takes a particular interest in the agreements and proposals embodying this concept, because most of them directly affect our continent and our region. The Antarctic Treaty,1 the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 {XXVI)}, the ASEAN Declaration,2 the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)3 and the proposal by Iran for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East [AI9693] all move in the right direction. They command Australia's broad support since they assert the dangers inherent in an uncontrolled, unregulated use of our planet for the deployment of nuclear weapons; they seek to limit the development, emplacement and use of nuclear weapons in the: areas and environments they cover; they all express growing anxiety about the spread of nuclear weapons; they all seek paths towards reducing tensions among the nuclear Powers. For the Australian Government, these initiatives not only represent ends in themselves but, we believe, they serve to stimulate progress on other important measures intended to bring to fulfilment the hopes of mankind to live in security, free from the threat of nuclear war.\n18.\tLet me say that Australia's anxiety about the nuclear arms race does not blind us to the risks to international peace and security from localized conflicts using conventional weapons. We, the members of the international community, stand condemned for our failure so far to find the sense of responsibility and the means of authority to stop regional disputes being settled by force. It is equally bad that some members of the international community have made possible \u2014for profit\u2014massive recourse to arms and to the means of waging* wars about to start or wars already begun. A world order that permits, or that by default sanctions, the large-scale transfer of weapons from one country to another where the risk of conflict is high, is gravely at fault and very foolish. This short-circuits the process of peaceful negotiation and gives first place to the settlement of disputes by war, by bloodshed and, as always happens\u2014and must always happen in modern wars\u2014by the bloodshed of the innocent.\n19.\tClearly , we still have far to go before the international community will agree collectively to forsake the short-term gains on arms sales abroad in return for the longer-term but less tangible benefits that such a self-denying ordinance would confer on the weapons producers. Nevertheless, we now ask that the major weapons-producing countries should set an example by imposing the strictest restrictions on the export of arms abroad to areas where there is a clear risk of conflict.\n20.\tRecent events have shown that the preservation of peace is more than a matter of arms control; it is also a matter of keeping the peace When violence threatens or occur?. It is not enough for Members of the United Nations to pay lip-service to the United Nations peace-keeping role. Individual Members have the duty to provide the material and financial resources to allow the United Nations to deal with threats to security, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression.\t\n21.\tAustralia stands ready to participate in peacekeeping operations in whatever way would be most useful. Australia is, of course, allied by treaty with the United States, and we make no apologies for that. There is, however, no area of actual or potential conflict anywhere in the world where loyalties, ideology or interests should make an Australian involvement\nin peace-keeping unacceptable or unwelcome. We wish Australia to be always among the first nations of which the United Nations would ask peace-keeping forces. We shall be among the first to respond. We undertake to keep the Secretary-General regularly informed of the nature and size of the contributions we are able to provide over a given period.\n22.\tAustralia further believes that the importance of preventive diplomacy must come to be more widely recognized and accepted, and that the ample provisions offered by this Organization for peace-keeping and good offices should be reinvigorated, explored more thoroughly and exploited more thoroughly. It is time, therefore, to look again at the hitherto untapped provisions of the United Nations Charter and to make all that we can of its capacity to provide useful contributions to such activities as fact-finding, conciliation, mediation and negotiation.\n23.\tWe here should particularly devote increased attention to the role of the International Court of Justice. Not enough nations use the Court. Members of the international community cannot be compelled to take their cases before the Court, but we should strive to build confidence in the Court's worth, its wisdom and its workability as one way of rationalizing and harmonizing international relations. If the. rule of international law and justice is to prevail, then an international tribunal is indispensable. The Court's jurisdiction should be widened. Jurisdiction should become compulsory and universal. New multilateral treaty arrangements, like that which will emerge from the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, should enforce compulsory settlement of disputes, with the International Court as the final court of appeal. By such steps the rule of law can be established and strengthened in a better world order.\n24.\tIn this difficult, complicated, crowded world we are all creating for ourselves, the causes of conflict multiply. Nuclear brinkmanship, ideology, border disputes, race hatred, religious bigotry, national ambitions, foreign exploitation\u2014all provide actual or potential sources of tension, conflict, bloodshed and war. Yet there remains for the future one of the oldest of all causes of war-\u2014the threat of war for the possession of resources. Huge population increases, the revolution of rising expectations, the enormous and often wasteful demands our technological civilization makes upon the world's resources \u2014all have increased the pressures on our world civilization to the very limit of the tolerable.\n25.\tFor countries which lack resources, the situation has become critical. The developing countries have been grossly disadvantaged; Last year's oil crisis brought that sharply home to all of us, developed and developing alike.\n26.\tIt is proper that in this world forum I should state the Australian Government's attitude to the use and development of Australia's own very considerable resources. There is no place in our thinking for economic nationalism in its crudest sense. We do, of course, wish to ensure steady markets at fair prices for what we produce. We recognize the great scope for increased co-operation between producers of raw materials and for groups of exporting countries to associate to build a better framework for orderly and rational development of production and trade. As a relatively developed and thriving nation whose production of many resources is also shared by developing and poorer nations, Australia recognizes its duty to co-operate with such nations in obtaining a fair and reasonable return for our products, and we are co-operating.' Equally, however, we in Australia accept our responsibility to reassure countries which depend upon our resources that they shall have steady, secure access to those resources at fair prices. We must protect our interests, and we shall, but Australia is not in the business of resources blackmail. That is the way to international disaster, for producers and users alike.\n27.\tLet us accept the plain fact that war for resources or food or markets carried on by any nation or group of nations would in modern times represent the supreme folly. There is no war, nuclear or conventional, by which the victor, so called\u2014assuming there is one\u2014could conceivably win back by war the resources used and destroyed in waging it. If we choose not to listen to the voice of humanity against war, we might at least listen to the voice of common sense and, indeed, ordinary, rational self-interest.\n28.\tAs a major food producer, Australia is. particularly interested in the proposals on food which President Ford [2234th meeting] and Secretary of State Kissinger [2238th meeting] made at this session. Australia undertakes to work constructively and cooperatively towards the implementation of those proposals. Suggestions such as the establishment of an international system of grain reserves are thoroughly commendable, and they deserve our most serious attention.\n29.\tOf all the changes that have occurred in the international community since the Second World War, none has more profoundly altered the face of the world than the accession to independence by those peoples and States formerly under colonial rule; The process is not yet complete, but we look to a time in the near future when no territory will be controlled against its choice by a metropolitan Power with which it has no geographical, social, racial or cultural affinity. In that regard, we particularly welcome decisions by Portugal about its colonies.\n30.\tAustralia has acted with determination and vigour to apply the relevant Articles of the Charter. Papua New Guinea became self-governing on 1 December 1973. It will become fully independent as soon as the House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea decides. We expect that decision soon: Let me emphasize that the decision we await is that of the House of Assembly. The Australian Government made its own decision long ago: we utterly reject a colonial role for Australia. Meanwhile, the Australian Government deals with the Government of Papua New Guinea in all significant respects as that of a nation already independent.\n31.\tThere is to me, I must say, a most satisfying symmetry in the march of events by which Portugal, the West, and Australia, the newest of the colonial Powers, are acting at the same time towards the liquidation of colonialism. Across the distance of more than four centuries the new world in Australia clasps hands with the old in ending a false, demeaning, unworthy power over others. \n32.\tThe dramatic and welcome progress made towards the dissolution of the oldest and last of the colonial empires now enables the United Nations to direct even more concentrated attention Upon its twin evil, that of racisms particularly in its post-colonial manifestations in southern Africa. We must be unremitting in the efforts sanctioned by the Assembly to break the illegal regime in Rhodesia\u2014Zimbabwe\u2014 to end South Africa's unlawful control over Namibia and to end apartheid. We should all make determined efforts to see that the momentum which launched the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination is not lost. <;My Government, conscious that Australia's own record is seriously flawed, is determined to remove all forms of racial discrimination within our own shores\u2014notably now as notoriously in the past, against our own aboriginals.\n33.\tWhile racism remains as cruel as any example of man's inhumanity to man, we should not, however, overlook the existence of other forms of discrimination which rob men and women of their right to live in dignity and peace of mind. Throughout the world, political prisoners languish in gaols or are otherwise deprived of their civil liberties. There are thoroughly unacceptable constraints on the right of political asylum. Religious and ethnic minorities are persecuted, workers are denied the protection of conventions of ILO and women are denied equal opportunities. Even in the General Assembly women are scarcely equally represented. The Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Willesee, will during the discussion be submitting Australia's views and proposals on these matters.\n34.\tThere has never been a time in human history when the truth of the oneness, the indivisibility, of humanity has been so manifest. It is no longer only a philosophical or religious proposition, but an assertion of sheer reason and commanding common sense. All the momentous recent developments have profound implications for the future conduct of international relations, since they have one common theme: the interdependence of us all. That interdependence is now almost total.\n35.\tAn attempt by any State to bring about political or economic change in another through unconstitutional, clandestine, corrupt methods, by assassination or terrorism, undermines the rule of international law, encourages adventurism and anarchy, endangers world peace, and turns quite quickly against even the most powerful nations that would seek to advance their cause by such methods.\t\n36.\tUnwilful erection of trade barriers by one State or group of States without regard to the hardship caused to others can create economic dislocation around the world by curtailing or closing export markets to which their industries have become geared and on which their foreign exchange earnings depend.\n37.\tA refusal to recognize the inalienable rights of all peoples to freedom and independence produces tension and conflict, not only between the oppressed and the oppressors, but between them and other nations which become associated or involved in these just and legitimate struggles.\n38.\tNow more than ever we look to the United Nations. It has the experience, the stature and the capacity to help us identify the sources of tension between nations, to prescribe collective measures to mitigate and eventually to remove* the causes of conflict, and to anticipate and prevent situations developing that have the potential for disturbing world peace.\n39.\tIt is claimed that the world is now short of leadership. It is truer to say that the nature, complexity and universality of the problems rushing in upon us render irrelevant and obsolete that concept of world leadership whereby a handful of powerful men in charge of the most powerful nations can chart the course for the rest of us to follow. So the challenge for the United Nations to provide a genuine and continuing source of leadership, of hope and purpose for the world is more urgent, the opportunity more real, than at any time in the history of the Organization. In the response we make here to that challenge, we shall be judged \u2014as nations, as representatives of our nations, and as men and women\u2014not by our power or size or wealth but by the honesty of our efforts to promote and to practise the principles of the Charter of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "On behalf of my delegation I convey sincere congratulations to Mr. Bouteflika on his unanimous election as President of this session. The qualities of his leadership have been displayed both in his country and in the context of the group of nonaligned nations.\n45.\tAt times in history events and developments suddenly assume the proportions of a bursting dam. Since I addressed this Assembly a year ago [2128th meeting], the world has been confronted with war, with profound changes in the distribution of power and economic wealth, with the sudden scarcity of essential raw materials and with continued massive violations of human rights. Those dramatic developments have brought home the dearly bought lesson that peace, justice, freedom and development are inseparably linked. None can be achieved without the others.\n46.\tLast year, in this Assembly, delegations welcomed political detente. My Government strongly supported, and continues to support, efforts towards detente in Europe and elsewhere in the world. But the situation remains unstable because so far detente largely represents understanding between the big Powers within certain limits, limits defined by elements of deterrence, competition and collaboration. The unacceptable risk; of nuclear war compels cooperation but does not exclude competition. External events beyond the limits of the understanding on detente continue to endanger the balance resulting from detente. Detente between the great Powers has therefore not eliminated sources of friction and crisis caused by lack of justice and freedom.\n47.\tThe most striking and dangerous case in point is the war in the Middle East and its aftermath. The international community was again confronted with the fundamental instability of a situation resulting from the absence of a just peace settlement in the region. Notwithstanding detente between the iJreat Powers, peace proved to be impossible without justice to all the parties concerned. The Netherlands Government welcomes and supports the efforts and steps to achieve such peace and justice the armistice agreements and the subsequent agreements on the disengagement of forces. A high tribute is due the Governments and statesmen within the region and outside it who made those agreements possible.\n48.\tThe position of the Netherlands Government in support of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council is known and is fully reflected in the declaration of the nine countries of the European Economic Community of 6 November 1973.4 Subsequent to that declaration, the countries of the European Economic Community have entered into a dialog with the countries of the Arab world in order to strengthen and intensify their mutual relations and to arrive at longterm forms of economic, technological and cultural cooperation. The Netherlands Government wishes to promote this EuropeanArabian economic cooperation. It expresses the strong hope that the efforts being undertaken in the political field will soon lead in the Middle East to durable peace based on justice.\n49.\tAnother external event affecting detente was the armed conflict in Cyprus. Here too, durable peace proved impossible without justice to all the parties concerned. A political settlement without any further recourse to armed intervention must, in the view of the Netherlands Government, be based on full respect for the independence and territorial integrity of the country and for the fundamental rights of the peoples and communities concerned, The conflict in Cyprus has caused profound human suffering and economic dislocation. My Government has contributed to the emergency operations of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Parallel to further efforts towards a political settlement, action should be taken by the international community to restore the economy of the island by providing emergency economic assistance.\n50.\tAlthough the United Nations has not been able to prevent the disasters that have afflicted the Republic of Cyprus since July, the presence of the United Nations has proved to be of great value. I wish to pay a tribute to the members of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus [UNFICYP] who have acted firmly and responsibly in situations of grave risk and have suffered severe casualties in performing their tasks. In view of the outstanding services rendered by UNFICYP in the present crisis, my Government has decided to make a voluntary contribution of $250,000 for the current year to the financing of the United Nations Force. \n51.\tThe Cyprus crisis and the war in the Middle East have demonstrated both the potentialities and the limitations of the United Nations peacekeeping activities. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations has been trying for years to formulate basic guidelines for those operations, but has not yet succeeded in reaching full agreement on the complex issues involved. I am gratified to note that this lack of agreement on the theory of peacekeeping has not prevented the Security Council from taking practical action when circumstances required new operations. I do hope that this will accelerate the work of the Special Committee.\n52.\tI should like to make one remark here about the question of the composition of peacekeeping forces. In my opinion this question should be dealt with in a pragmatic way and not made dependent on the application of too rigid and antiquated yardsticks of geographical distribution. Paramount should be the objective of the operation: the efficient and expedient safeguarding of peace. My Government remains ready to contribute Netherlands units to United Nations peacekeeping operations.\n53.\tAnother grave so are of danger to and instability of detente is in my view the arms, race in the Middle\nEast, the unprecedented proportions of which threaten to prevent or to upset any political settlement and increase the potential danger to world peace of the conflict situation in the region. If the world really wishes to promote detente and peace, the United Nations and individual Member States must address themselves to the problems of the arms race in conventional weapons in this and other danger areas.\n54.  I have spoken of some external factors which threaten to frustrate the development of detente. In my view a further serious threat to lasting detente is the unsolved problem of nuclear proliferation.\n55.\tThe Secretary General was right in drawing our attention, in the introduction his report on the work of the Organization, to the dangers to our civilization and the human race inherent in the uncontrolled spreading of nuclear \\\"knowhow\\\" and of plutonium, and in the proliferation of nuclear devices [AI9601I Add.I, sect. X], I cannot conceal my Government's profound concern regarding the action taken by India in May of this year in testing a nuclear explosive device.\n56.\tWe have taken due note of the statement of the Minister of External Affairs of India [2245th meeting] that India has no intention of becoming a nuclear Power and that it remains committed to a policy of using nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. Nevertheless it is difficult to distinguish between a nuclear test for peaceful purposes and a nuclear test for weapon purposes; therefore it cannot be denied that the Indian test explosion represents a setback to international efforts to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons and to ban nuclear tests everywhere and by everyone. I repeat: everywhere and by everyone.\n57.\tThe risk of nuclear proliferation should be a matter of concern to all nations, regardless of size or power. The imperative of world peace must override nuclear ambition. In this context the review conference provided for in the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] gains even more relevance than before.\n58.\tAs a member of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva the Netherlands Government will continue to support all efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. We regret that progress in this field has not come up to expectation. In particular, my Government deplores the fact that the parties to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963 have not yet fulfilled their commitment to ban nuclear tests in all environments.\n59.\tI assume that the Assembly will give great attention this year to the general problems of arms control and disarmament. Several new proposals from different sides deserve serious consideration.\n60.\tAs far as the. situation in Europe is concerned, the Netherlands, in consultation with its allies, will continue to press for substantial results in the Vienna talks on mutual and balanced force reductions.\n61.\tIn the introduction to his annual report, the SecretaryGeneral has urged us \\\"to ensure.that peacekeeping efforts must not be the pretext for slackening the momentum of the search for a settlement of underlying problems.\\\" [Al960llAdd.l, sect. VI.]\n62.\tIn this connexion, I wish once more to draw attention to the essential but too often neglected role of the International Court of Justice in the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Court has recently adapted its procedures and rules, which now permit shorter and more simplified action. I wish to support the SecretaryGeneral's appeal to Member States to review the possibility of referring legal disputes to the Court.\n63.\tParallel to the achievement of universality in the United Nations there has been a progressive development of new rules of international law acceptable to all States, old and new. Such development of international law will, however, not lead very far without the strengthening of, and more frequent recourse to, effective machinery for the settlement of disputes. I hope that this session of the General Assembly will take action to that end.\n64.\tThere can be no peace without justice and freedom and without respect for human rights. The Secretary General has shown his concern for the disregard of individual rights and the decline in civility. He has reminded us that the democratization of international relations in order to bring peace and justice to the daily life of all peoples has always been a central role of the United Nations.\n65.\tThe Netherlands Government will continue to press for the safeguarding and defense of fundamental human rights, within my own country under the European Convention on Human Rights in the discussions between Eastern and Western Europe, and in the world at large. I wish to express the profound joy of the Government and people of the Netherlands caused by the restoration of democracy and human rights set in motion in Greece and Portugal and by the reversal by the new Portuguese Government of the colonial policies of its predecessors. Those most encouraging developments, which have been welcomed by many in this General Assembly, should not, of course, turn attention away from persistent violations of human rights elsewhere. I refer specifically to the situation in South Africa and Namibia and to the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia. There is reason, too, for continued deep concern about the situation in Chile.\n66.\tI refer also to the increasingly widespread practice of torture and maltreatment of prisoners. The Netherlands delegation, together with others, will put forward specific proposals in this respect.\n67.\tThe persistence and the very increase of violence and brutality in today's world is an alarming phenomenon. Practices of terrorism jeopardizing the lives of men, women and children continue to be a source of great anxiety. It is a matter of common interest and concern to all nations to prevent and combat such practices by joint and separate action.\n68.\tIn order to strengthen respect for freedom of religion or belief the Netherlands delegation will also introduce proposals aimed at the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief.\n69.\tThe year 1975 has been proclaimed Intel national Women's Year by the General Assembly of the United\nNations [resolution 3010 (XXVII)]. My Government will fully support United Nations action in this respect, because the role of women is crucial in the search for development and justice.\n70.\tThere can be no peace without justice and freedom. The rapid developments towards decolonization in Africa have brought us considerably closer to the implementation of the right of self-determination of all nations. Some of the basic purposes of the Charter and the ideal of universality are now coming close to fulfillment.\n71.\tThe Kingdom of the Netherlands extends a most cordial welcome to the three new Members of the Organization: Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea Bissau. Our sincere feelings of sympathy towards the people and Government of Bangladesh, which have been so severely tried, have been expressed by our continuing efforts to render effective assistance. In Grenada we salute a nation close to the Netherlands Antilles, part of the Kingdom I here represent. My Government particularly rejoices at the presence among us of GuineaBissau. Its struggle to obtain the rights enshrined in our Charter has finally been justly rewarded.\n72.\tIt is my privilege to inform you that the Kingdom of the Netherlands next year will witness the accession to full independence and sovereignty *of one of its partners, Surinam. The Government and people of the Netherlands are looking forward to the now rapidly approaching day when Surinam will be able to take its rightful place in the General Assembly. In view of Surinam's wish for independence in 1975, the three partners of the Kingdom, that is, the Netherlands Antilles, Surinam, and the Netherlands, will soon meet in a joint effort to reshape the present relationship agreements.\n73.\tStability in Europe and in the world is seriously threatened by economic dislocation, by persistent inflation, and by the danger of recession and unemployment. The energy crisis and the profound changes in international commodity markets have produced a catalytic effect on the economic development of the industrialized world. A reorientation of thinking and policy on our pattern of growth and on the level and nature of our prosperity is called for. Obviously, a redistribution of power and wealth has been set in motion.\n74.\tHowever, there is the danger that this development will have a polarizing and antagonizing effect on international economic relations in the sense that consumer countries may be forced to embark on alternative sources of raw materials and self sufficiency. I wish to sound a note of warning with regard to these polarizing tendencies. Any nationalistic raw materials policy, if carried to the extreme, risks being self defeating. The alternative then is obvious: cooperation on the basis of economic interdependence, as called for in the Declaration and the Program of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth special session.\n75.\tThe resolution adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly gave expression to these fundamental changes in economic relations and in development cooperation. While the phenomenon of physical shortages was new to the rich countries, we should remind ourselves that a scarcity of resources has always been a normal situation in the poor countries. New border lines have been drawn in the international community. Countries with a structural balance of payments deficit today are found among the poor as well as among the rich. Countries suffering from shortages of commodities today are to be found in both categories. This new reality demands new policies and agreements for commodity markets. It also demands a reorientation of the future economic growth of the rich countries, whose growth will have to be selective in the sense that they cannot continue to use ever increasing quantities of raw materials supplies, both in an absolute sense and as a percentage of global availabilities. Thus, the future requires strategies for development not only for the poor countries but also for the rich strategies aimed at a global policy of interdependence.\n76.\tA new, worldwide recession would be a disaster, in particular for many developing countries. Regardless of other urgent measures by developing and developed countries, has the time not come for producers and consumers of essential raw materials to meet under United Nations auspices in a common effort to give effect to the notion of interdependence in order to help forestall such a recession? The present situation offers sufficient scope for progress towards a larger degree of justice in international economic relations.\n77.\tIn the search for development strategies we have so far been concentrating most of our attention on medium and longterm development. But the immediate needs of developing countries, the pressing problems of mass poverty, unemployment, undernourishment and lack of housing have often been neglected. Many developing countries are so hard pressed by the emergencies of today that they can hardly give sufficient attention to the problems of tomorrow. The Netherlands Government is convinced of the need for a new development dimension; a strategy and a program are required to meet the immediate needs of developing countries, including those resulting from natural disasters. The United Nations machinery in this respect must be strengthened. The assistance, to be worked out internationally, should be additional to existing aid programs for longterm plans and projects. The Netherlands Government in its budget for 1975 has allocated $100 million for assistance to meet the immediate needs of developing countries.\n78.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly has adopted a Special Program to assist the countries most seriously affected by rising energy and commodity prices. The Netherlands Government, in view of the appeal made by the Secretary General, has decided to make available during the budgetary year 1974 an amount of $30 million for assistance to these countries. A substantial part of these funds will be channeled through the Secretary General's special account; another part through the European Economic Community or bilaterally.\n79.\tNext year, the Netherlands intends to do more; it is prepared to contribute to the Special Fund established by resolution 3202 (SVI). Our contribution will be made in the context of my Government's new four year program for development cooperation, which has recently been submitted to Parliament. This program aims at a target for official development assistance of approximately 0.8 per cent of the gross national product by 1976.\n80.\tSince peace and freedom cannot survive without justice and economic and social development, all means to redistribute wealth and economic power will have to be considered. It appears to me that the balance of wealth and power between rich and poor countries may be decisively influenced by the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the sea which so far have remained untapped. In the introduction to his report on the work 4 of the Organization, the SecretaryGeneral rightly 'calls attention to the tremendous importance of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea [AI960llAdd.l, sect. XII]. The Netherlands Government adheres to the concept that the seabed and its resources outside national jurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind. Effective exploitation of the resources of the sea for the benefit of the developing world could lead to a decisive change in the existing structure of inequality in wealth and prosperity. The Netherlands, therefore, advocates the adoption of a new legal system that would safeguard this common heritage, emphasizing the duties which the use of the sea entails for all States. This requires effective arrangements and machinery for international legislation, administration, supervision and international jurisdiction. In Caracas excessive emphasis was placed, in my view, on questions of national jurisdiction, to the neglect of vital issues of international control and common interest, and I wonder whether developing countries are sufficiently aware of the enormous benefits that they can reap from international exploitation of the resources of the sea.\n81.\tI have spoken of some vital problems with which this session of the General Assembly will be confronted: problems of war and peace, problems of instability and equality,  problems of human misery and of the denial of fundamental rights. But I have also pointed to progress, new forms of cooperation and, in some areas, to breakthrough and new departures. The world, and with it the United Nations, is in motion and is moving faster than some may wish or expect.\n82.\tIn this perspective, the Netherlands Government attaches great importance to the special session of the General Assembly to be convened in September next year. That session represents a unique opportunity to come to grips with many of the problems that beset the world today. As one of the elements in this process, the outcome of the World Population Conference in Bucharest has provided a promising first step. The Kingdom of the Netherlands looks forward to the World Food Conference. More than ever before, the urgency of the world food problem calls for imaginative proposals and concrete action.\n83.\tIn the coming months, other international conferences and negotiations, such as the Second General Conference of UNIDO, the review and appraisal of progress in the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, the discussions on international monetary reform and the multilateral trade negotiations, will take place. All these activities, in which nongovernmental organizations can play an important role, should converge in a decisive effort for reaching agreement on the foundations for a new economic order at the next special session of the General Assembly.\n84.\tThe cynics and self professed realists who tell us that strategies, declarations and action programs are nothing but words which can lead only to frustration and damage the prestige of the United Nations, should remember that the great ideals of mankind, in history and today, were drafted in words which, once conceived, were able to move men to action. A determined effort to carry out by intensified international cooperation what has already been agreed upon in the Strategy and in other instruments can overcome the triple danger of fatalism, cynicism and nationalism, so clearly confronting mankind. If the right choices are made, the thin margin between order and chaos, sufficiency and want, peace and annihilation, described to us by the SecretaryGeneral, can make way for a system of peace, justice, freedom and development. The United Nations offers such a system in the unique collection of instruments for international negotiation and cooperation. Let us use those instruments. Let us devote more time to consultation and negotiation in the United Nations. We have it in our power to guarantee that future generations will not criticize our era as one in which a maximum of opportunities to better the lot of mankind was wasted by a minimum of goodwill and cooperation. Let us seize those opportunities.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me the privilege of associating my delegation with the hearty congratulations already expressed by many delegations on your election to the high and esteemed office of the presidency of the twenty ninth session of the General Assembly. As you are a distinguished son of Africa, your election is a tribute not only to your revolutionary country, Algeria, and to you personally but also to Africa as a whole. With your renowned statesmanship, there is no doubt that you will carry out your heavy responsibilities to the satisfaction of this Assembly.\n2.\tI should like, by the same token, to hail the creative efforts and considerable results achieved by the General Assembly at its last session under the leadership of the outgoing President from Ecuador. I wish also to pay a tribute to the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Waldheim, for the dynamism with which he has been executing his duties since his appointment as SecretaryGeneral.\n3.\tI do not wish to take up the time of the Assembly by repeating themes which previous speakers have so ably expounded. I will only speak about matters relevant to this Assembly which have direct bearing on Uganda, and to which this world body should react with action rather than flowery oratory.\n4.\tMy delegation views with guarded delight the new developments in Portugal. The new Portuguese Government has recognized the futility of trying to hold down peoples in areas many times the size of Portugal. Portugal's announcement of its intention to give freedom to its African colonies, after a wasteful and negative war lasting over a decade, heralds the day, not far from now, when we shall be engaged in this forum in a friendly dialogue geared towards the economic development of the\nAfrican and Portuguese peoples. We in Uganda, and indeed all the members of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], are satisfied that the material and moral support we have consistently been giving to the African liberation movements has paid dividends. We therefore welcome the admission of the sister State of GuineaBissau to this Assembly.\n5.\tThe presence of the representative of the heroic people of GuineaBissau among us is clear testimony to the success of the liberation struggle in Africa. We shall, both as a nation and as a continent, continue resolutely to support that struggle until all peoples under Portuguese domination are free.\n6.\tMy delegation noted with cautious optimism the speech delivered before this Assembly by the Foreign Minister of Portugal [2239th meeting] in regard to his country's determination to grant independence to the peoples of Mozambique, Angola and the Cape Verde Islands. My delegation believes that the independence of these Territories is long overdue. While we join all progressive countries in welcoming the intention of Portugal to grant independence to its Territories, the Uganda Government's stand remains clear and Arm: that is, that independence for Angola, Cape Verde and the Sao Tome islands should be granted immediately. We are strongly opposed to any program that stipulates any delay in granting immediate independence. We are consequently opposed to the Portuguese program of delaying the independence of Mozambique for a year.\n7.\tIn calling for immediate and unconditional independence for the peoples of Mozambique, Angola and Cape Verde, my delegation is fully aware of the progressive and well intentioned forces in Portugal. But, at the same time, we know of the existence of vicious and reactionary forces in Portugal and its Territories that are determined to frustrate the decolonization process, as exposed by recent events in Mozambique. We thus emphatically reject any program except one of immediate independence for our brothers and sisters in the Portuguese Territories.\n8.\tWe feel confident that the lesson Portugal has learned over the last 13 years should sound a clear warning to the racialist minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia. Clearly, the wave of freedom is steadily and inevitably heading southwards towards Cape Town. But we are not so naive as to assume that the path will be an easy one. The odds are many and formidable. In southern Africa we see a paradoxical triangle of Zionism, racism and economic exploitation. There are many evil forces that feel that apartheid is the sole protector of their economic interests in southern Africa. Because of economic considerations, the Americans have allowed\ntheir allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in connivance with Zionist interests, to perpetuate the racist regimes of southern Africa.\n9.\tThe stand of my Government in regard to the chronic and shameful situation in southern Africa and Zimbabwe is and will always remain that there is no other way, nor is there any other method, than military intervention. I do not need to emphasize the real dangers to international security that are inherent in the situations prevailing in both South Africa and Zimbabwe. We further believe, indeed we are convinced, that the adamant attitude of the Pretoria regime in not heeding international appeals, and its flagrant breach of the Charter of the United Nations call for stern measures; and to us this should mean the expulsion of racist South Africa from this Organization. The world has been patient enough, and it will remain a great betrayal of the principles of the Charter and indeed a sad commentary on our generation if we continue to nurse and accommodate the representatives of a racist and inhuman regime. We must live up to the noble and sacred duty of defending the principles that are clearly enshrined in the Charter of this Organization. We must therefore not be deceived by diverted from our own obligations.\n10.\tUganda views with great concern the underhanded manoeuvres and machinations to which these inhuman forces have resorted in an attempt to divert world attention from their direct involvement in perpetuating apartheid. Soon after the new Government of Portugal announced it would consider giving freedom to its African Territories, a vicious and slanderous campaign was unleashed against my country in a desperate attempt by the agents of imperialism, Zionism, fascism and racialism to divert world attention from the frightening racial situation in southern Africa by trying to brand a black African State as racist. Those evil forces, led by the British and Israelis after Uganda has expelled their nationals who were exploiting the economy of Uganda, and after Uganda had nationalized their assets in the interest of the development of its own citizens, lost no time in financing a vicious campaign against Uganda. They gave graft to a few individuals in the International Commission of Jurists to produce haphazardly a report whose sole aim was to paint Uganda as a racist country so that the world community would exonerate the racist regimes of southern Africa from blame.\n11.\tI wish to observe that Uganda is committed to freedom and human rights in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. In Uganda today there exists freedom of the press: that is to say, there are also privately owned news media. There is also freedom of religion: the religious conflicts that were rampant throughout the colonial period and that were carried forward by the previous regime right up to 1971 have now been settled and there is no religious discrimination whatsoever in the State machinery. As a matter of fact, the Government has given financial and material support to all religious groups, Christian and Moslem alike. There is also freedom of association, and equality before the law; our judiciary system is functioning properly.\n12. Nationalization of property is subject to compensation, as guaranteed by the Uganda Constitution.\n13! There is no discrimination based on sex. I am glad to announce here that in Uganda women are fully emancipated and share the same responsibilities as their male counterparts in all fields of activity. They are now busy preparing for the celebration of the International Women's Year.\n14.\tBut for the freedoms I have just enumerated to be meaningful and practicable there must exist State machinery capable of guaranteeing law and order and punishing their infringement, since the absence of such machinery could only breed anarchy and the lack of such freedoms. Uganda has reached a stage of anarchy immediately before 1971. At that time there existed sections of the Uganda community which had been armed by the State machinery then existing for the purpose of committing depredations on the population. It was .this that led to the military takeover of the administration of the country in 1971, in order to restore freedom and human rights in Uganda.\n15.\tIt is clear, therefore, that the imperialists financed' the British and other mass media to carry false and concocted stories about Uganda in order to cover up their own atrocious crimes, such as the wEioiesale destruction of the,VietNamese people, the indiscriminate slaughter of the innocent people of Northern. Ireland and the Zionist pogrom unleashed against the Palestinian people. Why has the International Commission of Jurists, for example, not produced studies on Northern Ireland? If the Commission wishes any credence to be given to its work it should seriously do something about the image it has so far given of itself, namely that of a bunch of graftcollectors in the employment of imperialists, Zionists and racialists. We hope the world community will not be taken in by this obvious debauchery on the part of the imperialists and their own agents.\n16.\tThe occasion of the vendetta against Uganda is not the first time that British imperialism has connived with Zionism to bring misery to a given group of people. Indeed, the Middle East problem would never have arisen if a similar vendetta had not been pursued by Britain and world Zionism to frustrate the just aspirations of the Arab nations. The problem was originally created by the British and the Zionists when they drove the Palestinians out of their homes and lands and created the State of Israel. Since then, the expansionist forces of Zionism have systematically killed and destroyed the * legitimate owners of Palestine. Uganda is very much concerned about this state Of affairs, considering that, before the Zionists took Palestine, the British had made them the alternative offer of Uganda. Therefore, Uganda is fully committed to supporting the aspirations of the Palestinian people because we realize that if the Zionists had selected Uganda it would have been the people of Uganda suffering the Zionist pogrom.\n17.\tIf is Uganda's policy to support all just causes wherever they may be. We have condemned and will continue to condemn Israel for its continued occupation of Arab land. In 1972 Uganda was the first African country to sever relations with Israel, thereby spearheading the move which successfully isolated the Zionist State from recognition by African countries.\n18.\tAs I mentioned earlier, Uganda supports all just causes in the world. That is why we have given unstinted support to the black people in America and elsewhere in their struggle for equality and human dignity. Unfortunately they still live in a situation amounting to slavery in their own countries. It is high time that black people were recognized as equal beings entitled to equal and dignified treatment. The myth that they are not equal has long been exploded by the fact that African countries have been able to run their own affairs. It is ironical that when the Western Powers come to Africa they treat Africans with respect. The question that Uganda would like to pose is, \\\"Why do they not extend this same, respect to the black people in their own countries?\\\" If the Western countries wish to give credibility to their professed concern for human rights they ought to pay serious attention to this problem with a view to rectifying the situation.\n19.\tOn economic issues, Uganda is confident that in spite of the difficulties and obstacles which beset the sixth special session of the General Assembly the session achieved the purpose for which it was called: namely, to lay the foundation or basis for a new (economic relationship between the developed and the developing countries. The recent energy crisis has made the whole world aware that the economic foundations of the socalled developed nations are not as solid as we have been led for many decades to believe. Uganda subscribes to the principles of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (SVI)]. We believe in the right of every country to exercise permanent sovereignty over its natural resources and all economic activities. We believe in the right of every country to exercise effective control over its resources and their exploitation by means appropriate to its own situation, including the right of nationalization or transfer of ownership to its own nationals.\n20.\tIt was in keeping with these principles, which are universally recognized, that Uganda's economic war was declared by President Idi Amin Dada. The aim of this war was to transfer the economy of Uganda to its rightful owners, the Ugandans. For many years, even after independence, more than 80 per cent of Uganda's economy was being managed, controlled and owned by foreigners, mainly from Britain, who did net have the interest of ?he country at heart. The rationale of the step taken by the President of Uganda was to ensure that the volume and pattern of economic activities in Uganda were determined by Ugandans. The fulfillment of this required that the bulk of productive activities be generated, managed and owned by Ugandans. This objective is thus an expression of faith in the doctrine of economic independence and selfreliance. Since he came to power, the Ugandan leader has devoted most of his economic efforts to giving practical effect to this doctrine. However, my Government does not consider economic selfreliance to imply complete isolation. Thus, foreign .enterprise, foreign' financial assistance and foreign personnel are always welcome to supplement Uganda's own resources for the development of key sectors of the economy. Also, the expansion of Uganda's trade with foreign countries remains a cardinal element in. the Government's development strategy.\n21.\tUganda was therefore startled that, when we nationalized British and Israeli assets for the benefit of our own nationals, those two countries, motivated by greed, started a smear , campaign against Uganda to the extent of persuading their imperialist allies to cease commercial transactions with it. Uganda is at the present time a victim of the belief, translated into practice, of certain countries that aid is an extension of foreign policy which must be utilized to wield undue influence. For the same reason, because of the legitimate steps we took to hand over the economy of Uganda to the indigenous Ugandans, certain countries have tried, and managed, to influence the blocking of aid to Uganda by such international financial institutions as the World Bank and IMF. We are contributors to these institutions and therefore have a right, like any member; to receive aid from them. To confuse bilateral differences between nations with international obligations and rights is a definite and familiar attempt to apply the bigstick policy to the small and weak nations.\n22.\tIt is a wellknown fact that these institutions are supposed to grant aid to all Member States without discrimination or bias, and they should therefore adhere to these principles. Unfortunately, experience has shown that the setup of these institutions is susceptible to the influence of the big developed countries, which tend to use them to put pressure on the weak developing countries. My delegation would like to see an urgent reform in these institutions to rectify this anomalous situation which has hitherto been detrimental to the interests of the small developing nations. We reject this \\\"Big Brother\\\" blackmail policy in aiding developing countries. It is a policy of economic strangulation.\n23.\tAs if that was not enough, the International Commission of Jurists, at the instigation of some imperialist countries, deposited a socalled study with the Commission on Human Rights, alleging, among other things, that, the transfer of the economic life of the country from foreign exploiters to the nationals of our country was a gross violation of human rights. The right of nationalization by a State, in the interest of its economy, of assets owned by foreigners is inherent in its sovereignty. That is a universally accepted principle. Uganda is neither the first, nor will it be the last, country to nationalize foreign assets. The British imperialists who instigated the accusation and had it placed before the Commission Human Rights are the very people who, barely a fortnight ago, were quietly sitting at a table in Kampala with the Uganda .Government to work out compensation arrangements for the assets nationalized. The imperialists certainly do have some original approaches to the practice of double standards. I wish again to reiterate that it is our first policy to pay compensation where nationalization of property has occurred. It is in keeping with that principle that the Uganda Government has set up a highpowered committee to appraise the assets left behind by those affected by the economic war.\nThat is a practical demonstration of the seriousness of our intentions.\n24.\tWhile on the economic question, I wish to stress that Uganda as a landlocked developing State keenly participated in the deliberations and outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. We shall continue to work for the equitable sharing of both the living and nonliving resources ofthe sea because we believe in the concept that the sea is the common heritage of all mankind.\n25.\tOn historical analysis, it is established that most of the ills of this world, and particularly of Africa, are the direct result of actions of the big imperialist and colonialist Powers that for centuries have convinced themselves that they have the divine right to interfere in any manner and at any time in the affairs of smaller and meek States on our continent. All the problems I have enumerated are the direct result of colonial and imperialistic policies of ensuring that the whole world shall be organized according to their whims and fancies. It is because the imperialist Powers regard small nations as pawns in their chess game that we have situations like the tragic case in Cyprus and the continued division of Korea and Viet Nam.\n26.\tThe main purpose of superPowers being permanent members of the Security Council is to see that there is peace in the world and to ensure that, wherever tension exists, there are peaceful ways of easing it. Uganda finds it deplorable that the United States of America, a superPower and a permanent member of the Security Council, has always been directly involved in the creation and perpetuation of world tension through unwarranted interference in the affairs of other countries. We are all aware of the problem of Viet Nam, where we witnessed the destruction of innocent lives by the massive bombings of the American B52, bombings unparalleled in human history. In Korea, Cambodia and in the whole region of SouthEast Asia, we see America unceasingly interfering in the affairs of these countries with a view to creating pliable States. In South Africa, the United States, through its investment, is propping up a regime that is suppressing the overwhelming majority simply because of the color of its skin. The people in these countries are peaceloving and have a right to determine their own destiny. Our appeal to the United States is that American influence and wealth should be used for peaceful purposes and should help to. raise the standards of living of the people in these areas rather than bring them untold misery. We have noted with satisfaction the declared intention of President Ford to pursue this line. Our hopes are that these peaceful intentions will be translated into deeds and not remain mere declarations.\n27.\tThe main purpose of the interference in the internal affairs of our countries by the imperialists is to create and maintain spheres of influence. Uganda, as is well known, used to belong to the British sphere of influence. That is no longer the case and I wish to inform the Assembly that Uganda is ready to cooperate with all countries, irrespective of their ideology or size, on the basis of equality.\n28.\tI now come to consider the question of disarmament because it has a direct relevance to the foregoing issues I have raised. Uganda is happy to note the growing interest among Member States in the attempt not only to curb potential arsenals but also to limit or destroy the existing ones. Many representatives who have spoken before me have treated this question fairly comprehensively. I will, therefore, only make Uganda's stand on the question unequivocally clear. We neither support the proliferation of nuclear weapons nor wish to see the big Powers alone monopolizing nuclear weapons, We believe that disarmament should involve first and foremost the destruction of existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons.\n29.\tWe fear that if the big Powers are left to monopolize the nuclear club, the former colonial Powers will have the instruments to return and colonize us. The imperialist Powers built up their economies by exploiting the natural resources and cheap labor of the colonies. Even during post-independence days, the same colonial Powers continued exploiting developing countries by imposing their own conditions on trade. Now that the third world has, after the energy crisis, awakened to the fact that the so-called developed nations are vulnerable economically and that a new international economic order is inevitable, Uganda foresees the danger of leaving nuclear weapons in the hands of the imperialist countries. These Powers may one day use economic reasons as the excuse to threaten nuclear war in order to force developing nations into compromising their economic independence. Disarmament therefore becomes a crucial issue so far as developing countries are concerned.\n30.\tMy delegation feels that, even if present stockpiles of nuclear weapons are destroyed, technological knowledge should not be monopolized by the superPowers only. If the developing countries are ever to bridge the economic gap between them and the developed countries, then it is necessary that they have access to nuclear technology in order to use it for peaceful and developmental purposes.\n31.\tI now wish to stress the role of the United Nations and its agencies in giving correct information, especially in regard to the developing countries. We feel that some of the problems we constantly debate here would have been avoided if it had not been for the deliberate distortion of information by the imperialist press aimed at checking the development of third world countries. The imperialist press has nothing good to say about the third world countries, and yet it was the colonialists who left us most of these problems; by deliberate design.\n32.\tIt is indeed a strange phenomenon that the imperialists do not want to deal with straightforward, honest, and down to earth leaders of the third world who truly represent their peoples. This explains the imperialist attack on the Ugandan leader. When the imperialists handed over power at independence, they made sure they handed it to very carefully selected puppets of their own choosing so that they would continue, through corruption, confusion and other means, to plunder the resources of those countries. It is not a coincidence that in the majority of casQs, when the masses cannot endure the situation \nany more, military coups have taken place to save such countries from total collapse. It was in this situation that the soldiers of Uganda who, together with the masses, had suffered under corrupt politicians, took a decision to lay a sound foundation for the economic progress of our country. Now, instead of praising the efforts of honest military leaders like the President of Uganda to put the interests of his people above the interests of foreigners, the imperialist press began waging a smear campaign against such leaders.\n33.\tWe would like to appeal to the developed nations, particularly the former colonial Powers who come to this forum and use lofty words like \\\"social justice\\\" and \\\"world order\\\", to come out seriously and help those honest leaders of the third world to build a better life for their peoples rather than wait for some corrupt political leaders to emerge so that they can resume their plundering.\n34.\tThe imperialist mass media seem preoccupied with distorting the correct image of the developing nations so as to dissuade other nations with good will from coming to the aid of such countries. The imperialists forget that at their own invitation they came and imposed their own foreign civilization on us, deprived us of our culture, uprooted our society through corruption and loose morals, and imposed their own languages on us, thus bringing us the complex problems that we face today. The imperialists came and destroyed our own traditional qualities of self-reliance, selflessness, cooperation and moral justice, and instead taught us materialism, selfishness and corruption.\n35.\tBut in outlining the desire for Uganda to be self-reliant economically, I do not wish to give the impression that Uganda is pursuing a policy of isolationism, as this is a very narrow anachronistic doctrine. We pursue a policy of cooperation with all peace-loving and well-intentioned people of the world including citizens of this great country, the United States of America, which is playing host to the entire world. We invite them to come and visit Uganda to receive the traditional warmth and welcome of the people of Uganda.\n36.\tBut I would be failing in my duty if I did not remind those who are so preoccupied with distorting the image of Uganda that they choose to close their eyes and forget the innumerable practical steps that the President of Uganda has personally undertaken towards the realization of world peace. Uganda's enemies do not wish the world to hear that President Amin was solely responsible for the fundamental transformation of AfroArab relations on the African continent, and yet the alliance between the African and Arab peoples has contributed much to the lessening of tension in the African and Middle East region. They ignore the Ugandan leader's personal efforts to mediate in person to ease tension between third-world countries like Iraq and Iran, Pakistan and Bangladesh and India, Somalia and Ethiopia, Guinea, Senegal and the Ivory Coast, and North and South Korea, to mention only a few. He has also championed the rights of such groups as the blacks in America, the Irish in Northern Ireland and the Palestinians in the Middle East. Unlike some other leaders, the Ugandan leader does not believe merely in paying lip service to world peace but in making practical contributions to it.\n37.\tI conclude by stating that Uganda and others peace loving nations of the world will work towards making this Organization a truly international community, where the experiences, cultures, and contributions of the various communities represented here are mixed and balanced. We in Africa feel that for our contributions to make an impact we must be ourselves that is, truly African. The mission and challenge to us, therefore, is not to opt out of our responsibility to battle with the affairs of our countries as our enemies would have us do, just because of the immensity and complexity of our problems, but to contribute whatever we are capable of .contributing. After all, problems will continue to exist and even multiply so long as this world is not Utopia. I can do no better than end with a quotation from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar:\n\\\"There is a tide in the affairs of men,\nWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life\nIs bound in shallows and in miseries.\nOn such a full sea are we now afloat;\nAnd we must take the current when it serves,\nOr lose our ventures.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to congratulate you on behalf of the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic upon your election to the high post of President of the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly. In this connexion, I should like to point out that the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria are linked by ties of friendship and struggle for progress and the freedom of peoples. We look upon the election of the representative of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria as a further recognition of the important role played in the United Nations by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\n69.\tWe sincerely welcome to our midst the new Members of our Organization, the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and Grenada. Their admission to the United Nations proves that the present international political transition from tension towards detente creates conditions for the successful advancement of the national liberation movement, for the realization of the aspirations of peoples to a free and independent life.\n70.\tThe twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly is meeting on the eve of the thirtieth anniversary of the victory over fascism in the Second World War which has brought, thanks to the victory of the Soviet Army, freedom to our people, too, following the period of six years of Nazi occupation. This year Czechoslovakia has recently celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the Slovak national uprising, which represented not only a significant event of resistance against the Nazi occupants, but also one of the important popular military actions in Europe. Next year we shall celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the liberation of our State which, as one of the founding Members of the United Nations, has always endeavoured to prevent the repetition of the horrors of war.\n71.\tToday we can already state with satisfaction that in the qualitatively new era of the 1970s the prospects for strengthening and maintaining peace are more promising than ever before. This is a remarkable positive phenomenon in a history filled with almost never-ending wars. It is therefore our duty to deepen the process of international detente, to make it spread to other areas of our planet -in short, to spare no effort in order to ensure that mankind may enhance its spiritual and material values in peace and in constructive international co-operation. This too should become a guiding principle in the activities of the United Nations and at the current session.\n72.\tThe axis of international development should not lie in tensions which threaten at every moment to grow into dangerous confrontations, in the feverish anus race accompanied by a senseless waste of material values or in the exploitation of other peoples, but, on the contrary, in detente, disarmament and development.\n73.\tThanks to the efforts cf peace-loving forces and thanks to their growing unity against the forces of aggression, there exist nowadays the necessary prerequisites for the implementation of the aims and objectives expressed in the three aforementioned concepts.\n74.\tThe changing balance of forces in the world, the growing might of the Soviet Union and of other countries of the socialist community, the strengthening of the political independence and economic self- reliance of the developing countries, the dynamism of progressive and democratic forces as well as the realistic approach on the part of a number of statesmen and political circles in the capitalist countries in their assessment of the international situation -all this has rendered the policy of the cold war absurd. The danger of an armed conflict between the States of the capitalist and socialist systems has been reduced. Conditions have been created for a further lessening of tensions, for a consistent implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence among States with differing social systems.\n75.\tThe twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly is meeting precisely when detente is the predominant feature in the development of international relations. The settlement of conflicts is in principle moving to the political sphere. At the same time, however, certain recent events indicate that efforts are being made to obstruct this process.\n76.\tThe policy of detente is most in evidence in Europe, where substantial changes have made it possible for European countries to begin an era of constructive co-operation. A particular role has been played in this area by the normalization of relations between the socialist countries and the Federal Republic of Germany as embodied in the respective bilateral treaties. Relations between the countries of the socialist community and other Western European countries are also developing. In these circumstances, it seems only logical and completely realistic that the Governments of the European States be required to elaborate the principles which should guide their mutual relations.\n77.\tThis is the purport of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Conference has already achieved many positive results. Nevertheless, it is our belief that its course might have been easier had it not been for certain impediments, such as, for instance, attempts to delay the conclusion of the Conference and the casting of doubts as to the level at which its final act would be concluded. Every effort should now be made to promptly achieve the historic objectives of the Conference. It is our belief that the negotiations in Geneva will be concluded successfully in the near future through the joint efforts of all participants.\n78.\tA system ensuring security and constructive co-operation among European nations will benefit not only the European continent but also other regions of the world. At the same time, it will set a good precedent which may indicate a suitable course in other areas. I am referring, for instance, to the efforts to build a system of collective security in Asia.\n79.\tNegotiations and decisions agreed on in the multilateral sphere are more the only path we are following towards international detente. The basis for a multilateral normalization of international relations lies in good bilateral relations among States. There is no doubt that this is particularly true of negotiations of such importance as those between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America. It is our Arm belief that the fruitful results these negotiations have yielded in the political, military, economic and other fields and their implementation will contribute substantially to making the process of detente the common denominator of foreign affairs throughout our planet.\n80.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic unremittingly supports peaceful developments in the world. This is in the very nature of its socialist ideology and of the program of peace which it is trying to carry out, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, in international relations. Therefore we have striven and shall continue to strive to develop equal and mutually beneficial relations with every country interested in such relations. We have been trying and shall continue to try to overcome obstacles to the development of such relations.\n81.\tIn this context, note should be taken of the importance of the Treaty on mutual relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, which came into force on 19 July 1974. We look upon if as a victory of reason and realism. The Treaty marks the end of a difficult past and paves the way towards the development of equal and mutually beneficial co-operation. In the effort to make our whole frontier a boundary between good neighbors we have also taken steps to remove obstacles to the development of normal relations with Austria.\n82.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has recently conducted a series of useful talks with other Western countries as well. It has continued to develop its traditionally friendly relations with non-aligned and developing countries. It has established diplomatic relations with a number of States and has signed numerous bilateral agreements in economic, cultural, consular and other fields. We are also endeavoring to achieve such normalization of relations with the United States of America, which would be in accordance with the policy of international detente and would promote the development of mutually beneficial relations between the two countries. We hope that these efforts will meet with a positive response from our partners.\n83.\tWe are also aware, of course, of the fact that the encouraging international trend towards the strengthening of peace is not an automatic phenomenon. The surface of the international situation continues to be troubled by events that contrast with the policy of detente and are contrary to the requirement that disputes between States should be dealt with exclusively by negotiation. These events have a negative effect on the international political atmosphere.\n84.\tLast year we welcomed with satisfaction the Paris agreements as fundamental prerequisites for ensuring peace in South-East Asia. Nevertheless, a normalization of the situation in Indo-China has not yet been fully achieved. We therefore support the position taken by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam requesting strict adherence to all the provisions of the Paris agreements and the consistent implementation of the decisions adopted by the International Conference on Viet Nam in March 1973. We condemn the activities of the Saigon administration, which erects obstacles to the creation of an atmosphere of national reconciliation in South Viet Nam. We consider ;hat a realistic way out of the present situation is the plan of 22 March 1974 of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam. Czechoslovakia, together with all other forces of peace and progress throughout the world, will continue in the future also to support not only the efforts of the VietNamese people but those of all other peoples of IndoChina aimed at satisfying their legitimate aspirations.\n85.\tThe attention of world public opinion has been focused for many years on the Middle East, where international security has been threatened by long- lasting tensions and war operations. The roots of the explosive situation have not yet been eradicated. The main cause of the grave situation persisting in the Middle East lies in the aggressive policy of Israel. Israel must withdraw its troops from the Arab territories it has occupied and must stop flouting the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine.\n86.\tThe Czechoslovak delegation supported the initiative taken by the Arab States, Members of the United Nations, in proposing the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of the question of Palestine as a separate item. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic deems it necessary to put in motion all political means that might achieve a Middle Eastern settlement in the spirit of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council. It is particularly essential to resume as soon as possible the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of all directly concerned parties, including the representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] acting as participants with equal rights. The Conference must focus its attention on a concrete solution to the basic problems of the Middle East.\n87.\tA new focal point of tension has recently appeared in the eastern Mediterranean. For certain circles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO], which are attempting to liquidate the independent State of Cyprus, a sovereign Member of the United Nations, and turn the island into a NATO base, the policy of non-alignment was a real thorn in the flesh.\n88.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has always supported the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and has opposed attempts to divide and annex it. The Government of Czechoslovakia remains convinced that an end must be put to outside interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus and that it is essential to implement scrupulously the provisions of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council, particularly resolution 353 (1974) of 20 July 1974, to withdraw ail foreign troops and military personnel from Cyprus, and to leave to the people of Cyprus and its legitimate Government the right to decide freely on the destiny of the country. Those are the aims pursued by the proposal of the Government of the Soviet Union, of 22 August 1974,' for the convening of an international conference on Cyprus within the framework of the United Nations. The Government of Czechoslovakia fully supports the above proposal.\n89.\tIt is also necessary to strengthen peace and ensure healthy international development in a number of other regions of the world. One of them is the Korean peninsula. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, aware of the importance of the reunification of Korea for-peace and security in Asia, strongly endorses the policy pursued by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the aim of which is the peaceful democratic unification of the country without outside interference. The decision taken at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to dissolve the unlawful so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea was welcomed in Czechoslovakia. The General Assembly, at its twenty-ninth session, must take a further step toward the removal of this anomalous situation which has kept our Organization involved in a policy inherited from the cold war, and it must bring about the withdrawal from South Korea of all foreign troops still unjustifiably stationed there under the United Nations flag.\n90.\tIt is indeed outrageous that in today's world the peoples of certain territories should still have to suffer from colonial and racist oppression. The United Nations must press ever harder for a complete and uncompromising implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. The recent achievements of the national liberation movement have, posed anew the question of further organized efforts by the United Nations towards a full elimination of the remnants of the system of colonialism in the world in the immediate future.\n91.\tWe welcomed the fact that the new provisional Government of Portugal, supported by the whole of Portuguese democratic public opinion, has dissociated itself from the reactionary position taken by the previous regime, and has decided to recognize the independence of Guinea-Bissau and concluded an agreement with the representatives of the national liberation movement of Mozambique on the granting of independence to that country. We should like to express our deep conviction that the people of Angola, as well as the peoples of other territories under Portuguese administration, will also attain complete independence in the near future.\n92.\tSurely it is high time now to put an end to colonialism, racism and apartheid in the whole of southern Africa. The peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia also must be able live in freedom, independence and equality.\n93.\tDuring the year that has passed since the Fascist coup in Chile, a world-wide campaign of solidarity with the Chilean people, and a campaign to release Luis Corvalan and other patriots, has been widely reflected in the organs of the United Nations. In the future, too, the United Nations should take further steps against the mass violations of fundamental civil freedoms and human rights by the military junta in Chile.\n94.\tAt a time when the international political barometer raises hope for further detente, the need to stop the frenzied arms race, which is a threat to the whole of mankind, and the need to reach general and complete disarmament are becoming increasingly urgent. Political detente must be supplemented by detente in the military sphere, and the more than $250,000 million spent annually by mankind on armaments must be used for economic progress in order to raise the living and social standards of the people, and in order to strengthen economic co-operation.\n95.\tIn order to attain positive results in the field of military detente, we feel that it is particularly important not to delay the negotiations on practical preparations for, and the convening of, a world disarmament conference, which would make it possible to move forward towards an overall solution of the whole intricate complex of disarmament questions. It is our continued belief that more active use should be made of the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, particularly with regard to the question of a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons, the limiting of underground testing of nuclear weapons, and the conclusion of an agreement on a comprehensive nuclear and thermonuclear test ban.\n96.\tWe have already welcomed the proposal made by the USSR to reduce by 10 per cent the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council and to use a part of the funds  released for providing assistance to developing countries.\n97.\tAt the current session, the Soviet Union has introduced a draft resolution [AIC.IIL.675] to which was annexed a draft convention on the prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well-being and health. This new peaceful initiative has come to occupy an important position in the whole matter of safeguarding mankind against the threat of a devastating war. I am convinced that this proposal will meet with the full support of this session.\n98.\tWe further trust that the results of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to be held in the spring of next year, will contribute decisively to the full implementation of the aforementioned Treaty and compliance with it.\n99.\tWe welcome the efforts made by the participants in the talks on the reduction of forces and armaments in Central Europe and the constructive character of those deliberations. It is our firmly held belief that they will result in generally acceptable measures which would not put any of the parties at an advantage or at a disadvantage and would not threaten the security of any of the countries involved. Czechoslovakia, like other socialist countries, is prepared to provide maximum support for attempts to stop the frenzied arms race.\n100.\tThe present political atmosphere in the world and the further process of detente have created favorable conditions for the promotion of trade and economic contacts among all countries, irrespective of their different social systems.\n101.\tTo bring about a complete normalization of international trade and economic relations, it is, however, necessary for the developed capitalist countries and certain economic groupings to abolish discriminatory practices and to liberalize their trade with ail other countries The agenda of this session of the General Assembly includes important economic and social questions as reflected in the decisions taken by the sixth special session of the General Assembly. These must be decided upon in the spirit of the Charter and in the interests of all countries.\n102.\tThe Czechoslovak delegation attaches particular importance to the consistent implementation of decolonization in international economic relations, for without it we cannot visualize true progress in the interests of the broad popular masses of the individual sovereign States of the so-called third world. In spite of the resistance of various exploitation minded circles, the progressive principles are nevertheless gaining ground in all spheres of international economic life, just as the economic power of the countries of the socialist community.is growing and the political and economic independence of the developing countries is becoming stronger.\n103.\tWe view the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S~VI)] adopted at the recent sixth special session, as well as the future Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States -whose text should be speedily completed and adopted as a universal document- as an important basis for, and contribution to, the all-round development of international economic co-operation. The resolutions adopted at the twenty-ninth session pertaining to the items of the sixth special session must, we feel, reflect the fact that detente and peaceful co-operation are a prerequisite of progress and that disarmament is one of the possible sources of additional resources necessary for peaceful economic development.\n104.\tWe firmly believe that it is necessary to strength-en world peace and security as a basic prerequisite for a further systematic improvement in the world economic situation which would also be to the benefit of economic development and progress in the developing countries.\n105.\tThere is no doubt that the process of international detente and the degree to which the United Nations participates in strenghening it at the same time help to enhance this Organization. The role and significance of the United Nations in today's conditions, against the background of developed collective efforts of countries interested in the building of permanent and lasting peace, is undoubtedly increasing.\n106.\tWe regard the United Nations as an important international forum which is able to make a significant contribution to the strengthening of the present trend towards general detente in international relations so as to implement successfully in them the basic norms of peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems. The present trend towards international detente creates very suitable conditions which are highly propitious for the accomplishment by the United Nations of the tasks assigned to it by the Charter and so that the United Nations can devote itself fully to carrying out the mission formulated in the Charter.\n107.\tWe are convinced that concerted action by all peaceful and progressive forces here also in the United Nations will stop all those who would attempt to reverse the course of history. The delegation of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is prepared to co-operate in this spirit at the present session, in a businesslike and constructive manner, with all delegations truly interested in peace, security and the further promotion of friendly co-operation among peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is a source of pride and gratification for me to express to you my heart felt congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly during the current session, which is. undoubtedly considered one of the most important sessions in the history of the United Nations on account of the vital questions set before it and because of the present critical stage in the history of the relations between countries and peoples. Your election to the presidency is also to be looked upon as a compliment addressed by the United Nations to your country and to its great leader, President Houari Boumediene, who has dedicated himself to the cause of all peace-loving peoples.\n2.\tI should like to pay a tribute to the tremendous effort exerted by your predecessor, our dear friend Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who conducted the deliberations of the previous Assembly session and of the sixth special session with wisdom, foresight and objectivity.\n3.\tI should also like to pay tribute to the work accomplished throughout the whole of last year by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and to his devotion to the objectives and principles of the United Nations.\n4.\tit gives me pleasure to welcome the friendly countries which have joined our Organization. The admission of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations is undoubtedly an incontestable victory for the right of all peoples to decide their own fate and to shoulder their international responsibilities in full and to undertake a positive, constructive role for the building of a better world for all of us.\n5.\tWe look forward to the declaration of the independence of the remaining countries which have been suffering for many centuries from the fetters that have bound them, depriving them of their natural right to participate effectively in decision-making which influences the future of the human race. Here, I refer in particular to the necessity of declaring the independence of Mozambique in conformity with the Lusaka Agreement. The same right has to be acknowledged in respect of the struggling people of Angola.\n6.\tWhile welcoming the spirit which has motivated the Portuguese Government to abandon the old logic of colonialism and to turn a new page in the history of relations with the peoples of countries previously under Portuguese occupation, we express the hope that this trend will continue and will be consolidated in such a way that it will make it possible to achieve concrete and tangible results with respect to all Territories which are still under Portugal's domination. Then can all the African peoples turn a new page in their relations with Portugal, and only then can cooperation replace conflict and strife.\n7.\tIt is indeed deplorable to find that government in South Africa is still based on racial discrimination and on the deprivation of the African peoples, the rightful owners of their territories, of their fundamental rights, in order to serve the interests of an exploiting minority. The racist minorities in Zimbabwe and Namibia are still persisting in the policy of imposing settlers' colonialism and are still following practices designed to change the demographic structure in those regions in order to destroy their heritage and to usurp their wealth.\n8.\tThe first and foremost responsibility which we should face in our deliberations during this session and, indeed, in every session is to scrutinize and look searchingly at our world so that we may know where we stood yesterday, where we stand today and in which direction we are to proceed in the near and distant future. It behooves each of us to envisage the development of the world in the future and to evaluate the events of the past. It is on the basis of this mutual assessment of the past and of the future that we can reach an identical, or at least common, view of inter-national situations, thus enabling each Member State to define for itself the course it can follow, the burdens it can assume and the challenges it can accept within the framework of efforts to achieve common goals.\n9.\tRepresentatives probably know that our concept of the future -be it the result of an individual or a common endeavor- should be governed by rules of legality and morality. The fusion of these two essential elements should be the basis on which we deal with reality and govern our policies, otherwise we would fall prey to day-dreams and, surrendering to illusions, would build our palaces on sand, to be shattered by the winds and transformed into a series of frustrated hopes.\u2003\n10.\tThe tremendous scientific achievements of humanity in recent years have provided us with new criteria which should govern our evaluation of the future in the light of our past and present experience. Suffice it to refer here to the principles and methodology employed by the science of \\\"futurology\\\", so that our vision of the future of international relations may not be based on star-gazing, speculation or guesswork.\n11.\tA quick glance at the world in the past few years reveals that the most important development on the international scene is the emergence of what has been termed \\\"detente\\\". Opinions are divided about detente, for there are Members who view it with optimism as the peace which will save humanity from the scourge of war, violence and hatred, while others deny that it can lead to anything good for human society. Perhaps the non-aligned countries are more entitled than others to have their say about this new element in international relations, since they were the first to call for the reduction of tension and to stress the necessity of lessening the danger of confrontation, which can result in nothing but catastrophe for us all. They were also the first to seek a common ground where all peoples could come together in peace and express their creative faculties in the service of the welfare of all humanity.\n12.\tPerhaps the best attitude to be adopted towards detente is to insist that its application should conform to its theory and that its implementation should be a fulfillment of expectations. Detente should continue and should be consolidated in the interest of all, yet not at the expense of anybody. We do not look upon detente as a matter which concerns the two superPowers more than others; it concerns us all to the same degree since it affects the features of international relations in the present and, to say the least, in the near future. In fact, this doubles the responsibility of the two super-Powers to contribute to the solution of all urgent, burning problems since interdependence prevails in the world of today and it has become impossible for a country or for any group of countries, no matter how strong they may be in the political, economic or military fields, to live detached from the rest of the world. It should by now be impossible for them to imagine that they can act as if they were on an isolated island where they cannot be affected by events in the world at large.\n13.\tIt is imperative, in the light of these conditions, that each of us should have support for the role he plays within the international community. It should also be clear that there is no place on the international scene for those who just watch and observe. All of us must insist on rejecting any system by which a country or a group of countries would have the exclusive authority to take decisions that affect the destinies of peoples, because such a monopoly can only lead to abuse of responsibility. Participation in authority and the sharing of responsibility are both a right and a duty for us all, and this necessitates a full participation of all from the very start in decision-making, so that we do not find ourselves confronted with a fait accompli that has been dictated to us and for which we can find no solution. It is wrong to assume that others would willingly acknowledge our right to positive participation, for such a right is to be practiced and not to be granted. Such a course is made increasingly clear by the continuous experience of every day and is becoming a firmly rooted tradition in international relations.\n14.\tEgypt, being one of the oldest civilizations known in human history, is perfectly willing and prepared to shoulder all its international responsibilities with all the risks and sacrifices that this may entail, and it reaffirms once more its basic and fundamental commitment to the struggle to be waged along with all peace-loving peoples that are aspiring to freedom in various parts of the world.\n15.\tEgypt has established it is foreign policy on the basis and within the framework of humanitarian ideals which recognize no discrimination and no isolationism. Thus the Arab movement is a positive one, in full interaction with all human aspirations and movements; it is a movement which keeps pace with events and does not stand against the tide of history.\n16.\tOur obligation regarding the future of Africa is in essence a human obligation, because it grows out of the fraternal links and organic ties between peoples brought together by civilization, history, aspirations and common interests. We may perhaps all agree that the countries of the African continent have been able within a short period, after having shaken off the evils of colonialism, to set an example in the sense of responsibility, good judgment and foresight. It is obvious to all of us that the achievements of our African peoples throughout the limited years, be they on the regional or international level, are achievements that enrich human experience.\n17.\tIn a broader context, the non-aligned countries, despite obstacles and challenges, have been able to consolidate the gains which they had achieved in the past in the interest of all humanity. They have remained in the vanguard of the forces which are attempting to rationalize international conduct and to base it on criteria that should lessen egoism, domination and dictating of terms. We firmly believe that many of the problems with which we are still living today could have been solved, had the countries of the third world been able to overcome the obstacles put in their way and had they been able to neutralize the elements that benefit from the continuation and aggravation of those problems. We are confident that the non-aligned countries will in the near future play a role of no less importance than that which they have played in the past.\n18.\tIt is within this framework that Egypt conducts its relations with all countries of the world full of confidence and without complex. Consequently, Egypt, while determined not to become a sphere of influence for anybody, is capable of extending its international co-operation in various directions. Egypt honors all its obligations and responsibilities in the same spirit in which it safeguards its rights. In its relations with all peoples of the world Egypt determines its policy in the basic belief that there are no insurmountable problems between Egypt and any other peace-loving people, and that there are no conflicts or contradictions that are impossible to overcome.\n19.\tEgypt, has followed these principles in its relations with the two super-Powers, the pillars of the policy of detente. Bilateral relations with the Soviet Union are founded on friendship and mutual cooperation. We have appreciation for the Soviet people and their leadership in siding with the Egyptian people on their march towards social and economic development and their support of the Arab nation in its legitimate struggle to regain its territories and to repel aggression.\n20.\tAt the same time, Egypt has welcomed the relative change that has taken place in the American attitude as a result of the glorious October war, and viewed it as a step in the right direction which is worthy of response. As a re ult, Egypt has restored the channels of communication between the two countries and has also responded to the American efforts in the field of disengagement on the Egyptian and Syrian fronts. These efforts have resulted in military agreements which help to consolidate the fragile and the dangerous cease-fire that existed before. Despite the fact that the American policy towards the Middle East still leaves much to be desired, we are anxious to give America every opportunity to bring that policy into greater harmony with right, law and principle.\n21.\tAs a parallel to that, we have welcomed the constructive role played by the European countries after they realized the facts of the situation and understood its dimensions. For our part, we look forward to enlarging this role, now and in the future, for the sake of peace, justice and common interests. Undoubtedly, the European community, which has suffered the scourge of wars and destruction, and which throughout its existence has maintained historical, cultural and economic ties with our region, is qualified to contribute a great deal to the establishment of peace and prosperity in the region.\n22.\tEgypt has responded to the readiness of European countries to strengthen our ties of co-operation, and has established close contacts with each and all of them. Egypt has also reacted positively to the desire of the European group to establish a dialog with the Arab countries, so that co-operation between the two groups may reach a level that would ensure the welfare of all their peoples and open new horizons for wider and more extensive international co-operation. While we welcome this Arab-European cooperation, we do not believe that it should be confined to one particular field, because all fields of co-operation and exchange are interlinked and it is difficult to separate them.\n23.\tAs far as we are concerned, the European continent is of strategic importance: in the first place, because the security of the Middle East region is closely linked with the security of Europe and is affected by whatever happens in Europe, and vice versa. Economic and cultural interests are also interlinked in such a way that they have to be molded within a framework of co-operation and interdependence.\n24.\tI agree with the words of my colleague and friend the Foreign Minister of France, Mr. Jean Sauvagnargues, who stated before this Assembly a few days ago:\n\\\"This type of co-operation that we are both trying to establish does set an example and opens\nup a promising outlook. It is a question of working together, with all the participants on an equal footing, towards social and economic progress. The undertaking must not interfere with the interests of any country.\\\" [2238th meeting, para. 154.]\n25.\tAs a parallel to this enlightened peUcy, Egypt has followed a course founded on the open-door economic policy that aims at consolidating co-operation with all peoples that are prepared to deal with us on the basis of equality, interdependence and mutual interest. It is a policy that does not discriminate between countries and peoples; it is also a policy that does not affect to any degree the path of socialist transformation which we have chosen for ourselves as a system to achieve development and to secure the future of every Egyptian citizen. Thinking and moving, as we do, within this framework, we have been sorry to hear from this rostrum and elsewhere, during the past few days, statements which have proved, from various experiences since the end of the Second World War, to be impractical and to lead to nowhere.\n26.\tWe were told that some countries were manipulating basic human needs for the sake of narrow national interests; that the use of some raw materials as a political weapon and the imposition of the oil embargo against certain countries were policies that might eventually lead to confrontation instead of cooperation. It was even claimed that the fragile framework of international economic co-operation would be exposed to danger if the oil-producing countries continued their present pricing policies. We have heard the new thesis that the high cost of oil is not the result of the dynamics of economic factors but of political and selfish decisions that have not taken international interests into consideration.\n27.\tThe advocates of this theory want us to forsake reason and to believe the following: first, that oil is the only raw material the price of which has gone up; secondly, that the rise in oil prices has resulted in a spiraling rise in th? prices of substitute materials and of manufactured goods; thirdly, that the rise in the prices of oil products was not due to economic factors; fourthly, that there is an implicit assumption that the Arab oil-producing countries are the only producers that have raised their oil prices; fifthly, that the industrially advanced countries are the ones that deserve attention and protection, because the rest of the countries of the world depend upon them in meeting their needs for manufactured goods.\n28.\tWe should have expected that everyone had grasped the profound quantitative and qualitative changes witnessed by the world and realized that the peoples that obtained their independence at the cost of many sacrifices cannot permit any encroachment upon their sovereignty, or any return of guardianship over them under a new guise; nor can they be content with only a facade of political independence. \n29.\tThe following established and indisputable facts should be recognized. First, oil prices rose only after the prices of other raw materials and manufactured goods had gone up. Secondly, the industrially developed countries exclusively have controlled international prices through speculation and monopolies, regardless of the requirements of world social and economic development. Thirdly, the Arabs were not the only ones to raise their oil prices but joined with other producers if different parts of the world in so doing. At the same time, it is obvious that the international monetary system established at Bretton Woods in 1944 has not lived up to the world's expectations. Finally, when the Arabs decided to mobilize their oil to serve their struggle for their destiny, they did not manipulate the destinies of other peoples. They feel nothing but love and sympathy for all other peoples, but when they did follow such a course, that was in response to a foolish policy adopted by some statesmen without any consideration for Arab interests and their feeling. They also used their oil only within the limits that would secure their legitimate rights.\n30.\tThe following facts should not escape bur attention. First, the Arab countries did not take any action relating to oil supplies until after they had warned the countries which assist Israel in maintaining the occupation of Arab territories in defiance of the international will and the resolutions of the United Nations. Secondly, the Arab countries lifted the oil embargo immediately after the countries against which it was imposed -and in particular the United States- had changed their attitude and had directed their policy towards contributing to a just and lasting settlement of the problem. Thirdly, some of the statesmen in the developed countries are attempting, before their peoples, to put the blame on the Arabs with respect to inflation, either to evade responsibility for facing the internal situation or to seek the favor of some pressure groups which find it in their interests to launch a campaign against the Arabs.\n31.\tWe would have expected everyone to realize the profound change brought about by the glorious war of October, and the far-reaching effects which that war brought about militarily, politically, economically and psychologically. The proper thing to do was to create the circumstances conducive to a peaceful settlement. In that respect, it would have been preferable to take immediate decisions to stop providing Israel with unlimited shipments of arms. This policy has contributed to heightening Israeli arrogance.\n32.\tIt may perhaps be appropriate to refer here to a voice which was raised in the United States of America, calling for wisdom and rationality. The voice was that of Senator James Abourezk, when he addressed a meeting of the United States-Arab Chamber of Commerce on 25 September 1974. In his speech Senator Abourezk said:\n\\\"It is clearly in the interests of humanity, as well as of the United States, that we stop furnishing warplanes, missiles, napalm, phosphorus bombs and the money used to provide these weapons to Israel, so long as Israel continues its mission of destruction of innocent civilians and of their crops in Southern Lebanon/*\nThe Senator went on:\n\\\"It is clearly in the interest of the United States to bring about a durable peace in the Middle East, rather than the present political stalemate which will once again ignite bloody conflicts in that part of the world.\\\"\n33.\tThe problem of high prices of goods is much more complicated and deep than we think. It is not confined to one commodity to the exclusion of others, and it does not relate to one producing country or a group of countries. It affects the whole world. In the final analysis, this question cannot be tackled on the basis of isolating its political factors from economic considerations or vice versa, for it is a mixture of both.\n34.\tInternational relations are established on the basis of mutual interest and not on dictation, domination and threats. Political decisions should reflect a sense of responsibility and should be based on an exchange of interests. The industrially advanced countries would be under an illusion if they imagined that they could expose the \\\"security of developing nations to danger or that they could continue to manipulate their wealth and expect them to remain idle.\n35.\tAs the Foreign Minister of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mr. Gromyko, has rightly stated before this Assembly a few days ago:\n\\\"The general state of world affairs is being molded by a tremendous number of factors, ranging from political and military to national or even psychological factors. And it therefore hardly lends itself to one-dimensional assessment.\\\" [2240th meeting, para. 125.]\n36.\tThe attempt to distort the reputation of Arab countries and defame them will only lead to widening the gap between the parties concerned and this is bound to delay reaching a balanced solution that can guarantee the common interests of all peoples in all corners of the world. The assumption that developing nations will continue to surrender to injustice, suppression and pressure is a dangerous one and it is of the utmost danger because it can only lead to a series of explosions and armed conflicts and an economic and psychological struggle which can only result, in the long run, in a deterioration of international relations which would engulf us all in the worst of consequences.\n37.\tLet us discuss matters rationally and listen to a sincere voice emanating from a rational source which belongs to the third world. Let us listen to the Foreign Minister of Peru, Mr. de la Flor Valle, when he says:\n\\\"It becomes apparent in the multidimensional struggle of the countries of the third world to create a new international economic order which takes concrete form in the defense and recovery of natural resources;\\\" [2238th meeting, para. 172.]\n38.\tI wish also to quote the Foreign Minister of France, Mr. Jean Sauvagnargues, when he said:\n\\\"In this connexion the right of the third world countries not only to receive a fairer share of the fruits of economic and world progress but also to influence the choices on which this activity depends cannot be contested.\\\" [Ibid., para. 149.]\n39.\tLet us listen also to another rightful piece of testimony coming from the representative of one of the developed industrialized countries. Mr. James Callaghan, the British Foreign Secretary, said the following a few days ago:\n\\\"The unprecedented world-wide economic boom of recent years led to higher commodity prices prior to the recent increases in world oil prices.\\\" [2240th meeting, para. 219.] \n40.\tThis session is worthy of being distinguished from previous sessions. It should not be just a quantitative addition of another pile of papers to the records of the United Nations. There is nothing more worthy of the attention of this session than the Palestinian people. So, let us make this session \\\"the session of the people of Palestine\\\". Let us see to it that history will record that we have directed all our energies and resources towards safeguarding the right of an entire people to maintain their entity, to decide their fate and to continue their creative march together with other peoples working for the establishment of a better world.\n41.\tThe international community has committed an historical error by ignoring this people and denying that they existed after they were uprooted from their homeland. History is witness to the fact that throughout the ages Jews have never enjoyed more magnanimity and brotherhood than that which they enjoyed from the people of the Arab world when they lived with them; Jewish culture has never flourished more than it has under the umbrella of the Arab countries, where there has never been any discrimination, persecution or racism.\n42.\tThe international community persisted in the error by considering the Palestinian people, victims of oppression, as only groups of refugees deserving of nothing but mercy and pity. Authenticity and the history of the Palestinian people have protected them from disintegration and dispersal.\n43.\tDespite the labyrinth in which the Palestinian people have lived in the twentieth century, they are more determined than ever to exist and to face all challenges with rare courage. Today, the Palestinian people stand with dignity, capable of shouldering their international responsibility and participating in the construction of the new life in the Middle East.\n44.\tWhen we consider the facts of the situation and look at the cause of the Palestinian people in its proper perspective as first and foremost a political matter, we are neither granting these people a right nor bestowing upon them a privilege; we are correcting an historical error which we committed against them and against the whole of humanity. To withhold the recognition of the natural rights of a people would be tantamount to the humiliation of the whole of mankind. The structure of humanity is indivisible, and we cannot deal with the fate of peoples on the basis of double standards which give or deny without reasoning.\n45.\tThe Palestinian people are capable of seizing their own rights and of imposing their will, but it would be better for us to give their movement international legitimacy instead of imposing upon them the task of struggling outside that framework of legitimacy. By virtue of their long history of dealing with situations and facing reality objectively and without evasiveness the Palestinian people are qualified to assume this task. They realize that the glorious war of 6 October has opened new horizons for all the Arabs and has for the first time afforded an opportunity to reach a just and permanent peace in the area that would make it possible for its people to devote their attention to development, and to the task of economic and social transformation which is needed to make their future secure.\n46.\tFor those reasons, we suggest that the General Assembly should discuss the cause of the Palestinian people during this session on. the basis that it is the essence of the problem, with the following principles as guidelines: first, the reaffirmation of the basic and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the rejection of any neglect or usurpation of those rights; secondly, the reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination without any outside intervention and to securing their national independence and their right to return to their homeland I am sure that the General Assembly will call upon the Palestine Liberation Organization, as the representative of the Palestinian people, to take part in the debate in the General Assembly when the Palestinian question is to be discussed; and thirdly, the reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinian people to use all means to achieve their basic rights in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n47.\tWe should recollect that President Mohammed Anwar El-Sadat stated when the fighting was going on in Sinai and the Golan Heights:\n\\\"We are not war adventurers, we are peace- seekers; and we are not fighting to launch aggression on other people's lands, but we have fought and will continue to fight to attain two objectives: first, the full restoration of all our lands that have been under occupation since 1967; second, the finding of means to restore and ensure respect of the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine.\\\"\n48.\tThis is our basic and established policy from which we will never deviate. When we talk about peace, and work for peace, we mean genuine peace that tackles the essence of the problem and ends the cause of conflict, and not simply a peace that only addresses itself to superficial symptoms. The problem has transcended temporary and partial solutions which are intended to prolong the period of the truce -a truce that has not prevented three wars from breaking out in less than 20 years and has failed to pave the way for peace.\n49.\tWe agree that there are certain ethical principles to be followed in international relations and policies that should be respected in the interest of international life. The first of these is that .aggression should not go unpunished. And therefore we do not allow Israel to commit aggression and to go unpunished, let alone being allowed to reap the fruits of that aggression. Israel should pay for the destruction which has been inflicted on the cities of Suez, Ismailia, Port Said, Quneitra and other civilian targets\n50.\tFurthermore, economic piracy and the looting of natural resources is something which cannot be tolerated. Therefore, Israel will bear full responsibility for sapping our natural resources; I refer here in particular to the oil and other resources that have been stolen from Sinai.\n51.\tI have declared on more than one occasion that Egypt did not and will not accept the state of \\\"no peace, no war\\\". I repeat this here, from this rostrum, because such a state of affairs can only serve aggressive Israel; it does not serve peace, and Egypt rejects it categorically. If anyone should try to maintain such a state of affairs, he would discover that his calculations were based on a gross error and an unsound estimate.\n52.\tWe want a just and lasting peace and we are not asking too much in demanding that the peace should be just, for experience has proved that unless peace is just it cannot be durable because it fails to become implanted in the conscience of the nation and it fails to create the proper mental and psychological environment for coexistence between peoples. It is, indeed, deplorable that Israel should not have thoroughly absorbed this fact. Israel's accumulated arrogance and conceit and its superiority complex and desire for expansion have made it impossible for Israel to digest the lessons to be learned from the October war of 1973 in all its dimensions. We still hear every day statements by the officials in Israel threatening that they will not relinquish the lands that they have occupied by force and their audacity has reached the point of denying the very existence Of the Palestinian people. It is, indeed, a mockery that Israel should argue about the recognition of the Palestinian people at a time when it demands more international recognition for itself. Thus positions are reversed and the intruder who has unjustly implanted himself in the area claims for himself what he denies to the owners of the land.\n53.\tTo all these Israeli hysterical and desperate cries we say:\n\\\"Stop that, because it will not do you any good. If you are genuinely seeking to coexist peacefully with the peoples of the area, it is imperative that you discard those reckless tendencies now and for ever. You should not be deceived because some are still supplying you with their assistance and flooding you with charity, giving you arms in limitless quantities. All this is not going to realize for you the dream which apparently you are still entertaining, namely, breaking the Arab will and forcing the Arab people to surrender to your conditions. All this can only produce a prolongation of the conflict, complicating it beyond solution. You will have only yourselves to blame if you later regret wasting this golden opportunity to reach an honorable solution. Look around you, you will see a wall of international refusal of your expansionist and aggressive intentions. You will find a collective denunciation of your shameful conduct which spurs you to attack women and children in villages and in peaceful camps.\\\"\n54.\tThere is no alternative to a return .to the truth, logic and international law. And it is futile to cling to traces of the past with their misleading mirage and their unrealized dreams. The destiny of peoples can only be decided on the basis of the just truth and not on the basis of unjust illusions.\n55.\tOrr our part, we have firmly resolved to enter the battle for peace with the same determination that led us to engage in fighting, for our objective in both cases is one and the same: the liberation of our occupied land and the achievement of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. It is for this reason that we have welcomed the convening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, which is in fact a practical echo of an idea submitted by President Anwar El-Sadat.\n56.\tWe should remember and it is always beneficial to remember that Egypt was the first country which agreed to the convening of the Geneva Conference, and we went there with a sincere heart. We still believe that it is the appropriate formula for discussing all aspects of the question and for reaching a comprehensive and permanent solution to the crisis. Egypt therefore is ready to go to that Conference at the nearest suitable time after the completion of the preparation for the resumption of the Conference on the part of Egypt and others and in the light of Egypt's responsibility to bear the greatest burden in moving towards a just peace in the area, as well as the special responsibility of the two super-Powers with respect to Security Council resolutions and for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n57.\tIt is only natural that, while we are exerting our efforts to establish peace in the area, we should also seek to establish a zone free of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, so as to strengthen peace in that area. This should be parallel to the efforts that are being exerted to encourage the establishment of such zones on the regional level, in order to pave the way to general and complete disarmament.\n58.\tWe all know that the countries of the Middle East are regarded at present as non-nuclear Powers and that they are unwilling to direct their resources towards the production of nuclear weapons, with the exception, that is, of Israel. Israel has refused so far to take any step towards acceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], despite the fact that the majority of the countries in the area have gone a long way towards acceding to that Treaty. That in itself is sufficient to demonstrate and to prove the expansionist intentions of Israel. Israel's refusal to accede to the Treaty explains why Egypt, after having signed it, has not yet ratified it. Should this state of affairs continue, it will constitute a great danger and threat to security and to peace. Speedy action is therefore called for in order to close this gap. The responsibility of the two super-Powers in this respect is a fundamental one, because of their special position in the Treaty and their responsibility, together with the rest of the permanent members of the Security Council, for the maintenance of international peace and security. I should like to repeat here what I have already said, namely, that Egypt is prepared to ratify the Treaty when Israel agrees to accede to it and to adhere to its provisions.\n59.\tWe are of the opinion that when we submit this question jointly with Iran [A/9693 and Add.l and 2] for discussion at our present session, we should concentrate on three basic principles: first, on an obligation not to introduce nuclear weapons to the area in any form whatsoever; secondly, on an obligation on the part of the nuclear Powers not to use nuclear weapons against countries of the area, and not to introduce nuclear wear HIS into that area; and thirdly, on the establishment of an appropriate safeguards system to guarantee the fulfillment of these obligations.\n60.\tWithin this framework, the whole area and its peoples can be made secure against the dangers of nuclear destruction, and at the same time nuclear energy can be used for peaceful purposes in accordance with the provisions of the non-proliferation Treaty and the guarantees provided for therein.\n61.\tWe cannot speak of the Middle East without expressing our deep regret at the sad events that have taken place in Cyprus, resulting in the undermining of the legitimacy and peace of that non-aligned country. We have ties of affection with the people of Cyprus; we are linked by proximity, common interest and a desire for mutual security. We firmly believe that there is no way to restore peace to the various parts of the island without a return to legitimacy and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. There should be no interference from outside in its affairs, and the two communities of the nation should be left to decide freely their own internal affairs.\n62.\tThe non-aligned countries have taken it upon themselves to play an active and positive role in deploying the necessary efforts towards .reaching a solution to the crisis, in the light of these principles and free from all ambition, selfishness and desire to toy with the destinies of peoples. In doing so, the (ion- aligned countries are seeking a quick end to the sufferings of the tens of thousands of Cypriots who have been rendered homeless and who have had imposed upon them the tragedies of a war they did not want, a war in the decision of which they have had no part.\n63.\tWhen we concentrate our attention on the Middle East and the events and developments of that region, we do not overlook the fact that there are other questions to which we should also devote much of our attention; for we believe in the indivisibility of the struggle of peoples for liberation and for ridding themselves of foreign domination and exploitation. We believe in the unity of mankind's destiny, and our relationships with the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America are friendly relationships based on fundamental principles. We therefore regard with great attention the events in IndoChina and we demand strict adherence to the Parts Agreement concerning Viet Nam.\n64.\tWe also urge, that the peoples of Cambodia and Laos be left to decide their own affairs without dictation or pressure from abroad, since the bitter experiences of the past have proved that foreign intervention leaves behind it nothing but more conflict, more devastation, more suffering. We also hope that the foreign forces will be withdrawn from South Korea and that the Korean people in both the North and the South will be left to decide their own affairs, free from provocation or intervention.\n65.\tThe General Assembly at this session is faced with one of the most important tests it has had to meet since the emergence of the United Nations as a means for the expression of the international will and as an instrument for serving the cause of peace and cooperation among nations and peoples. In view of the pressing problems that face the world today, we cannot bury our heads in the sand and we cannot afford to be blind to the facts of the situation, for if we do, we shall be paralyzed or able to do very little -and too late.\n66.\tThe test before us is clear and there is no ambiguity about it: either we side with the cause of peace, freedom and progress, or we waste this opportunity -which may be the last for the fulfillment of humanity's hopes, thus ruining the dreams of coming generations.\n67.\tI appeal to this august Assembly -and I am filled with hope- to rise to the level of its responsibility and to the level of the international events at this turning-point in history, and to fulfill the expectations of the peoples we have the honor to represent, so that their confidence in the United Nations and their respect for its principles and objectives may be restored.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I congratulate you most warmly on your election to the President's chair, for which your qualities and long experience as Foreign Minister of your country so admirably fit you. I wish you well in the direction of our business, which includes many important and some difficult issues. The year of your presidency will be an important year. We shall in fact be getting to grips with matters which are central to the future welfare, and even the existence, of human society.\n4.\tFirst of all, I must speak of the recent tragic death of our beloved Prime Minister, Mr. Norman Kirk, who last year spoke for New Zealand in this debate. He was a good and humane man -a champion of the poor and the weak. We were deeply touched and comforted by the sympathy shown to us by people from all over the world at the time of our loss. Such solidarity occurs only when we lose a leader who has risen above local concerns, as he did one who has worked to advance the cause of the whole human family. The response to his death suggests that multitudes hunger for new attitudes among the leaders of nations. New Zealand will miss him greatly. But my Government will still try to bring to reality his personal vision of a new world social and economic order. We shall continue to strive, as Mr. Kirk did, to translate into international terms the vision of a decent and humane society which motivates our policy at home. Our goal remains to help to harness the great resources and skills of the people of this planet, so that everyone, not just a few, will have a chance to live as human beings should. We shall continue to work to strengthen the United Nations as a center for harmonizing the actions of nations and for protecting the rights of the smaller nations.\n5.\tThe last three years have witnessed a remarkable change in national attitudes. In 1972, the year of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm, the international community became aware of, and accepted the existence of certain physical limits to economic growth: limits to the availability of natural resources and of food; limits to the amount of pollution that can be discharged into the environment before inevitable and unwelcome consequences follow. In 1973 the world began to receive sharp, warnings of some of these physical limits, particularly in the supply of energy and of food. It became painfully apparent that our ability through existing institutions to make efficient and humane use of the world's talents and resources for the common good was more limited than we had thought and more limited than we could put up with.\n6.\tIn 1974 it became obvious that the world had better make a more serious effort to understand the interdependence of all peoples and all States. At a number of historic conferences the nations at last started to study realistically the fundamental changes that will be needed if we are to bring about the new order that the world requires a new order that will ensure a more equitable use of the world's resources to meet the demands of the future. These conferences included the sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the World Population Conference, 1974, and, soon, the World Food Conference. The common theme of these conferences was, and will be, interdependence. Whatever subject is studied, the same lesson emerges: we are one people, we are all one of another; and if we ignore that truth all of us will suffer and none of us may have a future in any meaningful sense of the word at all. At one time only visionaries and preachers spoke in such terms. Now the message has spread to the so-called practical people.\n7.\tGovernments, in their concern about the state of the planet, are having to look up from problems of local tension and conflict which are themselves hard enough to solve and to face fundamental issues affecting the very survival of humanity. The great issues of today are population, food, energy, natural resources, the environment and the embracing need for an economic order which will enable all people to realize their full potential as human beings. For the immediate and foreseeable future these constitute the agenda these will be the primary concerns of the international community and of the United Nations. Our success in dealing with them will largely determine the climate in which relations between States will develop in the next decade.\n8.\tDetente is not just a question of political relations between the great Powers. True, detente must be based on a general acceptance of the interdependence of the great Powers and the small, of developed and developing nations. It must be based on the willingness of all of us to work together to solve the problems about which I have spoken. What alternative is in fact open to us?\n9.\tTo deal first with the subject of food, the shortage of food is growing worse. The international community has recognized the urgent need to act and to deal with the situation. Without food there can be no human energy. The World Food Conference will be a vitally important meeting. World food stocks have sunk to the lowest level in 50 years. We are now living literally on a hand-to-mouth basis. The assessment prepared for the World Food Conference has indicated that there will be a very significant food deficit in developing countries in the 1980s. Others have forecast the possibility of mass starvation by the end of the century. As a matter of immediate anxiety, a grave food shortage looms next winter. Weather conditions have reduced the harvests in the United States and Canada, and, therefore, the possibility of their being used, as they so often have been, as a backstop. The drought in the Sahel has brought famine to Africa. Further shortages seem likely to hit countries in Asia.\n10.\tWeather is one cause of these troubles but nations are also at fault. The institutions for producing and marketing and distributing food have failed us. Above all, they have failed those countries and those people on the lowest incomes. There is an enormous unused potential for food production, but the international community has not yet devised ways of sharing its resources and skills for the benefit of all. The World Food Conference must provide the framework for such co-operation. If a crisis situation is developing, there will be a tendency to concentrate on short-term food aid. A world food security arrangement, which has so far eluded our efforts, is more necessary than ever be-fore. We must ensure that arrangements are made for sufficient stores of food, so that people do not starve in the emergencies which past experience teaches us will unfortunately occur from time to time.\n11.\tThe world, however, cannot just rely on the traditional food producers, There is a fundamental imbalance in food production. The answer is not to produce more and more food in the rich countries and ship it off as aid to distant parts. We must give top priority to increasing national production in developing countries. In many regions there are untapped resources of land and water. These can and must be utilized to expand food production. It is essential that the World Food Conference produce arrangements that will transfer agricultural technology to developing countries and increase the supply of the agricultural inputs they must have: money, energy, fertilizer, seeds, chemicals and equipment.\n12.\tMost of New Zealand's special expertise is in the varied field of agriculture. We have shaped our development assistance and technical co-operation according to programs to make it available to others who need and want it. In the last year over 30 per cent of our bilateral aid involved the transfer of agricultural technology, materials, equipment and training. In providing this aid we are making a strong effort to ensure that it is practical and literally down to earth. Our friends in the South Pacific tell us that in the past years their islands have been nearly buried by feasibility studies, surveys and reports by international experts. They have been studied and surveyed beyond all bearing. What they want now is action. So do we. We do not underestimate the value of research. Our own agricultural success has depended on it very much indeed. But we think that if production is to be increased, as it should be, this will be done by men prepared to dirty their hands in the field, and not by those who polish the seat of a chair in a distant office. We for our part try to avoid inflicting on other people chair polishers disguised as experts. And we hope that the students from other countries whom we train in New Zealand will get the message that countries are developed only by hard work and effort, and that workers are deserving of equal respect whether they wear collars and ties or just shirts.\n13.\tAs a major agricultural exporter, New Zealand certainly shares the interest of developing countries and other States in the orderly marketing and distribution of food. We are constantly working for the elimination of barriers to trade and for the creation of stable markets at fair prices. Obviously in this area we are working in our own interest; but we believe also that we are working in the interests of others just as much as in our own. The World Food Conference should provide constructive guidance to the multilateral trade negotiations at present under way. We hope it will also give the incentive to remove the present stumbling blocks to progress in these negotiations. This is an area of activity in negotiations in agricultural trade that is usually dull and hard, and greatly complicated by national politics. But if food is to be produced in much greater quantity and it must be if the rapidly growing number of people are to be fed we must get an imaginative breakthrough in this vital field.\n14.\tI have spoken of our concern about the world food shortage. I have said that we wish to make available to developing countries the benefits of the technology and expertise that we have built up in our agriculturally-based economy. Together with our colleagues from Sri Lanka, we have promoted emergency arrangements to ensure that the countries most in need can obtain sufficient supplies of nitrogenous fertilizers at prices they can afford.\n15.\tWe are convinced that real and lasting progress can be made by developing countries only if aid policies are closely co-ordinated with trade and monetary policies. The sixth special session of the General Assembly was an historic event, in some ways a revolutionary event. Its consequences will work themselves out over many years.\n16.\tBut the most important revolutions, we believe, occur in men's minds, not in the streets. Colonialism collapsed in two decades because of a conviction that its day was over. As the cumulative result of years of effort in education, sometimes through oratory and pressure, the conscience dormant in most people was brought to life and even the colonial Powers came to share this conviction, some more slowly than others. But I believe that we are now on the brink of another and even more profound shift in attitudes. We are beginning to accept, not just in words, but through practical decisions, that all members of the world society in which we live have a just claim on the wealth and the more decent life that that society can make possible. To discuss a new economic order is now to discuss reality.\n17.\tA momentum has been established. Much more discussion will no doubt be required before consensus is reached on specific actions and before the change in attitudes is complete. But to achieve this we have to keep up the momentum and concentrate the energies of the international community on a manageable, realistic field of action. For our part we would like to suggest that the Assembly at this session identify as priority tasks for the coming year the four main issues for priority action: food, trade access, reform of the monetary system and emergency assistance. We think it would be useful if at this session the Assembly directed the subsidiary organs of the United Nations to bear this in mind in drawing up their own agenda and work programs.\n18.\tAt the sixth special session, the General Assembly established an emergency program of measures to help the countries hardest hit by the economic situation [resolution 3202 (S-VI)]. My country has allocated $10 million for this program. At the meeting to be held on 27 September on this subject I shall give more details of this contribution. However, we believe that a firmer basis should be established within the international community for providing large-scale emergency assistance whenever the need arises. We must have the means to avert the risk of the energy crisis or any other similar catastrophe creating a \\\"fourth world\\\" of countries so hopelessly placed that they are without any prospect of economic and social development for decades to come. My Government accepts that developing countries must increase their share of international trade, principally through improved access to the markets of the developed countries of the world. We support the generalized system of preferences and we are at present reviewing the New Zealand scheme with a view to introducing improvements into it.\n19.\tNew Zealand does not play a major role in the world financial institutions. But we have supported, and will continue to support, the principle that the developing countries should be full participants in discussions leading to major decisions on the international monetary order.\n20.\tL turn now to disarmament. Against this back-ground of human need, which all the speakers this morning touched on, it is surely tragic folly, to squander resources at an ever-increasing rate to perfect weapons of destruction. We already have enough nuclear weaponry to obliterate all life from this earth several times over. Almost everyone says he wants to stop the arms race and to use the scarce resources that would be saved for constructive purposes: for aid and human welfare. Each year this Organization solemnly proclaims how essential it is that additional resources be devoted to economic and social development. Each year it proclaims the need for disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament. Yet each year its proclamations are ignored. We now watch with despair medium-sized and even small-sized Powers trying to follow the bad example of the great nuclear Powers.\n21.\tSince the Assembly last met in regular session the tempo of nuclear-weapon testing has been stepped up. Two super-Powers have told us that a decade must elapse before they will be able to disentangle themselves from the spider's web of the arms race- a decade to strike what they choose to call \\\"a strategic balance\\\".\n22.\tIn the same time-span we face the prospect, even the certainty, if the international community does not act with vigor to prevent it, that there will be further additions to the nuclear club. Given the example set by the super-Powers and I do not feel at all comfortable in lecturing others we have to say that we completely reject the notion that the possession of these dreadful and suicidal weapons can in some way enhance a nation's status or security. On the contrary, the greater the number of States that possess such a capacity the more unstable the relationships between States will become and the greater will be the danger to world peace. We are deeply concerned that recent events may undermine the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. Some find defects in this Treaty, but, despite, the defects, it does offer a path back to sanity and reason.\n23.\tFor many years the nations of the South Pacific have been close to the testing of nuclear weapons. Interested parties may argue that the tests are harmless, but those of us who have been closest to them are keenly aware of the dangers that testing poses for the human environment. We know that these tests can create anxiety and apprehension in ordinary people everywhere. We urge that this Assembly again assert, clearly and without equivocation, that testing in every form must be ended, soon, urgently, through a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The Assembly should act to advance the principles of the non-proliferation Treaty.\n24.\tWe believe that the Assembly should stand ready to encourage positive proposals from countries of a given region to increase regional stability and security. In recent years that search for international security and stability has been given new impetus through regional activities. New Zealand continues to see merit in this approach, and we urge outside States to co-operate fully in giving effect to these initiatives by smaller countries in various parts of the world.\n25.\tI come now to the law of the sea. The law of the sea occupies a crucial place among the issues upon which the international community should focus most urgently in the coming year. In a world where population and resources press heavily upon one another, it is of critical importance to agree upon a just use of the resources of the oceans.\n26.\tThe session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas this year was especially important for the countries of the South Pacific. It gave New Zealand and its neighbors a most welcome chance to stress the special dependence of small island nations on the sea island States such as those in the South Pacific are at a disadvantage: they are geographically remote and they have very few agricultural and mineral resources. The development of their nearby maritime areas represents one of the few ways in which they can hope to supplement their slender land resources. New Zealand was encouraged that at Caracas these special needs were generally recognized.\n27.\tMuch work remains to be done; but we were heartened by the progress made. For the first time we now have within reach the essentials of a new agreement on a 12-mile territorial sea and a 200-mile economic zone. Undoubtedly, there will be a great deal of hard negotiation to come before a fair and balanced agreement can be reached on all the major issues. New Zealand, as a coastal State, recognizes the just interests of others: of the land-locked States and of those with limited access to the resources of the sea. We recognize the just interests of all countries, but especially the developing countries, in preserving the \\\"common heritage of mankind'' in the resources of the deep sea-bed. We hope that all countries will look to the next session of the Conference, in 1975, as the stage at which compromises must be made. And we believe that, if approached in that spirit, the session will lead quickly to the final treaty.\n28.\tI shall now speak of the South Pacific and Niue. In connexion with the South Pacific islands, but in a different context, we are pleased to note that in a referendum on 3 September the people of Niue chose to become fully self-governing, in free association with New Zealand: On 19 October New Zealand and Niue will end their relationship of administering Power and Non-Self-Governing Territory; we will enter a new period of partnership on a basis of equality. As a self-governing State, Niue will take its place as a full member of the South Pacific Forum along with other independent and self-governing States in the Pacific, including Papua New Guinea. Niue's new Constitution contains my Government's assurance that New Zealand's economic assistance to Niue will continue as before. During the process of self-determination it has been helpful for the people of Niue, as well as for New Zealand, to have the United Nations constantly and closely involved.\n29.\tNew Zealand is conscious, as never before, of the importance of Africa on the world's stage. We see the need, not only for Africa but also in the wider interests of the international community, to find lasting and peaceful solutions to the problems of that continent.\n30.\tIt is understandable that the situation in southern Africa should be of such continuing concern to this Assembly. New Zealand stands solidly with the world community in rejecting the policy of apartheid in South Africa. My Prime Minister welcomed a recent opportunity to assure the Chairman of the Special Committee on Apartheid, Ambassador Ogbu of Nigeria, that New Zealand would continue its stand on sporting contacts with South Africa: South African teams will not be allowed to enter New Zealand, unless they represent a sport in which apartheid is not practiced.\n31.\tNew Zealand also continues to offer practical support to the victims of apartheid: it contributes to the United Nations Educational and Training Program for Southern Africa, the United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa and the United Nations Trust Fund for Namibia.\n32.\tIn addition, my Government has decided to contribute more than $200,000 over a two-year period to a joint project with UNICEF to provide humanitarian assistance through liberation movements for the tens of thousands of displaced persons from Southern Rhodesia, Namibia and Angola who are at present living in -Zambia. This money is given to supply drugs, vaccines, high-protein food supplements, agricultural tools and educational aid.\n33.\tBefore I conclude, may I express my Government's pleasure at the admission of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau to membership in the United Nations. We welcome also the historic change which now allows us to look forward to the early admission of two other important African countries, Mozambique and Angola. Their accession to independence will mark a major step in the process of decolonization and a further major step in the liberation of Africa. It will bring us still closer to the full realization of the principle of universality, to which my Government attaches great importance.\n34.\tI have said that the primary concerns of this Organization today are people, food, energy, natural resources, the environment and the need for a new economic order. These are universal concerns; every nation has a duty to play its part in helping to solve them. New Zealand believes that all nations can best do this within the great family of the United Nations, accepting the obligations as well as the privileges of membership.\n"

        "file_text": "The unanimous election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly of Mr. Bouteflika, the distinguished representative of Algeria, a country with which Romania entertains warm relations of friendship and co-operation, is for the Romanian delegation a source of deep satisfaction. In extending to him our most cordial congratulations, I express the firm conviction that, thanks to his qualities and to his country's international prestige, he will substantially contribute to the successful out-come of our proceedings and thus of this session.\n20.\tI should also like to renew our tribute to Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who, with tact and competence, presided over the work of the last regular session and the sixth special session of the Assembly. \n21.\tMay I from this rostrum discharge the pleasant duty of conveying once more to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our special thanks for his untiring efforts in the service of the United Nations dedicated to enhancing the contribution and effectiveness of the Organization in solving the complex problems of our time and to strengthening its prestige in the world. We are convinced that the lively dialog between the leaders of the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Secretary-General will proceed in the context of concerted efforts aimed at strengthening the United Nations.\n22.\tThis session of the General Assembly can be proud that an important step has been taken towards achieving the universality of the Organization. I refer to the admission to membership in the United Nations of Guinea-Bissau, Bangladesh and Grenada. On behalf of the Romanian Government, I should like to extend to them our most sincere congratulations and our welcome to the Organization, and to pledge our full co-operation in the promotion of the aims and principles of the Charter.\n23.\tThe delegations of States Members of the United Nations are meeting this year for the twenty-ninth time in order to consider together the problems that confront mankind today, to analyze them in the light both of the specific information available to us at present and of the prospects for the future, and to find acceptable solutions to all. These solutions must be lasting, and must benefit both each individual nation and the international community as a whole.\n24.\tThis year is significant for the Romanian people in that we can see the good results of profound structural economic, social and political changes which have taken place over the 30 years since the liberation of our country from Fascist domination. Romania today is an industrial and agricultural State, with a vigorous industry developing at a rapid pace on the basis of the latest achievements of modern science and technology and a flourishing Socialist agriculture. Those achievements, without precedent in the ages- long history of the Romanian people, demonstrate its creative capacity to build up its own way of life freely, in accordance with its own desires and aspirations.\n25.\tRomania's international activity, in full accord with the new historical realities, has taken on new outlines and new dimensions, the attributes of the policy of an independent and sovereign Socialist State. This activity expresses the aspirations and the fundamental hopes of the Romanian nation, which are in full harmony with the general interests of peace and progress, of understanding and close co-operation among all States in the world.\n26.\tThe dynamic character of Romania's foreign policy, the variety of the forms it takes and its re-sounding message are reflected in the number of States with which we have diplomatic relations, amounting now to 120. The Romanian people has never had as many friends as it has today. In our opinion, this is proof of the realism of the international policy of our State, and its harmony with the legitimate aspirations of all peoples to a life of freedom and dignity, to the establishment of a durable peace on our planet and the elimination of war and of force in general in international relations.\n27.\tIn this spirit, Romania is developing and expanding its relations with all Socialist States and is striving to expand its relations with all developing countries and with all States struggling for their independent development. Our State, in keeping with the principles of peaceful coexistence, is also working for the promotion of mutually advantageous co-operation with the developed capitalist countries.\n28.\tRomania has firmly established its international relations on the basis of the principles of full equality of rights, respect for independence and national sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, mutual advantage, and the non-use of force or the threat of force in relations among States.\n29.\tThe change in the balance of forces on the world scale resulting from the innovative ideas of socialism, the appearance on the international scene of many States vitally concerned to strengthen their independence and the rallying of new social and political forces to the flag of peace, democracy and progress has developed concurrently with, and is closely linked to, the technological and scientific revolution. This adds new factors to the international realities of today.\n30.\tEvents, wherever they take place, have rapid repercussions on international relations as a whole, and in one way or another affect every State. These are factual reasons which, in addition to the solid grounds of law, justify the growing concern of States with international questions and with their rights and obligations to participate and to make their own contribution to efforts aimed at settling international problems.\n31.\tNations wish to live in peace and tranquility and to be complete masters of their own destiny, abolishing for ever imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism, and the policy of force and the diktat. People wish to co-operate and not to destroy each other in devastating wars, which have never provided viable solutions to international problems. Nations wish to join their efforts in order to discover further mysteries of nature, to confront the difficulties that arise, to progress together with all speed, if possible during our own outstanding period of history, towards the summit of civilization.\n32.\tLately the international community has been giving more frequent and systematic consideration, in a spirit of co-operation, to the major problems of its present and its future. There have been a number of international conferences, and there will be more and in this context I should like to stress the particular value of the United Nations, its Secretariat and its Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim), which have discussed, and will continue to discuss, such problems as energy, the environment,-population, food, industrial development, the law of the sea, and science and technology, Fundamentally, these are aspects of a question which is on everyone's agenda, namely, development. Man and society are engaged in a development process which nobody can avoid. In order to cope with this process we must, on the one hand, eliminate obsolete situations and renounce methods and procedures that have prevented us from advancing rapidly, and, on the other, unite our efforts to find solutions to the major problems we face.\n33.\tI have the privilege of reminding the General Assembly of the vibrant appeal of the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania, Mr. Nicolae Ceauescu, at the session of the great National Assembly to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the liberation of Romania:\n\\\"We appeal to all Governments and to all peoples to act in concert and to co-operate actively in order to promote a policy of detente in the world \nand to make the present international situations thoroughly democratic.\n\\\"We should co-operate intensively in order to find unanimously acceptable political solutions to all the problems confronting mankind today, to bring about the triumph of reason and equality in international relations, to avert new armed confrontations and forcefully to defend the free life and work of all peoples.\\\"\n34.\tIt is true that, following profound transformations in international life, a new trend towards detente is making itself felt in the world. We must devote all our efforts to encouraging this tendency so that it may become the dominant and definitive trait in international relations. Unfortunately, however, the trend is not yet irreversible. The developments of these past few months remind us once more that in this world there are still forces opposed to peace, detente and co-operation. Consequently, we should continue to strive for the triumph of the policy of peace and understanding among peoples. It is certainly not an easy task; but, by relying on the will of peoples and by proving our sense of responsibility for the future of present generations and of those to come, we shall be able to overcome all the difficulties.\n35.\tThe protection of peace, the supreme good of all mankind, is inextricably linked to the achievement of general and complete disarmament and, above all, of nuclear disarmament. We cannot lose sight of the fact that, while negotiations on disarmament are under way in Geneva, the arms race, the increase in the number of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, as well as of other means of mass destruction, are a source of grave danger for the peace of and for civilization itself. The United Nations is in duty bound to take this state of affairs into consideration and to take relevant measures. Progressive forces and all peoples should unite their efforts and act with energy for the implementation of a truly new policy on disarmament.\n36; The Romanian Government favors the adoption of specific measures aimed at putting an end to the arms race, the reduction of military budgets and troops, the dismantling of foreign military bases and the elimination of military blocs. We favor the acceptance by all States of solemn commitments to prevent all aggression or interference in the affairs of other States. In our opinion, the proliferation of atomic weapons can be halted only by putting an end to the production of nuclear weapons and by proceeding, on the basis of agreements, to the destruction of existing stocks.\n37.\tDuring this last quarter of a century it will be the task of all the Members of the United Nations to take resolute steps towards the establishment of new relations among all peoples of the world and the building of a new economic and political order in accordance with international decisions. By acting in this manner, we shall be responding to the vital aspirations of all peoples for the total elimination of the old imperialist policy of force and diktat, of colonialism and neocolonialism, and of all forms of interference and pressure.\n38.\tWe should encourage the solution of disputes among States by political means, unconditionally respecting the fundamental principles of contemporary international law. This law is itself subject to continuous changes reflecting the transformations that have taken place in society and in relations among States. Life shows that in our time the major problems confronting the international community can no longer be solved by a small group of States. The search for just and lasting solutions requires the participation, on a footing of equality, of all States concerned, thus strengthening the role of small and medium-sized countries in international life. It is only thus that we shall be able to find the solutions that most nearly correspond with the interests of all nations and fully serve the cause of peace. \n39.\tThe establishment of truly democratic and equitable relations in the world and mankind's advance along the path of progress are inextricably linked to the establishment of a new international economic order. The experience of history shows that there is a close dialectical correspondence between the development of an independent economy and the realization of true national sovereignty. It is a truth, proved in practice everywhere in the world, that to ensure real independence it is essential to forge a powerful independent economy.\n40.\tThe work of each nation has always been and will remain the main determinant of the development of its material production and its social and economic progress. The manner in which each people by its labor successfully exploits its national resources plays a decisive role here. At the same time, more rapid progress on the part of the developing countries requires firmer action to strengthen relations between developed and developing countries on the basis of just principles that will further their own efforts for economic and social progress. It is high time and we should realize this fully for us to act forcefully to close the vast gap between the economies of various States and to bring their levels of development closer together.\n41.\tThe elimination of discriminatory measures hampering economic exchanges and a broader access for all States to the achievements of science and technology of our time are other important requirements for the reorganization, on new bases, of inter-national economic relations.\n42.\tRomania, which is itself a developing country, is broadening and diversifying its economic relations with the other developing States. Those ties are an expression of its solidarity with those States in their efforts towards economic, social and national emancipation. The political actions of the leaders of our State, the many visits made by President Nicolae Ceaugescu to developing countries everywhere and the economic agreements that have been concluded in recent years have highlighted the better utilization of the material and human resources both of Romania and of those other countries. Such undertakings make it possible to contribute to the training of officials in the countries concerned and to meet the mutual interest in the development of industry, agriculture and other economic sectors, with a view to the accelerated economic and social progress of those countries.\n43.\tThe establishment of that new kind of international economic and political relationship requires a perfecting of the system of participation and action of States in international life. An ever more important role must be played by the United Nations.\n44.\tRomania wishes to make a positive contribution to the full use of the possibilities and means of the United Nations in the solution of international problems and the encouragement of co-operation and understanding among States, and it has therefore proposed that the General Assembly study the possibility of strengthening the Organization's capacity for effective action, so that that action will truly reflect the new social and political facts of the present-day world and conform to the trends towards making international life more democratic. The Romanian Government bases itself on the concept that the primary interest of all nations in finding just and viable solutions to the great problems facing mankind necessitates the creation of conditions in which the United Nations will be truly able to carry out the functions and responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter.\n45.\tWe think that the Organization has a considerable number of means for more energetic and effective action on all the situations arising in international relations. Many of the Charter provisions have been rarely or insufficiently used; others have not been applied at all. Still others have been interpreted in such a way that they have proved to be unusable or impossible to apply.\n46.\tThe General Assembly has the duty to study responsibly and with the greatest attention all the means that would ensure the application of the Charter provisions and the use of the methods made available to us by the Charter in particular, those provisions concerning the prevention and peaceful settlement of disputes, the confirmation of the process of the democratization of international relations, and the development of wider and more equal co-operation among all nations.\n47.\tWe view that study as a process in which the General Assembly will give constant attention to the question of strengthening the role of the United Nations and will periodically evaluate the efforts made, the progress achieved and the measures to be taken in the future. At the same time, we believe that other United Nations bodies should also, within the limits of their competence, study and put into effect proposals and suggestions by States designed to improve the activities of those bodies and thereby strengthen the role of the Organization in the world.\n48.\tOf course, the ability of the United Nations to deal with the questions it must solve depends in the final analysis on the political will of its Member States \u2014I would even say on their commitment to finding acceptable solutions in the interests of all the peoples and putting into effect the obligations they have assumed under the Charter and other international instruments, as well as the undertakings and actions to which they have subscribed under various United Nations resolutions.\n49.\tThe Romanian delegation is pleased with the way the General Assembly's sixth special session devoted to raw materials and development worked and the results it achieved. We are in favor of the implementation in relations among all the States of the principles laid down in the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and of the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)].\n50.\tIn the Romanian delegation's opinion, the specific study and effective implementation by inter-national bodies within the United Nations system and by other international organizations of measures which were envisaged by the special session and which fall within their competence are very urgent tasks. The adoption during this session of the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, elaborated on the proposal of the President of Mexico, Mr. Luis Echeverria, will be a further step towards the preparation of a whole body of principles governing economic relations among States.\n51.\tWe have similar views regarding the recent World Population Conference, which was organized by the United Nations and to which the Romanian people had the honor of playing host. In our opinion, resolution V, entitled \\\"For a more just world\\\", adopted by that Conference, has particular significance. The document once again makes clear the international community's attachment to the ideals of a new and better world. We are convinced that the constructive way in which the representatives cooperated at that Conference and the fact that they succeeded in defining, on the basis of a consensus, the directions that action in that field should take action closely linked to the broad efforts of States to achieve economic and social progress create a very good basis for the continuation and improvement of such activities in the future.\n52.\tConvinced of the role that modern science and technology play in the process of development, the Romanian Government is in favor of the organization by the United Nations of a conference on science and technology. We intend to propose some practical actions in that respect.\n53.\tAn important role in the strengthening of the process of detente in the world is played by the efforts to achieve security and co-operation in Europe. The Romanian Government believes that the results achieved so far by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have created conditions for the successful preparation of documents and for the convening in the very near future of the third phase of the Conference, at the highest level. The documents that will be adopted at that time should lead to the definition of new principles governing relations among the European States and to the opening of the path towards peaceful multilateral co-operation among all the States of the continent. They should also provide guarantees to each nation against any use or threat of the use of force and my interference in its internal affairs; they should provide also the possibility for each State to develop freely and as it wishes, without any impediments.\n54.\tRomania, as is known, has actively participated in the Conference. It has made and will continue to make a specific contribution to the process of defining measures aimed at rendering the non-use of force in inter-European relations effective and at defining the context and the objectives of the institutional consequences of this first political forum of European States. We believe that the States which have participated in the Conference should now, in a constructive spirit of mutual understanding, devote all. their efforts to speeding up and successfully concluding the work in Geneva, and to agreeing unanimously on measures so long awaited by the peoples of our continent and capable of strengthening security and the development of co-operation on the European continent.\n55.\tWithin the context of this process of reorganization on a new basis of relations among European States, Romania will continue to work for multilateral cooperation among the Balkan States so that the Balkans may become a zone free from nuclear weapons and from foreign military bases, an area of peace and cooperation. We are also in favor of the Mediterranean becoming a zone of peace and international co-operation. We support the proposal of the Soviet Union aimed at achieving the withdrawal from the Mediterranean of all Soviet and United States ships and submarines carrying nuclear weapons.\n56.\tIt is with satisfaction that we note that a qualitatively new element has intervened in the struggle to remove the remaining vestiges of the system of colonial domination. Southern Africa, a bastion of colonialism, has begun to crumble under the pressure of the struggles of peoples for freedom. We have welcomed the accession to independence of Guinea-Bissau and we believe that we should resolutely continue this process so that the peoples of Angola at 1 Mozambique may freely decide on their own destinies.\n57.\tIn the spirit of its own traditions of struggling for freedom and justice, Romania will resolutely oppose all forms of colonialism and neocolonialism and foreign domination. We firmly support the right of peoples to self-determination and independence, and we call for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)). The Romanian people, to whom racism and chauvinism is alien and who reject them, strongly condemn the outmoded minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia, as well as the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid.\n58.\tIn the opinion of U Romanian Government, the present session of the General Assembly and the United Nations in general are called upon to adopt firm and effective measures, making use of all the means provided by the Charter in order to force South Africa to put an end without delay to the illegal occupation of Namibia, so that the people of that country may preside freely over its own destinies, in keeping with its national aspirations.\n59.\tTo achieve the objective of the total elimination of colonialism, we believe that it is particularly urgent and timely to intensify efforts in order to bring about a broader recognition of national liberation movements and to secure the participation of their representatives in all the activities of our Organization which are of concern to them. From this rostrum, I should like to reaffirm the militant solidarity of the Romanian Government and people with the just struggle of national liberation movements, to whom we provide multilateral diplomatic and material support.\n60.\tThe frequent meetings and the fruitful discussions held by President Nicolae Ceaugescu with the leaders of the national liberation movements, by the recognized value of direct contacts at the summit level, have enshrined in international relations the lasting nature and depth of the sentiments of solidarity of the Romanian people with their just struggle for national independence.\n61.\tThe changes that have taken place in the Middle East and the military disengagement agreements concluded, which the Romanian Government has welcomed as a first major step towards the settlement of the conflict, strengthen our conviction that we should now take Anther action to establish peace in that region.\n62.\tIn the opinion of the Romanian Government, a just and lasting solution in the Middle East requires, as a first step, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from occupied Arab territories, recognition of the right to existence and independent development of all States in the area, the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, including the creation of an independent Palestinian State, and its recognition by the international community, bearing in mind the relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations. Moreover, as the Romanian Government has often stressed, we cannot achieve a lasting settlement of the situation in the Middle East without a proper solution of the Palestinian question. Certainly, in order to finalize this process, it is necessary to make unremitting efforts and to resume as soon as possible the Geneva negotiations under United Nations auspices, with the participation of all States concerned, of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and of all other States which wish to contribute to the implementation of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n63.\tThe overriding interests of the peoples of that region, as well as the interests of international peace and security, require that ail States strive resolutely to put an end to the conflict and to achieve a just and lasting peace.\n64.\tThe situation arising from developments in Cyprus is a cause of legitimate concern for international peace and security. As a country situated in the same geographical region, Romania is keenly interested in the evolution of the situation on that island and strongly supports respect for the independence, sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Cyprus, the withdrawal of foreign troops,, primarily of Greek and Turkish troops, and the settlement of those questions by political means, not by arms or force.\n65.\tIn the solution of the problem of Cyprus, based on the maintenance of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, a decisive role must be played by the Cypriot people.'Direct contacts and discussion between the two communities, as well as the immediate and specific consideration of all those questions, should lead to lasting agreements ensuring peaceful coexistence on the basis of full equality before the law of all the citizens of the Cypriot State. The prolongation of the present situation can have grave consequences for the Cypriot State and for international peace and security.\n66.\tAs regards the Korean question, the United Nations, in our view, has a moral obligation to help further the positive process begun through the political initiatives and persevering efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Consequently, an end should be put without delay to all those institutions which, against the national interests of the Korean people, have functioned as barriers on the road towards realization of that people's aspirations to peaceful and independent unification.\n67.\tThe General Assembly has already taken a first step in that direction by deciding at its last session to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea.4 It is therefore incumbent upon the Assembly to continue courageously along this path, and to work for the withdrawal of the foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations.\n68.\tRomania stands firmly by the side of the Cambodian people in its just struggle for national liberation and independent development in accordance with its national aspirations, without any outside interference. We believe that the United Nations has a duty to take into account the realities of the situation in that country, the de jure and de facto situation in Cambodia, and to proceed at once to the restoration in the United Nations of the legitimate rights of the Royal Government of National Unity, under the leadership of the Cambodian Head of State, Norodom Sihanouk.\n69.\tIn full solidarity with the just cause of the VietNamese people, the people and Government of my country have always given their support in a variety of ways to the heroic struggle of the Democratic People's Republic of Viet Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam, and welcomed with satisfaction the end of the war and the conclusion of the Paris peace agreements. It is now the duty of all peace-loving States to exert positive pressure for the implementation of those agreements, thus contributing to the defense of the freedom and independence of the VietNamese people, and to support for its efforts for peaceful rehabilitation.\n70.\tIn keeping with the same position of principle, the Romanian Government welcomed the conclusion of the agreement re-establishing peace and national harmony in Laos, and the moves to put the agreed arrangements into effect.\n71.\tAt the beginning of my statement I mentioned the fact that the representatives of Member States are holding their twenty-ninth session. The United Nations now has a past history of almost three decades. This year we have a new opportunity to prove to the entire world that the United Nations is an international forum capable of keeping step with the processes of innovation now going on in the world, with the unprecedented changes that characterize our time.\n72.\tIt is incumbent upon us, the representatives of the Member States, to devote all our efforts to ensuring that the present session will represent, in the history of the United Nations, an important step forward in seeking solutions to the problems confronting us, especially in eliminating the use of force or the threat of force, and banishing war from the international scene. Situations of tension and military confrontation must make way for understanding and co-operation among peoples. Let us join our forces, let us do everything in our power to ensure that peace reigns in the world, and that all peoples go forward ever more speedily towards the summits of civilization. It is thus that the United Nations will succeed in justifying the confidence placed in it by all peoples almost three decades ago.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it behooves me at the outset to reiterate the congratulatory expressions which were extended to you by my Prime Minister when he addressed the Assembly on the opening day [2233rd meeting]. My delegation has become very aware of the high esteem in which you are held, and we look forward to your capable guidance of the business of the current session. In our opinion, this points to a new direction in the affairs of the United Nations.\n62.\tIn this context, permit me to express also our sincere and deepest congratulations and commendations to our two other new Member States, Bangladesh and Guinea-Bissau. We look forward to working together in the spirit of brotherly co-operation with them, within the framework of this Organization.\n63.\tAt this juncture, I would like to seek your per-mission, Mr. President, to express to the Secretary- General, Mr. Waldheim, the appreciation of my Government and my delegation for his proven dedication in his tireless work in the cause of peace and the fulfilment of the objectives of the Charter. We are indeed fortunate to have an individual of his stature so ably performing this role, at a time when stature in individuals, as in nations, is so sorely needed.\n64.\tI would also like to voice my country's deep appreciation to all the representatives who, during the present session, have expressed kind words of welcome to Grenada in their statements. My country will always remember the warmth of their greetings, and we reciprocate most cordially their statements of friendship. Also, we take this opportunity, to convey our appreciation to those other nations which have manifested their friendship to Grenada at this time.\n65.\tMay I also express our sincere condolences and sympathy to the Government and people of Honduras, through the Honduran delegation, on the occasion of the terrible natural disaster which that country suffered as a result of the recent hurricane. To my delegation, the word \\\"hurricane\\\" identifies one of the many natural disasters with which we are faced today, and it is synonymous with the Caribbean region and Central America. Grenada having suffered, in 1955, from one of the most devastating hurricanes in history, my delegation and the Government and people of Grenada fully appreciate, in the most realistic way, the gravity and the immeasurable extent of the tragedy which has befallen the people and the land of Honduras.\n66.\tOn this most important question of natural disaster, my delegation notes with particular interest the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of the item relating to assistance to countries in cases of natural disaster [item 60], and looks forward to some more meaningful and effective action on an international level to lend practical assistance to those countries and peoples who, from time to time, are the hapless victims of the ravages of such disasters.\n67.\tThe interdependence of all nations, large and small, has proved to be the outstanding feature of international relations in this part of the twentieth century. There is continuing talk, a great deal of talk, of a new world order which will ensure for nations and peoples a more equitable use and distribution of global resources to face and meet the demands of the future. Priorities have been set, and many fruitful United Nations meetings and conferences have deliberated at length on the common theme of interdependence of peoples including the sixth special session of the General Assembly, the World Population Conference, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, and, too, the forthcoming World Food Conference to be held in Rome in November. Underlying the substantial work of these and other historic meetings is this common link running through their agendas like a golden thread.\n68.\tIn varying forms and with different results, we are being taught the same lesson namely, that we are one global people, inhabiting Buckminster Fuller's \\\"Global Village\\\". We must act in concert one with the other, or perish through disunity and lack of common vision. Grenada recognizes that the degree of success the Organization attains in solving, or re-solving, the major issues of the day, economic, political or social, will greatly depend upon the climate , prevailing in international relations.\n69.\tIn the next few years, should we ignore this vital factor, or through political short-sightedness fail to develop it properly, the world as a whole will suffer.\n70.\tThe Prime Minister of Grenada stated recently at this podium, \\\"... Grenada stands today as a free nation, a nation committed to the cause of world peace\\\" [2233rd meeting, para. 299]. It is the intention of my Government and my delegation to support the United Nations, and to co-operate to the fullest in its attainment of the lessening of international tension.\n71.\tInternational tension is caused by international insecurity. International insecurity, Grenada believes, can and must be eradicated by our unified re-dedication to the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security adopted at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2734 (XXV)].\n72.\tI would like to affirm my Government's total commitment to facial equality. In Grenada our people continue to live, as we have done over the past years, in harmonious and fraternal brotherhood, without distinction of color, race or creed. Consequently, we have achieved a climate of solidarity and freedom in every aspect of our national life. My Government believes that racial justice is one of the essential requirements for international peace and progress.\n73.\tIn this context, I would like to state that my Government condemns policies of racism in all its forms and manifestations, and joins in calling upon those Governments which pursue these policies to put an end to such abhorrent practices.\n74.\tMy Government's belief in racial equality ties in with its policies of equality of the sexes, policies which my Prime Minister, Mr. Eric Gairy, touched on in his address before the Assembly. Mr. Gairy said:\n\\\"It is also precisely because of our faith in the sanctity of the equal rights of men and women that we have enshrined in our Constitution the provisions which guarantee that the rights of Grenadian women are equated to those of Grenadian men, especially in the context of citizenship, thereby setting a precedent for this aspect of human equality within the commonwealth of nations.\\\" [2233rd meeting, para. 296.]\n75.\tThe women of Grenada have long been the backbone of our society. Unlike our counterparts in some developed countries, we have for generations played a dual role as mother provider and head of the family. In Grenada, too, women have equal political rights with men. They serve as government ministers, as cabinet members, and as active members of Parliament, and it is well known that Grenada was the first country within the Commonwealth of Nations to recommend a lady who held the high position of Governor. I might add that women are also active in business and in the professions, and there are women's organizations that have been working hard towards the total improvement in the status of our women.\n76.\tMy Government recognizes the contribution and the untapped potential of our women, and reded- icates itself to the eradication of all customs, laws, attitudes and practices which discriminate against women in any society in any part of the globe. Women comprise more than half of our society, and, in terms of human-resource power, they constitute an important factor in the over-all progress and development of all nations. My Government therefore feels that if women are to take their rightful place in society, all inhibiting laws, attitudes and practices must be immediately removed.\n77.\tAnd regarding our continuing campaign to secure effective \\\"woman power\\\", permit me to quote a recent statement of the Secretary-General in which he said: \\\"The equality of the sexes is a necessary pre-requisite for social and economic development, and a stimulus for world peace\\\". This reflects our senti-ments and our pplicies exactly.\n78.\tThe proclamation designating 1975 as Inter-national Women's Year [resolution 3010 (XXVII)] has certainly given added stimulus to my Government in its promotion of the equality of the sexes, and we fully support and express our desire to participate meaningfully in the programs of the year.\n79.\tBy our membership in this international Organization, we have undertaken a formal commitment to the rule of law in all aspects of our international relations. In my country's domestic governmental program, the rule of law will be the very bedrock upon which our policy is based, and this also was clearly enunciated by our Prime Minister in his address to the Assembly. We are proud of this tradition and very happy at being able to seize the historic opportunity afforded us, through membership in the United Nations, to conduct our international affairs on the basis of observance of the rule of law. In this fellowship, and with this essential prerequisite, we join the Organization.\n80.\tIt is extremely significant that newly independent nations large or small, rich or poor seek to join the ranks of the United Nations, and Grenada, of course, is no exception. Over the past three decades we have carefully followed the course and the progress of this unique world body, and we are resolute in our belief that the United Nations, by embracing all peoples and countries, is creating the true community house for all mankind. The effectiveness of the Organization lies precisely in the unanimous support of its Members and in the degree of solidarity achieved through open debate, frank discussion and democratic free exchange. It is important that the strength of the Organization, guided by the strength of the principles entrenched within the Charter, is never underrated nor undermined. In this same spirit of solidarity, Grenada offers itself whole-heartedly to the service and the purposes of the United Nations, and we open our arms to all brother nations as faithful members of the world community.\n81.\tThere has been endless reference by Members to the near total. universality of the Organization. Indeed, universality of membership and the political good will of Member States are the twin pillars of the United Nations.\n82.\tMy country is happy, as I said earlier, to be part of this rapid progress towards universality of the United Nations, and in this connexion, I today appeal to all countries to reaffirm their resolve and hasten their efforts to assist in the removal of the remaining shackles of colonialism. To the colonial system, with its perpetration of vast human injustice and endless exploitation of native peoples, must be attributed the blame for many of the ills of developing countries over the past several centuries. The Government of Grenada has always unswervingly supported the inalienable right of all peoples to self-determination and full independence.\n83.\tMy Government, which in February this year attained full freedom and independence for the people of Grenada after many centuries of colonial domination, fully supports and endorses the idea that inter-national peace and security will be greatly enhanced and preserved by the emergence of more and more countries from colonial domination into the arena of national independence. Correspondingly, we, sub-scribe to the respect for independence and the inherent sovereignty of States that form the very basis of the Charter of the United Nations.\n84.\tIn the rapidity of political, economic and social change with which we are faced, the concept known as \\\"future shock\\\" is manifesting itself on a daily basis to nations and individuals alike. In the smaller States, we are increasingly becoming the victims of this greatly accelerated rate of change within modern society. Today the artificial boundaries between the worlds of economics and politics are becoming more blurred; any remaining lines of demarcation separating those worlds are being finally erased by the energy crisis, the imbalance of world supply and demand for food, and an often precarious detente.\n85.\tWe have recognized the fact that political independence, through a vital and necessary milestone on the long and thorny road to self-determination, is but a catalyst in the process of real national independence. Economic viability, with the consequent improvement in the quality of life, is the goal that we seek for our people and generations yet unborn, and it is in this context that we view with pleasure and anxious expectation the establishment of the Pro-gramme of Action on the Establishment of a Nev International Economic Order by the General Assembly at its recent sixth special session convened as a result of the positive vision and initiative of the non-aligned and other developing countries. It is clear that emergency measures have to be urgently taken to maintain the momentum of the proposed new economic order, which will benefit the developing countries in particular. This is the time to effect concrete improvements in the lives of millions of third- world peoples. It is now up to the General Assembly's Second Committee to seize and utilize this golden opportunity.\n86.\tWe noted with considerable interest the promise made by President Ford of the United States of America to provide help to developing nations in the most vital areas of need. We believe that President Ford's statements were made in all sincerity and good faith and, therefore, we are hopefully looking forward to their implementation.\n87.\tWhile we realize that we have achieved full political independence which has enabled us to take our rightful place as a Member nation, we are acutely aware that as a developing country our ultimate goal is to make a meaningful contribution to world peace through economic independence. Many developing nations find themselves still at the mercy of multi-national corporations and are victims of economic servitude to the developed nations as suppliers of their agricultural raw materials and as markets for their expensive manufactured goods.\n88.\tAs I said, we welcome the resolutions adopted at the sixth special session earlier this year, which could well prove a turning-point in economic relations between rich and poor countries, and we look forward to meaningful and positive action on the part of the United Nations and thie .more developed countries to bring about substantial and constructive economic improvement for the developing countries. We look forward, too, to increased direct assistance in helping ur> to exercise effective sovereignty over our own natural resources of land and sea, and so ultimately to preserve and maintain our people's political sovereignty.\n89.\tWe affirm our Government's policy of economic self-reliance, self-help and self-sufficiency to achieve our national goals and objectives. However, this does not mean that we would not encourage foreign capital and expertise. In fact, we have a very healthy atmosphere for investment in Grenada, and we are in particular encouraging foreign investment in private enterprise. What we hope for is a more equitable distribution of profits and a program of training which would enable our people effectively to hold managerial positions alongside non-nationals.\n90.\tWe in Grenada, as a Caribbean nation, will continue to support all our regional institutions in their economic and fiscal policies and, at the same time, will aspire to enter into relationships with international monetary institutions with a view to finding realistic ways and means of bringing about viable and self-sustaining economic growth for our country.\n91.\tIn the 1970s and beyond, we anticipate greater economic co-operation, too, with our Latin American neighbors and our African brothers, and wider economic interdependence with the rest of the world as a result of the efforts of the sixth special session.\n92.\tThe establishment of a new economic order is essential if a ray of hope is to be seen for a reversal of the widening of the gap between developed and developing countries. We are concerned and, indeed, anxious for the economies of small countries such as ours, whose agricultural export earnings are keenly affected by the vagaries and ravages of weather, as well as market prices over which we have absolutely no control.\n93.\tWhile we welcome the attempts made by the Organization to alleviate the economic problems of developing countries, we still feel the need for a greater and more comprehensive understanding of our problems by the more developed States Members of the Organization, and we look forward with keen anticipation to a sharing of technological expertise, experience and economic strategy to combat spiraling inflation, poverty and economic dependence.\n94.\tAs a small island State, we are fully aware of the vital importance of the vast untapped resources of the sea-bed to our developing economy and we know that we shall be soon involved in the race for the riches of the sea. It is important that a nation should not suffer because of its size and that in keeping with the Charter, the United Nations should ensure that economic justice is achieved for all. While we recognize the just interests of others those of the land-locked States and those with limited access to the sea we must face the reality of our inescapable reliance on the resources of the sea to supplement our limited agricultural resources. It is therefore extremely heartening to us that the special needs of island States were recognized at the recently concluded session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in Caracas. We look with hope to the establishment of a just and equitable order of allocating to all countries the resources of the sea-bed, and the preservation of this \\\"common heritage of all mankind\\\". My country intends to participate in the next session of the Conference in 1975 and we anticipate a final treaty which will ensure the protection of all interests.\n95.\tOn the seemingly perpetual question of disarmament, my country deplores the dangerously vast resources utilized by certain Powers in their development of, research work on and proliferation of nuclear weaponry. We believe that the fragile framework of peace is being threatened by this continuing development of the destructive power of sophisticated weapons. The awesome annual expense being directed to increasing regularly these nuclear arsenals would without doubt serve humanity to a far better purpose were it devoted to increasing the volume of development co-operation. Grenada feels that the tremendously valuable research on nuclear energy should be used expressly for peaceful purposes, and that more of the resources of major Powers should be diverted to the production of food and agricultural products for the improvement of the level of existence of third- world peoples in particular.\n96.\tGrenada is a peace-loving and life-loving nation. We support all initiatives for the effective curbing of the arms race, the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, and the reduction of military budgets of certain Member States with a consequent diversion of the funds saved to the provision of tangible assistance to developing countries. Our irrevocable convictions will not permit us to do otherwise.\n97.\tI emphasize, in conclusion, that the continuing emergence of developing countries into independent nationhood has led to the creation of a new dynamic force in today's world, which is certainly influencing the trend of international relations. Grenada looks forward to making its own contribution to the endless task of ensuring lasting peace, economic justice, and maximum social progress for all of our peoples. With our belief in the principles of the Charter, we join you in working together towards achieving these goals.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, after listening to all the tributes addressed to your country, as well as to your own person, it would be tempting to refuse to follow the tradition for fear that, if I did, I might find myself uttering commonplaces and cliches. This temptation is all the more pressing since Dahomey considers that your election to preside over this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly is as if we ourselves had been elected, not only because your election is the election of Africa as a whole, but also because of the ties of deep friendship which bind our two peoples together.\n96.\tIn so doing it would be difficult for me, however, to fail to discharge the pleasant duty of saying to this brilliant audience how highly appreciative the Revolutionary Military Government of Dahomey is for the wise choice which resulted in your distinguished person being elected to preside over the Assembly and which, beyond question, will be an omen for the successful conduct of the work of this twenty-ninth regular session of the General Assembly.\n97.\tIndeed, your lengthy experience in the workings of the United Nations, which you have more than once sparked with your dynamic participation, the authority and mastery which you have gained throughout your lengthy and brilliant career in the service of the Algerian diplomatic corps, your many and valuable contributions to the cause of the non-aligned countries and that of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], are just so many major trump cards which will not fail to bring their full influence to bear in the discharge of our tasks, above all at a time when the United Nations has entered upon a new historic phase of its existence.\n98.\tAnd since at the present time we are living through a new era of decolonization, how could I fail to touch on the lengthy and difficult process of decolonization in Algeria, which was the result of a glorious revolution of which you are a member of the youngest and most dynamic cadre. The Algerian revolution did not only overthrow an entire system of domination and exploitation in northern Africa. It did more than that: thanks to that revolution it became possible to ensure self-determination and independence for most of our French-speaking countries. Since that time you have been engaged, side by side with your great leader President Houari Boumediene, with rare success in promoting in Algeria a foreign policy worthy of liberated Africa, divested of all forms of subordination between the parties.\n99.\tThus, in adding my voice to those very eloquent tones of representatives who have preceded me at the rostrum, I should like above all to welcome in you the worthy son of militant Africa, that Africa which, expunging the record of the severity with which determined colonization tried to smother legitimate aspirations, was able to show, once its objectives had been attained, that it knows how to forget and to pardon. This is our guarantee that throughout the entire session we will be guided by a man of high quality, dedicated to just causes and legitimate aspirations of the peoples which we represent here.\n100.\tLast year, from this same rostrum, I welcomed our incoming President, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, a descendant of that Latin America which has been\nnourished on the patriotic traditions of Bolivar. The way in which the business of the twenty-eighth session was conducted under his high authority, his courtesy and his knowledge of the practices of the United Nations are evidence that I was not mistaken in my appraisal. Quiring the sixth special session, over which he also presided, Mr. Benites gave us lessons in courage and deyotion which proved\u2014if proof were necessary\u2014-how much he cherishes international peace and security .\n101.\tDahomey has followed with special interest the activities of our Secretary-General in the course of this year. The dynamism, the patience and the perseverance that he has displayed in confronting the difficult and very delicate problems that have been entrusted to him deserve our praise and make him an exemplary international civil servant, wholly devoted to international peace and security. To be convinced of this-one need only follow his accomplishments and actions throughout the year. There is everything to show that nothing can daunt this ardent defender of the cause of the Organization when it is a matter of bringing about the triumph of the purposes and principles contained in the Charter.\n102.\tMy country rejoices in the fact that we had the pleasure of receiving Mr. Waldheim last March in the course of his brief trip to western Africa, a trip which enabled him to observe for himself, on the spot, the damage caused by the natural disaster of drought. I personally, on the occasion of his sojourn in Dahomey, had an opportunity to witness the interest that he shows in African problems and his desire - which is markedly increasing -to act in such a way as to ensure that resolutions of the Organization on decolonization, racism, apartheid and racial discrimination are implemented in their entirety. For all of this, he deserves the congratulations and encouragement of the international community.\n103.\tMr. President, in your introductory statement [2233rd meeting] you very ably sketched the international problems confronting the Organization in the past and today, so there is no need for me to dwell on this. However, you will readily appreciate that the delegation which I am leading at this twenty-ninth session attaches special importance to certain items of capital importance to Africa in particular and for the countries of the Third World in general. These questions deal with the situation of the countries engaged in a struggle for their liberation from domination and foreign exploitation, problems of racism and apartheid, conflicts throughout the world and, of course, problems concerning development in the context of the new world economic order.\n104.\tFor several months now Africa has been the scene of one of the most striking events in its history: the beginning of the liquidation of the last bastions of colonialism. You are in a good position to realize this, Mr. President, because after secret negotiations carried out in London, the Partido Africano da Inde-pendencia da Guine e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) reached an agreement with its adversary that your country should be witness of the act whereby Portugal, finally awakened from its chimerical dreams, transferred powers it had usurped for more than 10 years, and more' particularly since last year, to Guinea-Bissau.\n105.\tIt will be recalled that on 24 September last, when the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly had barely begun its work, news reached us of the proclamation of the independence of the State of Guinea-Bissau. That historic act of an African people was welcomed by us with joy, because our sister State had finally won by struggle, with weapons in hand, and regained its dignity and international sovereignty. The valiant fighters of that sister State, by liberating at the price of unheard-of sacrifices almost all of its territory, by proclaiming the independence of Guinea-Bissau, thus took up the challenge which had been flung at fighting Africa and the peace-loving and justice-loving people of the whole world by the Fascist and anachronistic regime of Caetano and company. In doing so they had proved to the world that the course of history is irreversible and that just causes always triumph in the end, regardless of the obstacles placed in their path.\n106.\tThe striking and brilliant victory of progressive forces in Portugal a little later and the toppling of the Caetano clique in shame confirm our appraisal of this historic truth. But, one year ago, despite our legitimate and genuine joy, despite the striking manifestations of solidarity of peoples throughout the world who love peace and justice, our peoples in Africa were perplexed and pained at the hesitations and the shilly shallying of certain important Members of the Organization which still hesitated to look the truth in the face. Thank Heavens, we are able to recognize now that the wheel of history has turned more quickly than all the sordid calculations and highly selfish interests of those who had become accustomed to remaining insensitive to the sufferings and tribulations of oppressed peoples. That country which yesterday was refused de jure recognition is today sitting among us as a fully fledged member of the international community. Thus, it is with deep emotion that, on behalf of the Revolutionary Military Government and the people of Dahomey, I hail the representatives of this sister State which has suffered so much to gain its freedom.\n107.\tSince I have been given the opportunity, I should also like to welcome the sister republics of Grenada and Bangladesh, which have just joined the great family of the United Nations. Their arrival in our midst is clear evidence that, despite all obstacles, the Organization is proceeding irresistibly towards universality ; To each of these sister countries, I should like to assure the friendship and co-operation of Dahomey.\n108.\tTurning again to the African countries which are in the process of regaining their freedom, my delegation agrees that the task of our Assembly has been facilitated by the victory of the progressive forces in Portugal itself. The statement made by General Spinola on 27 July last, making public for the first time the firm determination of his Government to grant independence to its former Portuguese colonies, and the statements of Mr. Mario Soares, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the new Portugal, from this same rostrum [2239th meeting], constitute commitments which my Government takes at their face value.\n109.\tYes, the Revolutionary Military Government of Dahomey notes with sympathy the courageous choice taken by the new regime in Portugal henceforth to take the place which is rightfully theirs in the Organization and we encourage that Government to continue along those lines. But my delegation is in duty bounded say that it will not go further for the time being, and Africa should still not lay down its weapons at this stage of the struggle, for if, generally speaking, the progressive world applauded the initiative of the new Portuguese authorities, one cannot help feeling some uncertainty as to the future of the colonies that are now promised their freedom.\n110.\t.What is at stake is certainly complicated, and the imperialist and capitalist interests that are threatened are considerable. If in Portugal itself the progressive forces seem to have the upper hand for the moment, it is none the less true that the forces of evil in that country are still considerable and very active. Those who regret a past that is over and done with will not fail to cherish the illusion of new Portuguese Rhodesia. Certain great Powers will not wish to stand idly by while new nations emerge in strategic locations and endowed with a wealth of strategic resources. There is not the slightest shadow of a doubt that the racist minorities in South Africa and Rhodesia will not fail to take a negative view of the appearance of new black States on their doorsteps, and the active support they give the whites in Mozambique and Angola, who wish to sabotage the new policy of liberation embarked upon by Portugal, is in this connexion highly, significant.\n111.\tThat is why we in Dahomey think it is still too early to determine when the process of decolonization now being undertaken by the new Portuguese leaders will actually be completed. We cannot demobilize our troops yet; it is too early for us to cry victory while the threats hanging over our brothers are still so grave and their future still almost wholly uncertain. My country is grateful to the Portuguese authorities for their determination to liberate the colonized Territories, but we can do no more until Portugal has settled the political imbroglio and ended the suffering for which it is responsible in those countries. That is why we feel that now, more than ever before, the Organization should follow the development of the situation in southern Africa and hold itself in readiness to give material support to those countries, if their independence proves to be threatened.\n112.\tI wish now to speak of the two cancers afflicting Africa, with which that whole continent, and the United Nations itself, must cope. I refer to Rhodesia and South Africa.\n113.\tThe first continues to defy the Organization - with, of course, the complicity of the administering Power, which, despite its Pontius Pilate -like reactions, nevertheless bears the (entire responsibility for the situation created in that country , where a white minority deliberately chose to rebel against, the British Crown, stifling the will of an overwhelming black majority. The Organization is today entitled to ask of the United Kingdom how long it means to go on perpetuating such a situation despite the conclusions of the Pearce Commission's report.7 Is it not time for the rebel minority regime to be brought to reason and for the administering Power to cease taking refuge behind fallacious pretexts?\n114.\tThe case of South Africa also deserves rather close at trillion. Since its creation, our Organization he. continuously been concerned with the situation in South Africa, where apartheid has been made into a political philosophy of government. Everyone knows the lot of black people there, who are not even recognized as human beings. This intolerable and inadmissible situation, created by a Member of the Organization, has been the subject of many resolutions which the Pretoria regime has constantly refused to implement. Thus South Africa has placed itself beyond the pale of the Organization, which now has no choice but to assume its responsibilities. What is more, since 1970, our Assembly has continuously rejected the credentials of representatives of the apartheid Government because that Government is not an expression of the aspirations of the entire South African population, white and black. Nevertheless, legal quibbles have always led to the argument that the decisions of our Assembly are serious warnings addressed to the apartheid regime that it should change its policies and act in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.\n115.\tThat complacent interpretation, far from giving the minority Government of South Africa pause, has merely strengthened it in its inhuman policies based upon denial of the human dignity of black people. In the circumstances, it is impossible for our Assembly to remain indifferent to the defiance that a Member of the Organization constantly flings in our face. If we can still take refuge behind legal quibbles -and for certain of us such a refuge is at any rate highly convenient nevertheless intellectual honesty should make us ask ourselves what this \\\"Member\\\", which systematically refuses to apply either its Charter or its resolutions, is doing among us. Honesty and common sense yes, honesty and common sense alone should long ago have made us expel this, to say the least, peculiar Member. It is high time the Organization at last applied Article 6 of the Charter to excise this gangrenous growth from its body.\n116.\tMy delegation feels the time has come for our Assembly to take energetic measures against that Government. It is all the more important to do so because that Government, in defying the decisions of the Assembly that took from it the Trusteeship of Namibia and the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice declaring illegal the presence of South Africa in Namibia, sees fit to carry into that Territory which is henceforth under the authority of the United Nations Council for Namibia its policies of apartheid and bantustanization.\n117.\tFollowing the repeated efforts of the Secretary-General, under the instructions of the Security Council, to settle the problem amicably with the apartheid regime, and taking into account the obvious bad faith displayed by the South African Government, my delegation thinks that our Assembly Should Once again take up the problem of Namibia as a whole with a view to finding the urgent and immediate solution that is necessary. I need hardly emphasize that such a situation, should it long continue, might become a grave threat to international peace and security, if the Assembly does not give it all due attention in good time.\n118.\tEveryone here knows that the General Assembly was able to complete the work of its twenty-eighth session on 16 September last only because of the conflict that shook the Organization as a result of the resumption of hostilities last October in the Middle East. Thanks to the wisdom of the parties concerned, and above all because the super-Powers understood the danger to the world of the perpetuation of such a situation, a disengagement agreement was concluded, first between Egypt and Israel and then between Syria and Israel, thus for the time being averting any resumption of hostilities. Although it is not yet possible to say that all danger of war has been eliminated, the maneuvering of the great Powers in the region has clearly shown their standing concern to prove to the world that the controls are still in their hands.\n119.\tIt is indeed painful to note that, despite the many resolutions of the Organization, relative peace has prevailed in the Middle East only when th? superPowers have decided it should, thus demonstrating that, when they see fit to cease their rivalry, areas of conflict in the world can disappear once and for all. In these circumstances, and in view of these facts, which speak for themselves, how could we fail to hold them responsible for all the wars that periodically flare up here and there?\n120.\tIn the Middle East, the guns are now temporarily silent, but there is no guarantee that the fighting will not start again. It is therefore urgently necessary, first of all, that Israel withdraw from all occupied Arab territories and, secondly, that, rather than freezing the situation, those principally responsible and those actually involved should find a formula that will make possible an early resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East with a view to restoring a just and lasting peace in the region. It is the interests of the peoples of that area that are at stake. It is the interests of the international community too that are at stake, to the extent that that Conference will help safeguard peace and security in the Middle East.\n121.\tBut if a just and lasting peace is to be restored to that part of the world, my delegation feels that it must not be at the expense of the aspirations of the Palestinian people; for that people, deprived of its land and reduced to a nomadic existence, and whose national identity has been completely flouted, also has the right to a homeland. That is why my country has supported the inclusion in the Assembly's agenda of the item entitled \\\"Question of Palestine\\\" [item 108}. Indeed, the time has come for us to stop deceiving ourselves; we must insist on speaking the language of truth. The parties concerned must come before us and tell us their thoughts so that the delegations here may determine their attitudes advisedly. It is at that price, and at that price alone, that the Geneva Peace Conference can be moved off dead-center and that the Organization can make a positive contribution that will help spare the Middle East a further flare-up of violence.\n122.\tWhat I was saying a moment ago about the attitude of the super-Powers is further illustrated in the conflict that flared up between Iraq and Iran. One had only to listen to the statements of the representatives of the parties to the dispute before the Security Council and to recall the inability of that organ to any decision to realize that a situation had arisen\nfor which the two countries were not really responsible. And yet there were casualties on both sides. Thanks to the efforts of the mediator sent by the Secretary-General, a solution was found which, for the moment, appears to rule out any possibility of a resumption of hostilities, provided, of course, that lose truly responsible so wish and that the peoples of those countries understand that it is not in their interest to continue killing each other.\n123.\tIn Cyprus, the situation created by hot-heads remote-controlled from one knows not where was obviously intended to discredit the Organization, to the extent that it nearly shook its institutions. Those unfamiliar with international politics might find it at least incomprehensible, if not inadmissible, that right under the very nose of the United Nations force, whose mission was to watch over peace between the two communities and to protect constitutional legality, a coup d'etat should have taken place without that force being able to come to the assistance of the constitutionally elected head of government, Archbishop Makarios. But if one bears in mind \\\"the limits of the Organization and the more-or-less openly avowed determination of the super-Powers to demonstrate their hegemonic strength, one will easily understand the political and strategic motives that impelled the instigators of the coup to jeopardize the very existence of that sovereign State and Member of the Organization.\n124.\tIn acting so lightly, those remote-controlled foreign forces which have underlain the Cypriot tragedy since 15 July demonstrated a very shortsighted view, in that their acts have fostered the division of the island into two distinct communities and have seriously jeopardized constitutional law and the self-determination of the Cypriot people.\n125.\tFor the super-Powers this has been a fine opportunity for mutual outbidding. If they had at least taken the trouble to think first and foremost of the sufferings of the displaced populations before waging war, that would have been easier to understand. If they had left it to the competent authorities of the Organization in this particular case, the Security Council to settle the problem in fairness and justice, we would not be where we are today. But all that matters to them is their interests and their rivalries. My delegation feels, however, that despite the reservations raised by the interference of the great Powers in this matter, the proposal, supported by my Government, that there be an international conference attended by members of the Security Council, the parties concerned and the non-aligned States should be given close attention. This solution is not ideal but is nevertheless one way of seeking to restore peace and constitutionality to that tormented island.\n126.\tIn the IndoChina peninsula the situation remains tense; international peace and security continue to be sorely tried. Thus in Viet Nam, after the international community learned with relief of the conclusion of the Paris Agreement, which was supposed to lead that country towards peace by making possible the establishment of a democratic regime, war continues because a clique in foreign pay has been unwilling to respect the terms of that Agreement.\n127.\tIn Korea, the fact that the Truce Commission scuttled itself following contacts between South and North made it easier for the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to adopt a consensus text.9 By that consensus the Assembly invited the two parties to continue their dialog with a view to finding a solution enabling them to reach their objective of peaceful and democratic unification. Unfortunately, since the last session no progress has been made in the direction desired by the General Assembly. The main cause of this situation lies in the presence of foreign forces based on the territory of one of the parties. When we realize that that so-called United Nations force; which was once composed of troops from a number of countries, now consists solely of troops from one country, it can easily be understood that the decision of the Organization in setting up that force is no longer in effect and that the last bastion of the so-called United Nations force should also leave Korea. In any event, if a force is to take refuge under the United Nations flag, it can only be with the consent of the parties concerned. In other words, if one of the parties calls into question the existence of that force, the Assembly must take measures enabling the withdrawal of the so-called United Nations forces from Korea in order to ease contacts between the two parties. And we must do everything possible to avoid jeopardizing the reunification desired by the two parties.\n128.\tIn Cambodia, an intolerable situation continues, enabling a clique which actually represents nothing to continue to claim to speak on behalf of the Khmer people and to occupy Cambodia's seat in the General Assembly. It is now time for the Assembly to Clarify its position, which, in any event, must be one of seeking the restoration of the rights of the Royal Government of National Union, which is still headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, whose forces still control almost all of Cambodian territory. The Assembly must render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and exclude the representatives of the Lon Nol clique.\n129.\tOne corollary of the persistence of zones of tension is the proliferation of weapons and the need of the industrialized countries to find outlets for their arms industries. My delegation thinks that we should denounce that competition in the sale of weapons which is taking place all over the world now following the energy crisis. If my country unreservedly supported the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it nevertheless feels that if those weapons were not such as to endanger the very existence of the countries possessing them, the Organization would never have taken up the problem and sought to limit their scope. It is thus hypocritical frantically to seek for a limitation of weapons which can upset the tranquility and the development of the great Powers while doing nothing to reduce the manufacture of conventional weapons or the sale of those weapons to others, encouraging them to seek confrontation among themselves.\n130.\tIf the Assembly followed my train <of thought it will have noticed that everywhere international peace and security are sorely tried and that wherever this is the case one can see the hand of one or both super-Powers and that they stop at nothing when it comes to exercising their power and sabotaging the efforts of the Organization for international peace and security. The question therefore arises, if the situation continues, whether all the members constituting the Assembly will continue to allow the Organization to be weakened at the behest of the super-Powers.\n131.\tMy delegation thinks that times have changed since the San Francisco Conference, which was essentially concerned with dividing up the world into hegemonic zones. The best proof is that from the some 50 Members which then constituted the United Nations, the Assembly today is composed of 138 equal Members. This is a reality which cannot long remain ignored. The balance of forces has changed and the .text that governs the Organization must be adapted to this new situation. Accordingly, my delegation unreservedly will support any initiative to that effect which would seek to restore justice and equity in the Organization. A thorough-going revision of the Charter is necessary. Some interests will certainly be encroached upon. But the overwhelming majority of the Assembly will agree because it is in the interests of the United Nations and of its credibility.\n132.\tWhile a double standard may have been understandable in 1946, it no longer reflects the reality of 1974, and it would be a grave mistake to go on perpetuating it.\n133.\tBefore concluding I cannot forbear to speak of a problem which is of the utmost concern to my country and to the international community: the economic crisis through which the world is now passing.\n134.\tThe international economic situation in recent years has been marked by a series of crises: a crisis of the international monetary system, with galloping inflation and rising prices, the food crisis, and the threat of famine in some parts of the world where food shortages are creating a critical situation. The picture would not be complete if we did not add to all the foregoing the ravages caused by the consequences of natural disasters such as drought, floods and cyclones.\n135.\tThe case of Honduras, where thousands of people have just die**, their homes destroyed and their fields laid waste, is an illustration of the scourges which are visited periodically on the world. I should like to take this opportunity of asking the delegation of Honduras to accept the expression of the deepest sympathy of the delegation of Dahomey.\n136.\tOur community has addressed, itself with peculiar felicity to the problems raised by these various crises. The Committee of 20,40 despite the complexity of the question, is seeking solutions with a view to improving our international monetary system. Other specialized agencies, like FAO and WHO, are doing their best to counter the depredations of malnutrition, famine and disease.\n137.\tPanic provoked by the difficulties of the world economy has led certain countries to seek ways and means of stemming the crisis, if necessary through protectionist and restrictive means, the consequence of which would be to block the expansion of international trade. For our part, in the developing countries, impoverished by the shameless exploitation of our national wealth by th<? colonial Powers and the great international trusts, our situation is unspeakably tragic. The economic crisis Which is raging all over the world strikes us doubly hard since it adds to the injustice we have always and everywhere denounced.\n138.\tIt is not really right that we should continue, without reacting, to be refused free access to the markets of the wealthy countries. It is not right that we should always be the only ones to pay the cost of the implacable law of supply and demand. It is not right that we should always have suffered and go on suffering from the perpetual worsening in the terms of trade. It is not right that our already fragile economies should always suffer the limitations of chronic under-equipment. It is not right that we should continue to support without any assistance the burden of external debt and debt-servicing which considerably reduces our capacity to finance development projects, whereas our creditors continue to extract the maximum exploitation from our resources. It is not right that we should continue to suffer so much injustice and so much discrimination in regard to freight, insurance and other matters at the hands of the big companies that govern the world markets.\n139.\tThe legitimate actions of the petroleum-producing countries in imposing fair prices for their product provoked the fiercest opposition from the industrialized countries, which were all too quick to speak of crisis while actually throwing on to the developing countries the weight of the effects of the rise in the price of energy and the cost of capital goods of which we had urgent need. Indeed, some of these industrialized Powers do not hesitate to make threats rather than seeking a solution in more realistic terms, namely, that of the economic interdependence of great and small and of the need for a just and equitable remuneration for the products and the labor of each and all.\n140.\tOur international community, aware of the necessary interaction between politics and economics, and its role in the maintenance or non-maintenance of world peace, has convened various meetings attended by all countries with a view to finding ways of remedying so many injustices from which the poor countries suffer, and to harmonizing, for the greater good of mankind, economic relations between the various States in order to bridge or reduce the gap between rich and poor countries. But the failure of the first three sessions of UNCTAD and the near failure of the First United Nations Development Decade have shown the Third World countries clearly that it is the selfish interests which alone prevail in the wealthy countries.\n141.\tAs we approach the end of the first half of the Second United Nations Development Decade, the successive crises -monetary crisis, food crisis and so forth- and the imperialist measures of a protectionist and restrictive nature undertaken by the rich countries have deeply disturbed the pattern of international economic relations.\n142.\tThere can be no doubt that the position is very disturbing indeed for the 25 least developed countries, including Dahomey. Hence, it has seemed to us that if no measures are taken for their effective application, the recommendations of international conferences designed to improve our countries' prospects for development recommendations that often have had little effect will be no more than mere palliatives that will be quickly offset by the deleterious consequences of crises which upset international trading relations and of which we are the main victims.\n143.\tThat dramatic situation with which we are faced has further strengthened our bonds of co-operation and our faith in the policy of agreeing on a thorough study of the political, economic and social problems confronting us, having regard to the structure of international economic relations dominated by the industrialized countries. We are deeply convinced that no lasting solution to our difficulties can be found unless this structure of international economic relations based on a balance of force unfavorable to the development of the poor countries is called into question.\n144.\tThat situation, which certain industrialized countries had already,-described as intolerable, was bound to give rise to tension and confrontation if the international community did not seriously tackle it in time. That was clearly understood, Mr. President, by your Head of State, President Houari Boumediene, when on behalf of the non-aligned countries he proposed the convening of the sixth special session of the Assembly, on raw materials and development. That special session, held here in April and May this year, drawing lessons from the various crises, particularly the petroleum crisis, that had strikingly demonstrated the interdependence of our economies, had the merit of clearly and precisely defining the roles that should henceforth govern economic relations between rich and poor countries, through the establishment of a Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n145.\tFor the first time in the history of international economic relations, the rich countries recognized the existence of a basic problem requiring immediate solution. No matter what reservations may be expressed, they detract in no way from the problem of substance, which requires an urgent response from our community in the clearly understood interests of all.\n146.\tFor our part, we in Dahomey believe that the main problem is henceforward as clear as day. What we must do is replace the old international economic order, which has been based on the balance of force and domination, by a new international economic order taking into account, among other things, the interdependence of our respective economies, respect for the sovereignty of every State, the necessary solidarity between the various nations of our international community , and assistance by the richer to the poorer, without any discrimination between the socio-economic systems freely chosen by the latter. For the development of the developing countries' resources to satisfy the needs of their masses and of the peoples of other countries adds to the wealth of the world and to the progress of mankind.\n147.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, whose second session has just finished at Caracas, has brought home the need to establish a new international legal order governing the ocean spaces. The new law of the sea now being drafted must take into account first and foremost the interests of the developing countries. It must therefore be a fundamental element in the creation of new forms of international co-operation.\n148.\tDahomey, aware of its interests in that sphere, agrees with many other countries that the requirements of economic growth and national security make it necessary that the coastal States have a national\noceanic zone that is as broad as possible. That is why it firmly supports the logical and very coherent notion that a State's territorial waters should be extended to a maximum of 200 nautical miles, thus , assimilating the exclusive economic zone to the territorial sea. It goes without saying that in its national oceanic space the coastal State would exercise full jurisdiction and full sovereignty. However, in addition to accepting the traditional obligations, it would agree to guarantee to its landlocked neighbors the right of access to the sea and the right of free transit under bilateral or regional agreements.\n149. That idea, which offers the best protection for the interests of the underdeveloped countries with regard to the law of the sea, is based on the physical and legal unity of the zone in question, from the standpoint of its size, of the intermediate column of water, of the seabed and the subsoil, and of the corresponding resources.\n150. With regard to the regime for the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, the delegation of Dahomey believes that the international authority to be established should be endowed with extensive\npowers in connexion with not only the exploitation and exploration but also the sale of the resources, in order to prevent a decline in the prices of the minerals from the deposits on dry land, and in particular of those produced by the developing countries. In any event, exploitation of the international zone must not be entrusted to multinational corporations on the unconvincing pretext that the international authority does not have the required technical and financial means a formula that would betray the concept of the common heritage of mankind. The industrialized countries that already have the means necessary to undertake the exploration and exploitation of the re-sources of the international zone can demonstrate their willingness to co-operate by placing themselves at the disposal of the authority until it is financially\ncapable of acquiring those means itself. \n151. Those were the various agenda items on which my delegation wished to .share its thoughts as the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly begins\nits work. While the Organization can take some pride in the fortunate outcome of some of the burning problems that had been before it recently, we must note with some bitterness that most of those problems have been solved virtually outside the United Nations.\nThe changes in Portugal and the progress achieved in colonial matters seem to have been less the result of positions we have taken or recommendations we\nhave adopted than the normal outcome of the struggles and sacrifices by the peoples concerned. \n152. At the very most, our support-often very timid support-for the liberation movements may have helped to galvanize the energies of the freedom-\nfighters. Today more than ever before it has become essential that we should pause for thought, should seek the causes of the paralysis and impotence of the Organization in respect of the tragedies confronting mankind. We can no longer wait to see the dead bury their dead'.\n153. The same problems arise in connexion with economic relations among nations at different levels of development. Our endless recommendations for a more just balance in the distribution of the planet's goods and resources all too often remain dead letters. The wealthy nations will move only when their interests are threatened or when we confront them with the only weapon available to us: the price of our raw materials. In other words, the rule of might continues to be the supreme rule. But we must take care that poetic justice does not lead to a state of affairs in which those who are the strongest today become the weakest tomorrow and the law of the jungle turns out to be the only law suited to our ways and our thinking.\n154.\tNo, it seems to me that the raison d'etre of the Organization is precisely to avoid such a state of affairs. Let us therefore so act that this precious instrumentality of the United Nations may truly serve the cause of justice and peace in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honor and a privilege for me to convey to the President and to the representatives assembled here the greetings of my Sovereign, His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Deva, and his best wishes for the success of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\n2.\tI should like to convey to the President, on behalf of my delegation, our sincere congratulations on his election to the high office of President of this session of the General Assembly. We are familiar with his distinguished public career and the high reputation he has gained in his own country as well as in the international sphere. We are confident that under his able and wise guidance it will be possible for the work at this session to contribute towards the solution of some of the basic problems at present facing us. My delegation wishes to assure him of its full cooperation and support in the discharge of his heavy responsibility.\n3.\tI should like also to take this opportunity of expressing our deep appreciation of the exemplary services rendered by the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who carried out successfully the task entrusted to him in a year which was one of the most challenging of our time from both the economic and the political points of view.\n4.\tThis year witnessed a most serious economic crisis which threatened the existing economic order of the world. But, at the same time, this has also been a year characterized by the numerous international initiatives taken and efforts made by various countries of the world and by the United Nations itself towards the solution of the outstanding socioeconomic and political problems of our time. The most important among these was the special session of the General Assembly convened to study for the first time the problems of raw materials and development and devoted to the consideration of the most important economic problems facing the world community. Therefore, in spite of the discouraging economic threat looming over the world today, we are confident that with cooperation and understanding among ourselves and on the initiative of this world body we can work out internationally acceptable solutions to all the problems facing us. It is with this hope and in this optimism that we have come to the United Nations this year.\n5.\tRemarkable progress is being made in the improvement of the international political climate. The policy of detente has continued to be the main feature in international relations and has helped to bring not only a relaxation of tensions but also closer cooperation between the major Powers. The agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States of America in the scientific, technological and industrial domains and on the limitation of strategic weapons and underground nuclear tests reached during the last visit of the former United States President, Mr. Nixon, to the Soviet Union are undoubtedly positive steps towards the promotion of world peace.\n6.\tThe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe being held in Geneva also showed that there is strong determination among the European Powers to resolve, their differences and bring about increased cooperation among themselves. This is in itself a positive trend towards lasting detente in Europe in particular and world peace in general.\n7.\tSince it has contributed greatly to the relaxation of world tension, the increased cooperation between China and the United States and between China and Japan, is receiving ever growing support.\n8.\tIn the Middle East, thanks to the untiring efforts and great negotiating skill of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Henry Kissinger, a disengagement agreement between Syria and Israel, which constituted one of the most difficult tasks of our time, has been achieved. Mr. Kissinger not only brought together two parties which had never met before except on the battlefield but also devised a breakthrough which may be the beginning of a new era of peace in that area. This, together with the disengagement agreement reached between Egypt and Israel, will, we hope, clear the way for further negotiations between the Arabs and the Israelis for the final settlement of the problem.\n9.\tIn cite of these favorable trends in ArabIsraeli relations, the prospect of peace in the Middle East is still far off. We believe that no permanent solution of the Middle East problem is possible until the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are properly and justly settled.\n10.\tNepal, as a peace loving nation, has always been in favor of a peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem and has supported all such moves as were aimed at bringing about a peaceful and permanent solution of the problem. We have always supported the various resolutions of the Security Council designed to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem. The practical solution is laid down, we believe, in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The full and speedy implementation of that resolution is expected to bring about a lasting peace in the region.\n11.\tWe readily responded to the request of the United Nations to participate in the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East by sending a contingent of the Royal Nepalese Army to the spot. It is satisfying for us to learn that that contingent of the Nepalese Army, as on past occasions, has fulfilled its duties in a most disciplined way and has proved its worth. We are also glad that we have been able to contribute, in whatever humble way we could, towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region.\n12.\tIn the SouthEast Asian region a few tense situations that persist have been the source of permanent disturbance to the peace and security of the area. Though the fighting in Viet Nam has come to an end, the problem is still unresolved. My delegation is of the opinion that the Paris peace Agreement should be implemented to the full so that peace and harmony in the area may be speedily restored.\n13.\tThe restoration of permanent peace in the SouthEast Asian region will not be possible unless the Korean question is solved to the satisfaction of both the Koreas. The decision of the last General Assembly which brought about the dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea was a positive step in that direction. My delegation will support all such moves that may contribute towards the creation of favorable conditions for the acceleration of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\n14.\tThe recent disturbances in Cyprus are deplorable not only because they caused a serious disruption of peace in the island but also because they brought heavy suffering to the innocent people there. We welcome any initiatives from within or from outside the United Nations which are aimed at establishing a normal situation on the island. My country appreciates the personal initiative taken by the Secretary General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in making an on the spot assessment of the situation and in the consultations he had with the leaders of the parties in conflict. We are of the conviction that there should be no threat to the territorial integrity of Cyprus and that it should continue to remain as independent and sovereign a nonaligned country as ever.\n15.\tLi spite of all these disturbances, the most satisfying trend in recent international relations has been the relaxation of tension. The settlement of conflicts in many regions of the world by peaceful means will undoubtedly create an atmosphere of confidence and trust between nations and will help to create conditions favorable to international peace and security. This positive trend in international relations should be complemented by other international actions that can promote rapid economic progress and development, the most basic and urgent need of our time. More concrete international measures should be taken to halt the arms race, which is not only the cause of perpetual fear and distrust among nations but also the main factor responsible for economic retardation.\n16.\tThere have been many encouraging developments in the field of disarmament in recent years, but the progress achieved so far is inadequate. The arms buildup is increasing alarmingly and vast riches that could have been used for the promotion of peace and the welfare of mankind are being drained by the production of destructive weapon^ We are of the opinion that the growing tendency among the developing countries and others on the threshold of development to rapidly obtain possession of nuclear power is dangerous not only because it seriously disrupts international peace but also because it retards the economic development of the world. It is for this reason that we oppose all proliferation of nuclear power and the consequent nuclear tests carried out underground or under water, in the atmosphere or in outer space.\n17.\tAs a peace loving nation Nepal wants to remain at peace and is, therefore, especially interested in seeing peace restored in the South Asian region, to which it belongs. With this in view, we have supported all moves towards the normalization of relations between Pakistan and India and also welcome the resumption of talks between them. Our support of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) regarding the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace is motivated by this desire. We shall willingly support any such future moves that lead to the restoration of perpetual peace in the area.\n18.\tIt is only through general and complete disarmament that international peace and security, which is one of the main objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, can be achieved. We believe, therefore, that it is more urgent than ever before that positive consideration should be given to the convening of a world disarmament conference in which all nations, whether big or small, developed or developing, nuclear or nonnuclear including the divided ones could participate and deliberate on ways and means to achieve this sacred goal.\n19.\tWe are indeed very happy to welcome the People's Republic of Bangladesh among us as a new Member of this august body.' The Republic of Bangladesh is one of our neighboring countries with which we have the most intimate friendly relations. We supported its admission to this Organization from the very beginning and we are now happy to see this realized. We are confident that Bangladesh, by its participation in the various deliberations of the United Nations, will contribute to our common endeavor in the promotion of world peace. We should also like to express our deep satisfaction at the admission of Grenada to this world Organization. We are also happy to welcome the Republic of GuineaBissau in this family of nations as a sovereign and independent country. The emergence of GuineaBissau as a sovereign independent nation is an example of the decline of colonialism in the world. We hope that the Republic of GuineaBissau will add to the strength of the Organization in effectively dealing with the problem of decolonization and swiftly bringing salvation to the peoples suffering under the tyrannical yoke of some colonial regimes and will thus contribute to the promotion of world peace.\n20.\tThis year, there have been some positive developments in the field of decolonization. The new Government in Portugal has recognized the Republic of GuineaBissau as an independent and sovereign country and has at the same time shown interest in entering into negotiations with various liberation movements. The independence of Mozambique is also already in sight, and it is gratifying to know that that country will emerge as a new independent nation in a year's time. We heartily welcome the establishment of a provisional government in Mozambique. The present policy of the Government of Portugal of granting independence to its colonies is highly praiseworthy. We only hope that the decolonization of all Territories under colonial rule and an immediate end to all the sufferings of colonial peoples, which have long been a matter of serious concern to all of us, can be achieved as speedily and as urgently as possible. We should also like to see Mozambique and Angola as Members of this august body in the near future.\n21.\tThe active participation of my country and its contributions to various international efforts to eliminate colonial domination and racial discrimination are well known to all representatives here.\n22.\tThe worst form of colonial oppression is being adamantly practiced by the racist Governments of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, in total disregard of world public opinion. In South Africa, the colonial people remain condemned to all forms of torture and repression. The Government of South Africa has been stubbornly denying fundamental human rights to its people and has been making a mockery of all United Nations decisions, including those of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and of the United Nations Council for Namibia.\n23.\tThe South African Government has not only continued forcibly and illegally to occupy the international Territory of Namibia against the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice but has also practiced a most inhuman policy of apartheid in exploiting and repressing the indigenous people there. We strongly condemn all these acts of barbarism on the part of the Government of South Africa, which are an affront to humanity and civilized behavior.\n24.\tThe minority Government of Southern Rhodesia has also continued to consolidate its racist regime and to repress the liberation movements of its people by all inhuman and criminal means of collective punishment. It has denied the people of Zimbabwe the right to self-determination, freedom and independence, in defiance of all United Nations decisions. That illegal racist regime has sufficient moral and material backing from its major trading partners, who cooperate with and maintain it for their own selfish economic interests, thereby impeding the effective application of sanctions imposed by the Security Council against the regime. We are of the view that all Member countries should unite and consolidate their efforts to bring this deplorable situation to an end. We believe that the recently adopted International Convention on the\nSuppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII), annex] will be helpful in eliminating this form of racial discrimination and request all Member States to sign or accede to this Convention without delay.\n25.\tThe necessity for international cooperation has become urgent not only for the maintenance of political security and international peace but also for the solution of many of the social and economic problems of our time. The growing trend among nations in trying to solve, through peaceful consultations and understandings, global problems concerning the environment, population, food, the seabed and outer space is a very positive one. It is the more so when new and legitimate solutions to all these problems are being sought within a universal institution such as the United Nations, where every nation, big or small, developed or developing, has equal say.\n26.\tNepal has been participating with keen interest in all these United Nations activities. More recently, Nepal actively participated in the deliberations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas. Though the Conference could not fully achieve its objective of producing a single agreed convention, the progress achieved in such an important area, progress which involved the varied and conflicting interests of nations, was undoubtedly noteworthy. We are of the opinion that we should give careful consideration to the rights and interests of all the groups of countries, instead of concluding a hasty convention that might leave room for future disputes on such a vital area affecting the common interest of mankind.\n27.\tNepal, together with other landlocked and geographically disadvantaged countries, has made its viewpoint sufficiently clear on the main questions affecting its interests in relation to the sea and its resources. The foremost interest of all landlocked countries, including Nepal, is the international recognition of their rights to free and unrestricted access to and from the sea. This is a prerequisite for the promotion and diversification of the trade and economic development of a landlocked country. Provisions for the right of transit through coastal countries and for port facilities, including the construction and maintenance of warehouses at the port to provide storage for goods in transit and facilities for the transport of goods, are the matters of vital importance for the landlocked countries which should find accommodation in the convention on the law of the sea.\n28.\tWe are against any attempt to annex the economic zones to the territorial seas of the coastal countries and to establish exclusive rights over such zones. The arbitrary limit of the economic zone at 200 miles lacks justification, and there is no reason why such a vast area should be occupied exclusively by coastal countries, in this way reducing the area of the common heritage of mankind to a meaningless concept. We do not mean, however, that we are opposed to the creation of an economic zone as such. But as the zone would be created for safeguarding the interests of the developing countries against the unscrupulous exploitation of the area and its resources by countries with advanced scientific and technological means, we are of the opinion that it should be under the common jurisdiction of all neighboring States, whether coastal or landlocked. All States should have a due share in the resources of the sea, whether living or inanimate. And all States which exercise jurisdiction over the zone should also share responsibilities as well as duties.\n29.\tAnother important international problem which confronts mankind today and in which the United Nations is deeply involved is the explosive increase of population and the growing worldwide shortage of food. The World Population Conference, held in Bucharest in August, and the forthcoming World Food Conference, to be held in Rome in November, are the other two major activities of the United Nations this year. Though these problems seem to be separate, they are very much related to one another. They should be examined together with other interrelated problems like the threat to the environment, the rapid depletion of resources and the need of accelerated economic growth. We very much welcome the World Population Plan of Action adopted by the Bucharest Conference.3\n30.\tNepal is one of the densely populated countries, with 79 persons per square kilometer, which is three times higher than the world average of 27 persons. With a fate of population growth of more than 2 per cent on the average, the population increase, which is expected to be doubled in 30 years, is already putting strains on the agricultural production. Per capita agricultural production is declining and if this trend continues, the cereals, especially food grains, which account for the exportable surplus of Nepal, will be a scarce commodity in a few years time.\n31.\tThis, with the recent problems posed by the rising prices of fertilizer and other inputs, together with their scarcity, has been adversely affecting the economic development of my country. His Majesty's Government is aware of the urgent need to work out a comprehensive plan to face any future difficulties that these trends may bring to the economy. We therefore greatly value the world conferences on such vital questions as population and food, and see that these international initiatives may bring forth practical and urgent measures for effectively combating these problems looming over the future of mankind.\n32.\tAll these initiatives taken and efforts made by the United Nations, and those effected by all other countries of the world on their own, will not bear fruitful results until the widening gap of economic disparity between the developed and developing countries is narrowed.\n33.\tFrom the economic point of view the year has been very disappointing. If the continuously rising inflationary trend has become the common unavoidable feature of the world economy, on the one hand, the wide gap of economic disparity between the developed and developing nations is becoming even wider in an alarming way. Though the exporting countries benefit from the rise in prices of their products, the least developed and landlocked countries, like Nepal, which have practically nothing to trade off against the rising cost of both raw materials and manufactured goods, have become the most severely affected countries.\n34.\tThe impact of the deteriorating economic situation, aggravated by the energy crisis, was so severe on these hardcore poverty stricken countries that the objective of achieving an accelerated rate of growth, as envisaged in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] has not only become unattainable, but the question of maintaining the present rate of growth is becoming a matter of serious concern. As we are approaching the midterm appraisal of the Second United Nations Development Decade, the goals of the Strategy appear to be more and more remote. The recent problem of scarcity of essential and other basic goods has been added to the problem of rising prices. The developed countries have been reluctant to help in the accelerated development of the developing countries of the eliminate the gap of economic disparity. The contributions of 1 per cent of national incomes have not been forthcoming, and the transfer of technology and of its benefits to the developing countries has been purely fictional.\n35.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly was convened against this background of the deteriorating economic situation, further aggravated by the energy crisis. The session was able to convince the world that the present international economic order is in direct conflict with the current development in international political and economic relations, and it therefore approved the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 320 (SVI)] under which future economic relations among nations will be based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence and cooperation. The most important achievement of the special session, in our view, is the full realization that the political, social and economic wellbeing of present and future generations depends more than ever on cooperation between the developed and the developing countries, and that the interests of these two groups of countries are closely interdependent.\n36.\tThe adoption of emergency relief measures by the United Nations to mitigate the difficulties of the developing countries severely affected by the economic crisis was one of the very encouraging decisions of the session. We believe that the contributions made so far to the Special Fund established by resolution 3202 (SVI) are significant, though not sufficient for effectively meeting the economic hardships of the seriously affected developing countries. We hope that further contributions will be forthcoming from all potential donor countries for this purpose.\n37.\tNepal, as a least developed and landlocked country, faces many economic woes different from, and more serious than, those faced by other developing countries. Our level of economic development is so low and our exportable surplus so minimal and uncertain that our economy can neither benefit from the rising prices of primary goods nor sustain the burden of the rising cost of imports.\n38.\tNepal is basically a mountainous country with a difficult transportation problem, which has been the most serious bottleneck in our economic development for many years. We are still building our infrastructure, and our economic growth has been almost stagnant. Our industries are few and medium sized, and are hardly capable of producing export earnings. Our agricultural production is showing a declining trend due to want of fertilizer and the increasing pressure of population growth.\n39.\tIn spite of all these adverse economic realities typical of least developed and landlocked countries, Nepal is seriously endeavoring to emerge from this economic stagnation by embarking upon all round economic development, under the inspiring and zealous leadership of my Sovereign, His Majesty the King.\n40.\tThe recent economic crisis has brought about a serious disruption in the process of our development. The rising prices of basic commodities necessary for our development purposes, such as fertilizer, petroleum products and other development materials, coupled with the problem of their growing scarcity, have aggravated the situation. In the absence of dependable export earnings it has become extremely difficult to meet the increased cost of imports of both raw materials and manufactured goods resulting from the adverse terms of trade. This has also increased the possibility of a rapid depletion of the meager foreign exchange reserves. To all these, the landlocked character of the country in itself is an additional burden because it increases the cost of transport and makes development more expensive. So it is due to these specific problems that a least developed country which is also a landlocked country needs special attention and increased assistance for its economic development.\n41.\tWe are very much encouraged by the particular consideration the General Assembly at its sixth special session accorded the seriousness of the problems faced by the least developed and landlocked countries of the world in adopting both special measures and the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. As a least developed and landlocked country, we are naturally very eager to see that due consideration is given to such countries in providing the emergency relief measures provided for in the Special Program of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (SVI)]. We all know that without first improving the economic conditions of the least developed and landlocked countries of the world the hard core of the developing countries, as they are the objectives of the new economic order envisaged will not be realized.\n42.\tWe are of the view that the Special Program and the Program of Action should also be so designed that they complement and further strengthen the goals and objectives of* the International Development Strategy as well as the new measures formulated by the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to offset the shortfall in achieving those goals and objectives so that the steadily accelerating economic development of the developing countries, especially the least developed ones, can be urgently stimulated.\n43.\tIn conclusion, I should like to point out that the world of today has become so interdependent that no problem can be confined to national boundaries or tackled effectively by national efforts alone. We are convinced that we need an effective multinational channel through which all global problems on a wide range of human activities can be properly dealt with. Such a channel could, no doubt, be the United Nations, for this could for many years to come be the only conceivable world body in which all independent sovereign nations could work collectively, without losing their individual identities, for the common goals of mankind. It could be made an effective instrument for the international peace and security so vital to the socioeconomic and political development of the world. I want to recall here the feeling expressed by our beloved and long remembered King, the late King Mahendra, on the importance of this august body, when he said, \\\"The only real alternative to the United Nations is an even more powerful United Nations\\\", which amply demonstrates the faith the Nepalese people has in the United Nations and in its ideals.\n"

        "file_text": "I am particularly pleased at this time to extend to you, Mr. President, on behalf of the Government of Liberia, heartiest congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. You have for many years demonstrated astute statesmanship and unwavering dedication not only to the cause of international peace and global understanding but also to our common world Organization, the United Nations, in your capacity as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. Please accept our very best wishes and be assured of our fullest co-operation as you discharge the grave and historic responsibility of guiding the important work of this twenty-ninth session.\n33.\tI should like also to express our most genuine appreciation to your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador, who presided with calm and wisdom over the work both of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly and of the historic sixth special session.\n34.\tSignificantly, a little more than one year ago, on 24 September 1973, the courageous people of Guinea-Bissau declared the independence and sovereignty of their country, having liberated the greater part of their national territory. Today they have won the battle which, against great odds, they had fought to consolidate their independence and to free every inch of their land from the grasp of an oppressive colonialism. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau has now been accented- as a State Member of the United Nations. Liberia once again whole-heartedly welcomes this sister African State into this world forum and celebrates with it the hard-won freedom of its people to enjoy self-determination and national independence after so many years of difficult and self-sacrificing struggle.\n35.\tMore than 127 years ago, on 26 July 1847, the people of the Republic of Liberia declared their national independence. Since that time, moved by the most remarkable determination, they have preserved the independence of Liberia despite numerous threats and acts of aggression by foreign Powers, to which an independent African State was completely unacceptable. They endured that, as well as the taunts, insults and falsehoods, all deliberately designed to discredit Liberia in an attempt to prove that Africans were incapable of self-government. Because of that historical experience, Liberia attaches the greatest importance to the struggle against colonialism and minority rule anywhere, but most particularly on the African continent. It was the Liberian Government, through its representative on the Security Council, which, on 15 February 1961, first brought to the attention of the Organization the deplorable situation in the Portuguese Territories.2 We are therefore particularly gratified that, the Republic of Guinea- Bissau having entered our midst as a Member of the United Nations, we can anticipate with pleasure both the independence of Mozambique and its entry into the Organization within the next year.\n36.\tWe feel certain that the Portuguese Government, consistent with the progressive attitude and good faith it has already demonstrated, will continue with even greater intensity its efforts designed to arrive at an acceptable arrangement with the African nationalists in Angola so that that Territory may, within the shortest possible time, enjoy the right of self-determination, independence and sovereignty.\n37.\tThe decision taken by the Government of Portugal to bring to a close many centuries of Portuguese colonial domination in Africa represents primarily a victory for those valiant freedom fighters who, in Guinea-Bissau, in Mozambique and in Angola, have never wavered in their determination to attain national independence and forge their own national destinies. It represents also a victory for the people of Portugal themselves, for it frees them from the burden of waging what the Foreign Minister of Portugal has referred to as \\\"a long, useless war\\\" [2239th meeting, para. 102], so costly in precious human lives. It has also gained for Portugal a respected place in the world community.\n38.\tThat frame of mind which welcomed and sup-ported the most blatant exploitation of one people by another, which created colonialism and continues to feed apartheid and other systems based on racial prejudice, must give way entirely to the demands of a new age. The peoples of Africa still subjected to such exploitation and discriminatory treatment are determined to be free, to enjoy human dignity and to take their rightful place in the life of their respective countries and of our world. That will cannot be defeated. We have embarked upon a path from which there can be no turning back. Apartheid and alien minority rule, whether in Zimbabwe, Namibia or South Africa itself, cannot long survive. The torch of freedom has reached the very doorsteps of the most evil of the oppressors. Doubts and insecurity are bound to affect their national life and, in desperation, they can be expected to engage in ever more oppressive measures and to employ greater violence. But all that, in the end, cannot change the inevitable: the majority of the people of those countries will play their full role in political, economic and social affairs and come to enjoy all their rights as citizens. Whatever excuses are advanced, whatever subterfuges cm- ployed, the stark reality is that the South African Government and the illegal Ian Smith regime are maintaining and expanding systems designed to enhance the well-being and ensure the special privileges of a minority, while denying the African majority their basic, elementary and inalienable rights as human beings.\n39.\tThere is an alternative route they could pursue: they could do what is right and just. They could turn with all sincerity to the obliteration of racism and to the establishment of equitable multiracial nations in which the rights of each individual are secured, cultural differences are respected, and special privileges are eliminated. They would thereby ensure, we believe, the peace and harmony of all the people of those countries. They would also contribute to the spirit of reconciliation, co-operation and common purpose which is beginning to take hold among the nations of the world. Otherwise, it may be that the only answer will lie in a greater resort to armed struggle by the African peoples of South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe.\n40.\tSuch a development would be extremely regrettable to my Government because of the incalculable cost in human lives which would result and because of the greater threat such a situation would present to international peace and security. But the peoples of those areas may decide that they are left with no other choice. And in that event, those nations which through their trade and investment activities directly or indirectly strengthen the hands of the South African Government and of the Smith regime and stiffen their resolve will then have to bear their full share of the responsibility.\n41.\tWe witnessed yesterday [2248th meeting] the action taken by an overwhelming number of States Members of the Organization rejecting the credentials of the delegation of the minority racist South African regime and adopting by an almost unanimous vote a resolution calling upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa [resolution 3207 (XXIX)]. There has never been a greater show of solidarity by the inter-national community against South Africa's arrogant disregard for every requirement of morality, decency and justice, and for the principles of the Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the many resolutions adopted by this world body.\n42.\tLiberia believes that because South Africa has been intransigent in pursuing its evil, racist and repressive policies, and impervious to the numerous condemnations of those policies by the international community, it is South Africa which has now raised the most serious doubts as to its right to continued membership in the United Nations.\n43.\tThe struggle for national independence has in recent decades achieved remarkable progress, although, regrettably, it has not been entirely successful. Nevertheless, there is now nearly universal acceptance of the principle that every people has an inalienable right to political freedom, national self- determination and independence. And yet, the experience of recent years has shown that these rights cannot be entirely meaningful unless all peoples come to enjoy the freedoms which economic progress makes possible: the freedom from want, from hunger, from endemic disease, from ignorance and from poverty. Many representatives have already addressed themselves to this problem from this rostrum.\n44.\tAt the sixth special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and development held in April, to which the President of Liberia attached such great importance that he attended it himself, these issues were discussed in great depth. President Tolbert said:\n\\\"If this special session is destined to achieve the same quality of response as has been forthcoming from all the foregoing meetings and 'paper' declarations, then I doubt that our coming here will have been worth the effort. But if this Assembly would in a concrete manner address itself to the pressing issues of organized global development today, then, as participating countries, we must all stand determined to elevate and to reshape that process which is necessary to translate into evident reality the collective will to accommodate.\\\"\n45.\tVet effective follow-up measures have not ensued, and many industrialized nations have indicated their dissatisfaction with various aspects of both the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-Vl) and the related Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)]. The historic dialog which we began at that time must continue with greater vigor and be guided by a clarity of perception as to the ultimate goals we seek to achieve. Efforts must be undertaken to bring to reality the great objectives we expressed at that time. While emergency assistance is required on a priority basis for those developing nations most adversely affected by the existing economic crisis, in the longer run fundamental changes in the structure of the existing trade, monetary and investment systems must be made. New insight and study of means of reconciling in a just way the interests of developing and developed countries, consumers and producers, and rich and poor nations must be found. Mutually acceptable formulas to facilitate and expand greatly the inflow of capital and technological expertise to developing countries must be devised.\n46.\tIn our common endeavor to ensure a better life for the entire family of man, it has become necessary that we look beyond narrow and short-term national interests. Ultimately, the progress and well-being of any one nation will depend on the ability of all nations to prosper. A world which continues to be so clearly divided between the wealthy and the poverty- stricken cannot for long remain a peaceful world. What We need at this time is a joint and firm commitment to address ourselves to the problems which face the world today and which loom ahead for the future. To avoid disaster, we must avoid meaningless rhetoric and sterile exchanges designed to apportion blame, to castigate, or to justify. Liberia is concerned, rather, with the formulation of guidelines and plans by which the quality of life in our world can be improved. Liberia desires to see mere words replaced with action, and meaningless expressions of concern with carefully considered proposals. Most. of all, there must be a determination to embark upon the new course which the times require and to engage in the construction of a more equitable world order before it becomes too late.\n47.\tDuring the sixth special session, the President of Liberia also uttered these words:\n\\\"Living in an interdependent world, it is important to distinguish between self-interest and selfish interest. Selfish interest contains the possibility of exacting retribution for past injustices, and of seeking equalization for past exploitation. It seeks to promote the betterment of a part, while remaining oblivious to the well-being of the whole. Similarly, nationalism can be a force for good in our one world if its vision remains clearly focused on the commonality of our interests; if its overall targets are outlined in a compromising synthesis of concepts; if its efforts are exerted in a pooling of resources in a genuine pursuit of peace and freedom, security and justice.\\\"\nAre we continuously aware of this overriding commonality of interest? Can we now engage in a com-promising synthesis of concepts? Will we ever pool our resources for the common good?\n48.\tFor perhaps the first time in history, national problems are, in most instances, world problems. The most fundamental difficulties faced by nations today can no longer be solved in isolation. Global efforts are necessary. Economic growth and development, the growth of the world's population, our concern for irreparable damage to the environment, the availability and price of raw materials, the expansion to all peoples of the benefits of technology, the dilemma of ever-spiraling inflation and the urgent need to assure an adequate supply of energy resources and of food are all problems to which we must collectively find solutions. More than that, they are all interrelated. Yet it is distressing that, despite ever-greater awareness of the interdependence of the nations of our world and the need for implementing a common plan of action to resolve these difficult problems, so very little has been achieved.\n49.\tMany developing countries remain locked into a world system which keeps them as, essentially, producers of raw materials in a world market system of generally declining prices over which they have no control. Increased prices both of energy supplies and of other necessary imports required for development, and, in some cases, for mere survival, remain unabated. If some nations are able, to a greater or lesser degree, to offset higher costs for certain imports with higher returns on exports and, in some instances, with expanded domestic production, most developing countries are not in a position to do either. All of the evils inherent in shortages and price increases are absorbed by the developing countries. We are bound on a path to economic disaster unless meaningful, effective and urgent action can be undertaken on a sufficiently massive scale.\n50.\tIn recent times, despite the nearly universal commitment to co-operation rather than confrontation, despite the frequent exhortations against producers associations from certain quarters, despite the call for a rational system of distributing goods and services consonant with the expanded requirements of the peoples of the world and the availability of these items, we have yet to see any tangible example of an international will for real action rather than platitudes, declarations and resolutions.\n51.\tIs it naive to expect wealthy and powerful nations to do much more than they have done which, in some instances, has been meaningful even if grossly insufficient? We are therefore greatly pleased by the statement made by President Gerald R. Ford of the United States, while addressing this Assembly [2234th meeting], that his Government will increase rather than reduce the amount it spends on food and agricultural assistance to other countries. We also welcome the spirit of co-operation with which he called upon all nations to respond to challenges confronting the international community. It is indeed gratifying that this theme has been echoed again and again in these halls by many representatives. We are thus aware of how we need to proceed; what we must now show is the requisite courage and the will for positive action. And it is the responsibility of those nations possessing the capability to do so to take the proper initiative.\n52.\tThe other related concern which permeates our debate is that of peace in our world lasting, genuine and just peace, without which nothing could be accomplished and the very existence of mankind would be exposed to the most serious peril. We have there-fore all welcomed with increasing relief the spirit of accommodation and detente which exists between the major world Powers. No cause, no perception of national interest, no differences in ideological beliefs should be allowed to disturb this process. Rather, in an age of nuclear weapons, the need for peace and co-operation is overriding. It is our hope that recent developments will lead to a reduction of armaments and, ultimately, to complete disarmament. We believe that the security which is to be obtained from armed forces alone, or from an emphasis on military or ideological blocs, is more and more illusory. Indeed, the continued expansion in numbers and deployment of such weapons endangers peace and threatens security. Moreover, the tremendous cost of implements of war could be turned to such peaceful purposes as technological research and development assistance. This is why Liberia supported the Soviet proposal last year for a 10 per cent reduction in the defense budgets of major Powers, with some savings therefrom to be applied to the development needs of third-world countries.5 It is also for these reasons, and because of the evident, perilous threat to the environment such weapons would entail, and the further danger to mankind they would represent, that Liberia supports the proposal put forward this year by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Mr. Andrei Gromyko, entitled \\\"Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well-being and health\\\" [A/9702 and Corr.1].\n53.\tLiberia will always uphold the sovereign right of every nation to a secure existence and decry the use of aggressive force against any nation, or any interference in its domestic affairs by any other nation. As an African nation, we support, foremost, greater co-operation and unity on our continent. We believe that through discussions problems can be resolved and the energies of all African nations can be harnessed for the common benefit of the peoples of Africa and of the world. We shall therefore continue to attach the greatest importance to the Organization of African\nUnity [OAV], and to all efforts aimed at promoting bilateral, regional and continental economic co-operation and co-ordination among African States.\n54.\tAt the same time, Liberia believes in the underlying principles of non-alignment and will continue to play an active role in the furtherance of the objectives of the movement of the non-aligned nations.\n55.\tLiberia reaffirms its dedication to, and support for, the lofty ideals and high purposes prescribed in the Charter of the United Nations, However, Liberia feels that certain provisions of the Charter should be reviewed in the light of present-day realities.\n56.\tDespite the generally favorable trend of events in international politics and the greater consolidation of detente among the major Powers, it is most regrettable that the peace, security and internal stability of smaller States may still be disturbed by more powerful States. Detente and the climate of accommodation, to be truly meaningful, must apply to relations among all States, be they large or small. The case of Cyprus, which a few minutes ago was so eloquently stated from this rostrum by His Beatitude Archbishop Makarios, President of the Republic of Cyprus, illustrates an unfortunate example of the imperfections in the international system. I would echo the words of Secretary of State Kissinger of the United States:\n. . tolerance of local conflict tempts world holocaust\\\" [2238th meeting, para. 46], But that is one aspect of the problem. The other is that, regardless of whether or not any particular conflict remains localized, the people of that area are exposed to the horrors, the tragedy and the devastation of war. Moreover, the sacred principles of peaceful resolution of disputes and of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States are thereby trampled upon. These are firm and immutable principles absolutely necessary to an ordered and just world society. All nations must observe and respect them, or no nation will find security. I therefore hope that the people of Cyprus will be allowed the opportunity to resolve their difficulties peacefully and without undesired interference.\n57.\tThe cease-fire and disengagement agreements in the Middle East constitute an extremely hopeful beginning. I pay tribute to the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Henry Kissinger, for his tire-less and highly effective diplomatic initiatives. The role of the United Nations, and, in particular, that taken by the Secretary-General, who consistently demonstrates his total devotion and dedication to the cause of peace and the ideals of the Organization, merit our highest commendation. Yet dangers still persist. Portions of Arab territories are still held by Israeli forces. But we fervently believe that a just and durable peace can be obtained through patience, determination and good faith. Such a peace can only be guaranteed by complete Israeli withdrawal from illegally occupied Arab territories and by a firm commitment by all concerned to respect the legitimate rights of all nations in that region to a secure national existence within well-defined and acceptable frontiers. But genuine peace will not be possible if the aspirations of the Palestinian people and recognition of their legitimate rights are not taken into full account. We also believe that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East should be resumed as early as possible, and that the Palestinians should be accorded representation. But those are complex issues which should be carefully considered and discussed in this forum, for the fate of the Middle East surely is of the greatest importance to the peace and security of our world.\n58.\tThe hopes that the resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor will in reality become a common heritage for mankind, and that a fair and just determination will be made of national rights as regards territorial waters and exclusive economic zones, found expression in the important Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Caracas last summer. Despite its less-than-successful results, these hopes will be disappointingly unfulfilled if, in Geneva next March, compromise and conciliation do not prevail. We would then have lost a golden opportunity to set the world on a course of justice and peace in a very vital area.\n59.\tWe have reached the cross-roads. The path which we must follow, if a future of peace and plenty, brotherhood and understanding is to be assured, is clear. We are challenged at this momentous time to translate the ideals long expressed by so many of us into concrete reality. Should we fail to do so, it is evident that this good earth which we all share will be engulfed by unmanageable difficulties. In such circumstances, peace among nations will at best be meaningless and, at worst, virtually impossible to obtain, as each nation scrambles to assure its own survival. Our sacred task as members of the family of man and as representatives of a community of nations existing in the world must be, through co-operation, with a sense of common purpose and an acute awareness of the fragility of human existence, to undertake the construction of a rational and just world order in which all peoples can enjoy a life in larger freedom void of the ravages of disease, of violence and war, of hunger, of numbing oppression, of hatred and prejudices, of extreme poverty and of want.\n60.\tI believe that we of this world community are capable of achieving these goals. Let us therefore recognize the interdependence of our world, carefully observe the pitfalls which lie before us, and with conviction foresight, strength and courage totally involve ourselves at this session and in the years to come to the noble and arduous task of creating a \\\"new progressive age\\\" for all mankind, and for all times.\n"

        "file_text": " For many years, from this rostrum and others, the non-aligned countries have constantly called for peace and detente -a far-reaching general detente which would lead to international understanding and co-operation. As pointed out by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work' of the Organization [AI960llAdd.l], it is comforting to see that here and there in the world there is continuing progress towards detente.\n47.\tOne serious threat to international peace and security, as we have never ceased to condemn, is the persistence of colonialism and racial discrimination in Africa. However, there are very promising developments in the Portuguese colonies of Africa. History teaches us that a people which oppresses another cannot be free, and this truth has been amply confirmed in Portugal. The Portuguese people, subjugated by one of the last Fascist regimes of our century, was unable to liberate itself so long as the Portuguese Government was bent on pursuing overseas and by force of arms a policy of colonial occupation which history, the determination of the colonized peoples and world opinion condemned to inevitable failure.\n48.\tAs things turned out, in their heroic and just struggle against colonialism, the valiant liberation movements in the Portuguese colonies contributed substantially to the liberation of the Portuguese people itself. The glory for this is theirs. Today, after half a century of Fascist and obscurantist dictatorship, the Portuguese people can at last live as a free people, devoting itself to the urgent task of development and resuming its place in the community of nations.\n49.\tBut if the events of April 1974 are to become a genuine revolution worthy of the great humanist traditions of Portugal, if they are to become part of the logic of detente, the dialectical process must proceed to the very end. In other words, the political liberalization which has been taking place in the metropolitan country and which is no more than a necessary prerequisite must be followed by the rapid accession to independence and freedom of the Portuguese colonies as well.\n50.\tWe are following and we welcome all the efforts being made by the new Portuguese regime in this direction. We hope that nothing will arrest its progress along the honorable road upon which it has embarked, at the end of which it will And the respect and friend-ship of the African countries and of all the peoples of the world who love peace and justice.\n51.\tWe also hope that the Portuguese example will inspire all the other colonial Powers to speed up the inevitable decolonization of the colonial territories they still occupy. To this effect, we support the efforts of the French Government to speed the process of decolonization of the Comoro Islands.\n52.\tWe also take note of the recent statements of the SpanisL Government concerning what is called Spanish Sahara, and we are closely watching political developments in that territory in the light of the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity [iOAU] and the United Nations which should lead to effective and genuine decolonization,\n53.\tFinally, we hope that there will soon be a happy outcome in the case of Zimbabwe, that of Azania and that of the international territory of Namibia. In other words, and in accordance with United Nations resolutions, Pretoria must put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia. The Government of the United Kingdom, the administering Power, must restore legality in Rhodesia by establishing a genuine democracy, resulting from negotiations with the liberation movements, which are the sole authentic representatives of the people of Zimbabwe. As for apartheid, which is a disgrace to our century, the United Nations must stop at nothing in order to bring to heel the South African racists who have made racism a State policy.\n54.\tMy delegation unreservedly supports the decision taken recently by the Assembly [resolution 3207 (XXIX)] to invite the Council to consider frankly the relations between South Africa and the United Nations, and will spare no effort in the Security Council to ensure the triumph of the just cause of the African people of Azania.\n55.\tI take this opportunity of paying a well-deserved tribute to all the friendly countries which so far have given their material, financial or political support to the African liberation movements. As I did in the course of the good-will mission which I have just carried out in some of thole countries at the head of a delegation of the Co-ordination Committee for the Liberation of Africa, on the express instructions of the OAU, I wish to reiterate to all those countries the deep gratitude of Africa.\n56.\tThe encouraging prospects we have just mentioned concerning decolonization should not, however, make us forget that detente remains fragile so long as hotbeds of tension or bones of contention continue to exist in Viet Nam, Korea, Cambodia, the Middle East or Cyprus and so long as brutal or covert interference by foreign Powers in the internal affairs of other States continues to spread. That is why our desire has always been that a lasting and just peace should rapidly return to those regions.\n57.\tAs far as Viet Nam is concerned, we look for the complete withdrawal of foreign troops so that the Vietnamese people, within the framework of the Paris agreements, may bind up their wounds in freedom and set about rebuilding their economy laid waste by long years of war.\n58.\tSimilarly, we consider that following the dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea the time has come to withdraw all foreign troops still stationed on Korean territory. It is only in a situation free from outside interference that the people of Korea will be able freely and effectively to resolve the problem of the independent and peaceful reunification of their country.\n59.\tIn Cambodia, powerfully and firmly united behind its President, Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, in the National United Front of Kampuchea, the Cambodian people are successfully combating aggression. More than 90 per cent of the territory of Cambodia with more than 80 per cent of the population is now liberated and under the direct administration of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia. My delegation accordingly considers that the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia must resume its rightful place in the United Nations without further delay.\n60.\tWe welcome all the efforts of the United Nations and on a bilateral basis to restore peace to the Middle East, but we still say that, in order to bring about a just and lasting solution, these efforts must be based essentially on the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories and the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n61.\tIn the island of Cyprus the constitutional edifice erected so laboriously in 1960 has been taking terrible punishment which reached its peak in July 1974 and has already cost thousands of innocent lives. The guarantors of the island's status -the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey -have been unable, and with good reason, to find immediate ways and means of restoring peace, which is a prerequisite for the search for a negotiated solution to this problem, the implications of which, by endangering an established system, could threaten world peace.\n62.\tConfronted with this impasse, the world was in good conscience obliged to react and to call for an end to human suffering and the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops, with the praiseworthy objective of creating conditions favorable for the final settlement of the question by the establishment of the independence, unity and territorial integrity of the island. Those were essentially the concerns of the Security Council in its resolution 353 (1974) of 20 July 1974. As a non-permanent member of the Council, Cameroon was happy to contribute to those efforts, which must be continued.\n63.\tMuch remains to be done in this direction, in as much as that resolution of the Council and the other subsequent resolutions, the Geneva Conference and other initiatives in the same direction have not produced the desired effects. One of the things the Assembly must do at this session is to seek an appropriate solution to this problem, in which humanitarian considerations must take precedence over political aspects.\n64.\tThat is why my delegation, aware of the tense situation which continues to prevail in Cyprus and, if truth be told, throughout the eastern Mediterranean, will look favorably upon and support any initiative from no matter what quarter tending definitively to restore peace to the island and to resolve no less definitively, in the interests of the Greek and Turkish communities of the island, the political problem posed by an untoward arrangement whose failure all deplore.\n65.\tI should like now to address myself to a matter of concern which is crucial to detente, and I refer to international co-operation. The sixth special session of the General Assembly, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Caracas, and, most recently, the World Population Conference held at Bucharest, revealed the importance of the subjects they dealt with, the urgent need for fair solutions, and at th\u00ab same time the stubbornness of selfish national interests that render all efforts of cooperation practically useless. \n66.\tTwelve months ago, when the energy crisis be-came widespread, we realized how precarious our situation was; but our problems did not begin yesterday. For several years now, world prices for certain commodities have been continuously rising. According to the economists, the relationship between prices and incomes is direct, which is to say that high living standards are matched by high wages which in their turn lead to rising prices. But this situation does not prevail to an equal degree everywhere in the world.\n67.\tIt is true in the developed countries, where the majority of the people earn salaries above the average. But when the developing countries, whose active population must content themselves with low wages, are caught up in the machinery of inflation, their purchasing power undergoes a sharp decline. Thus, the poor become every day poorer and the Governments, destitute of resources, encounter insurmountable difficulties which can jeopardize the functioning of essential institutions.\n68.\tIt has been said that today 15 per cent of the human race possesses 85 per cent of the world's wealth; and the majority of those people live in Western Europe and North America, while hunger, ignorance, disease, poverty and natural disaster are the lot of the countries of the third world.\n69.\tIn recent years we have drawn the attention of the international community to the many and grave problems of the third world. Perhaps we were not understood. It seems to me that the petroleum-producing countries, in their frustration, have merely burst the abscess of a crisis which had long been gathering. Their position is well known. But did the developing countries have to go so far before the international community finally woke up to the situation and decided to come to the aid of our frail economies, by setting fair prices for our raw materials?\n70.\tAll of us in this Assembly have an idea of the way in which bilateral and multilateral aid is granted to the developing countries. While the gratitude of those countries should be emphasized here, we may ask for how much longer this aid will continue to be forthcoming, and what is its real impact on our economies, when all the other factors necessary for harmonious, accelerated, extensive and lasting development are lacking.\n71.\tWe have noted that since the end of the Second World War the prices of manufactured goods have increased year after year. With these rising prices, the level of living in industrialized regions has substantially improved, and the populations of Western Europe and North America have thus entered an age of luxury and even waste. The developing countries can only look on helplessly while this is happening for, while our production increases thanks to energetic development efforts, the income that we derive from it continues to decline.\n72.\tUntil a. just and proportionate relationship is established between the prices of manufactured goods and those of raw materials, we shall never be safe from technological aggression. In other words, the real problem facing mankind is that of a better distribution of resources, services and technology, and this can only be achieved by a vigorous policy of international co-operation, which was what the Second United Nations Development Decade seemed to be aiming at with, among other objectives, the transfer of technology.\n73.\tWe are not asking for charity from the wealthy countries, even though history tells us that those countries in large part built their colossal fortunes and ensured their own development by the exploitation of our peoples and the plunder of our natural resources. What we are asking is merely a new and more equitable economic order.\n74.\tThe General Assembly at its sixth special session showed the way to avoid the errors of the old economic system which led to the present crisis. One of the most important results of that session was the unanimous recognition of the interdependence of the industrialized countries and the countries of the third world that provide raw materials, and the interdependence of problems of trade, development financing and the international monetary system. To solve those problems we need co-ordinated solutions, both on the national and on the international level. The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and, above all, the Program of Action for the establishment of this new international economic order, indicate both the objectives to be attained and the means of attaining them.\n75.\tMy delegation particularly welcomes the Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI), in which the General Assembly calls on the whole United Nations family to undertake immediately an emergency assistance operation in order to aid those of the developing countries most deeply affected by the present world economic crisis. My delegation notes with satisfaction that many countries have already clearly indicated their willingness to make voluntary contributions to that Special Program.\n76.\tWhere tLsre has been some progress towards political detente it has often been outside the United Nations, Similarly, in the field of co-operation we cannot seem to find, inside our Organization, a platform acceptable to both industrial and third-world countries whereas, outside the United Nations, in a bilateral, subregional, regional or multilateral context, some positive action is possible.\n77.\tCan we therefore conclude that the United Nations has failed in its mission? Not at all. Over the 29 years of its existence the United Nations, because it is unique and universal, has emerged as an outstanding forum for contacts, for the exchange of views, and for collective reflection on the common problems of all mankind. Furthermore, in the specialized agencies major efforts have been made and positive results achieved. We hope that with the distinguished and dynamic encouragement of the Economic and Social Council, and with the assistance of our tireless Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, to whom we should like to reiterate our congratulations, the work of the specialized agencies will continue and expand.\n78.\tIt is therefore under the banner of hope that we come to take part in the work of the twenty-ninth session. It is, of course, a qualified hope, but a hope that will one day be realized through the determination of some, the understanding of others and the firm purpose of all who bear the name of man. Our hope is a world where peace, justice and human solidarity will prevail.\n79.\tWhen we speak of human solidarity, our thoughts naturally go to Honduras and Peru, whose peoples have been so sorely tried by a terrible hurricane. I hope that the delegations of Honduras and Peru will accept the deeply felt condolences of the delegation of Cameroon in this painful hour. Far from being discouraged, such trials should, on the contrary, strengthen our solidarity and shore up our hopes for a better future.\n80.\tYou will, therefore, understand, Mr. President, that my delegation, moved by this hope, appreciates the three-fold tribute represented by your enthusiastic and unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session. This is, first of all, a tribute to the people of Africa who, thanks to the dynamic and resolute stand of OAU over the past few years, particularly since the last session, have played a considerable role in reaffirming and strengthening the ideals of freedom, independence and solidarity set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.\n81.\tIt is also a tribute to the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, whose valiant people have won imperishable laurels not only through its heroic struggle against colonial oppression, but also because of its continuing fight against the injustices of imperialism as denounced at the last special session, convened in fact on the initiative of your famous head of State, President Houari Boumediene.\n82.\tAnd it is a tribute, finally, to yourself, a diplomat of consummate skill, a tireless freedom fighter and impassioned defender of the dignity and independence of the peoples of the third world. Beyond the mere ritual of congratulations, believe me, Mr. President, my delegation feels itself directly touched by these tributes paid by the most noble world Assembly to the head of the delegation of a friendly sister country.\n83.\tWe should also like to extend this tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Benites, who so wisely and responsibly directed the difficult proceedings of the twenty- eighth session and, above all, the sixth special session.\n84.\tA sign of the times: it is under your presidency that we joyfully welcome for the first time the delegation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, that brother State whose independence, proclaimed on the field of battle a year ago, tolled the knell for the last and oldest of the colonial empires. We welcome the admission to this Assembly of our brothers from Guinea- Bissau and of our friends from Bangladesh and Grenada, and we extend to them our warmest congratulations.\n85.\tThe admission of three new Members is part of the thrust towards universality, which must be one of the objectives of our Organization if it really wishes to be the major center for harmonizing the actions of all the nations of the world so as to maintain international peace and security, to develop international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character. In a word, to usher in a genuine world civilization in conformity with the provisions of Article 1 of the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "28.\tMankind is approaching a memorable date the thirtieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The years that have passed since then have been filled with a persistent struggle for the prevention of a new military catastrophe, for the strengthening of international peace and security. We can say with satisfaction that much has been achieved. The international situation today is increasingly characterized by important processes connected with the consolidation and deepening of detente and the extension of its sphere of influence. These processes affect a growing number of countries and continents and are beginning to exert a favorable influence on the advance of peoples towards socio-economic progress.\n29.\tThe favorable changes in the world have led to increased trust between countries and contributed to the creation of an atmosphere of mutual under-standing of the interests of other countries and peoples. The adherents of dictatorial and coercive methods in international relations are becoming increasingly isolated. Changes are taking place in the very thinking of those whose lives and feelings have been inhibited for so long by the cold war.\n30.\tFor all these development; history will pay tribute to the Soviet Union, the States of the socialist community, the non-aligned and other peace-loving countries and realistic political circles, which are striving together to strengthen peace and security and embark on the high road of constructive discussion and the solution of outstanding problems.\n31.\tAn important role in the process of the relaxation of international tension is being played by the development of peaceful relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The important agreements concluded between them in the past two years represent a major contribution to the cause of peace, and their implementation will undoubtedly promote the solution of many controversial problems.\n32.\tIt can now be stated with the utmost certainty that the new climate which is emerging in international relations is contributing to the settlement of various situations of conflict and making it possible for people to resist aggressive actions more effectively and defend their interests more successfully.\n33.\tThe conclusion of the Paris agreements on Viet Nam, the first steps towards a Middle East settlement, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the talks on the reduction of armaments and armed forces in Central Europe, the negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms between the United States and the Soviet Union -all these important historical events have been and are possible only as a result of positive changes in the international situation. It should also be emphasized that it was precisely as a result of these changes that it became possible to discuss the timely questions raised by the developing countries at the sixth special session of the General Assembly on the establishment of just economic relations among States.\n34.\tNotwithstanding all the complications and difficulties on the road to peace, and the roughness of that road, it is still fair to say that it is the process of relaxation of tensions that determines the development of current international relations. As was stressed by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine, V. V. She her- bit sky, at a meeting with voters on 6 June this year in Kiev, \\\"Detente is standing the test of stability, making constant headway and becoming ever more irreversible\\\".\n35.\tAt the same time, it would be unforgivably naive and misguided to suppose that in these new conditions the contradictions of the present-day world will settle themselves or that the threat of war has become an illusion. We must not forget that influential enemies of detente -military-industrial complexes and monopolies growing rich on the arms race- are still at work. Political adventurers from imperialist military blocs which thrived in the favorable climate of the cold war think even now in terms of a policy from a position of strength, provocations, military revolts and coups d'etat. They try to use the tensions which still exist in relations among some States in order to poison the international atmosphere. A shameful contribution is made to this futile exercise by international zionism, the anti-Soviet emigre rubbish which has installed itself in the West and those bourgeois ideologists and journalists who have been so busy at the feeding trough of the cold war\u2014a trough which for them remains to this day a source of sustenance.\n36.\tIn this unsavory company we find certain politicians -politicians rather than statesmen -who under the guise of pseudo-revolutionary phraseology are actually doing damage to the national liberation movements, the cause of peace and international co-operation. As at previous sessions of the General Assembly, the delegation of the Chinese People's Republic, headed by Mr. Chiao Kuan-hua, is repeating all kinds of malicious anti-Soviet fabrications. We still find in the arsenal of the utterances of this gentleman the trumped-up slanderous theory of the superPowers, the so-called regional super-Powers, and appeals to what he called revolutionary action, which, in fact, amounts to the fanning of the flames of military conflict. Doing everything he can to oppose detente, the Chinese representative still rejects all the constructive proposals of the Soviet Union, the socialist and other peace-loving States for the sake of the strengthening of international peace and security.\n37.\tIt is precisely the Maoists who are opposing proposals approved by the General Assembly, such as the convening of a world disarmament conference, a reduction of military budgets and the use of part of the funds so saved for assistance to developing countries, the non-use of force in international relations, the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, the calling of a halt to the testing of these weapons, and much else.\n38.\tNow, what concrete proposals does Peking have for us for the solution of the questions of the strengthening of peace and disarmament which are so vitally important for the state of mankind? Nothing \u2014apart from approving chaos in international relations, which is essentially the same as intensifying confrontation and stepping up the arms race.\n39.\tIn his statement yesterday [2252nd meeting] the Chinese representative once again attempted to cast the shadow of slander on the role of the Soviet Union in the granting of assistance tcf national liberation movements and the struggle of the Arab peoples for liberation from Israeli occupation of Arab territories. But we know that slanderous verbal outpourings cannot diminish the significance of the vast political, material and military assistance: being given by the Soviet Union to the fighting peoples.\n143o To paraphrase the Chinese proverb which we were offered by Mr. Chiao Kuan-hua, I could say that the flowers of slander wither, but the inexorable facts remain, and these facts are not in favour of the Chinese leadership.\n144.\tTo resist the forces of reaction and the opponents of the easing of tension is possible only through the adoption of concrete decisions and measures which would really lead to a consolidation of peace. Therefore, the United Nations must intensify its efforts in what is the key direction of all its activities\u2014the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of international security. We must promote this at this session by discussing the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. In recent years this document of fundamental importance has been reinforced by a number of new constructive proposals embodied in new decisions and resolutions of. the United Nations which are currently in force in interstate relations.\n145.\tAt the same time it should be pointed out that the effectiveness of the strengthening of international security has been decisively influenced by the consistent implementation of the Soviet program of peace mapped out by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and by the practical initiatives of the States of the socialist community.\n146.\tIn this connexion, I would like once again to stress the importance of the declaration on the non- use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons contained in General Assembly resolution 2936 (XXVII) adopted on the initiative of the Soviet Union. At the present time there are favorable conditions for further progress in settling the question of the renunciation of the use of force by means of all types of weapons, including nuclear weapons. In our opinion, the time has come to take practical steps for the complete implementation of this declaration and to make the most important principles contained in it binding on all Members of the United Nations. We express the hope that the Security Council, in accordance with the recommendation of this resolution, will take an appropriate decision.\n147.\tRecent events in the eastern Mediterranean reaffirm the necessity to fight ever more energetically for the renunciation of the use of force in international relations. The dangerous course of events in Cyprus provoked by certain circles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] runs counter to the measures designed to strengthen international security and therefore affects the interests of all peoples. The vital interests of the people of Cyprus have been seriously threatened. The issue is nothing less than the very existence of this non-aligned State.\n148.\tThe Ukrainian SSR calls for a cessation of all outside interference in the affairs of Cyprus, a Member of the United Nations, for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory, for the restoration of constitutional order, and for granting the Cypriots themselves a real opportunity to settle their own domestic affairs.\n149.\tThe wrongfulness and the failure of the attempts to solve the Cyprus problem within a narrow circle and in the interests of NATO, without regard to the will of the Cypriots themselves, only reaffirm the importance and the timeliness of the proposal of the USSR to convene, within the framework of the United Nations, an international conference on Cyprus. Such a representative forum could prepare decisions which would really ensure the existence of Cyprus as an independent, sovereign and territorially integral State, something which corresponds to the interests of the entire people of Cyprus.\n150.\tThere must be no further delay, either, in a political settlement of the Middle East problem, which for decades now has been poisoning the international atmosphere. The key conditions of such a settlement were and remain as follows: the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territories occupied in 1967; the protection of the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine in accordance with their national aspirations; the ensuring of the security, territorial integrity and sovereignty of all the States in this region. In the meantime, Israel continues its saber-rattling. It is making attacks on Lebanon, attempting to freeze the situation which arose following the agreements on troop disengagement on the Golan Heights and in Sinai, and is trying to replace radical political solutions by half-measures in order to entrench itself in the occupied territories.\n151.\tBut such a policy has no future. It can lead only to further exacerbation and conflict. The interests of peace, the interests of all the peoples of this region urgently require the immediate resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East.\n152.\tRecent events have made it ever more obvious that a Middle East settlement is impossible without a solution of the Palestinian problem and the ensuring of the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine. For this reason, the delegation of the Ukrainian SSR supported the inclusion of that item in the agenda of this session.\n153.\tThe draft resolution submitted by a group of countries aimed at the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations [Al9703lAdd.3] is also one of the measures aimed at strengthening international security. The presence of these troops is a major obstacle to the unification of Korea by peaceful means; it represents a source of constant military and political tension in this area and encourages the dictatorial regime of South Korea to carry out repression of democratic forces.\n154.\tThe Saigon rulers, who enjoy support from the outside, are continuing their bloodshed and their systematic violation of the Paris agreements. At the same time, it is absolutely clear that strict observance of these agreements is the major condition for the establishment of just and lasting peace in Viet Nam. The peoples of Asia are striving for peace, for the creation of a situation propitious for economic and social development, and conditions are becoming ever riper here for the establishment of a collective security system.\n155.\tThe memorable change which has taken place in the international situation from cold war to mutual understanding, from confrontation to negotiation, to the solution or the beginning of a solution of a number of the most important problems which only yesterday seemed insoluble, is creating real prospects for progress in the field of disarmament. The need to intensify efforts in this direction is dictated by the fact that in spite of the favorable changes in the world, the arms race continues. Swallowing up more than $250,000 million every year, it is not only having an adverse effect on the security of all States but also diverting vast amounts of material and human resources from peaceful creative work. Therefore, the task of supplementing political detente with military detente is extremely timely. The well-known initiatives of the USSR and other socialist countries are designed precisely to achieve this goal.\n156.\tAnother important and concrete measure in this field is that contained in the item entitled \\\"Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well-being and health\\\" [item 103], which has been submitted at this session of the General Assembly by the Soviet Union [A/9702]. This proposal is based on due regard for the real situation in the world and the prospects opened up by science and technology for creating new means and methods of warfare so far little known but potentially catastrophic for all man-kind. The time has come to work out and conclude an appropriate international convention to outlaw action designed to influence the environment and climate for military purposes. Raising a new barrier to the arms race, such an agreement would also be an important contribution to the performance of the global task of protecting the human environment. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR fully and wholeheartedly endorses this valuable initiative of the Soviet Union and calls upon the General Assembly to give it the necessary support.\n157.\tWe should like particularly to stress that constructive and positive participation of all States possessing important military potential and, above all, all the nuclear Powers, is extremely important for progress in the field of disarmament. The favorable trend in international development cannot of itself replace goodwill and the concrete contribution of each State to the cause of disarmament.\n158.\tThe purposes of uniting the efforts of all States in the world in this area would be served by the convening of a world disarmament conference, something which the General Assembly has repeatedly favored. Under present conditions, the timeliness and need for the earliest possible convening of such a conference are more than ever obvious, and the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference submitted to the General Assembly [AI9628] says precisely this.\n159.\tThe Ukrainian SSR is in favor of the convening of a world conference with the participation of all States of the world at the earliest possible time and calls upon all States to make a constructive contribution to its practical preparation and convening. All kinds of tricks aimed at slowing down and frustrating the preparations for such a conference can only be regarded as reluctance to participate in preparing measures of disarmament.\n160.\tConsolidation of the multilateral agreements already attained and making them more universal is an extremely urgent task in the field of disarmament. Indeed, without the positive participation in these agreements of all militarily significant Powers, especially the nuclear Powers, it would be difficult to talk about ensuring complete and effective realization of the measures designed to limit the arms race and bring about disarmament contained therein or about further progress in this field. We have in mind such important agreements as the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963,3 the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]; the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI), annex], the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925,4 and others.\n161.\tThe prohibition of chemical weapons and the comprehensive prohibition of nuclear-weapons testing, the reduction and freezing of military budgets and many other measures are urgent problems in the field of disarmament which could lead to the bringing about and achievement of the purposes of general and complete disarmament. There are really quite a few problems in the field of disarmament and all of them are important problems. But however difficult they may seem, they can be solved given the goodwill and the maximum exertions of States.\n162.\tEach year is marked with new victories of the national liberation struggle of peoples. In this regard the delegation of the Ukrainian SSR welcomes with special satisfaction the new Members of the United Nations\u2014the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. We wish the peoples of these countries success in the strengthening of their national independence and in their economic and social development.\n163.\tNew prospects are now being opened up in the world for the complete and final liquidation of colonialism and racism. The successful liberation struggle of the peoples of Guinea-Bissau, Angola and Mozambique is further proof of the importance and effectiveness of the solidarity and unity of action, particularly in the United Nations, of the forces of national liberation, peace, democracy and socialism. The task of finally eradicating colonialism and racism requires further strengthening of this unity and cohesiveness. Attempts to undermine or split the united anti-imperialist, anti-colonial front by means of false slogans and theories of all kinds can only harm the cause of complete liberation of peoples from the shackles of colonialism and racism.\n164.\tIndeed, it is precisely right now that favourable conditions are being created for the complete implementation of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. To this end, it is necessary to intensify the struggle against the racist regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury still remaining in Africa and against those who support. these regimes and help them keep the peoples in conditions of colonial slavery. We must implement the decisions of the United Nations on South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. There must be no procrastination and no manoeuvres de-signed to perpetuate colonial domination if we want once and for all to settle the question of decolonization of the remaining colonial Territories both in Africa and elsewhere in the world. Racism, apartheid and colonialism must be destroyed once and for all as early as possible. Our country has always supported and is prepared to continue .providing comprehensive assistance and support to the peoples fighting for their freedom and independence, for the complete liquidation of colonialism, racism and apartheid.\n165.\tA year has now passed since the bloody coup staged by the military junta in Chile. However, the anger of peoples who resolutely condemned the crimes of the Fascist junta has not subsided. The terrorist regime in Chile has been condemned by all peoples and constitutes a threat to the progressive achievements of Latin America. The hysterical demagoguery that the protege of the hangmen of the Chilean people has been constantly resorting to here, under the pretext of the right of reply, will not wash from the hands of the Fascist junta and its henchmen the blood of President Allende and dozens of thousands of the best sons and daughters of Chile.\n166.\tIt is our belief that the United Nations should raise the voice of protest against the suppression of democratic rights and freedoms, against the executions and the savage treatment meted out to the democrats and people of Chile, and demand that the Chilean junta immediately set free L. Corvalan and all other Chilean democrats and patriots languishing in the torture chambers of the junta.\n167.\tWith the support of the socialist community and all progressive forces of the world, the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America are waging a struggle for genuine economic liberation, for the liquidation of neo-colonialism and the remnants of the colonial past to which the existing system of relations between developed capitalist States and the third world belongs.\n168.\tA significant step forward towards the establishment of new, more equitable international economic relations was made at the sixth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, convened on the initiative of the developing countries with the support and active participation of the socialist States. The session demonstrated that the developing countries no longer intend to remain the object of exploitation by foreign monopolistic capital or the so-called multinational corporations. It is of special significance that, despite resistance on the part of the States to which those corporations belong, the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order adopted at the special session embody the sovereign rights of each State to its own natural resources and to effective control over them and their exploitation, including the right of nationalization. In the course of the session the present system of plundering of the natural resources of the developing countries by imperialist monopolies was severely condemned. There are increasing demands for a consistent limitation to the intermediary role of international monopolies in world trade and the elimination from economic relations of all manifestations of neo-colonialist and imperialist exploitation.\n169.\tWe are firmly convinced that economic relations among States must be built on the basis of the new principles promulgated in the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order \\\"based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and co-operation among all States, irrespective of their economic and social systems\\\".\n170.\tPutting those principles into effect will promote the democratization of international economic ties. The present session, we feel, should take measures to put into practice the decisions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly on the strengthening of the economic independence of the developing countries. At the same time it must be stressed that the conquest of the economic backwardness and the economic dependence of young States will be facilitated if they carry out far-reaching socio-economic reforms with the aim of eliminating the obstacles to the development of their productive forces.\n171.\tThe resources which could be released as a result of effective measures in the field of disarmament could make a substantial contribution to the acceleration of economic and social development in all countries, including developing countries. The economic progress of peoples would be facilitated by the practical implementation of the proposal, adopted on the initiative of the Soviet Union, to reduce by 10 per cent the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)], since such a measure would signify both a curbing of the arms race and the allocation of part of the considerable resources thus saved for additional assistance to developing countries.\n172.\tThe need to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations has been repeatedly stressed in the course of the general debate at this session. All the experience of the work of the Organization irrefutably shows that its effectiveness can be improved only on the basis of strict observance of the Charter and the implementation of decisions of the Security Council and other United Nations bodies.\n173.\tThe Charter of the United Nations enshrines the most important basic principles of contemporary \n174.\tinternational relations, principles which throughout the existence of the United Nations have been generally recognized in international law and further confirmed in relations among States. The Charter of the United Nations has stood the test of time and proved its viability under present conditions. At times, critics of the Charter question the principle of unanimity in the Security Council, but anyone who feels that way is either deliberately discarding the idea or in the heat of the debate is forgetting the fact that the United Nations itself is based on the principle of unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council and that the effectiveness of its actions depends precisely on that unanimity. The abolition of that fundamental principle could be used in the United Nations system to serve the narrow interests of individual major States or groups of such States, which would undermine the principles of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems at the very time when those principles are becoming ever more firmly established in international practice. We therefore resolutely oppose preparing plans for the revision- or what is known as the \\\"correction\\\" -of the Charter of the United Nations, which is the most outstanding international document of modern times.\n175.\tIn these days of October, when the world, in accordance with tradition, will be celebrating United Nations Day, it seems appropriate to refer to the time when the foundations of the United Nations were laid. The very creation of the Organization became possible as a result of the historic victory of the United Nations over the dark forces of nazism and aggression. In the great battle for a happy future for mankind, enormous sacrifices were offered on the altar of victory by the peoples of the Soviet Union, including the people of the Ukraine, which is now celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the liberation of the Soviet Ukraine from the Fascist invaders. The heroic exploit of the Soviet people is of world-wide significance and will remain forever in the grateful memory of a mankind firmly resolved to prevent any recurrence of the horrors of the past.\n176.\tIn these days we are continuously addressing ourselves to what is clearly and unambiguously defined in the Charter as the main and critical direction of United Nations activities: \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". Quite a lot has been done in this respect, and what has been done represents a powerful thrust forward towards an ever fuller use of the possibilities enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations towards truly effective and fruitful activities by the United Nations in strengthening international peace and security.\n177.\tWe look to the future with optimism, for we are convinced that the forces of peace and progress are irresistible. All peace-loving peoples stand for detente, for rational forms of international relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n178.\tWe are convinced that the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will make a weighty contribution to the noble cause of strengthening international peace and security and to the cause of eliminating the threat of war and the creation of a world in which all peoples can live without war or the alarms of war, enjoying the benefits of social progress.\n"

        "file_text": "It would of course be more appropriate for Prince Souvanna Phouma, our Prime Minister, to head the delegation of Laos to the General Assembly. But Prince Souvanna Phouma has only recently been ill and must still spend some time convalescing. It is therefore my duty to head the delegation of Laos to this session of the General Assembly.\n45.\tIt is a great honor and a great pleasure for me to represent at the twenty ninth session of this Assembly the Kingdom of Laos, which, having formed its Provisional Government of National Union and its National Political Coalition Council, has entered a new stage in its history.\n46.\tMay I be permitted, on behalf of my country, to associate myself with previous speakers and extend to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the eminent representative of the glorious People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, a country in the vanguard of the nonaligned countries, our warmest and sincerest congratulations on his unanimous election to the office of President of the current session.\n47.\tI would offer my congratulations also to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the SecretaryGeneral, on his tireless and persevering efforts and the inexhaustible energy he has devoted to the cause Of peace and international detente.\n48.\tI likewise offer my cordial and respectful greetings to all the representatives present here, to whom also I express my profound gratitude for their feelings of friendship and fraternal sympathy with regard to my country. They have my best wishes for good health and success in their noble undertaking.\n49.\tThe political program of the Government, recently adopted by the National Political Coalition Council in conformity with the Vientiane Agreement, clearly reaffirms the policy of the Kingdom of Laos in favor of genuine peace, independence and neutrality. Moreover, as a member of the great family of nonaligned countries, the Provisional Government of National Union of Laos would wish to express from this rostrum, its position with regard to the various international problems, in conformity with the Political Declaration and the resolutions of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries, held in Algiers in September 1973.\n50.\tThe year that has just passed has witnessed new and important victories in the struggle of peoples throughout the entire world for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress. In' all continents the peoples are strengthening their solidarity and intensifying their struggle against the policy of enslavement and exploitation carried on by the imperialists, colonialists and neo-colonialists, their struggle to reconquer and safeguard their fundamental national rights, to safeguard their countries' resources and to regain their due status in international relations. Those victories are reflected in this General Assembly itself by the number of its Members, which has grown considerably over the past few years through the admission of countries that have recently reconquered their independence.\n51.\tThus it is with a feeling of deep emotion and admiration that my Government and the people of Laos salute the entry of three new Members into the Organization\u2014Bangladesh, GuineaBissau and Grenada aware as we are of the enormous efforts and the numerous sacrifices made by the leaders and peoples of those countries before they achieved their sacred goal.\n52.\tThese happy results clearly demonstrate the imperative necessity henceforth to view world peace and the independence of peoples as the ultimate purpose of all policy. Our human community is faced with enormous tasks. Certain of them, such as the struggle for national liberation, the fight against hunger, the problems of pollution, overpopulation and the exhaustion of energy resources, are closely linked to posterity, to the freedom of mankind and to survival itself in an already gravely threatened environment.. There is indeed a law that can be stated, and that is that human nature aspires to happiness and freedom, and that whatever system will make it possible for these two fundamental aspirations to succeed will be the one that our human consciousness will recognize as the best. This, I believe, is not the profession of faith of a small Buddhist country; it is also a political philosophy on which we shall have to come to agreement.\n53.\tAlso, in view of what I have just stated, the delegation of Laos expresses its disapproval of whatever remains of the colonialist and imperialist spirit throughout the world. We suffer as .we continue to see immense territories still being exploited by a colonialism that concerns itself solely with profits and not with morality and respect for man. We hail the heroic struggle of our brothers to free themselves from slavery to the colonialists and neo-colonialists and to conquer and defend their independence and freedom. This just struggle for national liberation has a. sacred significance for all people conscious of their dignity, and we wholly and wholeheartedly endorse it.\n54.\tIn speaking of the practical results of world policy, we likewise salute the initiative taken in convening the sixth special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of discussing problems relating to raw materials and development, as well as the initiative taken for the drafting of a charter of rights governing access to the wealth of the sea ~by all countries, including both those with no coastlines and those that enjoy better geographical situation. The time has come for devising some equitable distribution of those riches. No country should be granted privileges on the pretext that the great Powers have at their disposal facilities denied to other countries. Many nations are at present attempting to find an acceptable and just modus vivendi capable of remedying many aspects of the economic backwardness of the third world, including the problem of hunger that exists in certain vast areas an intolerable problem, when we see millions of human beings lacking the very minimum for their subsistence. We are gratified that from this lofty rostrum their cries of suffering are being heard, and that compassion has been aroused and that people are working to assist their neighbors in distress.\n.55. Since, in the last analysis, it is always a question of the struggle of peoples for their emancipation, we are bound to speak of the war in IndoChina and the directions it has taken. In that part of the world, the peoples have suffered and continue to suffer from an unending slaughter, the sole cause of which is the aggressive policy of the imperialist forces. Thus it is that in Cambodia battles are still raging, imperiling millions of lives and causing damage to artistic treasures of inestimable value.\n56. Thus also in Viet Nam, despite the signing of the Paris Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet Nam some 20 months ago, the fighting has not stopped. It is obvious that the peoples of the IndoChinese countries are closely bound by ties that have existed for centuries ties woven by history, politics and sentiments. The peace and independence of the three IndoChinese countries are closely bound up together. As one of the signatories of the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the countries of IndoChina and the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos, the Provisional Government of National Union of Laos believes that the peoples of Laos, Cambodia and Viet Nam must reinforce their solidarity and mutual support in their struggle against imperialist aggression and interference with a view to the full realization of the fundamental national rights of each people. It is precisely for this very reason that strict compliance with the Vientiane Agreement on Laos and similar compliance with the Paris Agreement on Viet Nam are closely linked, as they are linked with the struggle for the peace and independence of our brothers the Khmer people.\n57.\tThe Provisional Government of National Union of Laos respects the Paris Agreement on Viet Nam and firmly supports the struggle of the Vietnamese people for strict compliance with that Agreement, which implies the reaffirmation of the fundamental national rights of the Vietnamese people, the cessation of military action and imperialist interference and the solution of the political problem of South Viet Nam through reconciliation and national concord between the two Governments of South Viet Nam in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of the people of that country.\n58.\tThe Provisional Government of National Union of Laos firmly supports the struggle of the Khmer people against the policy of aggression and imperialist intervention and for an independent, peaceful, neutral, sovereign, democratic and prosperous Cambodia, secure in its territorial integrity.\n59.\tLastly, I would venture to speak to you of the problems of the Kingdom of Laos, being convinced that this Assembly will understand the reasons we have for presenting them to you again reasons stemming solely from our search for peace and national concord.\n60.\tAs you are aware, the people of Laos has waged a long and victorious patriotic struggle against imperialism. Thanks to the firm will for independence and peace on the part of the whole Laotian people, and to the immense patience and self-denial of Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince Soupha nouvong, the Vientiane Agreement and its Protocol were signed, asserting once again the fundamental national rights and the neutrality of Laos, reestablishing peace throughout the entire Kingdom, and bringing about national concord step by step. After 20 years of fierce fighting, this result is considerable and has been warmly applauded by the Laotian people and perhaps also by all peoples friendly to Laos. Little by little, a great tranquility has settled upon that peaceful Kingdom the great tranquility of the countryside, once peaceful and prosperous. And now our 700,000 refugees, who had been obliged to leave their villages during the war, are encouraged in their hopes to return in the near future.\n61.\tThe two parties in Laos, with the approval of the whole Laotian people, have agreed to participate in the new Government which was formed after the Agreement of 21 February 1973 and the Protocol of 14 September 1973. This new Provisional Government of National Union views its principal tasks as the implementation of the Vientiane Agreement and the completion of the process of national reconciliation so that the Laotian people, shortly after the Kingdom wide general elections, will have a new, functioning Government* freely elected by the people, within a constitutional framework of the kind we wish for a peaceful, independent, sovereign, democratic, neutral and unified Laos, which we shall endeavor to make prosperous through our own efforts and with the intensive and unqualified assistance of friendly countries.\n62.\tThe Provisional Government of National Union of Laos, faithfully following its policy of peace and neutrality in conformity with the Vientiane Agreement and its Protocol, is concentrating, and will continue to concentrate, all its efforts on consolidating peace and strengthening national independence, preserving the Provisional Government of National Union and the National Political Coalition Council and strengthening national concord, internationally, the Provisional Government of National Union is pursuing a policy of peace, independence and neutrality. It advocates ties of friendship with all countries, especially with its neighbors, on the basis of respect for the five principles of peaceful coexistence. Laos will make its positive contribution to the common cause of the nonaligned countries, and is actively supporting the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America against colonialism and neocolonialism and for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress. While relying upon its own resources for the national reconstruction, it will seek unconditional assistance from all countries that, whatever their political regime, may wish to help Laos bind up the wounds of war and rebuild a country devastated by a long, destructive war.\n63.\tThe total withdrawal of all troops and all foreign military personnel from the territory of Laos and from all the neighboring countries will help to strengthen peace in Laos and reinforce the ties of friendship among the peoples of that part of the world. The struggle of the Laotian people against all attempts to sabotage peace and in favor of the proper implementation of the Vientiane Agreement is a long and arduous one; but because it is a just struggle, the Laotian people will be able to* overcome all difficulties and obstacles and will surely achieve final victory.\n64.\tThe people of Laos, redoubling its vigilance and strengthening its national union, is determined to fight resolutely for the full and strict application of the Vientiane Agreement, the maintenance of peace, the consolidation of independence and the complete achievement of national concord. It is resolved not to permit a repetition of the unfortunate circumstances of previous coalitions and to safeguard its fundamental national rights.\n65.\tWe are firmly convinced that countries and peoples represented in this Assembly that desire peace, freedom and justice will continue to support us in our struggle for the proper implementation of the Vientiane Agreement and to give us all the effective aid necessary for our national construction.\n66.\tI shall conclude my statement by offering my sincere thanks to the friendly countries which have been good enough to give us their disinterested assistance, as well as to those who will be willing to provide their help in the future for the healing of the wounds of war and the reconstruction of our country, thus bringing about a substantial improvement in the living standards of our people and ensuring real and lasting peace and national concord in Laos.\n67.\tMay this year see peace and national concord in Laos strengthened, new victories won by the peoples fighting for peace and national independence and, finally, world peace safeguarded That is the ardent wish of the people of Laos.\n"

        "file_text": "\nMr. President, it is most fitting that the twenty-ninth session of the. General Assembly is presided over by an illustrious son of Africa. For it is Africa which, in recent months and after dramatic events elsewhere, has been destined to reap the fruits of its labor after a Hong but determined struggle to liberate itself completely from colonial shackles. Today it is Guinea-Bissau; to morrow is soon to come.\n197.\tWe also salute you as a distinguished personality of Algeria and the Arab world, whose ancient civilization and glorious achievements provide a solid basis for the present and future progress of a large and significant segment of the world's population. For this Organization, the active participation of the Arab delegations in its work has a continuing and profound impact on every important issue before it. Your eminent record in the fight for freedom and your progressive ideas will indeed prove to be important assets as you steer the proceedings of the present session to a just and successful conclusion.\n198.\tMy delegation would also like to pay a sincere tribute to Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador, who, as President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly as well as of its sixth special session, guided our deliberations through one of the most momentous and challenging periods in the Organization's history. Thanks to his diplomatic skill and legal scholarship, as well as to his infinite patience and wisdom, the past year has been a truly productive one for the United Nations.\n199.\tWe were deeply shocked by the news from Honduras of the terrible havoc and devastation caused by the recent hurricane. Permit me, therefore, to convey the profound sympathy on behalf of the Thai people to the people of Honduras for their tragic losses and human suffering.\n200.\tWe warmly welcome into our midst the delegations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, following their admission to membership in the United Nations. It is rather significant that the three latest Members of the Organization belong to the three component parts of the third world, which is striving, in co-operation with others, to achieve economic progress and social justice for the international community as a whole. We are Confident that their presence among us and their contributions to the work at this session and in the future will be of immense value to all their colleagues in the United Nations.\n201.\tI bring with me to this august international gathering the goodwill of the people of my country, Thailand. Goodwill is, in my belief, an essential dis-position of the mind at the time when one is to embark upon an analysis or discussion of problems and conflicts. Without goodwill as the guiding factor, the road to understanding and solution will indeed be a difficult one and will only lead to a rigidity of views and a selfishness of attitude. So it is with an ample store of goodwill that my delegation now approaches the task at hand.\n202.\tIn view of the series of crises in recent years, both economic and monetary, it is not surprising that the States Members of the United Nations, developing and developed alike, will give high priority and attention to economic issues at this twenty-ninth session. My delegation agrees with the view of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, that the economic upheavals and portents of the past three years are not a series of isolated events, but are rather symptoms of a profound malfunctioning of the global economy. The high prices of oil, the spiraling inflation, the inflated costs of manufactured products, the non-availability of fertilizers, the grim prospect of a substantial decrease in food production and the breakdown of the international monetary system are all interrelated events which could result in prolonged economic stagnation on a global scale, a stagnation of extraordinary dimensions.\n203.\tThe historic sixth special session last May, which was convened on the timely initiative of President Houari Boumediene of Algeria, has greatly contributed to the international awareness of economic inequities in the world, and the recognition of the new international economic order and the adoption of the Program of Action has provided a constructive answer to the shortcomings of the present world economic system. My delegation will continue to give its support and co-operation to all practical measures which will ensure the full implementation of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. It is our sincere hope that the lack of political will on the part of some industrialized countries will yield to the spirit of co-operation between all nations, large and small, that must prevail in order to find an effective means to solve the economic problems which confront all of us. Only in this way can we. build a new society of nations based on an equitable redistribution of wealth and opportunity for all mankind.\n204.\tIn this connexion, my delegation looks forward to the adoption of the draft Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States at this session. The adoption of that Charter, in our view, would constitute an indispensable Step towards the realization, of the new international economic order. It would also facilitate our tasks in restructuring the present economic system on a more equitable basis, thus contributing to the success of the seventh special session on development and international economic co-operation in September of next year.\n205.\tAlthough Thailand is not classified as one of the countries most severely affected by the recent economic crisis, we have by no means benefited from it. On the contrary, the effects of the high prices of oil, fertilizers and imported manufactured goods, as well as world-wide inflation have been felt in all sectors of our economy. Being basically an agricultural country, Thailand has to rely mainly on exports of agricultural commodities at equitable prices for its foreign exchange earnings. Nevertheless, even before the recent energy crisis, Thailand's balance of trade, particularly with industrialized countries, has consistently been unfavorable to our side.\n206.\tOur need for high-cost capital goods and manufactured products, price fluctuations of agricultural exports, as well as unfair and non-commercial com-petition by rich producers for our traditional markets, have all contributed to this unsatisfactory state of affairs. And now the sudden Shortage and the increase in prices of fertilizers by over 100 per cent in 1972 and 1973 has compounded our difficulty, with repercussions in the domestic situation due to the rise in the prices of staples for our own population. Without fertilizers, food production in developing countries at the level of past years will not be ensured, much less will there be an increase in production or a surplus for exports.\n207.\tIn the light of these developments, the responsibility of the world community to double its efforts to forestall the danger of a food crisis and to save the world from the scourge of hunger and starvation has become even more urgent. There aire already millions of people in the Sahel region and in other parts of Africa and Asia who are undergoing the agony of hunger and starvation. The trend is that millions more will be added to the list if the process of desertification continues and if the levels of food and agricultural production cannot be increased.\n201). My delegation, therefore, agrees with the view expressed by several other delegations that a global policy is needed to meet man's immediate and- long- term need for food. We are hopeful that such a policy will emerge from the forthcoming World Food Conference to be held in Rome in. November. Being a surplus food producer, Thailand has always given favourable consideration to the needs of neighbouring and other friendly countries and hopes to participate actively and constructively in the Conference.\n209.\tNevertheless, my delegation has stressed time and again, here as well as in other forums, that there are significant differences between a rich producer and a needy producer. A needy producer, such as Thailand, is threatened constantly by price fluctuations, scarcity of essential inputs and unfair and non-commercial competition by i.eh producers. In this context, my delegation strongly believes that in striving for a global policy every effort should be made to ensure a fair balance of interests between food- exporting and food-importing countries, bearing in mind the special needs of peoples beset by national calamities and economic crises as well as the precarious position of those developing nations whose populations depend on the production and export of agricultural commodities for their livelihood and well- being.\n210.\tAnother important world conference very closely related to world food problems was recently concluded at Bucharest namely, the World Population Conference. My delegation supports the World Population Plan of Action adopted by the Conference, which has brought into proper focus the inter-relationship between population and socio-economic development in accordance with the spirit of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. Although my country continues to advocate family planning as a means of curbing population growth, we also subscribe to the idea that every country has every right to formulate its own population policy, and that such policy can-not be wholly effective if it is implemented outside the context of social and economic development.\n211.\tOn the African continent, which has been subjected to the worst kinds of colonialism and exploitation, the white, minority regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia continue to pursue their abhorrent racist policies against the peoples of those lands in violation of human rights and in defiance of the denunciations and the revulsion of the whole world, as expressed in the resolutions of the United Nations. In this connexion, Thailand was one of those delegations which yesterday [2248th meeting] voted for rejection of the credentials of the representative of South Africa as well as for the resolution calling upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa [resolution 3207 (XXIX)].\n212.\tWe address an urgent appeal, therefore, to those nations that still practise apartheid, oppression and colonialism to adhere to the course charted by the United Nations in these matters. Thailand unreservedly expresses its full support for the just struggle of the African peoples striving towards freedom and independence and the preservation of their natural wealth, and calls upon the international Organization to exert all its efforts to assist their legitimate struggle.\n213.\tWith regard to the question of Territories under Portuguese domination, the changes relating to those Territories have signaled the beginning of a new era of hope and expectation for the achievement of the long-fought-for freedom and independence of millions of Africans. The new Government of Portugal has indicated its categorical rejection of the colonialist policy of the previous regime, as well as its full acceptance of the relevant international provisions concerning decolonization. In this connexion, Thailand welcomes the enlightened and co-operative attitude of the present Government of Portugal towards the work of the competent United Nations organs concerned with decolonization. Although the recent developments have been heartening, only through total and unambiguous decolonization can the reign of peace be restored in Mozambique and Angola, the Territories remaining under Portuguese domination.\n214.\tThe victory achieved by the people of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is a great inspiration to all those engaged in the struggle for the liberation of the continent of Africa, particularly in those parts of Africa, including Namibia, still under colonial control. It gives the people of Africa fresh hope, and a new impetus, that their goal of total liberation of the continent will soon be realized.\n215.\tSome of the most disturbing developments have occurred in the field of disarmament. The staggering increase in the world's expenditure on arms cannot be satisfactorily explained by spiraling inflation alone. The growing investment of the world's available capital in weapons, unmatched by the level of expenditure on more economically productive ventures, tends to slow down any international effort to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor nations. The continuing nuclear proliferation, which helps to divert world attention from the nuclear Powers already in possession of an over-kill capability, may further weaken their will to carry out their responsibilities in the manner expected cf them by the international community.\n216.\tIt is also noteworthy that the important items relating to disarmament have been added to the Assembly's agenda while consideration of the older items is languishing in the face of serious differences among the major Powers themselves or the indifference of some of them to the interests of smaller nations.\n217.\tProgress towards the future convening of a world disarmament conference has been hampered by continued lack of unanimity on the part of the nu-clear Powers whose participation is, in our view, essential to its success. The proposal to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace has met with various arguments concerning global strategy in justification of those Powers' military presence in the area. It is perhaps not too much to hope that the interests of the littoral States will also be taken into account and that a policy of restraint leading to a reduction of big-Power rivalry and contention in the Indian Ocean will ultimately prevail, thus translating that worthy idea into concrete action. My delegation remains committed to that effort, as well as to the regional endeavor under the auspices of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN], to turn South-East Asia into a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality free from all forms of external interference.\n218.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has already acquired the distinction of being the largest international conference ever held in the history of man. Despite the enormous complexities involved, the Caracas session was able to achieve significant progress. Some of the delay in substantive work was unavoidable, due to the unprecedented procedural questions and the necessary allocation of time for the general debate. However, on such items as the international regime and machinery, where the issues were more or less clear-cut, it was unfortunate that no further progress was made owing to the unwarranted attitude of some developed countries, which threatens to undermine the common- heritage principle itself. Since the fundamental principle forms the bedrock of the emerging international law of the sea, and was, in fact, the initial raison d'etre for the Conference, there should be no misunderstanding of the import of this unhappy state of affairs.\n219.\tOn the other hand, my delegation is pleased to note the growing unity of the developing countries on these issues, based on their firm adherence to the common-heritage principle, as well as their recognition of the realities which demand a certain element of flexibility in their approach. My delegation believes that if the developing countries remain steadfast in their determination, as well as flexible whenever the situation requires, they will be able to contribute to the successful outcome of the Conference. Such a development would be most welcome, as it would ensure the early utilization of valuable sea-bed resources for the benefit of all mankind.\n220.\tMany small nations, including my own, maintain a continuing interest in the progress of detente on the international scene, for we are as hopeful as ever that the process of accommodation and its out-come will be of universal benefit in the avoidance of armed conflicts and the promotion of world peace. Detente, in our perception, should not, however, be restricted to the conduct of global strategies by the major Powers in relation to one another; on the contrary, it should also have the beneficial effect of restraining local conflicts which could eventually lead to a wider conflagration. Moreover, detente is not a cure-all. Remedies must also be applied to the ills which constitute the causes of conflicts.\n221.\tIn the Middle East, where the present lull may be attributed in part to the exercise of self-restraint by the major Powers, no lasting settlement will be possible unless and until the legitimate rights of the Palestinians are met. Therefore my delegation welcomes the inclusion of the question of Palestine as a new and separate item on the Assembly's agenda. In so doing, we have also taken into account the views of the great majority of countries situated close to the area. We urge Israel to withdraw from its occupation of Arab territories, and in the meantime to desist from the usurpation of Arab rights in the occupied territories, as well as from other practices in contravention of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\n222.\tThe tragic situation in Cyprus has also been brought to the attention of the world and is once again an important item of business for the Organization. My delegation earnestly hopes that a just solution will be found which will ensure for all the people of Cyprus the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of their country.\n223.\tIn connexion with the recent developments in the Middle East and Cyprus, the Thai delegation 362\nwould wish to place on record its sincere appreciation of the indispensable role of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. We should like also to pay a tribute to all the members of the United Nations forces on duty in the three areas concerned, as well as tc the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of international peace.\n224.\tI now turn to an area which is geographically closer to Thailand and whose future well-being and stability will have direct repercussions on all the States of South-East Asia. The strife and turmoil which have existed in IndoChina in the past 25 years have brought untold sorrow and suffering to the peoples in the area, yet the prospects for peace and harmony are today really not much greater than they were a year ago.\n225.\tIn South Viet Nam, the Paris Peace Agreement which was so painstakingly and successfully negotiated in 1973 fails to bring about peaceful conditions and the settlement that we all desire. War, on a smaller scale but no less ferocious, continues unhampered by obligations solemnly undertaken in the Paris Agreement. Non-observance of the Agreement is the major stumbling block to its full implementation. My delegation would therefore like to urge the parties concerned to demonstrate a stronger political will to ensure strict observance of both the letter and the spirit of the Paris Agreement. In this connexion, I would like to express our appreciation to the Governments of Iran, Indonesia, Poland at. J Hungary for their continued willingness to serve as members of the International Commission of Control and Supervision. We hope that their services, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, will contribute to the restoration of genuine peace in Viet Nam.\n226.\tRecent developments in the political field in the Kingdom of Laos have been more encouraging. The political will, so lacking in other political conflicts, appears to be the motivating force which has moved the Lao factions to engage in serious talks and reach a compromise agreement on the formation of the Provisional Government of National Union and the National Political Coalition Council in Laos. That Government, under the effective and impartial leader-ship of Prince Souvanna Phoui , to whom we send our best wishes for a speedy recovery, has been functioning for some months now. It is the cherished hope and belief of the Kingdom of Thailand, as a sister nation, that with its present set-up Laos will have a greater chance of success in preserving its independence, neutrality and territorial integrity. My Government extends its support and full co-operation to the Government and people of Laos in their efforts to achieve peace and stability, which cannot fail to have a positive impact on neighboring States.\n227.\tUnlike the situation in Laos, where a common desire and determination displayed by all Laotian sides enabled the parties to arrive at a peaceful settlement of their problems, the political conflict in the Khmer Republic remains unresolved. The tragic suffering endured by the Khmer people is a source of deep concern not only to Thailand but also to all other States in the region. We in Thailand, who have close historical and cultural ties with the Khmers, have no other wish but to see peace and tranquility return to the country,\n228.\tThailand's basic approach towards the question of Cambodian representation has not changed. We continue to maintain that the Khmer people them-selves should be allowed to solve their own political problems peacefully, free from outside intervention in whatever form. Such political settlement should be reached by the indigenous parties concerned, and nothing should be done in the United Nations which may prejudge the decision of the Khmer people and which may prolong the suffering and the loss of lives and property, including cultural treasures, in the Khmer Republic.\n229.\tOur views are not basest on personal preference for this or that personality. Nt>r do we concern our-selves with political ideology of this or that leadership. On the contrary, the attitude of my Government is governed by historical facts, the actual situation on the ground, and our firm adherence to the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of a State.\n230.\tIt is a historical fact that the leader of the former Government of Cambodia was removed from power not by force but by a vote in the national parliament in accordance with its own constitution. It is also a fact that the present leadership came into power not by the use of force but through constitutional means.\n231.\tThe present situation shows that the present and legitimate leadership in the Khmer Republic has effective control and support of the major portion of its population. The seat of its Government Continues to be in Phnom Penh, the capital of the country. On the other hand, the other leadership, which is said to control some parts of the country, is a Government- in-exile with its headquarters in the capital of another State.\n232.\tIt is the considered view of my Government that the United Nations has neither the authority nor the jurisdiction to exercise self-determination for the Khmer people. The choice is theirs and theirs alone. Any United Nations action which is tantamount to a change of national leadership in the Khmer Republic is sheer interference in the domestic affairs of the Khmer people, and would create such an undesirable precedent that a government-in-exile of any independent State might challenge the legally constituted government within the State itself. Instead, the United Nations would do well to respond to the appeal made by the Government of the Khmer Republic at Phnom Penh on 9 July 1974 by, giving support to all Khmers, whatever side they are on, and assisting them in bringing about the talks, without prior conditions, with a view to achieving a just and lasting peace guaranteeing the independence, neutrality and territorial integrity of the Khmer nation.\n233.\tThailand will continue its policy of good-neighborliness and peaceful co-operation with all States in the area, irrespective of their political inclination or economic orientation. The security interests of each State in the nation can only be safeguarded by strict compliance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence. In this respect, Thailand will not be found wanting.\n234.\tRegional co-operation continues to be an important goal of Thailand's foreign policy. My delegation would like to refer in particular to the efforts of ASEAN to intensify and broaden the scope of co-operation among member countries. It is with a keen awareness of collective responsibility born out of experience that we in ASEAN have adopted and continued the practice of regular consultations as a means of dealing with important matters affecting the peace and stability of our region.\n235.\tMy delegation recalls with satisfaction that the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly witnessed the participation, for the first time, of both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the discussion of the Korean item. My delegation sincerely believes that the participation of both sides in the work of the Organization produced a positive result and that the consensus which finally emerged with the endorsement of both sides had a beneficial effect on the situation in that part of the world.\n236.\tFrom the beginning, Thailand has actively contributed to the United Nations efforts in Korea, which were based on the legitimate right of the Korean people to decide their own destiny, peacefully and free from coercion. Consequently, my delegation whole-heartedly welcomed the joint communique of 4 July 1972 establishing a dialog between the two sides and paving the way for their constructive co-operation and peaceful reunification. Thus, we sup-ported the dissolution of the United Nations Com-mission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, which during its existence had performed a useful role.\n\n237.\tAgainst this background it is deeply regrettable to note that the appeal for a widening of many- sided exchanges and co-operation between the South and the North, as envisaged in the consensus statement,\\\" has not been fully answered. It has become apparent that the North-South dialog has made little substantive progress. Moreover, there have also been other incidents which could exacerbate existing tensions on the Korean peninsula. There is, therefore, an even more urgent need at present for both parties namely, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to try to find accommodation with each other within the framework of last year's consensus, and to continue and carry to a successful conclusion the endeavor, which can only be to their own direct benefit and be conducive to the lessening of tension in that important part of Asia and the world.\n238.\tWith regard to the United Nations Command in Korea, we maintain our conviction that any decision concerning its future should be taken by the appropriate United Nations organ that is, the Security Council in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.\n239.\tWhile the past 12 months have brought forth many momentous developments in the life of the United Nations, Thailand itself has also undergone innovative and evolutionary changes in the national life. The events of October last, led by the student movement, resulted in the change of our Government and has enabled the nation to improve upon its constitutional and political institutions. Respect for political and civil liberties is no longer an ideal but has truly become an everyday fact. Democracy, with the full participation of all people under constitutional rule, which will be reflected in the general elections due to be held early next year, is designed to promote economic development and social justice for the equal benefit of all people. This new trend is a source of pride for our Government and people and, we hope, will strengthen national unity and ensure progress for the whole nation. We believe that such a development will contribute to greater understanding and harmony among all States in the region of South-East Asia.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of Paraguay, we greet the illustrious President of this universal Assembly and express to him our most whole-hearted congratulations and our certainty that owing to his knowledge, vast experience, spirit of fairness and sense of service to the international community, this vast international gathering is assured of success from the very beginning of its work.\n136.\tTo former President Mr. Leopoldo Benites, we express our appreciation for the manner in which he guided the past session of the General Assembly, lending lustre to the Latin American presence iii this world conclave with his valuable experience and skill.\n137.\tOur joyful and brotherly greetings go to the States which have recently joined the Organization. We are happy to have them with us and we wish them every success in their undertakings.\n138.\tWe also greet the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and on this solemn occasion we wish to say to him that Paraguay fully appreciates the assistance and support it has been receiving from the United Nations and which constitute a most important factor in our development.\n139.\tAt the beginning of our statement we wish to express to the sister Republic of Honduras our deep and sincere solidarity, and our deep sorrow for the tragedy that has befallen it, to which all the preceding speakers have referred. It is our hope that United Nations solidarity will find concrete form in effective aid and co-operation, and not in these and other words, however expressive they may be.\n140.\tThe world picture has not altered fundamentally since the twenty-eighth session, although it is true that some positive progress has been achieved in peace and in the general detente among the great Powers.\n141.\tPeace and development are and continue to be the main goals of our Organization, it being understood that, as has been said, there is no peace without development, just as there is no development without peace. Peace continues to be the guiding star and the hope of all peoples on earth, wherever they are. Above all, peace with honor, with human dignity, with effective justice, without dominance, or situations of force or obvious inequity, in whatever form. Peace resulting from a situation of scorn for the supreme values of justice has no foundation. Peace which is not based on the heart and mind open to brotherly greetings is built on sand, and has no real basis. Peace which is not the result of a positive effort to improve the economic and social situations for the majority of peoples, harassed by the grave problems of under-development, can have no firm footing or long life.\n142.\tPeace must necessarily be viewed from above, beyond all geographical, regional or ideological differences, beyond the desires of individuals, or of groups or subgroups. There must be only one peace for all, in a world made better for all, where distribution is just, with a sound economy and equitable international trade at the service of free man. Therefore, the only course, the only way to peace is the development of all peoples.\n143.\tPeace still suffers violent disturbances, an affront to mankind. In this Assembly and in other appropriate places it is customary to sing the praises of peace and vow to serve it unconditionally. Yet the passage of time brings us Jeep disenchantment and disappointment. How many times in the course of this year of 1974 have the communications media not brought us the sad news of hatred, of violence between brothers and neighboring peoples, the play of overweening appetites, of the criminal assault of man against man, of the velvet glove, at the propaganda level, concealing beneath it the greedy hand of domination or influence, in some part of the world.\n144.\tTerrorism continues to destroy lives and property in brazen defiance of civilization itself. Kidnapping intrudes its hated presence into our daily lives. It is time to think seriously about these ills, which disturb the development of mankind and make us doubt our own culture. In this ignoble work the men of violence admit of no reason and respect no values. At times they respond with further terrorist action to favorable treatment from governments and organizations which, in a moment of weakness, had tolerated their actions or tried to justify the use of such ignoble means.\n145.\tTerrorism is a boomerang which in the end strikes or threatens all in its mad frenzy and in its abysmal scorn for the respect for the life of another. Those who shelter, encourage, or are merely indifferent to acts of terrorism carried out in other countries are miscalculating. Sooner or later, terrorism will do away with its own protectors, and with those who are in-different, too.\n146.\tDuring the days when we are meeting here, violence and terrorism have seized new victims, as if they wished to take this opportunity for more wide-spread publicity, or more effective intimidation.\n147.\tPeace requires the purity of a noble spirit on the part of those, who govern and their peoples, of countries and of ideologies. We must do away with the hotbeds of war, violence and terrorism, in striving zealously for the spiritual disarmament. It would be of no avail to put an end to disorder, to armed confrontation, to the advance of armies and to the dread wave of terrorism, if we do not first seek with conviction to eliminate hatred, and the cult of violence and ideological extremism in the minds of men, particularly among those who decide matters on this earth.\n148.\tWe still speak the language of peace, while the minds of men retain mental reservations which in advance set up barriers to the objective triumph of justice. We still speak the language of peace, but behind the scenes the resolve is only to look after selfish interests, without recognizing the right of developing countries to better conditions for their peoples. We still speak the language of peace when, in fact, we are seeking the triumph of one special interest over another.\n149.\tA false dialog is sought through confrontation without arms, but confrontation which after all seeks only the strengthening of certain groups, sects or ideologies which are determined to overthrow many established values because of their desire for immediate successes for their cause.\n150.\tThe United Nations is expanding and is growing stronger as new Members are admitted to it. Its universality is a sign of the modern times and betokens the fact that the United Nations no longer, as of yore, accepts the isolation of peoples and nations from its own structure. The Organization seeks, through its universality, to represent all mankind without odious or unfair discrimination which, ab initio, reduces the chances of effective action seeking the well-being of all peoples.\n151.\tThe world has not lost faith in the Organization. On the contrary , the world demands of the United Nations a realistic and vital attitude in order to enable it to meet every contingency, particularly at the political level, which is the most difficult but the one closest to peace and justice.\n152.\tThe mere action of bilateral diplomacy, miraculous though it sometimes is, must be followed by United Nations action, since it is the United Nations which represents all countries on earth, at the later stage of concretizing the remedy to situations of conflict. A truce is not enough, nor merely maintaining the peace. We must go to the root of things, to definitive political agreements based on a real and general disarmament of minds.\n153.\tThat is where the clarity of intentions of all countries of the Organization comes into play, starting with those countries which, for one reason or another, under the Charter have entered into commitments of broad, world-wide responsibility.\n154.\tWe must mention with some satisfaction some other positive achievements. There are clear signs of detente in the world in which we live. The great Powers have taken a first step by eschewing war or confrontation. Yet, we are bound to say that in regard to dis-armament a long road lies ahead. Military expenditure continues to add up to astronomical figures, while the amounts available for development of the needy nations are, relatively speaking, risible. Here in this universal forum we move ahead step by step, but we do move forward in the formulation of rules which define aggression. Yet, so much has to be done to disarm minds, to get rid of the desire for predominance or sectorization of groups of countries, or the exporting, surreptitiously sometimes, of the ideology which one seeks to introduce like a Trojan horse.\n155.\t\\\"Development is the new name of peace\\\" is the marvelous definition of Pope Paul VI. There is a universal sign which floats in the air we breathe and which requires that, with the development of all countries, we seek better days for all mankind.\n156.\tWe have no quarrel with the right of any nation to enjoy the riches of its territory, even though an unequal geographical distribution leads to privileged situations for some and irritating injustices for others. But it is intolerable that the mechanism which has arbitrarily been sustained and imposed for international trade, a mechanism of ridiculous prices for raw materials and high prices for industrial goods, should continually widen the gap between the developed and the developing nations. This gap is widening because at differences in infrastructures, in financial resources and, paradoxically, in the unequal possession of technology, of know-how.\n157.\tHunger, housing, education, culture, agrarian reform, health and social security are problems which should have no abstract frontiers or limits. Besides a higher moral imperative, expedience itself requires that all countries, starting with the super-Powers and continuing with the developed ones, realize henceforth that mankind and its future cannot be built on the well-being of a few and the poverty of the majority to the essential detriment of the supreme values of justice. Given this elementary maxim, the figures provided by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament are scandalously discouraging. While military expenditures amount to $220,000 million, of which more than 80 per cent is spent by the six countries with the largest military budgets, official assistance for development barely amounts to $8,000 million.\n158.\tIs it possible to build a lasting peace and well- being on the pain of this tremendous reality? Elementary logic tells us that it cannot be done and that this is a mistaken short-cut which will inevitably produce grave situations and may lead to the worst internally and internationally. On the pain and hunger of millions of human beings no peace can be built nor can human understanding be reached.\n159.\tAmong the causes which arrest the development of most nations is world inflation, imported inflation. It is like a thief who surreptitiously breaks in and removes a substantial amount of the value of labor and of savings. My country, Paraguay, for example, because of a free, orderly economy has considerably raised its production, its exports and its monetary reserves. In these conditions how are we to explain to simple and humble workers that, although the Government has not erred or been mistaken, in future there are goods which they will no longer be able to acquire or which they will have to consume on a reduced or sharply curtailed scale?\n160.\tIn this last year the substantial rise in the price of oil and its by-products has distorted the economy of most developing nations and also the economy of many industrialized, developed countries which do not produce oil.\n161.\tThe oil-exporting countries certainly have a legitimate right to receive fair prices for such a vital product, but so do the consumer nations have a legitimate right, since in the contemporary economy there is no immediate alternative to buying. This is an extremely difficult problem to study, and one which it is even more difficult to solve, and the Organization should devote its best efforts to it.\n162.\tThe world energy crisis, brought about by a reduction in the volume of extraction and sale of oil and its derivatives and by the increase in their prices, has consequences for industrial production, transportation, the cost of living and general inflation.\n163.\tIn the Republic of Paraguay, the Government of General Alfredo Stroessner will first modify and later eliminate the economic impact of the world energy crisis by using our own hydraulic power sources. The thermal plant which formerly supplied the capital with power has already been replaced by the hydroelectric plant of the Acaray River, which supplies the capita! and 100 cities and exports its surpluses to the neighboring territories of Brazil and Argentina.\n164.\tFurther, it gives me great satisfaction to announce that the Government of Paraguay, in equal association with the friendly and neighboring Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is already building what will be the largest hydroelectric power station in the world, Itaipu, at a cost of more than $US 3,000 million and with an output of 10,750,000 kilowatts. The first turbine will come into operation within less than eight years.\n165. Similarly, with the friendly Government of the neighboring Republic of Argentina, Paraguay is to build, also on conditions of equality, the hydroelectric power station of Yacyreta, which will be able to produce up to 4 million kilowatts, at a cost which may easily amount to more than $US 2,000 million. Further-more, negotiations are well under way to build, also with Argentina, an even larger hydroelectric power station, that of Corpus.\n166.\tParaguay, an internal or land-locked country, attended with confidence the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. There we again proclaimed before the whole world the irrevocable right of all land-locked countries.\n167.\tI expressed the essence of our position at the fourth regular session of the Organization of American States in Atlanta, Georgia, on 24 April, when I said:\n\\\"It will seem strange to you, Mr. President, and delegates, that the Foreign Minister of a landlocked country -whether it be termed an internal or a non-coastal State - should state its position on extending to 200 miles the maritime sovereignty of some nations. The fact is that the nations without a coast or without a maritime coast at present have a right to what are called the high seas, to their free navigation, to their riches, to their fisheries and to their subjacent wealth, as well as to overfly freely the suprajacent airspace. And, to the extent that coastal States increase their sovereignty by their own decision, they are automatically and arbitrarily limiting the rights on the high seas of more than 30 land-locked countries. Mindful as we are of international law, we maintain that such a decision cannot be the result of the will of a single nation: it must be the expression of the general will of all nations as stated in agreements or international treaties resulting from specialized conferences.\\\"\n168.\tParaguay hopes that, in the coming international meetings dealing with this very difficult and complex problem, elementary justice, which requires that land-locked countries or countries at a disadvantage geographically should have their share of all the re-sources and benefits that the sea yields or may yield in the future, will be strengthened.\n169.\tThe World Population Conference was another landmark in the work of the Organization. On balance, it gave only broad consideration to what is a matter of dispute at the universal level, but it paved the way for the future.\n170.\tWe know that, if present population growth rates are maintained, the population will double in 24 years in Latin America, in 30 years in Asia and in 25 years in Africa. But these figures must be advanced with serious reservations. There are imponderable factors which deserve attention. A mere change in climate could radically alter the situation. Technical and scientific advances may render habitable in the future places that are today inhospitable, and may introduce an enormous series of changes in the system of agriculture and livestock production and in, the production of all kinds of food, not to mention the reserves of food in the sea.\n171.\tThe Conference in itself gives a clear-cut impression that mere technical reports prepared by inter-national experts do not exhaust the subject or the innumerable possible points of view. Every country has its own view of the problem in accordance with its socio-economic structures, its ethical and religious convictions and the composition of its population. What must be emphasized is that any population policy must preserve intact the dignity of the human couple and the decisions which it alone can make: and, furthermore, that in this matter with which we are concerned widely differing views were expressed by the highly developed countries and by the developing countries. It is clear that the former are concerned about an increase in the number of possible consumers of world production. The others maintain that the major problems which are forecast from an increased population go deeper than this and are related to the unequal treatment which really exists today between wealthy countries and developing countries.\n172.\tThe United Nations took another positive step when it convened the sixth special session of the General Assembly. In a realistic and objective frame of mind it considered the grave problems of raw materials and development and the most important economic issues which the international community faces. An attempt was made, with some reservations by some countries, to establish a new, more equitable world economic order, and it was agreed to take emergency measures to assist those countries which faced grave problems derived from the latest international economic events. The developing countries not only asked for more remunerative prices -which means better salaries- for their raw materials. We also asked for social justice, that is to say, autonomous development. We not only asked to exchange our raw materials for dollars but also asked to exchange them for the transfer of technology, financial aid and food.\n173.\tWe hope that these noble demands receive a concrete answer; they must do so if all nations are to develop. We also hope that the emergency aid will be practical, effective and swift, because otherwise the avalanche of problems will lead to grave situations. A new rise in the price of crude oil on the international market could create situations which would be catastrophic for most of the developing countries which are not oil-producing.\n!74. From now on the world community has an absolute duty to be watchful and on the alert so that its action can be immediate when disturbances in the economic order affect the least developed countries, to the obvious detriment of international social justice.\n175.\tParaguay supports and will continue to support with renewed confidence the work of the Organization, which is useful in every direction and so vital to the affairs of the international community.\n176.\tParaguay is pleased to see the spirit of detente among the great powers, but we are bound to repeat that the aspiration of the world is for a just and honorable peace for all with full dignity, a peace based on the supreme values of civilization, culture and true coexistence. \n177. Paraguay hopes once again that the seed> of violence and death which continue to germinate will' be destroyed through the compliance of all States with the principles of the Charter.\n178.\tParaguay would wish to observe in the day-to-day activity of the Organization a faithful correspondence between what is proclaimed as a principle and what is done in the daily dealings of life.\n179.\tWe want a better world without economic or political oppression, without ideologies of domination that stifle freedom; we want a world of respect where the supreme dignity of man as an individual will guarantee the dignity of nations, constitute the basis for coexistence and make possible a new international economic order; we want a world where self-determination and the sovereignty of peoples will be an incontrovertible fact; a world where the powerful, whoever they may be, will not try for whatever reason to interfere in the affairs of other countries; a, world where the international community will carry on its affairs in absolute obedience to the exemplary principles which we here proclaim, and where mankind will enjoy peace, employment, freedom and well- being.\n"

        "file_text": "Speaking as I am for the first time from this rostrum and representing a country whose policy is profoundly attached to the noble principles of dialog and tolerance and which resolutely directs its efforts towards universal peace and the harmonious development of peoples, I must of course pay tribute to all those who have given of their best for the birth and survival of the United Nations.\n142.\tFor in spite of the shortcomings of its Charter, which must finally be brought into line with the political facts of the time, and in spite of imperfections in its functioning, our Organization remains the only hope of all peoples seeking to rise above either their particularism or their selfishness. It is the ideal instrument, if only because it sprang from the very ashes of tyranny, to fight enslavement, oppression and exploitation of man by ,man. It is the proper place for perfecting by diversification our means of co-operation and our systems of mutual international assistance which today, more than ever, are the sine qua non of our survival in this century of necessary inter-dependence.\n143.\tMr. President, at a time when a new wind is blowing through Africa, a continent which has so long been enslaved and robbed of its personality, the choice of you by our General Assembly , to preside over the proceedings of its twenty-ninth session assumes particular significance and becomes a kind of symbol. I have no need, therefore, to 'refer to the special links between Algeria and Gabon, and I will only express my sincere joy and that of my delegation at seeing you presiding.\n144.\tIt is true, Sir, that your tried and tested capacities and your exceptional qualities as a statesman have largely transcended our merely bilateral context, and it is, you may believe me, all of Africa and, along with Africa, all the friends of your country who join in congratulating you and in being gratified at your election. Here, as elsewhere, you will, I am sure, know the legitimate satisfaction enjoyed by great men at their own success* The dignity, the outstanding intellectual and diplomatic qualities, and the effective contribution of your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Benites of Ecuador, eloquently testify to the fact that the Third World is not lacking in great men.\n145.\tIt could not be otherwise when we have our distinguished Secretary-General as an immediate colleague. We must, indeed, recognize objectively the devotion and effectiveness of Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who has breathed new life into the Organization and who, among other noteworthy achievements, has found it possible to restore to the United Nations, particularly by means of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East and his contacts with the new Lisbon Government, its essential role as the guardian of international peace. My delegation would like to congratulate him publicly and would ask him to convey to all his colleagues our encouragement and sympathy.\n146.\tDeclaring at the very outset that a new wind is blowing through Africa, I had in mind above all the various aspects of the disturbing problem of decolonization. Indeed, after centuries of an absurd policy, we find the Portuguese people and its army rising valiantly to drive out the Fascists and to restore democracy.\n147.\tHence my joy and the privilege I find it to greet here, on behalf of the people and Government of Gabon, the delegation of the sister Republic of Guinea- Bissau, and I would request that delegation to transmit to all the sons of its motherland the message of our admiration and friendship.\n148.\tThe purest blood of African youth, including the noble and precious blood of Amilcar Cabral, will thus not have been shed in vain, and the youth of Portugal themselves, innocent, free of interests which were of no benefit to them and of a cause which was a disservice to their country and their prosperity, will no longer see their destiny withering on the vine, precisely where it has a role to play on behalf of human fraternity. An epoch has ended with the fall of the Fascists, who have met the fate reserved for all those of their ilk. Thus, there is a new wind blowing which dictates an objective appreciation of the new face of Portugal and means that we must stretch out our hand to Lisbon, so that as soon as possible and on the model of the Partido African\u00a9 da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde (PAIGC), the Frente de Libertaao de Mozambique (FRELIMO), the Movimiento de Liberacion de las Islas de Santo Tome y Principe, the Movimento Popular de Libertaao de Angola (MPLA) and the Frente Nacional para a Libertasao de Angola (FN LA) will come to exercise an effective administration over their respective territories,\n149.\tThe Portuguese Government must realize that the democratic reforms it is undertaking now in its own country have meaning in Africa only in the context of uncalculating decolonization and real and immediate independence for our peoples. In this regard my delegation notes with satisfaction the statement made from this rostrum on 23 September by the Foreign Minister of Portugal [2239th meeting). Certainly this requires courage, and is even dangerous vis-a-vis the major multinational firms and others who possess naval bases. But the rebirth of the Portuguese nation, the restoration of its dignity and international esteem depend on such courage as indeed does its future in Africa and its true prosperity.\n150.\tThis is also the time to condemn once again, in the face of an outraged international conscience, the odious crime of apartheid, which in South Africa, in Namibia and in Rhodesia has blotted out the personality of millions of human beings, on a scale unprecedented in history, from the land of their ancestors.\n151.\tThis situation constitutes a vast plot against us, but let me not be misunderstood: one cannot keep down for ever a people determined to free itself from tyranny or, even more, from foreign oppression. It is time therefore for those primarily responsible for international peace, some of whom are also the disguised allies of apartheid, to put an end to genocide and the threat of racial war which is constantly hanging over this part of Africa, where already sovereign neighboring countries are constantly subject to provocation.\n152.\tIf I have begun with the problem of the dignity of our people and our continent, it is none the less true that other situations, particularly affecting world peace and the world economy, are of concern to my delegation, and in any case the two subjects are very closely interconnected.\n153.\tConvinced that there is no real national independence without economic independence, Gabon whole-heartedly endorses the arguments put forward at the sixth special session by President Houari Boumediene [2208th meeting] which led to the conclusion that there is an imperative necessity to reform the international economic system.\n154.\tAlready Gabon has been striving to transcend the narrow framework of its own borders and to form a part of larger entities. This justifies our membership in the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa, our membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and also our relations with the European Common Market and the Group of 77 developing countries -which perhaps should properly be called the Group of 97.\n155.\tWe are therefore ready to broaden our horizons to embrace all States, whatever their national political orientation, provided they understand and accept the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of their trading partners. We consider it indispensable that we belong to the non-aligned group of countries because, in the face of the deplorable economic and financial fabric woven in their absence against the Third World countries to which we belong and which has no other purpose but their perpetual domination by systematic pillaging of their national resources, we must now bring to bear the strength of our cohesiveness and of our right, our permanent and sovereign right, over our natural resources, including our fishing resources in territorial waters, our right to study and to establish ourselves the price of our products, and our right also to deal with trading partners of our own choice, giving priority to trade between countries which are in the process of construction.\n156.\tWe are all aware of the effects of monetary disorder engendered by an outmoded economic system, but Gabon firmly believes that no one can continue to be powerful enough to subordinate perpetually a universal majority and to avoid the eventual application of the historic decisions taken in this very\nHall from 9 April to 2 May this year by the sixth special session of the General Assembly, a session which the President of the Republic of Gabon, His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, attended personally.\n157.\tReaffirming our total adherence to those decisions and principles as they were clearly enunciated on that occasion, particularly the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and the Program of Action flowing from it [resolution 3202.(S-VI)], the Republic of Gabon cannot refrain from condemning certain attempts to sow confusion or diversionary tactics which became apparent in the course of this special session, while the fundamental data of our concerns are clear and unequivocal. These are a fair price, for our primary products, reform of the international monetary system, transfer of technology and industrialization of our countries, control over the dangerous activities of multinational companies, our permanent sovereignty over our natural resources and a new concept of the assistance which may be granted to us. Because if to undertake investment in order to earn one's own profit is not aid and cannot be considered as such, any assistance with strings attached which forces any obligation upon the recipient is not aid either.\n158.\tThe countries in the process of construction want to act rapidly to consolidate their economic independence in order to raise their standard of living and relieve the privation of their people. This .requires from their partners, which are industrialized friendly countries, political courage, lucidity of judgment and sound understanding. It is quite useless, otherwise, to broadcast throughout the world pious intentions of solidarity and universal mutual assistance.\n159.\tMy delegation considers that we have no right to talk honestly of our desire for peace before we agree that attempts be made and success achieved in realizing the objectives which I have mentioned and which affect the fate of three quarters of mankind in a new context of international co-operation that will make it possible for everyone to enjoy his fair share.\n160.\tIndeed, no one can deny that economic blockades without any other justification than provocation, struggles for influence and hegemony that provoke and maintain the wars which devastate the third world and subversion aimed against the sovereign Governments of our States, derive from the ruthless competition, engaged in by certain nations for the sake of economic monopolies, which are irrefutably incompatible with the advent of a new era of international peace.\n161.\tConcerned both as the primary theater of these upheavals and as an integral part of a society which is in this way collectively threatened, the Third World appeals to the conscience of the great Powers for a change of heart that would lead rapidly to effective and lasting peace.\n162.\tFor its part, Gabon calls whole-heartedly for this peace, thanks to which vast financial resources and inestimable discoveries and technological achievements would be restored to global development programs. That is why we unreservedly support any sincere and realistic initiative that may lead to\nthe general and complete disarmament of the countries which suspect each other and keep each other under surveillance, while their arsenals of destruction become ever more sophisticated.\n163.\tThe maintenance of peace is the primary role of the United Nations. Gabon would like to see this Organization fully play this role, thanks to the new spirit which should be that of our Charter, which it j is indispensable to revise. The Charter was prepared 29 years ago by 50 States, that is to say, by a minority which cannot make decisions for the 138 delegations represented here today. And the non-aligned countries which constitute the majority of the Organization and eke out their lives at the mercy of the veto of the minority are firmly determined on this matter.\n164.\tLet peace reign through justice and long live the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure for me to speak from this rostrum to welcome the Heads and members of the delegations of States represented in this august Assembly. It is my great hope that our meetings at the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will be fruitful and produce great results commensurate with our aspirations to create an atmosphere of permanent peace and security in our world for the good and welfare of man.\n91.\tPermit me on this occasion to compliment my colleague and friend Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the President of the General Assembly for this session, who has often been with us in most international assemblies and conferences. It gives me great pleasure, in the name of my country, to express to you, Sir, my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session. We have known you as a freedom fighter, a pioneer liberator and a statesman of the first caliber. As this session will see the liquidation of some of the last vestiges of colonialism; your election to the presidency is an indication of the direction the Assembly will be taking. I am quite confident that all sincere efforts and activities at this session will be crowned with success under your leadership.\n92.\tI should not fail to express on this occasion my appreciation and gratitude to Mr. Leopoldo Benites, the President of the twenty-eighth session, under whose wise leadership and ceaseless efforts positive results were achieved and benefits were produced for humanity on more than one occasion and more than one place, despite all the obstacles and difficulties that arose at that session.\n93.\tIt gives me great pleasure also, in the name of the State of Bahrain, to congratulate and welcome the delegations of the new Member States of Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada, which are participating with us for the first time in the work of the General Assembly at this session.\n94.\tAt the beginning of my statement, I should like to refer to the Assembly's decision to introduce Arabic as the sixth official language of the United Nations [resolution 3191 (XXVIII)]. That decision is a source of gratification to us.\n95.\tThere can be no doubt that our world today is passing through an era of transition. The speed with which events and interrelations among States are developing has led us to a juncture where we have to choose between confrontation and co-operation and between local conflicts and co-ordination. We have to choose between order and sanity or emotion and violence, which lead to crises and catastrophes. Needless to say, we cannot resort to confrontation and conflict, on the one hand, and ask for mutual co-operation, on the other. We can no longer afford to pursue our self-interest without more world-wide co-operation. The solidarity and co-operation of the family of nations for the good and welfare of man is the only guarantee for the establishment of close and strong relations among nations in our world.\n96.\tSince the last session of the General Assembly, important and consequential events have occurred that have had grave international repercussions. The most important of these was the war that broke out in the Middle East in October 1973 and that was about to lead to a grave international confrontation which would have undermined world peace and security. As a result of the continuation of Israeli aggression, Israel's refusal to implement the resolutions of the United Nations and its persistence in occupying lands by force, a war broke out that could have involved the whole area but for the wisdom of the United Nations, which, through the resolutions of the Security Council, hastened to put an end to Israeli aggression and to the massacre of innocent people.\n97.\tI will now speak about the question of Palestine. The initial steps in the search for a just settlement of the cause of the, Palestinian people, who were ousted from their land and forced to live for more than 26 years in camps which, by twentieth-century standards, are unfit for habitation by any human being, are now being, taken. That people is still subjected to the most odious measures of oppression by Israel, measures directed either against those Palestinians who refused to leave their land, or against those who took shelter in camps in neighboring Arab countries. The latter group is daily facing a war of annihilation and destruction waged by Israel, which is arrogating to itself the role of watchman and aiming at the extermination of the original owners of the land, with the intention, in this twentieth century, of establishing a State on the soil, and at the expense, of the people whom it has dispersed.\n98.\tI should emphasize that, despite the difficulties and obstacles which Israel tried to create, we see for the first time in more than 25 years that we are on the road to peace as a result of the awareness of the Members of our international Organization of the problems facing the world and their determination to solve them.\n99.\tSecurity Council resolutions 338 (1973) and 340 (1973), which were passed towards the end of the last October war, came as a natural result of the struggle and efforts of peace-loving nations for the establishment of a durable and just peace in the Middle East to safeguard the lawful rights of the Palestinian people in their homes and on their land. The forces of peace in the world, supported by the commendable efforts of non-aligned and peace- loving States and of the two great Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, succeeded in initiating an atmosphere favorable to a settlement and in maintaining confidence in the United Nations when such confidence was about to be lost in the area as a result of the inhuman Israeli aggression. On the eve of the convocation of the Geneva conference under the, auspices of the United Nations, represented by its Secretary-General, peace-loving nations are more than ever called upon to support and confirm the principles which have been laid down in United Nations resolutions ever since its inception.\nIM, The road to peace is arduous. At this stage the United Nations must confirm the principles previously proclaimed in its resolutions with regard to the Middle East. This, in our view, involves confirmation of the following: first, complete and unconditional withdrawal, which should commence immediately, from all Arab lands occupied by Israel during its aggression of June 1967, including the city of Jerusalem; secondly, assurance of the lawful rights of the people of Palestine in their home and land, and compensation for their losses.\n101.\tI should point out here that what has been called for some time \\\"the Middle East question\\\" is in fact no more than the Palestine question. The attribution of the name \\\"Middle East\\\" to it is simply the result of the Israeli aggression, which extended to more than one State in the area. The heroic acts and sacrifices of the. Palestinian people have paved the way for it to establish its identity and assert its international personality. There can be no doubt that those who have the right to speak for the people of Palestine are their representatives.\n102.\tI refer here with appreciation and gratitude to the decision taken by the 'Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was held recently in the city of Caracas and which recognized that the Palestine liberation Organization [PLO] represented the people of Palestine. That decision was met with approval and appreciation by all peace- loving nations. That example deserves to be followed in order to reinstate justice and express disapproval of the policy of fait accompli based on suppression and force, contrary to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. As a first step on the way to a durable and just peace in the Middle East, we in this great Assembly should take a similar decision and invite the PLO to attend our meetings: we should listen to the voice of Palestine and the voice of the people of Palestine. If we do not take that step we shall remain far from the core of the problem and far from reaching a just and permanent solution.\n103.\tAgain, the question of Palestine is the case of a people whose land has been invaded and whose rights have been usurped. Surely the people of Palestine should have the same right as other peoples and States in the area to live in peace within recognized boundaries.\n104.\tThe initiative taken by President Boumediene, the teaser of the group of non-aligned States, in calling for the sixth special session of the General Assembly provided a new opportunity to enter into an informative, logical and calm dialog between the developing and the developed countries. That session provided an. early occasion seriously to discuss measures for development, prices, the problems of raw materials and basic materials, and the distribution of wealth in the world in order, to avoid Confrontation between developed and developing countries that is, between consuming and producing countries.\n105.\tThat session established one fact: namely, that the common interest of nations overlap and are interdependent. While-raw materials are used in advanced countries to develop their industries, the developing countries, which produce energy and raw materials, provide a vast market for the consumption of manufactured products.\n106.\tThe following are some of the important principles proclaimed in General Assembly resolution 3201 (S-VI): the sovereign equality of States; the right of self-determination of all peoples; the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force; territorial integrity; the right of every country to adopt the economic and social system it deems appropriate; and sovereignty over natural resources, including the right of nationalization. The resolution states further that the benefits of technological progress are not shared equitably by all members of the international community. The developing countries, which constitute 70 per cent of the world's population, account for only 30 per cent of the world's income. This makes the developed countries, in the course of time, grow richer and the developing countries grow poorer.\n107.\tIt is the great responsibility of the . United Nations to ensure the implementation of the principles of this new economic order which has been adopted by the vast majority of States. We understand the resolution to mean the following: first, financing economic and social development schemes in developing countries; and secondly, increasing investments in developing countries and providing them with expert knowledge and technical aid to improve their living standards and their economy.\n108.\tI spoke here at the sixth special session [2219th meeting] almost six months ago about the importance of international co-operation within the United Nations for the solution of the problems of nations and States which may be exposed to risks. Our full realization that the individual interests of States are interconnected will confirm the importance of the effective role which our Organization can play in the political, economic or sociological sphere. Events have proved this fact. The move made by some advanced countries early this year with the aim of continuing to take advantage of the underdevelopment of raw-materials producing countries and exploiting the resources of developing countries for the benefit and well-being of their own peoples did not succeed, owing to the growth of awareness and solidarity among the producing countries and their determination to utilize the resources of the land for the good of humanity as a whole, as distinct from the individual selfish interests that prevailed in the past.\t\u2022\n109.\tThe developing and producing nations, which constitute the majority of the population of the world, need, more than others, to utilize their resources in order to raise the standards of living and promote the progress of human beings who have been dispossessed for many centuries past as a result of the rule and exploitation of foreign forces.\n110.\tThere are many countries, including my own, which depend essentially on one natural resource, namely oil, as do most countries in the Gulf. Since the early 1950s the natural resources of the third world have been exploited in an odious manner. The prices of raw materials were very low and the cost of manufactured goods was a great deal higher. The only beneficiaries were the industrialized countries. As I said at the sixth special session, the price of a barrel of oil was $US 2.10 in 1952, yet by 1971, nearly 20 years later, the price had come down to only $US 1.80. The exploiting companies started to increase production unreasonably, which brought about inflation in the exporting countries and an excess of currency liquidity.\n111.\tTo lay down a policy for the production of oil by producing countries means to us only one thing, irrespective of what others may say: it means that those countries have started to plan for the future and to lay the foundations for a self-sustained economy to support their development.\n112.\tWe have heard much during this session about the increase hi the price of oil. In fact, such increase has come as a natural result of the increase in the prices of basic materials. It is illogical to consider the prices of foodstuffs and basic raw materials without including the price of oil. When we speak about prices we should refer to the prices of all food and basic materials, including oil, and compare the increase in their prices as a whole. I would like, therefore, to refer again to the view which we expounded during the special session.\n113.\tIn order to stabilize world trade, oil and all other raw materials, as well as commodities and manufactures from the developed world, should be matched by an index reference, so that all items can have their intrinsic value relative to each other maintained. Prices of particular items of trade, such as oil, wheat, coffee, sugar, iron and copper, could then be adjusted by reference to the general level of prices in order to maintain the value of the particular item.\n114.\tWe therefore support the view calling for \\\"the initiation of a constructive dialog, within the United Nations, among countries which produce basic raw materials, for the purpose of laying down a clear policy to avert the danger that mankind may one day face an acute shortage of food and energy.\n115.\tWe should understand that the standards which existed until the early 1970s and which favored the industrialized countries and the monopolistic interests of the world are now changing to give the initiative to the countries which own the sources of energy and raw materials. Without realizing and accepting this fact, it will be difficult for a developed world and a poor and destitute world to coexist. Both worlds are of the same man and on the same planet, which belongs to us all and whose riches we should all equally share.\n116.. The United Nations will celebrate on 24 October this year World Development Information Day. Bahrain will participate in the celebration, as it attaches great importance to such an occasion for two reasons: first, because it is a developing country planning for the future through the development of its resources and the building up of its economy, and, secondly, because it is trying to follow up the process of development and to create a prosperous society in the country and for its people.\n117.\tThe development projects, which the State of Bahrain has started to implement are based on the principle of a free economy. This has encouraged many companies and international investors to operate and establish their business in the country. The State of Bahrain has provided many facilities as regards taxes and the establishment of an atmosphere of stability for Such companies. In pursuit of this policy, the State of Bahrain, which is now building its economy and developing its resources, has embarked on a scheme of industrialization as a first step towards achieving both commercial and industrial development and progress.\n118.\tIn addition, the State of Bahrain pays special attention to agricultural projects and the extension of the cultivable areas of land in the country. It has allocated large amounts of money to the installation of a big desalination plan and the increase of electric power. The State, in co-operation with the UNDP and its subregional Office in Bahrain, is proceeding quickly with various development activities in the agricultural, health and educational fields. Bahrain is very keen to develop and strengthen its economy in accordance with its plans to build a strong economy and to establish a proper standard of living for its people.\n119.\tFor us, as a developing country, our celebration of World Development Information Day this year is not a routine celebration. It is a celebration to probe the means to industrial and agricultural development and meet the many challenges that face small countries like ours. It is not the intention of such a celebration to harp on what we have achieved in this respect, but to find out what we have not achieved and what we should achieve to catch up with many countries of the world in this space age.\n120.\tOur emphasis on the importance of industry and its development and the building of our national economy on a sound basis has led Us, in conjunction with sister Arab States, to open an Arab-European dialog through the Common Market to the benefit of all parties. We look forward to more aid and expert knowledge from the United Nations, the specialized agencies and the advanced countries in this field. Our country is responsive to all efforts for the development of the world and the progress of the human race.\n121.\tI am pleased to refer in this connexion to the decision taken by our Organization to establish the Economic Commission for Western Asia. It is an important and fruitful step, which reflects, at the same time, an understanding of the fact that some international standards and values are changing in favor of developing countries. The decisions and recommendations passed by the Committee are, in our view, the first step for such countries on a long journey towards catching up with the progress and development long since reached by many countries in the world.\n122.\tThe second session of the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea, held in Caracas, was the result of efforts made to regulate the exploitation of the resources of the high seas for the benefit of mankind as a whole and to eliminate the causes of friction between States arising from the exploitation of their natural sea resources. We look forward to a continuation of the efforts to solve the pressing problems in this field.\n123.\tIn the early days of the Conference, a spirit of compromise and understanding prevailed which enabled the Conference to formulate its rules of procedure by consensus within the prescribed time. During the general debate was almost a general consensus with regard to the main principles of some of the topics on the agenda of the Conference. Divergences of views and stands arose only later, when the details were discussed. This should not give rise to pessimism, considering the importance and complexities of the issues discussed and their effects on the economy of all States, particularly that of the developing countries. It is necessary for the success of the negotiations and the arrival at a fruitful and acceptable result at the forthcoming session of the Conference that such divergent views be reconsidered and that an attempt be made to narrow them down. It is not in the interest of anybody that the situation should remain as it is, as that may lead to conflicts and disputes over the resources of the sea and undermine the hopes we all entertain at present for the promotion of international economic co-operation.\n124.\tThe failure of the Conference to reach an agreement and formulate rules for the exploitation of the resources of the seas and oceans, and their utilization for the good of the human race as a while, is regrettable. It is hoped that such a failure will be transitory and that a universal and comprehensive agreement in this respect will be reached in the forthcoming session to be held in Geneva.\n125.\tAt the twenty-eighth session we supported the draft resolution concerning the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace which became resolution 3080 (XXVIII). Such support arises primarily from our desire to protect the region from the devastation of a destructive war and to protect cur people from confrontations which are not in the interests of humanity or of the people of the region. This leads us to view with increasing concern some of the recent steps and developments in the area of the Middle East. I mean, particularly, the race for possession of nuclear weapons by some people in the area, with the assistance of the great nuclear Powers. Such steps are a threat to the peace and security of the area, which has been the victim of traditional wars during the current century and which still suffers them. The stockpiling, production and development of nuclear weapons is, first, a threat to the peace and security of the people of the area, and, second, a threat to world peace and a direct threat to human civilization and the aspirations of people for peace and for building their economy and civilization. Bahrain, therefore, supports the proposal submitted by Iran to declare the Middle East a nuclear-free area [A19693].\n126.\tWe view with great concern the occurrence of bloody events in Cyprus, which has suffered and still suffers from instability and the loss of innocent lives. The Middle East area, at the same time, is affected by what happens now in the island. We believe in the right of nations to self-determination and are concerned mainly to see that the freedom and independence of Cyprus is maintained. The threat of confrontation or \\var in Cyprus, in our neighborhood, is a matter which deserves attention and quick action by the United Nations to contain these events. All interested parties should view the matter in a perspective that accords and fits in with the security and peace of the people of the area as a whole.\n127.\tIt is my pleasure in this respect to express my thanks to the Secretary-General for the constructive role he played in this crisis, and compliment him for the valuable efforts he has made in the service of the cause of peace in the world.\n128.\tIn conclusion, it is my hope that this session will succeed in attaining the goal we all seek -a world society in which peace, security and progress will prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is an appropriate recognition of your personal qualities as a statesman, an international diplomat and a fighter for human dignity. More importantly, your election symbolizes international recognition of the role of Algeria and its respected President, Houari Boumediene, in the struggle for equality, the right to self-determination and human dignity. It is a fortunate coincidence that you should be presiding over this crucial session, which will be faced with taking follow-up action on the decisions of the sixth special session, held as a result of the initiative of the President of your great country.\n2.\tThis session, which was devoted exclusively to the question of raw materials and development, was the culmination of a universal concern for the disastrous prospects of the existing international economic order. At that session resolution 3201 (S-VI) was adopted, which spoke of our united determination to work urgently for the establishment of a new international economic order based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and co-operation among all States.\n3.\tIn that resolution we accepted then that the developing countries, which constitute 70 per cent of the world's population, account for only 30 per cent of the world's income. We declared that in order to safeguard every country's natural resources, each State is entitled to exercise effective control over them and their exploitation and that no State may be subjected to economic, political or any other type of coercion to prevent the free and full exercise of this inalienable right.\n4.\tThe Assembly also pronounced itself on the need to regulate and supervise the activities of transnational corporations by taking measures in the interest of the national economies of the countries where such transnational corporations operate, on the basis of the full sovereignty of those countries; and finally, among other matters, the Assembly declared itself in favor of a just and equitable relationship between the prices of raw materials, primary commodities, and manufactured goods exported by developing countries and the prices of raw materials, primary commodities, manufactured goods, capital goods and imported equipment, with the aim of bringing about sustained improvement in the unsatisfactory terms of trade and the expansion of the world economy.\n5.\tThis resolution was adopted on 1 May 1974 as the basis for the establishment of a new international economic order. But only six months later, some of the countries which participated in the adoption of that resolution want to jettison the historic Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order which it contains.\n6.\tOne primary commodity -crude oil- has been singled out and made the villain of the piece; and the oil-producing countries are being pilloried before the bar of this Assembly as the culprits of international inflation and the wreckers of the national economies of the great wealthy nations. There is even talk of bringing back the gunboat to get oil prices reduced. Is it not sad that the international community continues to use nineteenth-century methods to solve late- twentieth-century international problems?\n7.\tOf course, the price of oil has increased sevenfold, but even more so have the prices of wheat, automobiles, steel, cement, every type of machinery and every piece of electronic equipment. Stated bluntly, the argument of those who say that if only oil prices were reduced then inflation would be checked means that the highly industrialized countries are not prepared to make any sacrifice in the phenomenally high standard of living of their peoples in order to promote the development of the developing countries and ensure the adequate flow of real resources to those countries.\n8.\tIt is true that the non-oil-producing developing countries are the least able to pay the foreign exchange bill demanded by high oil prices; but that is precisely the reason why there has been so much consultation in recent months between countries of the third world for the purpose of working out mutual assistance agreements and the establishment of special facilities to assist the most hard-hit countries. That is the reason why oil-producing countries, like my own, in spite of their development needs, are responding to international appeals for multilateral assistance to the hardest hit.\u2003\n9.\tIn the sixth special session the Assembly recognized the role of transnational corporations in the fashioning of a new international economic order. The Nigerian delegation had hoped that at this session proposals would be brought forward for the reform of the policies and practices of transnational corporations to enable them to conform and assist in promoting the new international economic order. If we take that most abused commodity, crude oil, we know that transnational corporations, which control the oil industry, hold national governments to ransom on oil prices. It is common knowledge that for every dollar which the producer country earns, the international oil companies earn between 7 and 10 dollars. National governments seem incapable of controlling, in the interest of their citizens, the profits made by oil companies operating in their countries. Is this not a problem which requires international co-operation within the United Nations system for its solution?\n10.\tNext, I must ask how we are going to establish a just and equitable relationship between the prices of raw materials, primary products and manufactured goods if we cannot \\\"set our sights\\\" above the current price of oil. It is my delegation's hope that the Assembly at this session will devote a considerable part of its effort to working out the implementation of the two resolutions adopted at the sixth special session, for, in the words of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"There can be no doubt that the nature and quality of life for future generations on this planet depends, as never before, on the ability of the community of nations to co-operate and plan effectively for the future in the common interest of all\\\" [Al960llAdd.l, sect. /].\n11.\tThe full impact of the special session at which the Assembly sought to put world economic relation-ships in their proper perspective will take many years to unfold, but I want to assure you even now that the Nigerian Government takes very seriously the solemn resolve of Members of the United Nations to work for the establishment of a new international economic order. The Program of Action adopted at the special session [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] outlined what is to be done in order to bring about that new order. It calls on the international community to replace an outmoded and lopsided structure of international economic relations with one based on full recognition of mutual interdependence and respect for the mutual interests of all parties. To do this, we must possess the political wisdom to recognize the need for change in our mental attitudes so that those who hitherto have been used to having every issue settled on their own terms can become accustomed to recognizing the legitimate aspirations of others. Inflation and supply shortages are real problems which we must deal with co-operatively and in a spirit of realism and mutual understanding, bearing in mind that we are living in a period of change, and that a period of change is sometimes accompanied by inconveniences to which we must learn to adjust. We must tackle these inconveniences through co-operation, not through confrontation.\n12.\tNowhere has the period of change manifested itself more clearly than on the continent of Africa, over the past year. About this time last year the people of Guinea-Bissau, through their, authentic representatives, the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC], took their fate in their own hands and declared their independence. We are happy that today the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is a proud Member of the United Nations, thus fulfilling the prophetic message which my head of State, General Yakubu Gowon, sent to the Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in 1971, namely, that within three years from that date at least one African Territory must be liberated from colonial bondage. The spirit of? liberation has gathered far more momentum than was anticipated in 1971, and we are happy to note the change in Mozambique, which has resulted in the installation in that country of a government of nationalists, poised to assume full sovereignty in 1975. We pray that the efforts towards conciliation which are now going on in Angola will result in the assumption of full sovereignty by that potentially great country before long. The Government and people of Nigeria congratulate the liberation movements of these countries on their sacrifices and their achievements. I should also like to place on record my Government's appreciation of the courage and wisdom of the masses of the Portuguese people in realizing that their long-lost freedom was inexorably bound up with the freedom of the peoples of southern Africa, who for 50 years had been the victims of political domination by a neo-Fascist clique from Portugal. I should also congratulate the new Portuguese Government for giving firm support to the new Mozambique Government in crushing the futile white minority coup in that country. One hopes that the lesson of the Portuguese Government's action will not be lost on their oldest allies, who continue to equivocate on Rhodesia.\n13.\tThese developments in Portuguese-held territories must give this Organization tremendous satisfaction. The support which the United Nations gave to Africa and the national liberation movements was indispensable for the final liquidation of Portuguese imperialism in Africa. However, vigilance is still required to ensure that the few reactionary elements in both Portugal and Angola and Mozambique are not permitted to reverse or even slow down the process of Portuguese decolonization.\n14.\tRegrettably, Namibia still remains in the fetters of South Africa's illegal occupation. The well-organized brutalities practiced on the indigenous population of Namibia in the hope of destroying their fight for freedom can be matched only by the Nazi horrors of the first half of this century. For how long will the United Nations watch such horrors helplessly? For how long will the Organization shy away from the firm measures that are needed to assert United Nations authority over Namibia? I do not believe that anyone here is still in doubt as to the unwillingness of the Vorster regime to withdraw gracefully from Namibia. Unless, therefore, this Organization is prepared to acquiesce in the illegal seizure of Namibia by South Africa, prompt and decisive action should be taken now to end South Africa's continuing defiance of the authority of the United Nations over Namibia. As in Namibia so in Zimbabwe; time is running out for the minority white oligarchies. One must pray that the white minorities in both Territories will choose the alternative of co-operation in a multiracial society before the deluge.\n15.\tBefore ending my remarks on decolonization, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the two other new Members of the Organization on their accession to membership and to the Charter. I refer, of course, to the People's Republic of Bangladesh and Grenada, both of which share membership of yet another organization with my country. Let me assure them that both in this and in every other forum my country will work in co-operation with -them for the achievement of international understanding and co-operation.\n16.\tThe brief interlude of comparative calm in the Middle East since the cease-fire after the October 1973 battle has created the impression that the Middle East conflict can now be resolved by a meeting in Geneva between the big Powers and the adversaries, and that we, the small countries of the world, need play no role beyond that of cheer-leaders in the power game called the Middle East crisis. If doing nothing more than cheering the players could bring real peace in that area and, by implication, peace of mind to the peoples of the African region, my country would be happy to do just that and no more. Unfortunately, this attitude is based on a fallacy. That is why my delegation welcomes the inclusion in our agenda for this session of the question of Palestine [item 108], and the opportunity of a full debate on what the international community understand by the phrase \\\"Reaffirms the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine\\\" contained in General Assembly resolution 2535 B (XXIV) of 10 December 1969. Furthermore, the General Assembly ought to state what is meant by returning to the Arabs \\\"the lands occupied by Israel as a result of the 6 June 1967 war, as stated in Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n17.\tOne would have thought that these phrases would mean what they say. However, they have been subject to such varying interpretations that, unless agreement is reached by the parties on what resolution 242 (1967) means, months of meetings in Geneva will not bring the solution of the Middle East crisis any nearer. We should have no illusions about any solution which does not take into account the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Arab people on the one hand and the recognition that Israel is a reality, a nation which can make its own contributions to world peace, on the other. As for the Palestinians, the international community cannot continue indefinitely to acquiesce in their remaining permanent refugees. Four million people rendered homeless as a result of the struggle in their land cannot be allowed to continue to live without purpose and without hope. These are the issues which must be settled in Geneva. These are the issues on which this Assembly must pronounce, as guidance for those who sit round the conference table in Geneva.\n18.\tReference to the situation in the Middle East cannot but draw attention to that unhappy island State, Cyprus. Whatever may be the rights and wrongs of the parties to the tragic drama in that island, we in Nigeria are convinced that Cyprus must be enabled to continue as one undivided sovereign State, and that the citizens of the sovereign State of Cyprus must learn to live together under one sovereign government. What arrangement the peoples of Cyprus make to ensure the stability and territorial integrity of their country is a matter of their internal affairs. My delegation hopes that the United Nations will lend its authority to ensuring the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus.\n19.\tThe events of the past 12 months, whether political or economic, indicate more than ever before that at no other time in the history of mankind has the term \\\"village\\\" applied more appropriately to the world. It needs little perception, therefore, to recognize that this \\\"village\\\" world of ours has become too small for endless rampages. Peace in the world is as indivisible as its destiny. We live in challenging times, which equally offer us more opportunities to meet these challenges. Despite its weaknesses, the United Nations is one of man's greatest creations. It offers us a unique forum for sustaining universal peace and progress. Let all its Member States, there-fore, powerful and weak alike, exercise the political self-discipline necessary for them to adapt the Organization and its rules to meet their present-day needs.\n20.\tI would like to end this statement with a tribute to the Secretary-General, whose courage and sense of mission have averted disaster after disaster in the past 12 months, whether in the Middle East, the Sahelian region, southern Africa or Cyprus.\n21.\tMay I add as a postscript my country' s sympathy for the victims of the disasters in Honduras and Peru.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I particularly welcome this opportunity of associating myself with the speakers who preceded me to this rostrum to extend our congratulations and express our satisfaction on seeing you preside over the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I do this all the more willingly since you are the worthy representative of a country whose militant faith in defending the causes of the third world deserves to be mentioned as an example. Knowing your great ability and your sense of duty, I have no doubt as to the success of this session.\n74.\tI also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Renites, of Ecuador, who had the signal honor of presiding over two sessions of our Assembly.\n75.\tI must not forget to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, most sincerely for all the efforts he has made and the success he has achieved for our Organization in his struggle to bring about a world based on peace and justice.\n76.\tI would also wish to avail myself of this memorable occasion to welcome, on behalf of the Government and the people of Senegal, the admission to the United Nations of the sister Republic of Guinea-Bissau, the homeland of the late lamented Amilcar Cabral, to whom even today we pay a moving tribute for his sacrifice in the cause of African independence and freedom. I rejoice at the admission of Guinea-Bissau all the more as Senegal has the honor of being one of the African countries which most assisted that sister State in its long and glorious struggle against Portuguese colonialism.\n77.\tI am also pleased to welcome the admission to this Assembly of the, courageous People's Republic of Bangladesh, which has again been sorely tried by natural calamities, and Grenada, whose independence puts an end to 320 years of colonial rule.\n78.\tAllow me, at the outset, to express the very high consideration in which my country holds the United Nations. The Organization is, indeed, the bulwark of the small countries, enabling them to become aware of their full and complete existence on an equal footing with the great Powers. It endeavors to be the conscience of the world and, as such, to prevail on all large and small by the standards which it defines. My country will do everything it can to help it.\n79.\tHowever, the Organization, which is in the process of attaining its profound goal, is fa/ from having recorded only successes, particularly m all the major questions which concern us. In this connexion my delegation is bound to note that at the opening of the twenty-ninth session major problems, which are among those which condition our very existence, particularly those relating to international peace and security, disarmament and development, remain without solution, even though in the past year some progress has been registered. \n80.\tbut can one reasonably speak of solutions when the arms race continues ceaselessly? Indeed, the military expenditures of the great Powers, far from \ndecreasing, rose by almost 50 per cent, from $200,000 million to $300,000 million in the course of a single year. This is ironic when one considers the recommendation of the General Assembly requesting the permanent members of the Security Council to reduce their military budgets by 10 per cent and to use part of the resources thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)]. This being so, how can one not bitterly deplore the attitude of the atomic Powers, which continue to strengthen their military arsenals and to carry out nuclear tests in the atmosphere and underground, thus causing the disappearance from our dreams of the idea of a peaceful world?\n81.\tSenegal of course welcomes the recent agreements signed between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic weapons. Moreover, my Government, which condemns the continuation of nuclear tests, welcomes the accession of the People's Republic of China and France to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), which prohibits nuclear tests in Latin America and the Antilles.\n82.\tHowever, in order for these positive acts geared towards peace to be really significant, they must be copied by all States which are concerned with inter-national peace and security. Similarly, the application of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] must also be marked by a condemnation of any militarization of that ocean. The great Powers, the coastal States, the land-locked countries and the other users of the Indian Ocean must enter into consultations in order to achieve the objectives of the Declaration.\n83.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe now meeting in Geneva, should lead to the convening of a world disarmament conference, which my Government earnestly desires.\n84.\tIn such a context, it is not surprising that many flash-points of tension exist where war goes on or may break out at any moment.\n85.\tIn Viet Nam, where my country has recognized the Regional Revolutionary Government of South Viet in order to promote the process of peace which was started by the Paris agreements, it is our wish that the United Nations intervene strongly to ensure strict compliance with the provisions of these agreements, particularly by the Saigon administration, whose aggressive attitude is based on I know not what encouragement.\n86.\tAs for Cambodia, my Government is more than ever convinced that peace depends solely on a return to the legitimacy represented by the Royal Government of National Union, which has already been recognized by more than 60 Member States of the Organization. In this connexion, my delegation particularly welcomes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the item entitled \\\"Restoration of the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations\\\" [item 25].\n87.\tAs regards Cyprus, my delegation expresses the inalienable rights of the people and the Government legitimately represented in the person of Archbishop Makarios and voices its constant concern for maintaining the integrity of the island, subject, of course, to proper account being taken of the interest of all the communities on the island.\n88.\tSimilarly, in Korea the United Nations should create conditions conducive to acceleration of the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. My Government, by maintaining diplomatic relations with the Governments of Pyongyang and Seoul, hopes to contribute to the reunification of Korea.\n89.\tWhen one examines the burning problem of the Middle East, there are grounds for believing that the conditions for a lasting peace in that region can result only from the dialog which might begin at the Peace Conference on the Middle East in Geneva. The disengagement agreements between Egypt and Israel on the Sinai and between Israel and Syria on the Golan Heights constitute important progress in that direction. We hope that the parties concerned will agree to implement strictly the relevant provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which provide for the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories and for the settlement of the Palestinian problem, as well as commitments that would give each State the right to live in peace within secure and recognized frontiers.\n90.\tMy Government wholly subscribes to these principles because such an attitude will undoubtedly assist the United Nations in giving a new impetus to the peace efforts. But our Organization must always bear in mind that this peace depends, too, on an active and sincere quest for solutions to the problems of survival and development which weigh on all the countries of the third world.\n91.\tIndeed, the convening of the sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development, showed the wealthier countries that the third world, now fully aware of the weight of its influence in international economic relations, is no longer prepared passively to accept the present economic order. The situation in most of these countries deteriorates from year to year as a result of the present state of affairs, compounded by the frequent occurrence of natural catastrophes of every kind.\n92.\tNo very effective procedure has been worked out by our Organization for providing speedy assistance to States Members which are victims of natural catastrophes. Thus, Bangladesh, having just emerged from war, has been almost entirely flooded; in India millions of men and women are likely dying of hunger as the result of a long unprecedented drought; and in Honduras hundreds of human lives have been lost, thousands are without shelter, and the economy has been hard hit by the passage of the latest hurricane. All these countries need immediate aid from the inter-national community, channeled through the Organization. \n93.\tMy own country, as you know, belongs to a region that has been the victim of one of these natural disasters. May I be allowed to recall here that, in our battle against drought, Senegal has always made great efforts by giving the highest priority, particularly in its development plans to the construction of dams, which are the only means to make our agriculture proof against climatic changes. Furthermore, the Governments of the Sahelian States have jointly undertaken important hydro-agricultural projects for the progressive transformation of ecological and meteorological conditions over the medium and the long term.\n94.\tThe conclusions reached at the last meetings of the organizations of the United Nations system for the development of the Senegal River prove, if that were necessary, how determined the Sahelian States are to eliminate the effect of the drought, which is a serious handicap to the economic and social development of their region.\n95.\tAs I had occasion to say from this rostrum last year [2132nd meeting], when we were faced with the disastrous effects of this scourge, African solidarity and international assistance were not lacking. The Government of Senegal again wishes to thank its brother States, all friendly countries, the United Nations and other international organizations for their invaluable assistance to the Sahelian countries facing difficulties due to natural disasters. I also wish to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who by his official visit ?n February 1974 brought us convincing proof that our Organization is concerned for the fate of the most disadvantaged.\n96.\tI am furthermore pleased to announce that, for the time being, the rainy season is almost normal throughout the Sahelian region, and that if there is sufficient rain in October, the harvest will be saved. However, two or three years of good rainy seasons will be needed for things to return to normal.\n97.\tHowever, in the Sahelian region, a return to normal will not put an end to uncertainty. The need remains above all, to control nature through the implementation of our major projects, so that periods of drought are not followed, as is frequently the case, by equally catastrophic floods. I therefore invite all men of good will, within the framework of international co-operation, to participate in the gigantic task of rebuilding and equipping the Sahelian region.\n98.\tEven more serious than natural disasters is the continuance of an economic order based on injustice and the exploitation of the least developed, whose progress is thus blocked, while the compensation measures provided for by the international community prove inadequate to improve that situation.\n99.\tIndeed, it is no secret to anyone that the situation of the developing countries is deteriorating more and more because the measures provided for, as well as the commitments undertaken within the framework of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], have not been respected by the wealthy countries.\n100.\tIf we observe the present rate of official external assistance, we see that in 1976 it will barely amount to 0.35 per cent of the gross national product of the industrialized countries, while three fourths of mankind will continue to incur billions of dollars of debts.\n101.\tAccording to data furnished by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], the aid given by the wealthy countries, in 1972, was only 0.30 per cent of their gross national products, a far cry from the 0.70 per cent set by the United Nations for official development assistance.\n102.\tAs for the net total of funds provided to the developing countries, it represented, for the same year, 0.78 per cent of the gross national product of the industrialized countries, whereas the United Nations target was -let us remember 1 per cent.\n103.\tA widening of the gap between the \\\"have\\\" and \\\"have-not\\\" countries, where it results from this state of affairs, may be prejudicial to the cause of international peace and security. It is in the context of the efforts to prevent such a possibility that my delegation sincerely thanks the United Nations for having convened this year, under its auspices, two conferences of an unprecedented political scope: the sixth special session of the United Nations, on raw materials and development, and the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which met in Caracas from 29 June to 29 August 1974.\n104.\tMay I again express my gratitude to President Houari Boumediene of Algeria for having taken the initiative in convening the session of the Assembly on raw materials and development. That event, which had its origins in the fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers in 1973 and which challenged the system that today governs international relations, shows us. clearly how non-alignment has found its raison d'etre in defending just causes against all forms of political hegemony and economic domination.\n105.\tTo this end, my delegation believes that any real political desire to make a frontal attack on the problem of development should, in the first place, recognize the distribution of natural resources as a key question. The appropriation of those resources by the strong to the detriment of the weak constitutes the basis of the unequal and unjust economic order that we know today, and that calls for a radical transformation if we are to establish the new economic order that is a sine qua non for collective economic security. Indexation of the prices of raw materials in terms of the value of the goods manufactured by the developed countries might perhaps constitute a palliative measure against the deterioration in terms of trade which result from this situation.\n106.\tThe fact that the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted, at its sixth special session, a Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order shows that the countries of the third world are fully determined to claim something more than a back seat on the international scene. The Program of Action, intended to ensure the implementation of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, adopted at the same session, will enable our Organization to deal better with questions relating to the fundamental problems of raw materials in relation to trade and development; the reform of the international monetary system and the financing of development; industrialization and the transfer of technology; and, lastly, the regulation and control of transnational corporations, not forgetting the sacrosanct principle of nationalization, which is an expression of the sovereign right of each country to safeguard its natural resources. The seriousness of the problems raised by the countries of the third world at the sixth special session makes clear the importance that must be attached to them.\n107.\tFurthermore, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which it has not been possible to finish drafting thus far because of the lack of political will of some of the developed countries, must be based on the fundamental principles adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development.\n108.\tFurthermore, my delegation fully appreciates the launching of the Special Program under the Program of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order to provide emergency relief and development assistance to the countries most seriously affected by the present crisis.\n109.\tSeeking a solution to those problems of economic and social development necessarily implies consideration of questions relating to a new law of the sea. The convening by the United Nations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, even though that Conference did not fulfill all the legitimate aspirations of the developing countries, may be regarded as the beginnings of justice in that field.\n110.\tThe fact that the United Nations has for years been interested in the law of the sea Within the framework of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor Beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction shows the importance it attaches to that problem, which is basic to the development of the countries concerned.\n111.\tWe all know that it was due to the developing countries that that Committee extended its discussions to cover the whole of the law of the sea, and finally agreed on the need to hold a Third Conference on the Law of the Sea at Caracas. My delegation shares the view of most African delegations which participated in the Caracas session, and believes we must abandon the traditional doctrines of the law of the sea in favor of a new concept, that of the common heritage of mankind, which implies free access by all to the riches of the sea, and an equitable distribution among all of the income obtained from the exploitation of its resources. In that connexion, Senegal supports the establishment of a new international organization to administer matters relating to the high seas, the common heritage of mankind, the resources of which would be used mainly in the fight against underdevelopment. Hundreds of millions of dollars might thus be devoted every year to that noble cause.\n112.\tMy delegation, aware of the importance of the Caracas Conference, unreservedly confirms its support of the position taken by the Organization of African Unity [OAU), which can be summarized as follows.\n113.\tFirst, we must recognize the right of all coastal States to establish, beyond their territorial seas, an exclusive economic zone, which should not in any case exceed 200 nautical miles. Within that zone coastal States would exercise permanent sovereignty over the biological and mineral resources therein, without jeopardizing other legitimate uses of the sea, in particular freedom of navigation and overflight, the laying of submarine cables or pipelines, and so forth.\n114.\tSecondly, we must recognize the right of land-locked and other geographically disadvantaged countries to participate in the exploitation of the biological resources of the economic zones on an equal footing with the coastal States.\n115.\tThirdly, the biological resources must be protected against the inroads of pollution and intensive fishing. It is therefore necessary to set up adequate institutions and establish an international authority which will see to it that the principles of defense against such inroads are respected.\n116.\tIn this field, Senegal, like OAU, advocates the establishment of a treaty governing the international zone so as to protect the ocean spaces and their living and mineral resources. The relevant machinery should have substantial and far-reaching powers. Its role should be to exploit resources and regulate the activities in the zone, and to reduce to the utmost the harmful repercussions of civilization, and the fluctuations of raw material prices.\n117.\tThose two great conferences, which should have left their mark on the Second United Nations Development Decade, unfortunately proved to be disappointing, partly because of their somewhat hasty preparation, but above all because of the lack of political will on the part of certain Members of our Organization, especially the industrialized countries.\n118.\tOn the other hand, my delegation expresses its satisfaction with the holding in Bucharest of the World Population Conference, and of the forthcoming World Food Conference sponsored jointly by FAO and UNCTAD at Rome. We affirm that the long-term problem of world food can be resolved only by a strategy which combines the target of increased productivity with that of equitable distribution. The Conference must consider a world food policy as a consistent whole, and include the questions of food aid and the best arrangements for emergencies, as well as the price stabilization and the balancing of supply and demand. Such a policy cannot, however, be formulated and executed without the support and co-operation of the developed countries, which must accept their responsibilities in this area, since inter-national peace and security will always be threatened if the developing countries cannot improve their food situation.\n119.\tIn the realm of peace, there is one sector where our Organization has made definite progress, which leads us to hope for a speedy solution of the problems concerned: decolonization and the fight against apartheid. My delegation rejoices at the overthrow of the Caetano regime; it welcomes Portugal's return to democracy and the recognition by the new Government of Portugal of the inalienable right of the African peoples to self-determination and independence. The recognition of the de jure independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau by Portugal and the Republic's admission to the United Nations are a source of satisfaction and reassurance to us, because those acts are directed towards the attainment of the universality of our Organization, which we all earnestly hope for. The meeting at Dakar between Mr. Aristide Pereira and Mr. Mario Soares, followed by meetings in London and Algiers, helped to hasten Portugal's recognition of the independent State of Guinea-Bissau. My Government will spare no effort to assist that brother State firmly to take its place within the family of free and independent nations.\n120.\tMy delegation sincerely hopes that the Cape Verde islands will soon join Guinea-Bissau in achieving independence and unity, and that Mozambique, where an important step has just been taken with the establishment of a Provisional Government of the Frente de Libertasao de Mozambique (FRELIMO), Angola, Sao Tome and Principe will shortly attain freedom and international sovereignty, in the interests of their peoples.\n121.\tThe declaration adopted at the eleventh ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of OAU at Mogadiscio called upon all States members of the Organization and on friendly countries not to restore diplomatic relations with Portugal until such time as it had recognized the right of its colonies to independence, started negotiations with liberation movements with a view to the transfer of power, and recognized the State of Guinea-Bissau.\n122.\tIt must be acknowledged that Portugal was then in the initial phase of its internal revolution, a stage, we must admit, of sometimes contradictory declarations and attitudes. But today, when the independence of Guinea-Bissau is recognized de jure, when FRELIMO, after the Lusaka agreements, heads a government of transition, when the transfer of authority has been properly carried out by the two countries, and finally, today, when Portugal declares that it is only wailing for a genuine representative before it decolonizes Angola, and solemnly proclaims that it will do the same for its other colonies, no one can deny that the requirements of the OAU have been fully met,\n123.\tThe Portugal of today deserves to be encouraged and helped. Recent events in Mozambique which have led to close co-operation between the FRELIMO and Portuguese armies, as well as the latest changes that have occurred in Portugal, illustrate this proposition clearly,\n124.\tSenegal for its part, being fully aware of its African responsibilities, has decided to re-establish diplomatic relations with Portugal. In so doing we are conscious of aiding both Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique, which already have important relations with Portugal as well as with other Territories that remain to be decolonized.\n125.\tSenegal, which has been watchful and ready immediately to revise its position if Portugal were not to comply with its commitments, believes that it would be to the honor of Africa to pay a tribute and to do justice to the new Portugal.\n126.\tAs for Sahara under Spanish domination, the Government of Senegal, consistent with the position which we have always defended in the United Nations, considers the decolonization of that country to be an imperative necessity. But, as has been indicated by the heads of the delegations of Mauritania and Morocco, there may be a special form of decolonization. There is a legal dispute between the African States concerned and the colonial Power. It therefore seems most desirable that the General Assembly, before considering this question, should request the opinion of the International Court of Justice. In this connexion, Sahara under Spanish domination reminds us a little of Namibia. The reason is that when South Africa set itself up in Namibia there was a lawful claimant to the Territory (the League of Nations and later the United Nations) which subsequently claimed its rights before the International Court of Justice, whose opinion is known.\n127.\tIn the present case, those who had rights before the colonial period of so-called Spanish Sahara, called on the same Court, an organ of the United Nations in which they had confidence, to state the legal position before our Assembly was seized of the problem. It seems to me to be wise and equitable to accede to this request, which I hope will enjoy the unanimous support of Africa, a continent primarily interested in decolonization. At any rate the sole concern of my delegation in this case is the rapid attainment of decolonization of the Territory by peaceful means.\n128.\tOur Organization has a special responsibility, that of helping the populations of Southern Rhodesia to attain their independence on the basis of equality of rights for all. Despite the efforts made by most Members of the United Nations, the minority regimes that are in power in Namibia and in Southern Rhodesia continue to base their retrograde policy on racism, segregation and discrimination.\n129.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, the illegal minority regime of Ian Smith consolidates itself from year to year despite the sanctions taken against it, sanctions, which, we must confess, are largely ignored by certain Members of the Organization, some of which are permanent members of the Security Council. It is obvious that the illegal Ian Smith regime ostentatiously thwarts every United Nations decision regarding the establishment of equality and justice in that country, where the minority, which imposes itself by force, constantly provokes neighboring Zambia at the same time.\n130.\tZambia has encountered great difficulties be-cause of the unilateral decision of the .illegal Ian Smith regime to seal off the common frontier. In this connexion my Government reiterates its full support for every positive measure taken by the world community to preserve the independence and dignity of the people of Zambia.\n131.\tWith regard to South Africa, my Government, which would have wished that South Africa's decision not to intervene in the recent events in Mozambique marked the beginning of a radical change in its internal policy, cannot for the time being do other than continue to condemn its policy which is based essentially on total contempt for the non-white races.\n132.\tFor us the point is not so much of including black members in a delegation than of having South Africa admit the elementary principle that a man is a man, whatever his color, religion or degree of evolution; and that a man is only a man whether he is an atomic scientist, a philosopher, an eminent Head of State, or whatever. As long as this is not recognized that country cannot find an honorable place in the international community.\n133.\tIn the meantime, South Africa must immediately liberate Namibia because, as it had failed to discharge its obligations as mandatory Power, the General Assembly, on 27 October 1966, was compelled to decide [resolution 2145 (XXI)] that the Mandate of South Africa was ended and that henceforth the rights of the League of Nations would be exercised by the United Nations. That was confirmed, we know, by the opinion given on 21 June 1971 by the International Court of Justice.5 The Security Council, by its resolution 269 (1969), confirmed the termination of South\nAfrica's Mandate over Namibia and called for its withdrawal from the Territory. That order should have been scrupulously complied with.\n134.\tIt is in the framework of this struggle to restore the rights to self-determination of the people of Namibia, which has always refused to become a feudal part of South Africa, that my Government fully associates itself with the measures adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session inviting the Security Council to put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa, and calling on the United Nations Council for Namibia to participate fully in the various activities of the subsidiary organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations [resolution 3111 (XXVIII)].\n135.\tMy delegation calls for the continuation, in the greater interest of the Namibian people, of the close co-operation between the United Nations Council for Namibia and the South West Africa People's Organization, which the General Assembly has recognized [ibid.] as the genuine representative of the Namibian people and which my country has authorized to open a permanent office at Dakar.\n136.\tAnd yet, despite the well-known obstinacy of the leaders of South Africa and of Rhodesia, my delegation ventures to hope that the emancipation movements which are liberating entire countries in southern Africa, together with the growing pressure of world reprobation, will lead them to a better understanding of history.\n137.\tIt seems proper, at a time when resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 on decolonization is making notable progress, giving greater credit to the principles of universality of the United Nations, that our Organization be closely associated with the settlement of all international problems.\n138.\tIt is, indeed, necessary, to avoid frustrations and imbalances that can only serve the interests of the great Powers, to give the United Nations full responsibility and the necessary authority in problems of international peace and security to which are linked the progress of the developing nations. The small- and medium-sized Powers must no longer be kept out of the settlement of problems of world interests because peaceful coexistence among the great Powers alone is no longer sufficient to create conditions for a real peace, prior to the emergence of an era of collective economic security, which we so earnestly desire.\n139.\tIn conclusion it only remains for me to express the deeply felt wish that this session may be that of the realization of the legitimate aspirations of all peoples to freedom and economic and social justice in newly found international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I, first of all, be permitted to extend to Mr. Abdelaziz BoUteflika the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Malta on his unanimous election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. As the representative of a country with which Malta shares not only the influences and concerns deriving from our common Mediterranean heritage, but also the principles and ideals of non-alignment, my delegation is doubly happy to see Mr. Bouteflika presiding over our deliberations during the current session.\n179.\tI should also wish to express the appreciation of my delegation for the admirable manner in which Leopoldo Benites conducted the business of the Assembly during the past year.\n180.\tIt is likewise with the greatest pleasure that I avail myself of this opportunity to welcome the presence amongst us of the representatives of the three States, Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau, whose recent accession to membership in the Organization has brought the goal of universality so much nearer.\n181.\tAt a time when the value of the United Nations is being questioned in certain quarters, it is a source of encouragement that new Members should still be found knocking on the doors of the Organization. But as the Organization becomes more universal, the question inevitably arises whether it is also becoming more effective. As the Secretary-General remarked in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization last year:\n\\\"the United Nations would be a far more effective Organization if Member States developed the habit of consistently responding to and respecting the decisions and findings of the main organs; if, rather than using the United Nations to promote short- term national interests, they would pursue long- term international aims and provide leadership in the pursuit of those aims; and if there was a general recognition, in deeds as well as in words, that present conditions of life on our planet demand much more of international co-operation than the mere protection of national interests.\\\"\n182.\tThese are indeed challenging words whose timeliness remains undimmed, and I am sure that none here would contest the Secretary-General's conclusion repeated again in this year's introduction to his annual report [Al9601lAdd.i, sect. I] that on the international community's ability to rise to this challenge the future survival of mankind may very well depend.\n183.\tFortunately, there are encouraging signs that this of repeated warning is not being entirely unheeded. The spirit of detente between the great Powers appears to have acquired a certain dynamic momentum, and although we share some of the misgivings of those who fear that an undue reliance on bilateral, or even regional, negotiations in such fundamental areas as disarmament and the search for a genuine peace and security might tend to relegate the United Nations to the role of a bystander, we cannot but welcome the important contribution towards relaxing international tensions that several bilateral initiatives, notably involving the great Powers, have made in recent times. As with the positive results achieved in negotiating disengagement and withdrawal from Arab lands in the Middle East, such bilateral initiatives can* be most effective when they complement, not supplant, the efforts of multilateral diplomacy. As the Secretary- General reminds us elsewhere in the introduction to the report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"If the beneficial effects of detente are to extend to conflict situations not involving in the first instance the nuclear Powers, the multilateral diplomacy of the United Nations will have to be more strongly supported and resorted to at an earlier stage.\\\" [Ibid., sect. II.]\n184.\tWriting on the same theme last year, the Secretary-General similarly emphasized the complementary nature of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, and observed that \\\"there is no single road to peace we must try them all\\\".5\n185.\tIt is in this spirit that my Government has actively participated in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe since its inception. Although regional in its composition there is no need to stress the global implications of this historic Conference. Europe, both the source and inspiration of so much that is positive in today's world, was also responsible for centuries of colonial oppression, and within the span of a single generation has inflicted upon the world the horror of two world wars. The search for lasting peace in Europe, and, beyond that, for active co-operation in husbanding its fruits, is therefore an event of the utmost significance.\n186.\tHowever, the problems besetting the world can no longer be treated in strict isolation and, just as security in Europe cannot fail to generate security outside its geographical confines, so will conditions of insecurity outside Europe continue to eat at the foundations of peace in that continent. This is especially so when those conditions of instability are allowed to persist on the very doorstep of Europe, in such a vital area as the Mediterranean. Fully aware of this danger, Malta did not fail to raise its voice. From the very beginning of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, Malta tenaciously held the view that European security and co-operation could not meaningfully be discussed if the problems of the Mediterranean were to be ignored. We are accordingly gratified that, as a result of our efforts and those of others who shared our views, the voices of several non-European Mediterranean States have been heard in Geneva at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. It remains for that Conference to take adequate heed of these concerned voices and to ensure that the perspectives they bring to the problem of security on Europe's southern flank are fully reflected in the eventual decisions reached.\n187.\tMalta has also taken the initiative, during that same Conference, to express certain misgivings about the confidence-building measures being recommended in that forum. Addressing itself to the question of prior notification of movements of forces, my Government has expressed the opinion that the recommended measures will not appreciably strengthen security in the Mediterranean and in Europe. To the small unarmed States of that region, prior notification can only be of value in so far as it enhances confidence amongst larger States which are capable of defending themselves. It cannot of itself provide security to weak and small States. For such States, other confidence- building measures must be sought.\n188.\tIn looking at the contemporary situation in Europe, what stands out conspicuously is that the majority of European States have sought their security within one or the other of the two military alliances on that continent. These two blocs have until very lately relied entirely for their security on the deterrent provided by their respective massive armaments. But the massing of more and more military hardware, together with the rivalry for influence in the Mediterranean on the part of the two leading members of the opposing blocs, brought about the realization that the whole structure of peace in the area was being undermined, hence the attempt to seek other solutions through the Conference on Security and Co-operation. Having grudgingly conceded that European security is intimately linked with Mediterranean security, the Conference has still to accept another and equally undeniable fact, namely, that a genuine peace in Europe cannot be achieved and maintained without the emergence of an independent Europe free to assert its own identity and to provide an effective buffer between the two super-Powers. It is in the interest of all, not least of those same super-Powers, to promote this new political dynamism.\n189.\tThere are those who believe that the European Economic Community may yet assume this role; but it is hardly realistic to expect that the Europe of the Nine will alone be able in the foreseeable future to do so effectively. In the light of these considerations, my Government has warmly welcomed the dialog that has been initiated between the nine of the European Community and the 20 members of the League of Arab States, and we express the hope that that dialog will eventually be extended to include other States bordering on the Mediterranean and the Gulf. Such a historic process could provide a unique stimulus not only to the prospects for economic co-operation but also to the search for peace. By building mutual understanding, it could lead to concerted political action in the interest of peace in the entire area, and it could gradually lead to the voluntary withdrawal by the super-Powers of their forces from the Mediterranean region.\n190.\tIn speaking of the problems of peace and security in the Mediterranean, one is inevitably reminded of that intractable threat to peace and security in that area, the Middle East conflict. The traumatic events of last year's October war have dramatically driven home the point that an overall solution to this problem can no longer be delayed. Happily, following that tragic reminder, there have been encouraging signs of movement, notably the troop disengagement agreements reached between Israel and Egypt, and Israel and Syria. But the momentum towards peace appears to have slackened in recent months, and if the lessons of the past 25 years have taught us anything it is that the situation in the Middle East will not remain static.\n191.\tIt is in the interests of all parties and of the entire international community to build upon what has been achieved and to move forward towards peace. That is why my country, together with a large number of others, has supported the inclusion of the new item in our agenda entitled \\\"Question of Palestine\\\". There can be no peace in the Middle East without a prior solution of the crux of the problem, which is the Palestine question; and there can be no solution to the Palestine question unless the rights and interests of the Palestinian people, including their inalienable right to self-determination, which this Assembly has repeatedly reaffirmed, are duly upheld. Once again my delegation expresses the hope that the Organization, and particularly those of its Members with special responsibilities under the Charter, will explore every possible avenue towards helping the parties directly concerned to find the road to an honourable settlement. It goes without saying that such a settlement can only be reached within the parameter of the essential principles involved: the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by means of force, respect for the territorial integrity of all States, the inalienable right to self-determination of all peoples, including the Palestinian people, and the right of every State to recognition and to security within its territorial boundaries.\n192.\tOur deep concern over She situation in the Middle East has been compounded by the recent tragic events which have occurred in Cyprus. Despite all the soothing words of detente, despite the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, a small unarmed State which has been participating actively in that Conference finds itself a victim, in 1974, of inadmissible foreign interference in internal affairs and of the use of armed force. It is our fervent hope that the judicious combination of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy which has proved its effectiveness elsewhere will not fail to find a solution that will safeguard for Cyprus its territorial integrity, unity, independence and non-alignment. Such a solution, in conformity with the lofty principles of the Organization, must above all provide for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the return of the refugees to their homes and properties, so as to promote the requisite preconditions in which fruitful negotiations can be held, involving the representatives of both ethnic communities and aimed at a lasting and equitable constitutional arrangement.\n193.\tDespite the balmy winds of detente, conflict and tension, fear and insecurity, also persist in other parts of the world. In South-East Asia, notwithstanding the formal cessation of the war in Viet Nam and the conclusion of the Paris agreements events which we all welcomed the situation is still far from satisfactory. The bitter struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against the forces of reaction and imperialism must still pursue its arduous path. If peace is to dawn over that ravaged land, it is essential that the Paris agreements are scrupulously observed by all sides, and that the efforts of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam to achieve the strict implementation of those agreements are no longer frustrated.\n194.\tIn neighboring Cambodia, the Lon Nol regime, bolstered by foreign support, continues to defy the Cambodian people and to cling to power in the diminishing areas still remaining to it. The time has surely come for dispassionate consideration by the General Assembly of the representation of Cambodia in the United Nations, bearing in mind that the Royal Government of National Union under Prince Norodom Sihanouk controls much the larger part of the national territory and enjoys the support of the vast majority of the Cambodian people. The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries which met test year at Algiers indicated the only honorable path which this Assembly should follow.\n195.\tAnother area of the world where peace has still to be consolidated is Korea. Following the modest step forward taken last year, the General Assembly will again during this session have an opportunity to make a positive contribution towards the peaceful reunification of that country. My Government is convinced that the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations is the essential first step leading towards meaningful bilateral negotiations and the attainment of peaceful reunification.\n196.\tIn Africa the day appears at long last to be at hand when the final vestiges of colonialism will have disappeared. We are happy to express our heartfelt satisfaction at the very welcome change which has occurred in Portugal's African policies and which has restored to Portugal its revered place in the international community. The unanimous admission of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to the Organization is perhaps the first tangible fruit of that positive transformation, and we look forward to the rapid and peaceful decolonization of the other African Territories under Portuguese administration and their admission to the Organization.\n197.\tBut these heartening prospects have also served to highlight still more starkly the depressing and inhuman conditions under which millions of other Africans continue to groan. Upon these millions and upon the conscience of the world, the yoke of apartheid and oppression in South Africa, in Namibia and in Zimbabwe weighs ever more heavily. At this eleventh hour, we still appeal to the Government of South Africa to heed the voice of humanity. The writing has long been on the wall for the colonialists. Now that the wall itself has begun to crumble, it is imperative that the policy of apartheid be allowed to do likewise. As for the illegal regime in Zimbabwe, we must all redouble our efforts to strengthen the policy of sanctions and to ensure that it is universally enforced.\n198.\tOn other occasions from this rostrum, the representative of Malta had outlined briefly the foreign policy of my Government. The cornerstone of that policy was and remains one of aloofness from military blocs and confrontation and of positive friendship towards all. Last year at Algiers, my country gained formal admission to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, thus proclaiming anew its dedication to neutrality and its solidarity with other developing countries in their quest for a better life.\n199.\tIf the cold-war confrontation under which the concept of non-alignment was born has moved towards a welcome thaw, that is not to say that non-alignment has lost its significance. The reality of big-Power rivalry is still there, complicated perhaps by the emergence of new centers of power, while the existence of spheres of influence is still very much a reality. The aspirations of mankind as a whole towards securing the immediate necessities of life and advancing from there towards the enjoyment of improved standards of living are still as far as ever from being realized. It is those factors, more than any other, which have ensured the steady growth of the non-aligned movement.\n200.\tSpeaking at Lusaka in 1970, President Tito said of the movement: \\\"We are not against the big Powers, we are only against power politics\\\". This is as significant today as it was then and succinctly captures the spirit of non-alignment. There are some who view the growing strength of the non-aligned movement with certain suspicion. In all frankness we are puzzled by such criticism. For it seems to us that to question the principles of non-alignment is to take issue with the fundamental purposes of the United Nations. The non-aligned countries are unanimous in their dedication to strengthening the United Nations and to making the Organization a more effective instrument for peace and co-operation, and in this we are all here completely aligned.\n201.\tMalta's espousal of non-alignment is not a new development. Since 1971, when my Government was elected to office, Malta has practiced a policy of non-alignment. It has striven hard, at great risk and sacrifice to its people, to make a valid and concrete contribution towards peace in the Mediterranean. In an overpopulated little island with no natural resources and which for centuries has known no source of livelihood other than catering to the military needs of the occupying Power, we have taken the bold step of declaring our firm intention to bring to an end within a few years the economic contributions deriving from this surviving relic of the colonial era.\n202.\tOnce again this year the General Assembly will be taking up the issue of disarmament without much progress on the part of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. It is no criticism of the members of that hard-working body to emphasize that the world has grown impatient over their inability to agree on such long-standing goals as a comprehensive test-ban treaty and a ban on chemical weapons. If no visible progress has been registered on such modest goals, how are we to view the prospects for the goal of general and complete disarmament, which indeed seems to recede further every year?\n203.\tWe in Malta have welcomed both the easier relations and the significant agreements reached between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the field of disarmament, notably the agreement last year on the prevention of nuclear war, and their announced intention to conclude a permanent agreement on the limitation of strategic offensive arms. Likewise, we are encouraged by their more recent agreement to halt, as from March 1976, underground nuclear-weapon tests above a certain magnitude. These are encouraging steps, but they can only be viewed as first steps on the road to real disarmament.\n204.\tMeanwhile, however, world opinion is discouraged by the continuation and, in some areas, increasing momentum of the armaments race. Nuclear testing, for instance, continues apace and evokes widespread indignation. We are opposed to all forms of nuclear-weapon testing, whether in the atmosphere or underground, and this in keeping with our commitment to general and complete disarmament. At the same time, however, as we deplore such testing, we cannot fail equally to deplore the fact that, 10 years after the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, which solemnly proclaimed the intention of the parties to achieve a comprehensive test ban, this goal is still beyond our reach.\n205.\tWhen those that have amassed the frightful capacity to destroy all life on this planet i tany times over continue to develop still more weapons to add to their armoury, it is not surprising that there are some who question an order of priority which seeks first to prevent others from developing their own weapons. A more rational order of priority would seem to be for all the nuclear Powers to heed the anguished demands for total prohibition of the use and manufacture of nuclear weapons and othei\\\" weapons of mass destruction, the dismantling and destruction of existing stocks of such armaments, accompanied by the progressive reduction of conventional weapons, and the discontinuance of nuclear tests in all environments.\n206.\tOne of the ways in which the cause of peace and disarmament can be advanced is by the creation of zones of peace and zones from which nuclear weapons are banned. The proposal before the Assembly for such a zone in the region of the Middle East [AIC.IIL.700] affects my country closely, and we support it whole-heartedly.\n207.\tOne of the most significant events in the history of the United Nations during the past year has undoubtedly been the convening of the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. My delegation has witnessed with satisfaction the growing realization on the part of the international community that new concepts, replacing the worn-out system of domination and dependence, must be worked out to govern mankind's increasingly varied activities on and under the seas. It was in 1967 that the delegation of Malta first launched the initiative which eventually led to the establishment first of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction and later to the convening of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n208.\tThe proposals submitted by Malta in 1967 included two interconnected propositions, namely, that the sea-bed and the ocean floor and their resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction should be declared the common heritage of mankind, and that an international regime governing the area and its resources and including appropriate international machinery should be established. These two principles were later incorporated in the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, adopted by the General Assembly in 1970 [resolution 2749 (XXV)].\n209.\tThe progress achieved by the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas this summer leads the Government of Malta to believe that such a regime and machinery, which will take account of the needs and interests of the developing countries, will in fact be created. In the light of this assessment, my Government feels that it is no longer premature to consider the location of the proposed International Sea-Bed Authority, and it has accordingly made known its decision to offer Malta as the site for the Authority's headquarters. In announcing this offer, my Government believes that many members of the international community would like to associate Malta in the most appropriate way with the tangible and lasting results which will have emerged from the Maltese initiative of 1967.\n210.\tIn talking of the United Nations and its achievements during the past 29 years, it has become habitual to make a distinction between, on the one hand, the Organization's record in the political and security sphere where, albeit considerable, its successes are not usually regarded as having matched the hopes reposed in it by its founders and, on the other hand, its much more substantial record in the field of economic and social co-operation. The argument continues that lack of, or only partial, success in the political and security issues invariably receives spectacular but negative coverage in the mass media, whereas important progress in alleviating the lot of humanity in its everyday life often goes unnoticed. There is certainly much truth in this, but, unfortunately, such arguments suggest that all is well with the performance of the Organization in the economic field and may give grounds for complacency. Despite the real and solid achievements of the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies, the stark fact remains that the gap between rich and poor nations, far from being bridged, continues to grow apace. The first United Nations Development Decade raised more hopes than it could satisfy. Almost midway through the Second United Nations Development Decade, it is clear that its objectives are likely to remain a mirage.\n211.\tIf this was already evident last year, the economic crisis into which the world has since then been plunged has not failed to sharpen our vision. Never was there more need for genuine co-operation among nations in their economic affairs. The energy crisis, in particular, has produced tensions that must be resolved equitably and amicably. The dire alternative of economic confrontation is too fearsome to ponder. In any trial of strength between the powerful, it is the weak bystanders who suffer the most. For those small countries which are exporters neither of technology nor of raw materials, the prospects would be grim indeed. For them, it would seem that they could at best expect nothing but ever higher prices to pay not only for manufactures but also for raw materials, food and fuel, all of which they must obtain from abroad. Such a double squeeze could only depress their terms of trade to intolerable levels and force a drastic reduction in living standards, which, in many cases, are already at a perilous level. It is therefore urgently necessary that the hopes generated by the sixth special session of the General Assembly should be speedily fulfilled. The urgent demands for immediate and effective machinery to translate into action the consensus achieved during that session are still awaiting implementation. We are grateful, to the Secretary-General and to all those who are striving to give early effect to the decisions taken at that historic special session, particularly the Special Program established under the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] and its call for emergency relief measures, and we venture to hope that these measures will be put into operation without further delay. It is also our hope that the beneficiaries of these special measures will not be identified solely on the basis of a purely mechanical formula that ignores fundamental differences in the structure of national economies. Sources of income which derive from transient, artificial and non-economic factors must be recognized for what they are, and their distorting effect on national income statistics must be isolated and corrected.\n212.\tI should like to conclude, as I began, on a note of optimism with regard to the difficult challenges facing the United Nations. If, in taking stock of the current situation, one is bound to acknowledge that the Organization has yet to arrive at satisfactory solutions to many of the world's pressing problems, this is not to belittle its achievements. There is no doubt that the world would be in far worse shape without the United Nations. As for the future, signs of encouragement are not lacking. For if it is true that the first step towards solving a problem is to be aware of its challenge then one can take comfort from the fact that, under the impetus of technology, the world community is increasingly forced to face previously unrecognized problems as well as new dimensions to old ones.\n213.\tIt is also becoming a tenet of conventional wisdom that the successful handling of global problems requires a measure of active international co-operation far beyond the concepts of mere detente and peaceful coexistence. This is certainly true of such global challenges as those posed by, amongst others, the current economic crisis, the equitable formulation of the law of the sea, the search for equilibrium between mankind's development activities and the preservation of his environment, the peaceful uses of outer space, the impact of fast-growing population, and the need to augment and to share the world's food resources. The same internationalist approach must also guide the way towards the establishment of a new international economic order, as called for at the sixth special session [resolution 3201 (S-VI)]. Whilst the need for international assistance has never been greater than during these difficult times, it is of the utmost importance for the developing countries to redouble their own efforts towards mutual co-operation in tackling their common problems. In this context, particular significance must be attached to the self-help program, including the solidarity fund for financing economic and social development projects, which the non-aligned countries have moved to establish.\n214.\tThe Government of Malta is fully aware of the importance of the principle of self-help for developing countries. In our own economic development, we have spared no effort to encourage our people to mobilize our entire national resources, both human and material, in order to participate fully in, and to share the eventual rewards deriving from, the successful accomplishment of the challenging task of transforming our nation's economy from its pre-independence role of catering to foreign military interests into one based on peace and co-operation with all\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is indeed a source of gratification to see the international community expressing its confidence in you by electing you to the Presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. Such confidence reflects the appreciation felt by the inter-national community towards your fraternal Arab country, which enjoys an eminent position on the African continent and among the non-aligned countries. It also reflects the high status and the positive role of the non-aligned countries within the international community. Your unanimous election is in fact an expression of appreciation and respect for your person and for your capabilities as an astute and eminent statesman. While extending to you my heartfelt congratulations, I should also like to express our gratitude for the efficient manner in which your predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, conducted the meetings of both the previous session and the sixth special session.\n22.\tOur world today is facing grave situations and challenges which put the United Nations and its procedures to a test, the outcome of which will determine not only the Organization's effectiveness in fulfilling its mission but also its very existence. In spite of the positive developments in the climate of international relations in recent years within the context of the policy of detente and the diminished likelihood of a nuclear war, the majority of the peoples of the world are still suffering acutely from colonialist domination, from the threat of aggression, and from poverty. Furthermore, in various regions of the world there are still many hotbeds of tension and danger which threaten international peace and security. In the forefront of such regions is our own Arab area, which has over a long period of time been the victim of the worst forms of aggression. It has witnessed at the same time the continued inability of the international community to find effective solutions to the problem. Representatives are no doubt well aware of the perils involved in this situation.\n23.\tWhat is indeed most disturbing is the fact that this forum, which is supposed to be a forum of justice, should witness strange methods being applied by their authors to threaten States which are exercising their natural rights and defending their legitimate interests. This is one of the manifestations menacing the inter-national community today.\n24.\tIraq, a country which has only recently rid itself of the last traces of colonialist domination and of the ugly manner in which its natural resources were being exploited, strongly believes that international relations should be firmly based on understanding and co-operation, on the solution of problems through peaceful means based on mutual respect, and on noninterference in the internal affairs of other States. It decidedly welcomes the steps already taken towards the relaxation of international tension and considers them as positive developments. At the same time, we also believe that detente cannot be fully achieved and will always remain threatened, unless the peoples of the world are guaranteed their full rights to freedom and sovereignty and to the pursuit of their legitimate interests. This cannot be achieved unless serious action is taken to remove the causes of aggression and tension throughout the world, particularly in our Arab region. Moreover, there is also the necessity of eliminating racial discrimination, from the evils of which many peoples are still suffering, particularly on the African continent.\n25.\tIt is a source of gratification that the current session should witness the admission to membership in the world Organization of a number of emerging States, namely the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. We should like to take this opportunity to extend our warmest greetings and best wishes to the new Members, in consonance with Iraq's consistent advocacy of the principle of universality for the international Organization. The admission of these States to membership in the United Nations is an affirmation of the fact that the struggle of peoples for freedom and sovereignty is bound to be crowned with success. It is also a full confirmation of the statement made by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report \\\"that the march of colonial peoples towards self-determination and independence is an irreversible process of history\\\" [Al960llAdd.l, sect. IX].\n26.\tThis is evidenced by the positive developments on the African continent during the past year. Following the accession to' independence of Guinea- Bissau and the transfer of power to the Frente de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] as a prelude to the proclamation of the independence of Mozambique, hope has been further strengthened that the other Territories still under Portuguese domination will attain their independence. We consider these developments a triumph for the Portuguese people themselves, who, because of colonial policies, have incurred great losses and suffered many tragedies. Portugal now has the opportunity to establish normal relations based on friendship and co-operation with all the countries of the world, including Iraq.\n27.\tYet, in spite of those positive developments on the African continent, the racist Government of South Africa persists in its defiance of the United Nations and of world public opinion by its continued occupation of Namibia and by the practice of its hideous policy of apartheid against the indigenous population. We are gratified at the resolution adopted by the General Assembly calling upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa [resolution 3207 (XXIX)]. For our part, we call upon the Security Council to respond to that resolution and to reconsider the membership of South Africa in the United Nations. The very presence of the representatives of the racist Government of South Africa in the United Nations is a contravention of both the Charter and the principles of human rights.\n28.\tWith regard to Rhodesia, we wish to reaffirm what we have always declared concerning the necessity of supporting and implementing United Nations resolutions by making such resolutions binding, in the real sense of the word, upon all States. We believe that the British Government bears a special responsibility for the removal of the racist regime in Rhodesia, and that it should in all seriousness assume that responsibility. The presence of the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia in our contemporary world constitutes an insult to the entire world and a shame which it must bear. The international community is called upon to employ all effective means to obliterate this insult.\n29.\tAmong the problems posing a threat to international peace and security and urging the international community to find just solutions for them is the continued tension on the Asian continent. The Vietnamese people still suffers from various forms of outside foreign intervention on the part of the United States, a situation which the Paris Agreement, signed two years ago, had supposedly terminated. The Vietnamese people is still bleeding profusely because the Saigon Administration, with encouragement from the United States, is not abiding genuinely and seriously by the terms of the Agreement.\n30.\tAs for Cambodia, because of the support given by the United States to an illegitimate regime controlling only a small area of the country, its people is still suffering from the evils and agonies of war. As a result of that situation, the international community should grant that people the rights to express its opinion, which includes occupation by its lawful Government the Government of National Union of its seat in this international Organization as the legitimate representative of the Cambodian people.\n31.\tRegarding Korea, Iraq has welcomed the steps taken along the road towards the reunification of the Korean people and the removal of foreign occupation forces stationed in South Korea. We call upon the United Nations without any further delay to put an end to the exploitation of both its name and flag in covering up the continued presence there of the forces of occupation of the United States. We also demand that the Korean question be given a greater measure of attention which would provide conditions propitious for the reunification of the Korean people and the removal of a center of tension from that part of the world.\n32.\tAmong the new important events arousing the attention of world public opinion and constituting a serious threat to peace is the crisis in Cyprus. We wish on this occasion to affirm our basic position regarding this question and to express Iraq's support for the independence of Cyprus, its sovereignty, its territorial integrity and its continuance as a non-aligned State. We call upon all parties concerned, including Turkey, our friendly neighbor, and Greece, to which we are bound by friendly relations, and the inhabitants of the island to co-operate with each other with a view to finding appropriate solutions to this crisis in accordance with the foregoing principles and on the basis of respecting and safeguarding the rights of the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus.\n33.\tAmong the chronic questions included in the agenda of the General Assembly is the question of disarmament. Despite some achievements of the United Nations in the form of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] and the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies [resolution 2222 (XXI), annex], our world is still in need of further efforts and co-operation with a view to arriving at effective formulas and solutions in this respect.\n34.\tThere are numerous sensitive areas in the world which are now threatened with grave dangers because of the presence in them of nuclear weapons. While we support the designation of the Indian Ocean and its geographical extensions as a zone of peace and the South-East Asian area as a zone of peace and co-operation, we also support in principle all proposals relating to the elimination of nuclear weapons from those areas and from the entire world.\n35.\tWe wish also to stress that there is a very small margin of difference between the peaceful and non- peaceful uses of nuclear energy. That fact was also emphasized by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, in which he stated: \\\"Available scientific evidence shows that there is little essential difference between explosive devices for peaceful purposes and those for nuclear weapons.\\\" [A/9601lAdd.l, sect. X.] In the circumstances, we believe that equal rights and opportunities should be recognized for all countries in this respect. At the same time, an attempt should be made to arrive at a serious and responsible agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy which would preclude its use for military purposes.\n36.\tOne of the distinctive features of the current session is the inclusion again in the agenda of the question of Palestine. There can be no doubt that Palestine is one of the major and most important issues of our time. Because of the question of Palestine, the Middle East has for more than a quarter of a century been exposed to a state of acute tension which has strongly affected and continues strongly to affect world peace on a large and serious scale.\n37.\tWhile we express our satisfaction at the inclusion of that just cause in the agenda of the General Assembly, we should like to express our point of view in an unequivocal and specific manner.\n38.\tAt the outset, it must be pointed out yet again that the Palestine question is not a result of the Zionist aggression perpetrated against the Arab countries in 1967. The issue has not arisen only today. That aggression and the current grave situation in the Arab area are but consequences of the Palestinian problem. In our opinion, it can be summed up as the question of a people expelled from its homeland by force of arms and by foreign invaders who established in that country a Fascist, racist and colonialist regime, one that cannot be justified save by the perpetuation of aggression, expansion and the fanning of the flames of war, counting on the support of colonialist forces with illegitimate interests and policies in the area, foremost among which is the United States of America. In our opinion, any attempts to ignore that historical and realistic aspect of the Palestine question would lead to a complete failure to find an appropriate solution to the problem and failure to consolidate peace and stability in the Arab region.\n39.\tSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967) unjustly and illogically refers to what it calls the problem of refugees without even a reference to their identity and to the causes and circumstances of their displacement. It has now become necessary to reconsider that historic injustice, and at the same time we deem it to be incumbent upon the world Organization not to commit another grave blunder when re discussing the problem by overlooking the greater part of the truth in the interest of acknowledging merely just one part of it.\n40.\tThe Palestinian people, which has been subjected to various forms of persecution and suffering over the last 25 years and which has struggled and is still valiantly struggling for the attainment of its legitimate rights, is fully entitled to return to its homeland and to exercise its right to self-determination in that land. Those rights must be exercised without any hindrance from the Fascist and racist hegemony of the existing Zionist military regime, and they must be exercised within a genuine democratic framework. In order to be faithful to the Charter of the United Nations and to its principles, the international community must extend full and undiminished recognition to those rights which have been attained and certainly will be attained by all the oppressed peoples of the world.\n41.\tThe Fascist racist regime now established in the land of Palestine constituted and still constitutes a hotbed of aggression and tension in our area. The perpetuation of that entity and the continuance of unqualified support for it from the United States of America expose our area to a very grave state of tension. They also threaten the peace and stability of the entire world with untold perils. The October war shook the world last year, but the world should expect greater dangers if present conditions remain unchanged. A great deal was said last year concerning the attempts to arrive at a peaceful solution to the problem of the territories occupied by the aggressors in 1967. That occupation, however, still continues; and the Zionist leaders still persist in the colonization and the annexation of territories in defiance of the resolution of the United Nations and of world public opinion. What really calls for condemnation is the fact that the United States of America is still acting irresponsibly, and contrary to its alleged intentions by providing the Zionist usurpers with enormous amounts of arms and huge sums of money in addition to political support in all fields, including the support rendered within this very international Organization. Instead of discharging its international responsibilities, in cooperation with the international community, by forcing the usurper and aggressor to withdraw unconditionally, the United States of America continues the pursuit of its policies, thus exposing security and peace in the area and the entire world to the gravest perils.\n42.\tFaced with such a situation, we wish to state our opinion that the Arab people whose lands were occupied in 1967 and the Arab people in Palestine which owns the historical right to its national soil are fully entitled to resort to all appropriate means to liberate their land and to recover their rights; it behooves the international community to stand by them and to give them all the support and assistance to which they are entitled.\n43.\tIf the international Organization has acted correctly and taken a concrete, positive step by its decision to reconsider its position regarding its relationship with South Africa, then it is high time that the United Nations reconsidered its position concerning the membership of the Fascist, racist regime established in the land of Palestine. By stating this, we call upon the General Assembly to recall the conditions of membership laid down in the Charter of the United Nations itself and to recall also the resolutions of the United Nations which have stressed time and again the rights of peoples to self-determination as well as the necessity of liquidating colonialism in all its forms from the entire world.\n44.\tWe have often spoken from this rostrum about the critical situation existing along the Iraqi-Iranian frontier ever since the Iranian Government unilaterally abrogated the frontier treaty concluded between the two countries in 1937, and by so doing, Iran was in contravention of the provisions and principles of international law and of the customs observed among the members of the international community and in international relations. Since then the Iranian Government has committed a long series of encroachments upon Iraqi sovereignty on Shatt-el-Arab and all along our land frontier. During the past years, the Iranian military forces have perpetrated numerous acts of aggression against our frontier areas. We were compelled to defend our land and sovereignty. Furthermore, the Iranian Government has openly and continuously interfered in the internal affairs of our country.\n45.\tBearing in mind the principles of coexistence between neighboring countries, and with the genuine desire of resolving problems through peaceful means and of establishing good relations with our neighbors, we in Iraq have been pursuing throughout the past years a policy of self-restraint, and we have been trying to confine disputes and clashes to the narrowest possible limits. Accordingly, Iraq has always called upon the Iranian Government to negotiate with a view to resolving differences through peaceful means. Among the prominent steps taken within this context was Iraq's declaration of the resumption of diplomatic relations with Iran on 7 October 1973 and the fact that it called upon Iran to negotiate. Unfortunately, the positive attitudes of Iraq were not similarly reciprocated by the Iranian Government which precipitated matters to the point of creating crisis situations through military acts of aggression committed against our borders by the Iranian forces throughout these years. We were thus compelled to refer the matter to the Security Council which decided to send a representative of the Secretary-General on a fact finding mission, The representative was requested to submit a report in this connexion, and he duly fulfilled the task entrusted to him.1\n46.\tThe result of the good offices of the Secretary- General was that the two sides did come to an agreement on four points which included the consolidation of the cease-fire, the withdrawal of military concentrations all along the frontier, and the preparation of propitious conditions for bilateral discussions without any preconditions.\n47.\tIn implementation of the foregoing agreement, Iraq took the initiative of inviting Iran to make the necessary contacts with a view to the withdrawal of the concentration of troops along the borders. However, the Iranian side has so far not responded to that initiative despite the lapse of five months since the adoption of Security Council resolution 348 (1974) of 28 March 1974. Iraq also took the initiative of inviting Iran to hold bilateral discussions. Meetings were indeed held between the representatives of the two countries between 12 and 28 August last in Istanbul, and this resulted in an agreement on an agenda for further talks to be held at a higher level. On this occasion we should like to express our thanks and appreciation for the positive efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General and his special representative, in conformity with the will of the Security Council as expressed in the resolution of March 1974.\n48.\tThe present situation constitutes a state of grave tension in the Arab area which is already fraught with danger. Such a situation, if allowed to continue, can lead to dire consequences. As an independent country, Iraq is determined to preserve its independence and its sovereignty. It will spare no effort and it will do its utmost to defend itself against any violations. At the same time, Iraq fully appreciates the urgent need to put an end to the hotbeds of tension in the area, and the need to establish friendly relations so that they may prevail among the peoples of the area which are already bound together by strong historical ties. Consequently, Iraq is fully prepared to exert all possible positive efforts in order to arrive at appropriate and equitable solutions to the problems pending between the two countries in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of good neighborliness and coexistence between countries.\n49.\tThe question of the Sahara now under Spanish administration requires an urgent settlement. The termination of foreign domination over the Territory is considered a basic matter which should not be postponed any further. It is our sincere hope that the Government of Spain, with which we have maintained close relations of friendship, will co-operate and respond positively to the Arab parties concerned in order to put a final end to its domination over that Territory. For our part, we consider the Moroccan intention, proposed at the 2249th meeting, to refer the matter to the International Court of Justice as a logical and sound move leading towards a solution to this problem.\n50.\tA quick glance at the current international economic order clearly indicates the incapacity of that order to absorb the quantitative and qualitative changes which the world has witnessed during the last two decades. That order is now suffering, more than ever before, from the symptoms of an imminent collapse. The successive waves of economic inflation which the world has experienced and the plummeting of the rate of growth of national incomes, in real terms, in many countries, as well as the disturbed balance of payments of those countries are clear indications of the dangers ahead.\n51.\tThe international community has become fully conscious of this grave situation and has realized the responsibility incumbent upon it to consider the causes and find solutions. Iraq, as President Ahmed Hassan Al-Bakr has declared, was among the first countries to call for discussion of the question within the framework of the United Nations. The appeal was made in a letter addressed by President Al-Bakr to the President of the United States last February, and the discussion took place at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, which was held as a result of the initiative of our Algerian brothers. At the special session the Assembly adopted a Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)]. That Declaration represents, in the view of many developing countries, including Iraq, the minimum of what is required. However, some industrial States attempted at the fifty-seventh session of the Economic and Social Council to shirk their responsibilities by voicing their objection to the texts of documents already agreed upon at the special session, thereby seeking to create obstacles to their implementation. We call upon those States to reconsider, and reconsider carefully, the consequences which may result from such attitudes. We also urge them not to damage their own long-term interests for the sake of ephemeral benefits.\n52.\tIt is indeed very regrettable to see some major industrial States failing to abide by the obligations of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], in spite of the passage of several years since its adoption and in spite of the adoption by various bodies of the United Nations of resolutions recommending its implementation.\n53.\tIt is really regrettable that accusations and threats should be hurled from this rostrum at developing countries which are exercising their natural right to sovereignty over their natural resources and seeking equitable prices for such resources. Those developing countries have suffered for hundreds of years from miserable conditions, as a result of the dominance of the major colonialist Powers and their monopoly of those resources in blatant disregard of the legitimate interests of their owners and of the interests of the international community at large. It is strange indeed that the developing countries, notably the oil-producing countries, should be held responsible for the inflation which is now rampant in the industrial countries. In that connexion, we should like to mention the following facts.\n54.\tFirst, the international economic order in general and the international monetary system in particular have been suffering from chronic ailments for a long time. On the practical level, the international monetary system, the foundations of which were established by the Bretton Woods agreements in 1944,2 collapsed in 1971 when the United States declared its relinquishment of its obligation to exchange the American dollar for gold, and vice versa, at the fixed parity laid down in the agreement - $35 per ounce of gold. The United States adopted that measure under the pressure of a continuous deficit in its balance of payments which began in the early 1950s as a result of its military and non-military operations outside its territorial borders, and of the successive waves of economic inflation from which its economy has been suffering and is still suffering.\n55.\tSecondly, the inflation from which the world is suffering today can be attributed in the first place to the nature of the economic order in the capitalist world. The recent wave of inflation began long before the oil-producing States started fixing more equitable prices for oil and oil products. This became only too clear in the prices of manufactured goods. In point of fact, economic inflation is a chronic ailment in the capitalist countries. It brought about ruin for many of those countries even before the discovery of oil in most of the countries which are now producing it.\n56.\tThirdly, the price of oil, like the prices of any other commodity, is determined by economic variables on a world scale. It is therefore unreasonable to view the energy problem and the price of oil in isolation from the prices of other raw materials, foodstuffs and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods. That is why we believe that what is called the energy crisis should be called instead \\\"the cheap-energy crisis\\\", because the price of oil, a commodity which is in the course of depletion, will always remain below its real value, not because it is a fuel used for heating but because it is a basic factor in running the machinery of economic life in the entire world.\n57.\tFourthly, the incredible profits made by oil companies constitute a major reason for the uneconomic increase in the price of oil in relation to the final consumer. To state an example, the profits of the seven major oil companies amounted in 1973 alone to more than $8,000 million, most of which was made outside the United States. That amount exceeds the total investments made by the oil companies in the Middle East area in the period from 1954 to 1970.\n58.\tFifthly, the high taxes imposed by the Governments of the oil-importing Western States upon that commodity constitute the second reason for the uneconomic rise in the price of oil to the final consumer. Studies made by the Organization of Petroleum- Exporting Countries [OPEC] show that the share received by the oil-producing countries from the price paid by the European consumer in 1967 was only 7,9 per cent, whereas the revenues of the oil-consuming Governments accruing from the taxes levied on oil accounted for 47.5 per cent of that price.\n59.\tSome officials in the industrial countries say that we are using our natural resources as a weapon for exercising political pressure. That is indeed strange, coming from people who are using their own commodities to exercise political pressure. We wish to stress from this rostrum what we have always said: that American strategy in exploiting the energy crisis in that way is aimed not only at the oil-producing countries, particularly the Arab countries, but also at the interests of Western Europe, Japan and all the countries of the third world. We believe that as a developing country we are capable of understanding and safeguarding the basic interests of the third world, to which we belong, at the same time as we respect the legitimate interests of all other States. We refuse the tutelage of States which have never proved that they are safeguarding the interests of poorer countries. We also refuse any kind of threat, whatever form it might take.\n60.\tOn this occasion I should like to say that the Government of the Republic of Iraq, through bilateral co-operation with many of the developing countries and the non-aligned countries, has given assistance of more than $500 million to those countries throughout the current year alone.\n61.\tWe could have devoted more time to reminding those who are speaking at this session of basic axioms derived from modern and ancient history. But we prefer not to do so out of our belief that attempts at misrepresentation cannot deceive the struggling, developing countries which have known colonialism in both its old and new forms and which have experienced all its various methods.\n62.\tIf the United Nations has not been able so far, and for reasons that are beyond the power of most of its Members, to achieve the noble purposes enshrined in the Charter, we have not yet given up hope. We believe that despite all the foregoing problems, the Organization remains an indispensable instrument for the creation of an international community where security, peace and co-operation will prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica, I am proud to be numbered among those who have expressed their congratulations to you on your unanimous election as President of this session of the General Assembly. I do this not only because of your eminence as an outstanding statesman, but because your great country has played a tremendous role in the non-aligned movement, a role which is appreciated by all those who follow with pride the true revolutionary spirit of the Government of Algeria.\n246.\tWith these compliments I should like to add expressions of the highest regard for Mr. Leopoldo Benites, whose distinguished international prestige brought added lustre to this body when he officiated as your predecessor.\n247.\tWe welcome the addition to this family of the United Nations of the new Members\u2014Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau -each of which brings some special quality to this great body. We are happy that Bangladesh has overcome the birth pains of nationhood and now takes its rightful place among us. To our beautiful sister island of Grenada, with which we share a common heritage, we extend a very warm welcome. Grenada is a full member of the Caribbean Community and participates actively in all the many regional institutions of the Commonwealth Caribbean. It, like us, faces the common problems of developing island nations. Guinea-Bissau may be said to have written its application for membership in the blood of its own brave African liberators. We welcome them all as willing participants in the struggle for the better life -which is the common purpose of this great family, the United Nations.\n248.\tThe Government and people of Jamaica extend their heartfelt sympathy to the Government and people of Honduras, who recently suffered a crippling blow from a Caribbean hurricane, It is our fervent hope that all its friends in this Organization will extend the hand of friendship and assistance to help to ensure its speedy recovery.\n249.\tJamaica wishes to pay tribute to all members of the peace-keeping forces of this body and especially to recall with reverence those who have given their lives in the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and peace.\n250.\tThe winds of change are indeed blowing through the continent of Africa. The events of the past year have justified the hopes, the sacrifices and the struggles of all those who sought to set Africa free from the bonds of persistent colonial domination. And the winds continue to blow -for we believe that the events which took place in the past few days in this chamber have laid the foundations for the final liberation of the continent.\n251.\tThe declaration of independence by Guinea- Bissau just over a year ago signaled the opening of the final act in the drama of liberation of the African community held by Portugal. The peoples of the world are learning much from the lesson of this liberation, the basic significance of which is the fact that it was the freedom fighters of colonial Portugal who assisted the liberals of their \\\"mother country\\\" to bring freedom and justice to the people of Portugal itself, and not the other way around. This is one of the political paradoxes of history, that it is the struggle for freedom by the fighting colonials that brings freedom and liberty to the colonizing Powers themselves. This will go down in history as the eventual realization that freedom is one and indivisible.\n252.\tAs we welcome Guinea-Bissau here, we look for the early accession of Mozambique and Angola to their rightful places as Members of this body, and we are heartened at the emergence of the new Portugal. We hope that nothing will interfere with the final processes of liberation of the Territories concerned. Jamaica and others who have given their full support in the struggle, will continue their vigilance towards ensuring the final outcome, encouraged by the new spirit of Portugal as expressed in this Assembly by its Foreign Minister [2239th meeting].\n253.\tA few days ago this Organization took what my delegation regarded as a historic step towards the final act of liberation of the peoples of southern Africa who are held in humiliation and oppression by the vicious regime in South Africa. The events of that day [2248th meeting], the results of the vote on the issue of the South African delegation's credentials and the move to have the Security Council study them mark a significant turn in this drama. The collapse of colonial domination in the former Portuguese Territories has forced many among the membership of this body to search their hearts; it has forced them to realize that a preoccupation with strictly legal forms and procedures can sometimes result in the perpetuation of gross injustice. The isolation of the South African regime has also threatened to isolate those who have persistently, by negative or by positive acts, protected them from the anger of the world and from the realities of the abhorrence in which they are held by most of the peoples of the world.\n254.\tFor I say to them, to condone apartheid and the daily humiliation of black people is to affront the United Nations itself, which body is concerned with the recognition of a respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex or religion. All Members of this Organization have a clear duty to fight against the forces of inequality and injustice. There can be no lasting peace while there is compromise by so-called freedom- loving nations in these matters. To compromise with freedom is to deny freedom.\n255.\tWhile we have been heartened by the developments in those Territories of Africa which have been linked to Portugal, we note that there has been no progress towards resolving the problems of Zimbabwe and Namibia, whose peoples have been denied the exercise of their inalienable rights to self-determination. The liberation of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia cannot be allowed to depend upon expediency instead of principle. The harsh tyranny operating in these two countries is being perpetuated by regimes which shamelessly abandon all principles of human decency in the obdurate pursuit of their political and financial interests.\n256.\tYear after year, with monotonous regularity, this august Assembly has passed resolution after resolution condemning the perfidy of that evil spirit otherwise referred to as the Government of South Africa, which remains obdurate and stubborn in its defiance of the United Nations. This intransigence has exposed this body to the charge of shameful impotence and has left the implication that it is only by force, violence and bloodshed that those-still held in bondage in Africa can hope to be free. In this respect, how are we of the smaller nations to view the stance of those powerful nations which would have us regard them as friends? In the case of Zimbabwe and Namibia, there is far more reason and universal support for United Nations troops to settle the question of freedom and justice there than there seems to be in Korea.\n257.\tDespite much criticism -probably unfair -the United Nations deserves some credit for providing the forum for those Member nations that have awakened the conscience of the world. This year has, however, witnessed the dismemberment of a small, independent country, by outside interference, and leaves open to question the security of small, independent nations.\n258.\tRecent events have revealed massive interference in the internal affairs of States Members of this Organization. Jamaica condemns such interference from whatever quarter it emanates. We reaffirm our faith that respect for the sovereignty pf nations neither allows, first, interference by one State in the affairs of another nor, secondly, intervention in the affairs of a duly elected Government. We of the non-aligned group view with alarm this undermining of the sovereignty of States, which constitutes a form of aggression by one State against another.\n259.\tThere is evidence of a real fear of aggression reflected in the references which have been made at this session to Belize. We hear hypocritical references to -and I quote -\\\"the firm adherence to the principle of the self-determination of peoples\\\" out of the very mouths of those who generate the cause of fear. How much respect can we pay to those who refer to \\\"the respectable aspirations of the people of Belize\\\", when the authors of those very words deny to those very people the natural God-given right to declare themselves free? Let those who profess to be anti- colonialist define that term. Let them go back to their own historical roots and recall the spirit of Bolivar, the great Liberator of Latin America.\n260.\tJamaica reaffirms its stand against all oppressors, whoever they may be, and appeals to all freedom- loving countries here to study and help to advance the just aspirations of the people of Belize. Peace and justice are the concern of all -not the least concerned is this colony, which, because of its status, has no voice here and which has remained for too long trembling in the limbo of fear between the threats of a neighbor, on the one hand, and the empty promise of independence, on the other. It is full time that this body, the United Nations, which is the repository of hope for the weaker nations, takes full cognizance of the regrettable situation in Belize.\n261.\tThe past year has witnessed the emergence of a new determination on the part of the developing countries to bring about fundamental changes in the international economic system. In the face of all the effort and all the display of evidence of progress and of national and international concern over the past decades, the simple and inescapable fact is that the part of the world occupied by the poorer countries has been losing the battle for progress. The widening of the gap between the rich countries and the poor countries is clear evidence of this fact.\n262.\tThe countries of the third world have called for fundamental change in the very structure and foundations of the world economic system. The sixth special session of the General Assembly -at which these issues were discussed and which saw the approval of resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI), embodying the Declaration of and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order marked a historic moment in our lives. We must move forward from this mark.\n263.\tThere are many factors which inhibit such forward movement. First and foremost, there is the lack of commitment on the part of some of the developed countries to the idea of such structural change. Some of these have made their position crystal clear, and my delegation views this situation with deep regret. Nevertheless, one of the encouraging developments in recent times has been the movement on the part of a number of smaller developed countries towards full acceptance of the proposition that such fundamental change is imperative. We welcome this significant development and urge these countries to give their fullest support to the search for the answers to the problems involved in implementing the Program of Action. We hope that in good time those other countries which are less enthusiastic -or even opposed to these aims -will join fully in the effort not only in the interest of the overwhelming majority of the peoples of the world, but, in our view, to the ultimate benefit of all countries and of all peoples.\n264.\tThe second major factor is our lack of full understanding of some aspects of the development process. In this connexion, we must review and revise thoroughly the assumptions, the goals and the methods of work, particularly within the United Nations system. We must raise our sights to the levels required to bring about the new system of international economic relationships envisaged in the Declaration and Program of Action. In the search for such solutions we need the ingenuity and the energies of all.\n265. The third factor concerns a series of crises which beset the world today and which relate to inflation, energy, the international monetary system, food supplies and population growth. These crises must be seen as a dramatic expression of the failure of the world economic system that we have known. They must be seen not, as some among us seem to feel, as a reason or an excuse for putting aside or diminishing the effort towards fundamental change in the system; but, rather, they should be regarded as a crowning justification for moving with greater determination and urgency towards a new economic order based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and co-operation among all States.\n266.. The fact that no country -no matter what its resources -is untouched by these events is a measure of the harsh realities of interdependence.\n267.\tEver since the emergence of global contact in trade and investment through colonialism and other devices, the world community has been interdependent. However, for the most part the experience has been that one sector of the world community has been almost wholly dependent on another. The members of the latter category -which in most cases have derived their economic and political strength from exploitation of the rest of the world- have nevertheless regarded themselves as being almost wholly independent of that group. Now we observe that a great deal is being said on the subject of interdependence. We repeat: this is not at all news to us. But we cannot refrain from observing that it is only the emergence of events which have seriously threatened the economies of the major countries that has led to this new understanding and emphasis on this phenomenon.\n268.\tToday the third world is seeking a complete change from the old interpretation of interdependence. This requires: first, understanding by the developed countries of the desperate urgency to raise the standard of living of the peoples of the third world; secondly, acceptance by the developed countries of the need for an equitable distribution throughout the world of the material benefits which derive from the world economic system and which provide a basis for \\\"the good life\\\"; and, thirdly, adoption and implementation by the developed countries of policies designed to achieve these ends.\n269.\tThis should be the new meaning of interdependence, and in order to make it a reality we need fundamental structural change in the world economic system. This is the link between interdependence and the new economic order.\n270.\tThe third world seeks not confrontation but parallel advancement -indeed, economic salvation. In our view, developing countries must exercise the discipline of the mutually distressed in order to avoid division among ourselves. May this discipline prevent individual members or groups that move towards the top of the ladder from neglecting their friends who remain at the bottom. In this respect I should like to make two observations: first, I commend the Republic of Venezuela, which has readily made substantial grants to assist some of the poorer nations that have been affected acutely by the energy crisis; and secondly, I express regret that, although there has been much talk and some action about stabilization and development funds, there has been a lack of sufficient meaningful progress in these matters.\n271.\tOur role is to press forward now and together to work towards the establishment of the new economic order. The frightening alternative is unthinkable; at the least, it is a perpetuation of the old idea of inter-dependence, which means that some form of charity, such as aid, could readjust the intrinsic inequalities between the developed and the developing world. The real change to establish this new economic order will begin only after this new meaning of interdependence elicits two simultaneous movements: first, the acceptance by the developed nations of the meaningful involvement of the poorer countries in the decision-making processes of international economic bodies; and/ or second, the realization of the developing world that the maintenance of discipline among its members and concern for the welfare of its members, both collectively and individually, will ensure that we will not once more be divided.\n272.\tWe, a small nation, accept the political philosophy that the central objective of all government is the equality of man and the improvement in the quality of his life. The international questions of food, energy , population control and other problems, real as they are, are abstractions unless we relate them to the basic needs of the human individual. The developing world, whose only assets in most cases are its human resources, must never lose sight of this fact, or fail to remind our brothers stronger in material wealth of this fact. The great problems of the present as to how many million barrels of oil per day or millions of tons of wheat are produced are meaningless unless they relate to the necessity to feed and house the millions of needy people throughout the world still crying out for an answer to the question: \\\"How can I retain my human dignity and self-respect, house my family and feed my undernourished children?\\\".\n273.\tJamaica notes and welcomes the proclamation of International Women's Year [resolution 3010 (XXVII)] and reaffirms its belief that women must be given a greater role in political, social and economic development.\n274.\tOur concerns are not merely about balance of payments; they are about the readjustment of the balance of human distress, which is so unevenly distributed. The condition of the. individual human being must be the center of our concern. Our response in Jamaica to the current emphasis on interdependence and economic co-operation is not conditioned either by injustices of the past or by threats of the present; it is the response of a small sovereign nation which desires sincerely to co-operate with others for the mutual benefit of all. We expect for ourselves and others a fair share of the fruits of our labor, and we demand a just portion of the proceeds of any joint development of our common resources. Our answer to the call for interdependence is that we want to change our role in this new economic order from that of sufferer to that of full participant in the world scene.\n275.\tThat is the tone of our response. It is a note dictated not only by the urgency of the moment but by a close reading of the facts of history. The facts show not only that the great empires of the past fell when they could no longer depend on the support of their colonies or dependencies, but also that today the developed countries need us as much as we need them. That is true interdependence.\n276.\tThis is not the petulant retort of the poor; it is a bold statement of fact: that interdependence requires among the wealthy nations a tremendous sophistication and a denial of vanity; indeed, it requires a dilution of arrogance, where blackmail, threats and all forms of intervention in other people's affairs are out of place. The empires of the past held together as long as their military hardware was the determining factor. Today interdependence and an economically healthy world must place full value on the qualitative contribution of the poorer majorities of the world.\n277.\tMy delegation and the Government of Jamaica which we represent are of the view that the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order must be the center and focus of the efforts and concerns of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and of each member country, and we expect that this session of the General Assembly will see the furtherance of these aims. A vital and integral part of these aims is the Special Program for emergency relief and development assistance to the countries most seriously affected by the prevailing conditions. We strongly urge here, as we have done elsewhere, the fullest and promptest attention to this matter.\n278.\tWe have heard from time to time comments, even complaints, about the devices to which developing countries have resorted in order to counteract what I would like to call the despotism of the minority. There have been adverse comments concerning the formation of associations of commodity-producing countries, which are mainly members of the third world. However, the formation of these associations has been forced on producing countries by the failure of the countries exploiting these resources to give them fair and equitable returns or to foster the transfer of appropriate technology and other benefits to any significant degree. There are complaints centered around the relatively recent phenomenon of the rising costs of raw materials. Yet the countries which complain say nothing at all of the long history of spiraling costs of their manufactured goods which are exported to the third world.\n279.\tThe spiraling costs of production of these manufactured goods reflect the rapid rise in the standard of living in the developed countries, as the wage levels of their workers have increased; thus, the rise in the standard of living in these countries has been achieved largely at the expense of the peoples of the third world, whose low wage-levels and standard of living are regarded as a part of the necessary, inevitable and immutable scheme of things.\n280.\tThe third world, for its part, has complained about the groups or blocs of the rich and powerful countries -for example, in the realm of international monetary affairs, the Group of 10, the club of the rich, whose members were in the habit of meeting and deciding on major issues and more or less instructing IMF on what it should do. In deference to the strong views of the developing countries, the Group of 10 gave way to the Committee of 20,4 which included representatives of developing countries on the basis of the existing constituencies in the Fund. Now we read of meetings in recent days of the Group of 5 -a new and even more exclusive club of not just the rich, but of the richest.\n281.\tThe question of the recycling of funds of the oil-producing countries is a concrete example of the need for a rational approach in dealing with specific international economic problems. Recent events have shown a strong tendency for those funds to move into the developed countries for their benefit. This points to the urgent need for a planned and controlled distribution of the flow of some of these funds into the developing countries which are in greater need of them.\n282.\tA strong new ray of hope and promise for inter-national co-operation has recently emerged. The General Assembly in resolution 2340 (XXII) and subsequent resolutions over the period 1967-1973 invited the nations of the world to create a new legal order of the sea. I say this is a hopeful turn because the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, recently held in Caracas, saw the greatest collection of experts and representatives, deliberately and collectively seeking to redress the imbalance in the world order in a quest for a new regime of international justice. I repeat, hopeful, because in the Declaration of Principles, as well as in the procedures adopted by the Conference, this distinguished group made serious, strenuous efforts over a considerable period towards creating and preserving a new order of international economic justice designed to bring about control of pollution on a global scale, and the regulation of the orderly exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed, among other things. Never before had the international community attempted such a comprehensive task.\n283.\tToday the revolution in the approach to the sharing of the world's resources and the acknowledgment of the rights and claims of the weak and poor among the nations, including the land-locked and otherwise geographically disadvantaged States, to the resources of the sea are firm steps towards establishing an era of permanent peace. This presents a very bright picture of community effort and a shining example of the interdependence of man and nations without which the whole operation admittedly would be an exercise in futility. We certainly have moved far frown the days of Grotius, when the high seas and its treasures were regarded as belonging to nobody, or to the strongest Power. Today, the world realizes that this Conference has a new opportunity to put into effect accepted principles of justice where man's poverty takes priority of consideration over man's power. Even here, however, let me sound a note of caution: to bring satisfaction to the millions who expectantly await the finality of these deliberations, it is necessary to overcome traditionally nationalistic acquisitive postures and substitute political will and a new faith in mankind.\n284.\tFinally, whether the activities occupying the attention of mankind be in the sea, on land or in the air; whether it- be the creation of more food, housing or otherwise to enhance the dignity of man; whether it be to assail the economic ills of the world: we need each other.\n285.\tI would like to close, with words from one of Africa's illustrious sous, President Julius K. Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania, calling for co-operation among the developing countries in the creation of a new economic order, when he said:\n\\\"We are not absolutely without allies when we demand reforms of the international economic system in the direction of justice. There is a growing number of organized groups within wealthy countries, and even a small number of wealthy Governments, which have recognized that the struggle for human equality and human dignity cannot stop at national boundaries.\\\"\nI commend these words to you all.\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation was very much moved by the sad news, which we heard a short time ago from the Secretary-General, of the loss to humanity in the death of Paul Hoffman. It is a loss to science, technology and experience. Mr. Hoffman, with his unrivaled knowledge, his keen interest in humanity, his zeal in the service of mankind and for the acceleration of the development of the developing countries, was an example to all. To his wife and family, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to the United States delegation we express our condolences.\n214.\tMr. Hassan Makki, our Deputy Premier and the head of our delegation, has been unable to be here in time and I have been entrusted with the reading of the text of the statement of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic on his behalf.\n215.\tMr. President, I should like to offer you our warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. Your unique personality, your wide knowledge, your great experience and your successful and sustained struggle for liberty and development were and will remain the motives that led the international community to entrust you with that important duty. If our sister Republic of Algeria is rightly proud of you it is because you represent also the, noble continent of Africa, that vigorous continent which looks forward to a better future and which is trying to take its proper place in the world community, thanks to its successful struggle to eliminate colonialism and repugnant and condemned racial concepts. We reaffirm that our delegation will do its utmost to co-operate with you in the successful fulfillment of the great task which you are now undertaking.\n216.\tOur unreserved faith in the Charter of the United Nations and our unconditional support for the principles on which this world Organization is based reaffirm our trust in the choice of yourself to occupy your high post and express the conviction of the international community regarding the great role which is being played by the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria in the field of international cooperation and In the restructuring of world, international and economic relations on a just and democratic basis.\n217.\tMy delegation would like to pay tribute on this occasion to the President of the previous session of the General Assembly, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who in his presidency combined prudence and ability.\n218.\tMy delegation would also like to welcome and express its warmest congratulations to the Republic of Bangladesh, to Grenada and to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on their admission to membership in the United Nations.\n219.\tI am very pleased to inform the General Assembly about developments in modern Yemen, which is trying strenuously to emerge from the era of isolationism and underdevelopment, an era in which it was deprived of the benefits of modern civilization, science and technology.\n220.\tTwo weeks ago Yemen celebrated its national day. Thanks to our victories over underdevelopment, reaction and stagnation, we are now harvesting all our potentialities and resources and moving forward in great strides towards a better and more promising future that will restore to this Arab State its ancient glories that were described by the world of the time in terms of the wealth of Saba and Arabia Felix. We have opened wide the doors of Yemen to all that is useful, so that we may take advantage of, and bring to our country and to our sons, the blessings of knowledge and development and all that can lead us to prosperity, while adhering fully to our moral principles and religious precepts. For this reason, we have drawn from modern concepts provisions for the latest type of democratic institutions and progressive constitutions that are in keeping with our religion and faith and our traditions, which are based on consultation and justice. We are now applying the best administrative system that can ensure the attainment of our ideal objectives.\n221.\tIn the field of education, we have built and are building hundreds of schools and institutes in order completely to wipe out ignorance and illiteracy, and we have established a young and ambitious university. We have sent out missions to our sister countries and to other friendly countries in order for them to learn as much as they can, in collaboration with UNESCO, in their particular fields of specialization.\n222.\tIn the field of public health, we have built and are building hospitals and clinics. We are recruiting our own doctors and all doctors coming to our country from our sister countries. In this area we are cooperating with WHO to the extent that we can, with a view to eradicating epidemics and disease.\n223.\tIn the field of social affairs and labor, we have established a special ministry and enacted modern laws for the purpose of developing our society and ensuring social justice in its highest concepts. In this area we are co-operating with the ILO.\n224.\tAlso in the field of labor, for purposes of ensuring communication in all its forms, we have built many roads. Strenuously and indefatigably, we are completing a vast, country-wide network of roads that will link the coast with the hinterland, passing through very lofty mountains exceeding 3,000 meters in altitude, connecting the cities with each' other, on the one hand, and with the countryside on the other. We have also built a modern port on the Red Sea and are engaged in building two other ports. Through telecommunications, we have connected Yemen with the whole world: by telephone and telex and with modern airports and international airlines. In collaboration with ITU, we have built a network that can be considered among the most modern.\n225.\tIn order to develop agriculture and our country is, first and foremost, an agricultural one, cultivating a variety of crops in different areas we have created modern farms and are trying to improve irrigation by both surface and underground water. In this field we are collaborating with FAO.\n226.\tWe are also working in other fields of activity, seriously and arduously, with the aim of ridding ourselves as rapidly as possible of the heritage of underdevelopment by advancing along the road to development and growth, in order to guarantee a dignified life to the 8 million people of our country. I wish to take this occasion to thank our sister countries and the other friendly countries that have extended their assistance to us in generous fashion and with no strings attached.\n227.\tAfter a period of stagnation, our co-operation with the technical agencies and various bodies of the United Nations and the international financial institutions has grown, and every year witnesses an increased understanding of the needs of Yemen on the part of these important agencies. This increase in their understanding results in an increase in the credit that can be extended to our country, thus assisting us greatly along the path of growth and development. Yemen also is thankful for the assistance that is being extended to it by UNDP and by other financial institutions that have provided us with assistance.\n228.\tWe all know very well that the object of including the name of Yemen among the 25 developing States is to implement all the resolutions adopted by the international community with a view to pushing forward this group of nations as quickly as possible; and we are sure that the assistance of our friends and the help of the international community will fail in reaching that objective unless we, the peoples and Governments, work hard and exploit all our resources, as we are now indefatigably engaged in doing. We also believe that the inclusion of our country's name in the list of the 25 developing countries is an additional incentive for us to step up our goal of development. We have learned from our own experience and from that of others in positions similar to ours that the development of our economy merits all our care and understanding and an open mind.\n229.\tThere have been developed some limited industrial and economic enterprises that could be successfully undertaken by government. The other enterprises, however, need capital, initiative, experience, expertise and personal effort, and for that reason my Government has enacted the most liberal laws for the purpose of encouraging investment on the part of both national and foreign capital with a view to bringing about a renaissance that will provide prosperity for the country and an honest and dignified living for the increasing numbers of our ambitious youth.\n230.\tWe have recently signed two agreements for investment in, and prospecting for, oil off our shores, and we sincerely hope that this economic co-operation will succeed, so that we can dedicate all the income and revenue from this valuable resource to raising the standard of living of our people and developing our country.\n231.\tTogether with our brothers in the southern part of Yemen, we look forward with great hope to the happy day when the total and natural unification of Yemen, within its historic boundaries, which is the ambition of every Yemeni, can be achieved, so that the Yemeni people as one can fulfill its ambitions and aspirations for development, prosperity and happiness, thanks to the historic unity long cherished by all the people.\n232.\tPermit me to turn, particularly on the occasion of the mention of oil, to the position of Yemen regarding all the problems and questions which have been referred by the Organization to its Economic and Social Council.\n233.\tIr. this Hall the President of the United States dealt with the question of energy and food all over the world. While my delegation shares the United States President's concern about energy and food, I would draw attention to the fact that oil and gas are limited in quantity and are not renewable. For this reason it is the duty of all humanity to do its best to economize and cut down on its consumption of this resource, so that mankind will not soon be deprived of it; and this particularly as oil not only can be used as energy but also, as a raw material, has thousands of derivatives that can benefit mankind, in the form of medicines and other things.\n234.\tEvery scarce non-renewable resource that is of benefit to all must be the concern of all people and they must fix its price in relation to its scarcity, its importance and its value. However, as there are a number of developing States still in need of oil to help them to ensure the quick pace of their development, it has become necessary to help those developing countries facing oil shortages to acquire oil at reasonable prices. This can be achieved through assistance in kind or. by other practical steps which the oil-producing countries are taking now, and for which we thank them. We heard evidence of that a few moments ago from the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates.\n235.\tAs for food and the vital need for it and the fears resulting from the decrease in food production, I can say that the Preparatory Committee of the World Food Conference has paved the way for holding the Conference this November in Rome in order to deal with this vital question. The Conference may reach practical solutions, such as the establishment of special funds to finance the increase of crops, to facilitate the acquisition of fertilizers at reasonable prices and to supply high-quality seed and other practical measures. My delegation also shares the views expressed on this question by the Foreign Minister of our sister Republic of Kuwait, Mr. Al-Sabah [2249th meeting], regarding the agricultural policy followed by some developed countries which give financial subventions to farmers in return for which they refrain from cultivating large tracts of land, in order to ensure a decrease in food production and a considerable rise in prices. It is worth mentioning that the present corrective change in the price of oil is not the reason for the rise in the prices of foodstuffs and other goods. That has been substantiated by the Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom himself in his address before the General Assembly, when he said that \\\"the unprecedented world-wide economic boom of recent years led to higher commodity prices prior to the recent increases in world oil prices\\\". [2240th meeting, para. 219.]\n236.\tThe international community has witnessed during the past nine months that is, since the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly many events and developments which have given proof of the effective role played by the international Organization in developing international relations and have revealed the growing strength of the non-aligned movement and the new positions gained by this movement along the path taken by the developing countries in reaffirming their political independence and national sovereignty over their natural resources.\n237.\tThe initiative of President Houari Boumediene of Algeria that led to the holding of a special session of the General Assembly to discuss raw materials and development was a true indication of the readiness of the third world countries and their seriousness in assuming historic responsibilities for development, on the one hand, and on the other, in reasserting their independence and their true desire to establish a serious dialog with the industrialized countries on a basis of equality in order to discuss the serious defect in the international economic and monetary system.\n238.\tHere I must refer to the continued monopoly by a few States of the resources of the sea. We hope that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas, which dealt with this problem in a practical and realistic manner, will reach at its forthcoming session in March an agreement that will ensure an equitable and just distribution of the tremendous resources of the sea, so that the developing countries, which have been deprived in the past of justice in that distribution, will have a share commensurate with their needs.\n239.\tWe also hope that the eminent personalities of this world will accept the principle of respect for the sovereignty of all States over their territorial waters, including islands and straits, because it is inconceivable and not in the interest of world peace that the fleets of big naval Powers should continue roving the seas of the world without observing or respecting the sovereignty of the small States. In particular those States feel pain when they see the fleets of those Powers approaching their coasts carrying the most lethal weapons of destruction and devastation, including horrendous atomic weapons. We also hope that the seas, including the Indian Ocean, will become zones of peace and security and not zones for dangerous military rivalry. We sincerely hope on this occasion that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, of which Yemen has the honor to be a member, would arrive at proposals that would lead to avoiding this continued military rivalry between the big Powers in this part of the world whose importance is growing as a result of the growing importance of oil along its shores.\n240.\tAfter having reviewed recent problems and their positive and negative impact on international relations, we would put on record here the viewpoint of my delegation and the view of my country towards some questions which are before the General Assembly.\n241.\tThe problem of colonialism and foreign occupation remains a factor which causes anguish for humanity's conscience and which hinders the progress of peoples, who have been the victims of the crimes of colonization, towards liberty, independence and prosperity. Depriving more than 20 million people of their inalienable right to live free on their own soil and to take part in building a prosperous society, in which justice prevails, runs counter to the spirit of the modern age and is not in keeping with the great developments that have been achieved by twentieth-century man.\n242.\tIt is to be regretted that colonialism and the colonization of Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro, of the African Arab Sahara, which is erroneously called \\\"Spanish Sahara\\\", has not ended. My delegation would denounce the continued colonization of the Arab land and finds it necessary that Spain and the international community should take the necessary steps to end this anomalous situation at this late stage of decolonization. The international community should not accept any measures which would ensure the perpetuation of domination or colonization, whether overtly or covertly. For this reason we support totally the moderate and prudent step which has been taken to place the case of this African-Arab territory before the International Court of Justice as a measure to put an end to colonization in all its forms.\n243.\tAlthough we welcome the spirit of realism shown by the new regime in Portugal and its pragmatic stand on the question of some colonies in Africa, we would appeal to them to end all colonial regimes in all parts of Africa which are still under Portuguese domination, particularly in Angola, by granting it, without delay, its legitimate right to self-determination and independence. What we have heard from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal enhances our optimism and our hope.\n244.\tThe cause of liberty and decolonization in Africa has not come to an end. Namibia is still groaning under the yoke of oppression and barbarism practiced by the racist regime of South Africa. Despite the world's appeals which have been addressed by the United Nations to the minority regime in Johannesburg the intransigence of this minority racist regime and its slighting of world opinion remain unchanged. We have reached the point of no return at which it is useless and futile to issue further resolutions and appeals. In the face of this situation it is the duty of the United Nations, with all its 138 Member States, to take drastic action which would ensure the compliance of South Africa with the resolutions of the General Assembly. We stress the responsibility of Member States to respect and observe their obligations and implement the resolutions on embargoes adopted by the United Nations.\n245.\tThe problem of Southern Rhodesia reflects a particular situation which is identical with what had taken place in occupied Palestine. In both cases, British colonialism had given foreign adventurers and terrorists the opportunity to occupy the two countries and, by encouraging them, to impose their domination over the indigenous peoples of those countries through terrorism and slaughter. We all remember how Great Britain withdrew from Palestine and abdicated its responsibilities as a mandatory Authority. It repeated the same operation in Southern Rhodesia, neglecting its international obligations towards the League of Nations and then towards the United Nations.\n246.\tThe bloody events which have taken place on the island of Cyprus since 15 July last and the regrettable developments which have taken place after the military coup that overthrew the constitutional Government headed by Archbishop Makarios is one of the dangerous negative points in international relationships, Though we do not want to dwell on this problem in detail, we would strongly support the resolutions adopted by the Security Council. We also reaffirm our special concern for and strong awareness of the territorial integrity of the island and the independence of the Republic of Cyprus and its position as a distinguished State among the non-aligned countries.\n247.\tThe world as a whole will not rest until racial discrimination and apartheid as practiced in southern Africa and Rhodesia are completely eradicated. My Government would support all resolutions and measures adopted with a view to ending apartheid and racial or ideological discrimination. How could a man, or a thinker, or an institution, or any Government condemn colonialism and the flouting of people's rights and racial discrimination, without mentioning the noble Palestinian people and their sad fate, and without welcoming the most recent resolution adopted by the United Nations, which has duly recognized this basic and important problem of the world by deciding to deal with it for the first time after a great many years of neglect.\n248.\tHere in the General Assembly Hall the Palestinian problem will be dealt with. Is the world entitled to continue to remain silent before the oppression and tyranny practiced against an entire people, exceeding three and a half million in number, of sons of Palestine? This Holy Land was chosen by God to be a place of peace and tolerance and not to be a place of tyranny, oppression and injustice. We are sure that the historians of the United Nations will consider this session to be one of the most important sessions ever held by the Organization and that they will call it the session which reinforced the basic rights of the Palestinian people.\n249.\tEveryone engaged in politics all over the world is now convinced that the noble people of Palestine is worthy of all care and appreciation because this heroic struggling people has proved without doubt and very clearly its genuineness and resolute determination to recover its legitimate rights with unprecedented courage. It has faced and is now facing challenges resolutely and with faith, a fact which has compelled the whole world to admire this people which has risen to its historical responsibilities and has proved its ability to shoulder the heavy burden which has been thrown on its shoulders very recently by the failure of the world community to recognize its basic legitimate rights and the continued injustices of the aggressor. Everybody shares our certainty that there can be no solution to the problem of the Middle East before the Palestinian people has recovered its inalienable and legitimate rights and any sustained neglect of those sacred rights will inevitably result in the further deterioration of the situation in the whole area, a fact which would endanger the whole world.\n250.\tHow can what is called the \\\"Middle East problem\\\" be resolved completely and radically unless a solution is found first to the problem of the Palestinian people whose rights have been denied and who has been expelled from its homeland and has been under the rule of a foreign invader? It is now high time that the world should come to its senses and deal with the cause of the disease, and not be content to avoid its complications and extend its symptoms. For this reason, my Government warmly welcomes the sensible resolution adopted by the United Nations to deal with the Palestinian problem within the proper context and with due care, that is to say, in the General Assembly, and gives the representatives of this noble Palestinian people every chance to explain its cause, to defend it and to put forward practical solutions for it. The bitter experience through which this people has passed has taught it how to contain and deal with the cause of the tragedy facing it, how to defend its legitimate rights and to abide by the concepts and democratic and human principles which have been voiced by it on all occasions.\n251.\tWe are sure that the international community which knows what Zionism is and which fully realizes its dangers, and knows who the Palestinian people is and what are its rights, will listen to the explanations of the Palestinian delegation from this rostrum and will support that delegation as it has done so far in all the various political and non-political conferences and meetings whether held within the United Nations or outside it.\n252.\tMy delegation expects the United Nations to abide by the provisions of its Charter, that is to say, to give the Palestinian people its full untrammeled right to return to its fatherland and to restore to the whole people, regardless of whether they return to their fatherland or not, the right to practice sovereignty and full and immediate independence.\n253.\tI reaffirm that my Government has unshakable faith in the fact that unless this people is restored to its rights and unless it is given the right to sovereignty and independence in its fatherland, there will never be any lasting peace in the Middle East, and the world's conscience will never be at rest because of the continuation of this tragedy. That is why we call for its radical solution on a just basis. If that is not done the whole area will be engulfed in a destructive war which, in turn, may become a world calamity.\n"

        "file_text": ": It is for me a great honor and privilege to address this Assembly in my capacity both as current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] and as head of State of the Somali Democratic Republic. It is a happy coincidence for me also to see this historic session of the General Assembly presided over by a great statesman and an outstanding son of Africa, Abdelaziz Bouteflika.\n65.\tI take this opportunity to extend to you, Mr. President, our warm congratulations on your accession to the important office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Our satisfaction at your election to this high office arises first of all from the confidence we have in you because of the qualities of statesmanship you have so brilliantly demonstrated in the course of your long and distinguished career in international politics. It stems also from the close political and cultural ties that bind our two sister countries, both of which are members of OAU, the Arab League and the group of non-aligned States.\n66.\tMy sincere congratulations go also to Mr. Leopoldo Benites, whose illustrious and wise chairmanship guided us all so ably in the United Nations during the momentous period of the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly held in April 1974.\n67.\tIt is always a pleasant task to welcome newly independent countries to membership of the United Nations, and we are happy to extend our congratulations to Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau on their admission to membership of the Organization. In acquiring these new Members the United Nations has been brought closer to its goal of universality, and it will undoubtedly be strengthened by the additional contributions that will be made to its work for peace, justice and progress.\n68.\tThe ideals which brought OAU into being and which have sustained its vigorous life and growth are those cherished ideals which inspired the Charter of the United Nations. Faithful to those lofty principles, OAU seeks to complement rather than supplant the efforts of, the United Nations to produce an atmosphere of justice, freedom and progress for all mankind. The close co-operation between the two bodies should be intensified even more in the coming years to solve the vexing problems of our times and especially those which concern the twin scourges of racial and colonial domination and economic underdevelopment.\n69.\tWith OAU, as with the United Nations, achievements sometimes fall short of goals. But in working to promote peace and progress on the African continent through political, economic and social cooperation on the basis of African solidarity, and in using non-alignment as the governing principle of its external relations, OAU contributes to the consolidation of international peace and security and the development of co-operation among States.\n70.\tThe evil forces of colonialism and racism still remain the most pressing problems facing both OAU and the United Nations. The struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination in southern Africa and elsewhere has long presented a challenge to all men of good will. The major initiatives taken by the African Members of the United Nations in keeping these issues before the conscience of the world have been an important factor in establishing their prominence in international affairs. But the campaign against colonialism and racial discrimination is a world responsibility, not just an African responsibility, for the evils which the campaign seeks to eliminate run counter to the basic principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n71.\tThe dramatic developments in the situation in southern Africa brought about by the change of Government in Portugal should elicit the support and sympathy of the world community. These developments have opened the way for extensive progress to be made towards the fulfillment of the long-standing goals of the world Organization in its pursuit of peace, justice and freedom.\n72.\tThe leaders of the new Portuguese regime are to be congratulated on realizing the futility of a colonial war. In recognizing the sovereignty of Guinea-Bissau and promising full and orderly independence for Mozambique in June 1975, and in declaring its commitment soon to grant independence to Angola, Sao Tome and Principe and the Cape Verde Islands, the Portuguese Government has shown political vision and wisdom. It is a matter of great pride for Africa and for the United Nations, which has done much to further the cause of freedom and justice that Guinea-Bissau is amongst us today as a sovereign State. In reality, Portugal has not given away anything it had not already lost, but that does not lessen its credit for averting further bloodshed.\n73.\tWhile Africa will reciprocate the good will of the new regime in Portugal by ending decades of diplomatic isolation and centuries of African resentment towards that country, yet we are watching anxiously and with the utmost vigilance the pace of progress towards independence for all the Portuguese colonies in Africa. Thus, our degree of appreciation for Portugal will depend on how far it fulfills its solemn obligations and undertakings in implementing its policy of independence for the remaining African Territories under its control, namely, Angola, the Cape Verde Islands, Sao Tome and Principe. The Assembly is aware of the fact that there are reactionary forces that may try to obstruct and sabotage the progress of emancipation for the African peoples concerned.\n74.\tIn addition, during the crucial period following their independence, the new African States emerging from colonial rule will require material, technical and even military assistance to consolidate their hard-won independence and to promote their economic development and national reconstruction. The United Nations with its special committees on decolonization, apartheid and Namibia should, in co-operation with OAU, prepare a comprehensive plan which will take into account all foreseeable requirements and eventualities. We feel strongly that only thus can we safeguard the newly emerging independent African States and provide them with an opportunity to consolidate their independence and national development.\n75.\tHaving given that solemn warning against undue complacency which might tempt hostile forces to reverse the policy of mutual understanding and co-operation now unfolding in Afro-Portuguese relations, I should like to state for the record, on behalf of OAU, that Africa is ready to extend friendship and co-opera-tion to Portugal and its people. They should have no fear for the safety of their people, property and interests in liberated Africa. It is not in the nature of the Africans to be vindictive. Africa has amply demonstrated to the world that its former colonialists can live in peace and prosperity as long as they are willing to abide by the laws of the country in which they reside. The Portuguese are no exception, and we are confident that they will have greater peace in liberated Africa than they had in Africa under Portuguese colonial domination. We Africans have suffered for centuries from discrimination on grounds of racialism and so we are ever on guard against inverse racialism.\n76.\tThe current events in Africa have demonstrated beyond doubt the effectiveness of the armed struggle waged by African liberation movements against colonial and racist domination. When the colonialists and racists rejected our pleas and peaceful gestures, as put forth in the Lusaka Manifesto, Africa realized that armed struggle was the only avenue open to subjected African peoples to liberate themselves from colonial bondage and racist domination. It was in this spirit that the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held at Rabat in 1972 endorsed the historic Mogadiscio Declaration.\n77.\tThe present developments in Africa have illustrated also the importance and effectiveness of the United Nations campaign against colonialism and racial discrimination. That campaign elicited from the world community a great deal of moral and material support for the liberation movements, which were given the means and the courage to continue their struggle in the knowledge that they did not stand alone. In this connexion, we would like to express our profound thanks and deep appreciation to the socialist and Scandinavian countries and the countries of the third world for their constructive attitude and support to the cause of African liberation.\n78.\tThe Organization of African Unity can take particular pride in the part its members played in working for United Nations recognition of the legitimacy of the liberation struggle and in making the organization a source of and channel for aid.\n79.\tIt is to be hoped that those lessons are now understood by those who have tended to underrate the effectiveness of the liberation movements, to discredit the international campaign and to question the value of the allegedly unenforceable resolutions of the United Nations. Those lessons should be taken to heart, particularly by the racist minority regimes which continue to operate in the remaining pockets of colonial and racist domination and which are even now attempting to undermine the progress attained in the decolonization process.\n80.\tThe momentum of these times must be used to press home a campaign that will complete the process of decolonization and to end the dehumanizing policies of apartheid. The United Nations must continue to expose South Africa's main trading partners, to condemn the violators of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia, and to identify those Governments and corporations whose activities in Namibia are in direct contravention of the findings of the International Court of Justice and the provisions of relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\n81.\tThere is no question about the extent and urgency of the task that still remains to be completed in southern Africa. In the case of Zimbabwe, the genuine political representatives of the people are either in prison, in exile or muzzled by the tyrannical regime which is steadily increasing the pace of its application of apartheid policies and yet successive British Governments, whatever their political coloring, have not recognized their political, legal and moral obligation to use all means, including the threat or use of force, to end the tragedy that is unfolding in Southern Rhodesia.\n82.\tThe grave escalation of repressive measures against the people of Namibia must be of particular concern to the United Nations because of its special responsibility for that Territory. Here is another area where there must be an intensification of aid to the liberation movements which represent the oppressed people of Namibia, and a universal campaign should be launched to inform international public opinion on this question. In this regard, attention must be directed to those financial and other interests which recognize and support South Africa's illegal administration over the Territory in order to exploit the Territory's natural resources.\n83.\tWe feel that the time has come for more drastic and concrete action to be taken by this world body against the racist regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury. The presence of the South African regime in the Organization is unjustified, and indeed a liability to this world body. It is gratifying to learn that the Credentials Committee at the present session has taken a historic decision in rejecting the credentials of this regime. That decision reflects the state of high political maturity reached by the Members of the Organization, and we trust that the Security Council will accept it as reflecting the general consensus of this Assembly. I therefore appeal to the Member States to support the call for the expulsion of the racist regime of South Africa. This is the only meaningful step which can be taken in view of the chronic refusal on the part of the South African regime to comply with the rulings of the United Nations. This step should be followed up by economic sanctions and by the tightening up of the arms embargo.\n84.\tWe call especially upon the Western Powers to use their decisive influence to induce the racist regimes of Salisbury and Pretoria to accept the implementation of the just resolutions of the United Nations. We feel sure that without the material and economic assistance of those Western Powers the racist regimes of southern Africa would soon be brought to reason.\n85.\tI take the opportunity to mention other countries that are also being denied their right to freedom and self-determination, namely, Spanish Sahara, Seychelles and French Somaliland. These Territories are retained by the big colonial Powers primarily because of their economic, commercial and strategic value. Both OAU and the United Nations have long pressed for the complete and unconditional independence of those Territories. It is the earnest hope of OAU that the Assembly at its present session will intensify its pressure so as to attain self-determination for these peoples.\n86.\tBefore concluding my remarks on the African liberation struggle, let me also say a few words about those other parts of the third world suffering from imperial domination. The cause of the progressive forces in the pursuit of justice and freedom and their struggle against the evil forces of imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism is a reflection of con-temporary world developments. The trend of world events demonstrates that the struggle of people for independence represents an irresistible force which can never be stopped or weakened. We are observing with admiration the many successes scored by the liberation movements and progressive forces in different parts of the world in their efforts to secure their freedom and human dignity. It is incumbent upon the Organization to support a\\\" subjected peoples in the attainment of their just cause and the fulfillment of their human aspirations.\n87.\tIn this connexion, we call for withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, Viet Nam and Cambodia, and we demand that the people in these Territories be allowed to shape their own political future without any foreign intervention or external pressure. The right to self-determination and the fundamental principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of States, both enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, should be strictly observed and given full expression in our inter-State relations.\n88.\tAnother vital issue of immediate concern to us is the Middle East crisis. The Middle East situation is of particular importance to OAU, since it involves the Arab Republic of Egypt, a founding member of that Organization. The OAU has spared no efforts to reason with the Israeli authorities in the hope that they would change their callous negative attitude and comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions calling upon Israel to evacuate the Arab lands it is illegally occupying and to restore the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine. But Israel chose to turn a deaf ear to our appeals, and consequently almost all the OAU Member States have severed diplomatic relations with Israel. With the blessing of some Powers, that country continues to persist with impunity in its defiance of universal public opinion and international morality.\n89.\tThe disengagement of Arab and Israeli forces on the Egyptian and Syrian fronts is no cause for complacency. The situation in the Middle East will continue to be dangerously explosive so long as Israel remains in illegal occupation of Arab territory and so long as the rights of the Palestinian people are ignored and so long as Jerusalem remains in Israeli hands.\n90.\tThe illegality of Israel's occupation of Arab territory is compounded by its active promotion of permanent Israeli settlements on the Golan Heights, the West Bank of the Jordan, in the Gaza Strip and the Sinai peninsula. In a policy of open expansionism, more settlements of Israelis have been established on occupied Arab territory since 1967 than in Israel itself. Israel has also made no secret of its intention to annex Jerusalem and to alter the demographic and Arab character of the City.\n91.\tBut that is not the end of these tragic developments. Israel continues to commit acts of aggression against the neighboring independent Arab States. The frequent military incursions into Lebanese territory, in violation of that country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the indiscriminate bombing of Lebanon's civilian population illustrate how far the Israelis are prepared to go beyond the rule of international law and beyond the norms of civilized behavior between States.\n92.\tBy acknowledging the Palestinian issue as a separate item on the agenda of this session, we are putting the Middle East conflict in its true perspective, and this reflects the mature development of the world body in coming to grips with the heart of the matter. The suffering and injustice inflicted on the people of Palestine for more than a quarter of a century is a tale of woe that defies any description. If there could ever be a crime against humanity in the same league as nazism and apartheid, it is this. What is even more tragic and depressing is that the principal perpetrators of this serious crime happen to be the very people who were themselves the victims of nazism.\n93.\tThe Organization of African Unity recognized long ago that the issue of the Palestinian people is a matter meriting special emphasis, and that is why the Palestine Liberation Organization was given observer status in that Organization.\n94.\tConfronted by this problem, with all its implications for the countries of the area, we can no longer afford to bury our heads in the sand like ostriches. We should recognize the inevitability, indeed the desirability, of a Palestinian State; and once that is accepted in principle by all concerned, including the world Organization, then and only then can we hope to be on the threshold of peace in the area.\n95.\tThe solidarity of African States in support of the Arab cause has always been, and continues to be, solely a matter of principle. It constitutes a clear testimony to the determination of member States of OAU to support peoples fighting for their land, their freedom and their dignity, to support a member of the regional organization whose territory continues under military occupation and to support a cardinal principle of international peace and security.\n96.\tThe recent October war in the Middle East not only brought victory to the heroic Arab peoples, particularly those of Egypt and Syria, but also confirmed the bonds of friendship and solidarity between African and Arab peoples in their just struggle against imperialism, racism and zionism. The basis of Afro-Arab co-operation lies in the pursuit of common objectives by the African and Arab peoples in their commitment to achieve the total liberation of their territories and to speed up their economic development. The bonds between the two peoples have always remained firm and unshakable. Africa and the Arab world have been and are linked by similar experiences; they are committed to the same ideals and principles and are facing a common enemy in their struggle for freedom, peace and justice. There is a special relationship between OAU and the League of Arab States both of which have common aims and principles. It is important to stress here that the two organizations are complementary to the United Nations and that they are firmly committed to the furtherance of the principles of international peace and co-operation set out in the Charter of the United Nations.\n97.\tThe tragic events in Cyprus are yet another major concern to the United Nations. It is significant that we should address ourselves here to the fundamental issues regarding the present crisis in Cyprus. In this connexion, we feel that all the parties concerned should meet under the auspices of the United Nations with a view to seeking ways and means towards an appropriate settlement. To restore peace and stability in the island, we should ensure that the Cypriot people are allowed to determine their own political future.\n98.\tRegarding the international climate, we are satisfied with the efforts of the Soviet Union and the United States of America to reduce tension and eliminate sources of conflict in the interest of world peace and security. We have been following with interest the major steps taken by the two big Powers to lessen the threat of cold war and to normalize relations as a contribution to peace and co-operation. We also noted with appreciation the recent dramatic events in the international situation, notably China's recovery of its rights within the United Nations, the acceptance of\nEast and West Germany as full Members of the United Nations, the East/West summit meetings, and the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.\n99.\tWhile we welcome the progress that has been made towards East/West detente, we are also shocked by the tragic developments occurring in many parts of the world. It is significant to point out here that the accomplishment of peace within the industrialized world alone does not necessarily mean world peace.\n100.\tI am sure that the Assembly is fully informed about the serious developments in the Indian Ocean where strategic naval bases of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have been established. This is a direct threat to the peace and security of Africa and particularly of those countries adjacent to the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean should remain as it was in the past, a zone of peace, free from any big-Power confrontations. We therefore call upon all Powers that have strategic bases in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere to dismantle those bases immediately in the interest of world peace and security.\n101.\tSpeaking on the role and the functioning of the United Nations, it is important to emphasize the need to review the basic structures and institutions set out in the Charter. The United Nations cannot continue as a static Organization. It is imperative that we assess its current structural weaknesses and suggest remedial measures. The scope of its powers should be widened, some of its basic organs should be made more representative and, above all, it must be vested with more effective authority to satisfy the demands and aspirations of mankind. The role of the Organization in its quest for peace and progress calls for a new approach as well as firm dedication in dealing with pressing international problems. What we urgently need is a genuine world body vested with the powers and authority required for the realization of its declared aims and objectives.\n102.\tIn this connexion, the big Powers have a major part to play. Instead of acting individually or unilaterally in their peace efforts, it would be more desirable if they supported and co-operated with the United Nations in its peace-keeping operations. This would be a major contribution to a more effective discharge of its functions by the Organization.\n103.\tDespite its legal and practical limitations, the United Nations has on many occasions demonstrated its capacity to deal with major international issues. As an experiment in universal co-operation among nations, its capabilities and potentialities for world peace cannot be underestimated. It is our only hope for survival in our time. I am confident, therefore, that it will continue to be a major source for peace, progress and prosperity of mankind.\n104.\tI should like now to say a few words on some of the major economic and social problems that are facing not only the African countries but also most of the developing countries.\n105.\tThe important and historic resolutions adopted by the Assembly during the sixth special session on raw materials and development, convened on the initiative of President Houari Boumediene of Algeria, provided an equitable basis for future international economic co-operation. We have high hopes that those resolutions will be fully implemented.\n106.\tThe road to social transformation is long and arduous and the constraints to real development have both internal and external dimensions. Developing countries are fully prepared to tackle their own internal problems. The situation is, however, made all the more difficult and complicated by the volatile nature of certain factors outside the control of the developing countries. These are international trade, inflation, monetary crises, the insensitivity of the world's richest countries to the problems of the poor and, above all, aggression and insecurity. The world's consciousness of these problems has been heightened and the developing countries are completely aware of the causes of their plight. This is a great achievement. Once the true diagnosis is made, the most effective remedy can be prescribed.\n107.\tEconomic and social transformation of developing countries is the responsibility of those countries themselves. That responsibility cannot be delegated. Transfer of resources from developed countries to developing countries can only supplement domestic effort; it cannot supplant it. Only through self-reliance and complete commitment to economic and social transformation can developing countries be the masters of their destiny. It is imperative that agriculture, industry and human development be given top priority in consolidating national economies and in striving to abolish complete dependence on developed countries for markets, technology and manpower.\n108.\tThe unfavorable economic position of the developing countries is the result of the inequitable position in which they have been placed by the capitalist international division of labor.\n109.\tThe developing countries are raw material producers whose prices in the world market have been declining in relation to those of the more sophisticated manufactured and processed goods. Even with today's unprecedented rise in prices for all commodities, the relative increase in raw-material prices in general is far less than the rise for manufactured goods, and consequently the terms of trade of developing countries have deteriorated even further.\n110.\tThe situation is untenable, and in the absence of an international mechanism to solve the problem, it can be redressed only through concerted action on the part of the developing countries. It is only logical that developing countries should form producers' associations and exert pressure jointly for fair returns on their real resources, so that they may achieve equality in international and economic relations among nations.\n111.\tIn establishing a new international order, the method by which the transfer of resources is affected, and its magnitude, should be changed in conformity with the real needs of developing countries. Developed countries have both a moral obligation and a self- interest in participating in the development of developing countries. In order that such participation may be meaningful, the transfer of resources has to be adequate in volume, reliable in supply, and soft in terms and conditions. Aid must be free from military alliance and be completely united to purchases from the donor countries. It is also appropriate to ensure more transfer of resources to areas where needs are felt most acutely. I have in mind here the least developed among the developing countries, and the areas that have been hard hit by natural catastrophes, especially the Sahel, some of the east African countries, Bangladesh and Honduras.\n112.\tAnother major problem is inflation. It is a phenomenon which has arisen entirely in developed capitalist countries and has been transmitted to the developing countries. The dominance of the multi-national companies, their struggle for markets, raw materials and investment opportunities in developing countries, and the high degree of militarism aimed at stifling national independence and social revolution in the third world, have introduced a world-wide inflationary pressure that is robbing developing countries of their real resources. The so-called oil crisis has been projected as the cause of world inflation. This is a calculated move to divide developing countries and to negate their new gains. If the fundamentals are to be tackled, it is imperative that we direct our attention more to the major capitalist exploitations, especially the enormous profits of oil companies; to the introduction of a more equitable division of labor in international trade; to a reduction of militarism abroad; and to genuine reform of the international monetary system.\n113.\tA major problem that confronts most African countries in their development efforts results from the constraints imposed by the smallness of their markets and by the lack of genuine common markets at sub- regional levels. As a first step towards greater integration, the water tight compartments into which African countries are placed in respect of telecommunication networks, airlines, postal services, banking, highways and sea transport have to be dismantled. We see an urgent need for quick and fruitful action in this direction.\n114.\tAn immediate and pressing task for international action is that of dealing with the effects of the drought that hap been experienced in countries all around the world but which has been a disaster of incalculable proportions in the Sahelian countries and in Ethiopia. African States are grateful for the generous assistance that has been received from many countries and many international organizations. However, since there are strong indications that the drought has become a permanent phenomenon because of fundamental changes in world climatic conditions, it is necessary that this phenomenon continue to be studied, that regional and international machinery for dealing with its effects continue to operate, and that relief programs be established on a permanent basis.\n115.\tAlthough positive developments have taken place in Africa and in international affairs as a whole, the difficult problems which lie ahead continue to pose a serious challenge to the Organization. We still live in a world divided between rich and poor; a world where imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and racism still exist in many of its parts; a world which is still under the threat of nuclear war; a world that is governed by economic systems which are unjust. I am sure that none of us has any illusions about the magnitude of these problems.\n116.\tIn dealing with these pressing issues there is a need for closer co-operation and understanding among nations at both regional and international levels. All countries, particularly the big Powers, should have greater faith and trust in the United Nations as a peace-keeping organ, thereby increasing its strength and effectiveness. In an interdependent world there must be a global approach to the solution of international problems. The Organization of African Unity will continue to make valuable contributions to the United Nations by promoting its international role and increasing its effectiveness.\n117.\tBefore I conclude, I will in the name of OAU and in my capacity as Soman head of State, to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his dedication to the work of this great Organization. Since his accession to the office of Secretary-General, he has exerted determined efforts in promoting the cause of peace, justice and freedom. May I extend to him and his staff our warm congratulations.\n118.\tI am fully confident that the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will bring about adequate solutions to the pressing international problems facing us, thus fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of mankind. I wish you every success in your work and I thank you for giving me this opportunity to address you here.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is a particular pleasure for me to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am firmly convinced that your great competence and vast experience will make it possible to bring the work of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion. Your election to the important function o* President of this session is not just a tribute paid by the whole world to your qualities but is also a tribute to the heroic struggle of the Algerian people. The bonds of brotherhood and friendship binding the Democratic Republic of Yemen to Algeria stem from our membership in a single Arab nation and our identical experiences of the armed struggle which we waged before independence. In view of the close links which unite us, we are happy and proud to see you, as the representative of struggling Africa, presiding over the General Assembly.\n99.\tI should like to salute your predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, who so competently presided over the work of the last session and the work of the sixth special session.\n100.\tI should also like to express our appreciation for and support of the sincere efforts of the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for having intensified the activities cf the United Nations and for making its contribution more effective in the maintenance of international peace and security.\n101.\tThe particular importance of the United Nations today must be constantly confirmed by Member States which should combine their efforts in order to safeguard the Organization, strengthen it and to apply its resolutions in such a way as to permit it to play a dynamic role in the maintenance of international peace and security.\n102.\tWhen one takes a close look at recent developments in the international arena one finds that these developments have tolled the death knell of imperialism and foreign domination. However, there are some regions which continue to be under limitations and suffer from foreign intervention. Some peoples do not yet exercise their right to self-determination and cannot themselves dispose of their own destinies. However, we are happy to find some new Members among us this year. This symbolizes the fact that the United Nations is very close to achieving its objective of universality.\n103.\tMy country bids welcome to Guinea-Bissau, a country which has been waging a fierce struggle against foreign domination and has made heavy sacrifices in its attempt to gain its independence and free-dom. We have the greatest possible respect for the people and hope that the delegation of Guinea-Bissau will convey to the people and Government of that country our high esteem of their heroic struggle and also our welcome to it now that it has become an active Member of the international community. We should also like to bid welcome to the Republic of Bangladesh to which we are bound by ties of friend-ship. We should also like to bid welcome to Grenada.\n104.\tOur people has waged a fierce struggle against imperialism but, thanks to its armed struggle, we have been able to gain independence. However, we have encountered many difficulties since independence. Reactionary, feudal forces have hampered the progressive measures we have adopted in the political, economic and social fields, but we have thwarted those attempts, thanks to the awakening of our people and to its political organization brought about by the national front, and we have been able to rebuff imperialism and neo-colonialism in all their forms.\n105.\tOur country attaches great importance to economic development. Indeed, colonialism has bequeathed us a very weak economy, based essentially upon services. Even so, since independence we have been able to rectify the situation and, in order to free our economy, we have adopted nationalization measures and created a public sector. We have promulgated a law on agrarian reform, which has been applied for the benefit of the poor peasants who are the lawful owners of the land. We have also set up agricultural co-operatives and State-owned farms. We have created cultural centers, built schools and hospitals and brought about far-reaching economic, political and social changes, thanks to the guidance and leadership of the political organization, the national front.\n106.\tOur people has made tabula rasa of many out-moded concepts. Many laws have been enacted in order to organize new social relations. A three-year economic plan the first for the country has been put into effect, and that has made it possible for us to lay some of the foundation for our economic activities and to develop our social services. In April last, we began to implement another five-year plan to develop the national economy, in which we are relying on our own efforts and the sincere assistance provided by fraternal countries in the socialist camp.\n107.\tIn spite of our limited resources, in the space of seven years that is, since independence we have been able to do twice as much as was done for our people by colonialism in 129 years of occupation. We have achieved our political independence, and we are struggling for our economic and social independence. To eliminate the remnants of the past, we are attempting to improve the standard of living of our people, and we are sure that our people will be able to attain the noble objectives which it has set for itself in spite of the constraints imposed from, abroad and in spite of the consequences of colonialism.\n108.\tWe are acting sincerely and in concert with our brothers in northern Yemen to achieve the aspirations of the Yemeni people for unity and progress within the framework of the Cairo Agreement and the Declaration of Tripoli. The Commissions working on unification have already made considerable progress, and we are very proud of that, and the Yemeni people is looking for and to the future with confidence.\n109.\tThe inclusion on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of a separate item entitled \\\"Question of Palestine\\\" [item 108] in itself constitutes international recognition of the importance of the problem of establishing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. This recognition is, in part, a positive measure in the direction of the firm position the international Organization should take with regard to its historical responsibilities vis-a-vis the problem of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian problem is above all a political one. Although the United Nations deals only with the humanitarian and social aspects of t he problem, .its true solution lies in the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination, a right which must be applied to all the national territories of that people.\n110.\tMy country considers the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] to be the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and this Organization has been recognized by important international conferences for example, the Arab Summit Conference held recently at Algiers; the Islamic\nConference held at Lahore; the non-aligned countries summit held at Algiers; and the African summit conference recently held in Mogadiscio.\n111.\tThe Palestine Liberation Organization must be recognized and supported by the international community as one of the national liberation movements, and must be treated in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. If the Palestinian problem underlies what we call the Middle East problem, the expansionist policy and constant recourse to aggression of Israel and support for it from imperialism and world Zionism have added new dimensions to the tragedy in the Middle East.\n112.\tThe occupation by Israel of part of the Arab territories as a result of the aggression of June 1967 represents a flagrant threat to peace in that area and hinders all efforts to establish peace. For that reason, we support the struggle of Egypt and Syria to liberate their occupied territories and to drive out the Israeli invaders.\n113.\tInternational relations today have begun to be marked to a large extent by what is known as dialog or international detente. In fact, today our world is witnessing constant efforts aimed at reducing the risks of war and eliminating the dangers of confrontation in a nuclear war, which has conjured up the specter of devastation, and at establishing world peace. Our developing country attaches great importance to peace and security as the basis for a national climate propitious for social and economic development.\n114.\tHowever, dialog and detente should take into consideration the concepts of the liberation of peoples and respect for their national independence. When the prerogatives of the imperialist Powers are threatened, those Powers try to violate independence and national sovereignty, and to increase tensions throughout the world. Armaments manufacturers and the companies that serve the imperialists interests hatch plots to undermine national economies and to fan the flames of conflict in the developing countries in order to overthrow progressive national regimes.\n115.\tThe best proof of that is the example of Chile. A democratic regime chosen by the Chilean people was overthrown, if only temporarily, and the noble citizens have undergone torture and have been thrown into prison. That was brought about by the forces of terror and fascism. The' national sovereignty of Cyprus also has been violated, and a coup d'etat was organized to overthrow Archbishop Makarios, whose regime represented the unity of Cyprus and its independence. That implies a great threat to peace in the region. We must therefore put an end to these foreign interventions in the internal affairs of Cyprus. The interference must cease, and the people of Cyprus must decide their own destiny.\n116.\tHow car* we establish a just and lasting peace when the forces of imperialism and neo-colonialism and their ever-present instruments and organizations throughout the world are engaging in acts of sabotage and are every day finding new methods of intervening in the internal affairs of peoples and States and at-tempting to dominate them? World peace can be achieved only if there is respect for the national sovereignty of States, if there is no intervention in the internal affairs of peoples and if peoples are allowed to decide their own destinies and to choose their own path towards progress and development.\n117.\tOur country borders on the Indian Ocean, and we therefore attach great importance to the military and political developments occurring there. We are very pleased at the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)], because we consider that real peace cannot be established unless an end is put to all military bases in all their forms in the Indian Ocean and the countries around it.\n118.\tIf the fierce imperialist war against the people of Viet Nam has calmed down to some extent, nevertheless the signed accords ending this war are still subject to maneuvers and plots designed to deprive the people of Viet Nam of the enjoyment of the fruits of their long struggle. That is why we support the National Liberation Front and the Provisional Revolutionary Government, the sole representative of the people of South Viet Nam, and ask the United States to put an end to its intervention in the affairs of Viet Nam and to cease its support to the agents of Saigon.\n119.\tWe also support the legitimate struggle of the people of Cambodia and the legitimacy of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia presided over by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, which is the only representative of the people of Cambodia. We call upon the people of the world to support the heroic peoples of IndoChina fighting for their political and economic independence against the forces of aggression and their agents.\n120.\tTo create a climate favorable to stability and the peaceful reunification of Korea, we must bring about a total withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations. We are convinced that those occupation forces will do nothing to reduce tension or to create a propitious climate for effecting a unified Korea. We support the efforts for peace and direct negotiation between the parties without any foreign intervention and we should like to express our support for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which has refused to allow Korea to be admitted to the United Nations as two Korean States.\n121.\tWe also support the just struggle of peoples against colonialism and neo-colonialism; in particular we support the African peoples who are fighting. We condemn the policy of apartheid of the Governments of South Africa and Rhodesia. We should like to express our satisfaction at the serious measures taken by the new Government of Portugal with regard to negotiations with the revolutionaries in Mozambique and Angola in order to permit them to achieve independence and occupy their proper place in the family of nations.\n122.\tWith regard to the liberation movements, we must salute the heroic struggle of the people of Oman, a people which has been fighting to liberate its country from paid agents and enable Oman to find its national identity and discharge its international responsibilities. We support the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman and we condemn foreign intervention in the affairs of that country and the foreign presence in all its forms. We call upon all peace- loving forces to support the heroic struggle of the people of Oman to exercise their legitimate right to self-determination.\n123.\tIn recent years, economic problems have arisen internationally with regard to what is known as the energy crisis. That crisis is nothing but the result of the negative aspects of problems which have afflicted the economies of capitalist countries and which have been exported to the developing countries.\n124.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly highlighted the importance of the creation of a new world economic order based upon justice and equality.\n125.\tWe would like to emphasize today that international detente can only be brought about and inter-national peace and security can only be established in a world where the gap between the industrialized and the developing countries is not always widening, and if we take account of the right to a better life of peoples who are struggling against poverty and underdevelopment in all their forms.\n126.\tTwo world conferences have been held recently, the World Population Conference in Bucharest and the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in Caracas. Although the latter Conference did not yield the results hoped for, it did pinpoint the need for creating a new order which would take account of new developments and new conditions prevailing in the world. Account must be taken, therefore, of the rights of developing countries to full sovereignty over their own natural resources to ensure against exploitation. We hope that the World Food Conference to be held in Rome will adopt measures which will reduce the dimensions of the world food crisis.\n127.\tIn conclusion, we hope that this session will be crowned with success and will justify the great hopes placed in it by those who want to see peace, progress and prosperity reigning throughout the world.\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to express to you, on behalf of the Government and people of the State of Kuwait, heartfelt congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election is a tribute to the high status you enjoy in international circles as a statesman with wide experience. I had the privilege of working with you during Arab meetings and sessions of the non-aligned group of States and other conferences. May I say that my impression of you is one of a man of experience, acumen and ability appreciated by all. I have also had the opportunity to work with you as a colleague and a good friend during the past 10 years, and this has confirmed my earlier impression. I offer my congratulations, and wish you great success during the present session.\n268.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Leopoldo Benites, for the manner in which- he conducted the work of both the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly and the sixth special session, which were marked by great efficiency and impartiality.\n269.\tI should also like to commend the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who has worked hard to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security, and to express appreciation for concern with the problems of the developing countries.\n270.\tKuwait welcomes the admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to membership in the United Nations. I had the honor of taking part in the efforts which led to the conclusion of the agreement between\nBangladesh and Pakistan, as I led the mission which was sent to Dacca by the Islamic Conference in Lahore. I am very pleased to see Bangladesh among the Members of the United Nations.\n271.\tI also welcome the admission of Grenada to membership in the United Nations. May I express the hope that the membership of those two countries will enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations and its capacity to implement the principles enshrined in the Charter and to achieve universality.\n272.\t1 should also like to welcome the admission of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to membership in the United Nations after the struggle of its people culminated in full independence. Kuwait was among the countries which first recognized Guinea-Bissau, because it had faith in the ability of its people to triumph in their struggle against the forces of colonialism and in the lofty principles which require the liquidation of the remnants of colonialism, wherever they may be.\n273.\tThe world has made great strides in various fields of activity since the establishment of the United Nations. However, the only sphere in which little progress has been made is that of international peace and security. The world is still threatened by war and the small countries are a prey to anxiety because they do not find in the Organization or in the pattern of international relations anything to reassure the i about their existence, their destiny, and their right to maintain their independence and territorial integrity.\n274.\tTwo years ago I welcomed the symptoms of detente, which marked the relations between the big Powers, and I should still like to welcome this development, which minimizes the chances of the outbreak of a global war and saves the world from a great deal of fear and suffering. I should, however, pause to state that co-operation among the big Powers was limited in scope and did not include strengthening international peace and security, improving the efficacy of the United Nations and enhancing its prestige.\n275.\tThe best proof one can give of the failure of the. big Powers to discharge their international obligations is the impotence of the Security Council, its constant inability to act in times of crisis and to provide peace and security to the small countries, The big Powers, especially the permanent members of the Security Council, are primarily responsible for undermining the Council, damaging the prestige and impugning its capacity to apply the principles of the Charter. The members of the Security Council should act in a conscientious manner as representatives of the international community. They must also realize that the prominent position they enjoy and the additional privileges assigned to them must have as their counterpart a sense of responsibility , honoring international obligations and adherence to the letter and spirit of the Charter.\n276.\tKuwait has consistently advocated complete and general disarmament in international forums because it believes that the arms race must lead to disaster. The quality of arms in this age and the progress of science and technology have rendered war a dangerous tool for settling disputes among the big Powers and an abortive method of gaining ascendancy. Complete and general disarmament is still a distant ideal and a far-fetched dream. The bilateral disarmament agreements recently concluded between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have turned the arms race from a race of quantity to that of quality, Although 11 years have elapsed since the signing of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, the nuclear Powers have not yet agreed to banning nuclear underground tests, and some Powers still conduct their tests in the atmosphere. The most significant step in the field of disarmament was the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI), annex). We still hope that the Powers concerned will reach an agreement on banning chemical weapons as well, so that this may yield earnest results in the field of disarmament by eliminating destructive weapons and not merely restricting their production and use.\n277.\tMy Government welcomed from the outset the proposal to convene a world disarmament conference, as we believe that this is a vital matter that concerns all countries. At the same time we commend the preparations being made for that conference; their thoroughness and comprehensive character are the best assurance for its success and for fulfilling the major task it is entrusted with.\n278.\tWe welcome the proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in the region of the Middle East. We hope that this proposal will receive the attention it deserves and lead to the conclusion of an international agreement akin to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, which has proved its merit as a means of rescuing that continent from the dangers of nuclear war and an effective method for convincing the big Powers of the need to respect the aspirations of countries which do not wish to get involved in the conflict among big Powers.\n279.\tKuwait also supported from the outset the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. We hope that the report which the Secretary-General will make on the military and naval presence of the great Powers in the Indian Ocean will serve as an incentive to constructive debate that will lead to the conclusion of an international agreement aimed, at dismantling foreign military bases in this ocean and preventing naval deployments near its shores.. This naturally presupposes agreement, understanding and constructive co-operation among all the countries of the Indian Ocean, which must use -solidarity and unity among them as a means to compel the great military Powers to respect their will and their craving for peace. We must.be mindful of the economic aspects of disarmament which dissipate valuably human and material resources that should be used for peaceful purposes to produce houses, food, clothing and medicine for peoples afflicted with poverty and privation.\n280.\tThe organs of the United Nations were preoccupied last year with the appraisal of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, The studies.and deliberations conducted in this respect clearly revealed that the advanced countries did not fulfill their commitments but were rather reluctant to take the necessary measures for providing aid to the developing countries and improving the terms of trade. So long as the Strategy is not applied one must come to the conclusion that the main obstacle is the lack of political will on the part of the developed countries. Kuwait is a developing country, and yet it has been devoting a large percentage of its gross national product during the past years to help less fortunate developing countries support their efforts to achieve self-sustained growth and extricate themselves from poverty and privation.\n281.\tOne must commend the United Nations for its efforts to accelerate the pace of economic and social development in the developing countries notwithstanding the meager financial resources available. I should like to make special mention of the sixth special session, which adopted a Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, designed to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the field of international economic co-operation and further the objectives of the Strategy, i should also like to thank the Organization for its promptness in extending aid to countries afflicted with drought and natural disasters. The concern of the international community with the plight of countries afflicted with such disasters is a new manifestation of true international co-operation and evidence of the prevalence of brotherhood and amity among all nations.\n282.\tSome industrially advanced countries have once more broached the question of the rise in the price of oil and its effect on the inflation which afflicts the international economy . Those countries may have either forgotten or deliberately ignored the incontrovertible fact that the oil companies, the interests they serve and the countries to which they belong had deliberately frozen the price of oil at a very low level for more than a quarter of a century, keeping it thus static in comparison with alternative sources of energy while the prices of all basic commodities, manufactures and services exported by the industrially advanced countries had, been rising constantly throughout that period. Raising the price of oil was in essence the correction of an inequitable situation which persisted for a long time and which was dictated by the responsibility of the oil-producing countries towards their peoples. The insistence of the industrially advanced countries on keeping the price of oil low is designed to perpetuate the practice of depleting the natural and economic resources of the developing countries for the benefit of the industrially advanced countries without giving the developing countries a fair return.\n283.\tThe inflation which afflicts the world today is endemic in the industrially advanced countries, which are trying to evade their responsibilities by putting the blame on the developing countries. The last pretext they have thought up has been to ascribe their economic ills to the rise in the price of oil. Inflation has be deviled the industrially advanced countries since the end of the Second World War. It is a problem created by the economic policies of those countries and their inability to manage their domestic affairs properly. The industrially advanced countries have even exported inflation to the developing countries through the constant rise in the price of their exports of industrial equipment, foodstuffs and the various commodities and services on which the developing countries are entirely dependent.\n284.\tThe developing countries have been incessantly striving, to regain sovereignty over their natural resources and their right to decide how to exploit these resources and use the. revenues therefrom to build their economies and raise the standard of living of their peoples. The developing countries are still striving to establish an equitable relationship between the prices of their exports of raw materials, primary commodities, manufactures and semi-manufactures and the prices of their imports of food-stuffs, manufactures, semi-manufactures, industrial equipment and services.\n285.\tThe claim that energy is being used for political purposes is a cause of wonder. The countries which are heaping blame on the oil-producing countries now are the ones which started the practice of classifying goods, treating some of them as strategic materials subject to special trade rules which prohibit their export to certain countries. In that manner they have subjected trade exchange to political and ideological considerations, and used it as an instrument of pressure and intervention in the domestic affairs of other States. When the Arabs embargoed the export of oil to countries which support Israel and encourage it to>persist in its wanton and aggressive policy, their real aim was to rectify a situation contrary to the basic principles of justice, to restore usurped rights and to remind those countries of their responsibilities towards the people of Palestine, who have been deprived of sovereignty in their homeland and divested of their national and human rights. Hence there is no room for comparison between the pressure exerted by the big Powers to achieve selfish ends and the efforts of the Arab countries aimed at ending occupation, resisting aggression and restoring usurped rights to their rightful owners.\n286.\tMoreover, some industrially advanced countries are now striving to create a link between the so-called energy and food crises. Let us, then, examine the farm policy of these countries and their plans to reduce the area of cultivated land and restrict agricultural production. One can hardly believe that some of these countries pay a subsidy to farmers in return for their commitment to leave vast areas of their farms uncultivated in order to ensure that production is restricted and prices are raised. This policy has been applied in lands noted for their huge agricultural potential and equipped with the most advanced farming and irrigation techniques. One is therefore led to conclude that if the farmers in those countries were free from constraint and encouraged to increase rather than restrict production there would be a large agricultural output which would exceed the needs of the domestic market and make food available at low prices.\n287.\tHow unusual is the policy of those countries that would rather leave fertile land uncultivated and dump the surplus farm produce in rivers or leave it to decay in stores and warehouses than offer it to the developing countries which are in desperate need of it and whose only fault is that they cannot purchase agricultural products with hard currency. Removing existing restrictions on agricultural production in certain industrially advanced countries not only will contribute to alleviating inflation in those countries through a reduction in the prices of agricultural products but also will have far-reaching benefits for all the developing countries whose development plans are frequently disrupted and which strain their meager resources to import food products on harsh terms,\n288.\tOne cannot place food and energy on an equal footing because the source of food is renewable and non-exhaustible while oil by its very nature is nonrenewable and depletable. Oil is also the only source of income for many developing countries, and yet we are constantly subjected to pressure to expand its production though the consumption of one additional drop of it means depriving our future generations, of a life of freedom and dignity .\n289.\tKuwait is keenly alive to the difficulties which international economic problems, including the energy problem, have created for the developing countries, Kuwait has always striven to promote development in the developing countries and help them to attain self-sustained growth. There is no need for me to enumerate the details of the aid extended by my country in the past. Suffice it to say that the aid provided by Kuwait, which is itself a developing country, has constituted about 7 to 8 per cent of its gross national product, which exceeds by far the volume of aid provided by the industrially advanced countries at any time and the obligations imposed by the United Nations Second Development Decade on the developed countries.\n290.\tDuring the sixth special session I had the honor of announcing that the capital of the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development would be increased from $600 million to more than $3,000 million.14 Under its new constituent instrument the Fund will extend economic and technical aid to all developing countries, whereas in its old form its activities were confined to Arab countries. Kuwait has shown preference for extending its aid bilaterally rather than multilaterally because-its long experience has shown that the majority of the developing countries prefer bilateral aid provided that it is not tainted by political considerations and no strings are attached to it, that can be. fully appreciated if one realizes to what extent international organizations are burdened by a bureaucracy which hampers their delivery capacity and exhausts the bulk of their resources.\n291.\tThough the assistance of Kuwait has always been of a long-term character, the recent difficulties of some of the developing countries have induced Kuwait to grant short-term assistance as part of the emergency measures designed to alleviate the lot of the adversely affected developing countries.\n292.\tThe salient feature of our age is the scarcity of natural resources and their inadequacy to meet the needs of the population explosion in some countries. the World Population Conference recently held in Bucharest adverted to this problem and recommended dealing with it as part of the economic and social plans of the countries concerned, which should seek to achieve a fair distribution of resources to provide prosperity to all sections of the population. The United Nations should be commended for treating the food problem as an urgent question whose solution requires a concerted effort and collaboration among all countries. Kuwait welcomes the recommendations of the World *Food Conference and will provide the necessary aid in conformity with its previous stand in support of the World Food Program.\n293.\tWe attach special importance to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which also seeks to explore new natural resources in the sea-bed and to establish a legal regime regulating the exploitation of these resources, which have already been proclaimed by the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction [resolution 2749 (XXF)] , in which the General Assembly solemnly declared that the sea-bed and ocean floor, and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, as well as the resources of the area, are the common heritage of mankind. We hope that exploitation of these resources will help to bridge the gap between the developing and developed countries. The Conference is seeking also to settle the protracted disputes between countries in the area within the limits of national jurisdiction and draft new legal norms more suited to the spirit of our age and the wishes of the developing countries, which constitute the majority of mankind. We sincerely hope that the Conference will succeed, during its next session and in spite of the numerous difficulties it is facing, in reconciling divergent viewpoints and drafting a single convention on the law of the sea which will rectify historical inequities and establish a new legal order.\n294.\tThe developments that took place in Cyprus this summer bring to our minds the importance of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which proclaim the right of States to independence, territorial integrity and respect for their constitutional structure. Kuwait would like to voice its sincere hope that peace and amity may be restored to that island in a manner that would safeguard the right of the communities therein to a life based on equality and justice.\t,\n295.\tOne must always be mindful of colonialism and apartheid, outmoded remnants of the past that should be discarded in this age. It is a source of great satisfaction to observe the policy of the new regime in Portugal and its efforts to recognize the liberation movements in Territories that were previously under its rule. We also hope that Portugal will, without further delay, recognize the independence of Angola, so as to complete the program of work which it initiated when it recognized the independence of Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique. It is a cause of great regret that the racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia still adheres to its inhuman policy and that the Government of South Africa tenaciously persecutes the indigenous patriots in South Africa and Namibia. We are confident that the cause of justice wiU prevail and that these oppressive Governments will soon realize that oppression and tyranny do not pay dividends any longer and that they must recognize the right of peoples to self-determination and renounce apartheid, which is a crime against humanity.\n296.\tDiscussion of colonialism, racial segregation and subjugation leads us once again to discussion of our region, the Middle East, which has been for more\nthan a quarter of a century a stage upon which those interrelated evils have played their sinister role.\n297. Last year at this time the attention of the world was drawn with renewed earnestness to the events of our region, These events convinced those who were still unconvinced that security cannot be established in the Middle East -nor, indeed, in the world at large -as long as the evils of dispersion and deprivation, occupation of the territories of others, disregard for international law and for the principles of the Charter, and violation of the rights of man, the rights of peoples and the rights of States continue to exist in that region.\n298. Although the battlefield is quiet today, it would be a mistake to conclude that the sources of turmoil and the causes for anxiety over the fate of the region and of the international order as a whole have disappeared. For as long as people continue to be displaced and deprived; the original act of usurpation which led to their dispossession and deprivation continues to be perpetrated; and as long as the territories of others continue to be occupied the original aggression which produced such occupation continues. The current state of relative quiet is no more than an external facade. Behind it lies an inadmissible situation, a situation which rests on an evil that has not been remedied and which is certain to generate further turmoil.\n299.\tEver since the General Assembly came to be seized of what has been referred to as \\\"the situation in the Middle East\\\" in the aftermath of the aggression of June 1967, we have emphasized, year after year, that a distinction must be drawn between ,the two principal facets of that situation, namely, the question of Palestine and its destiny, as a country and a people; and the conflict between Israel and the Arab States, of which the latest manifestation has been the occupation by Israel of territories of some Arab States.\n300.\tIn the statements I have made during the general debate at the successive regular sessions of the General Assembly since 1967,1 have always emphasized that in dealing with the Middle East problem that distinction must be the point of departure; that the tragedy which befell Palestine and its people was the original sin and the underlying problem; and that no solution of any of the resultant, successive, grave problems which have arisen in the region since then can constitute a complete or a lasting solution to the Middle East problem, unless it is accompanied by a corrective and radical solution to the tragedy of the Palestinian people -a solution that restores rights, eliminates deprivation, puts an end to usurpation and dispersion, establishes justice where injustice and oppression now reign, and, through all this, creates the conditions for real peace, the peace that is just and lasting, and conducive to security and prosperity.\n301.\tAs I have analyzed the manifold and interrelated aspects of the tragedy of Palestine in the past before the General Assembly, I shall content myself this year with recalling that that tragedy consists of the occupation of Palestine in its entirety and the usurpation of all its resources, the dispossession and displacement of the majority of the Palestinian Arab people and the replacement thereof by alien settlers who have been permitted to exploit the usurped Palestinian resources and to establish on the territory\nof Palestine and at the expense of its deprived, displaced people an imported society and an alien regime which has subjugated those Palestinians who have remained in their homeland. In short, the tragedy of Palestine is the tragedy of an occupied and usurped land and of a people which has been deprived, through displacement or subjugation, of the opportunity to enjoy the most sacred and elemental of its human and national rights, and prevented from living a normal life. The tragedy of Palestine is the product of a process of colonial settlement which has been consummated in the age of decolonization. It is the consequence of the establishment of a racist regime precisely during that era in which the awareness of the evil of racism has spread throughout the world, and the conscience of mankind has rejected and condemned all racist regimes.\n302. My description of the tragedy of Palestine would be neither complete nor fully candid, however, if I did not refer to one of the most painful aspects of that tragedy, namely, that the United Nations and the Assembly in particular bears a considerable portion of the blame for the fate of the Palestinian people and the tragedy of its existence. For, in the final analysis, the situation in which that people has found itself for over a quarter of a century and which constitutes a desecration of sacred principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, is a situation in the creation, aggravation, and perpetuation of which the United Nations itself has played a decisive part whether through actions incompatible with the spirit and letter of the Charter, or through inaction at times when international action was an obligation prescribed by the provisions of the Charter.\n303.\tThus, the tragedy of Palestine, which has persisted throughout this period a very long period in the life of the present Palestinian generation has been since the beginning one of the facets of the tragedy of the United Nations itself. And the corrective solution of this tragedy has been an obligation of the United Nations, and will continue to be so for as long as the agony and deprivation of the Palestinians last. Time, by itself, neither mitigates the impact of the tragedy upon its victim nor absolves the United Nations of its duty to effect a bold and corrective solution.\n304.\tIt is our conviction that the consideration of the question of Palestine as a separate item on the agenda of the General Assembly, independently of other items dealing either with ramifications of that question or with other questions related to it, is more than a procedural matter. It is an act of substantive import that goes to the very essence of the question, for it corrects the previous approach by virtue of which the original question was ignored while some attention was paid to some of its ramifications.\n305.\tIt is also our conviction that, in order for the consideration of the question to be responsible and to reflect an earnestness of purpose and clarity of vision, it must be accompanied by inviting the Palestinian people to participate in the discussions through its legitimate representative, which alone can authoritatively explain its viewpoints, voice its aspirations and define its objectives.\n306.\tIt will be recalled that the tragedy of Palestine was born in circumstances in which the people of Palestine was prevented from participating in the discussions and decisions which subsequently exercised a decisive impact upon its being and destiny: under those circumstances, the absence imposed upon the people of Palestine was both a symptom and a cause of its tragedy. The pursuit of a corrective solution for that tragedy cannot be truly corrective, nor can it produce useful results, unless it begins by restoring the people of Palestine to its proper place, by ensuring its presence at and participation in the deliberations of the General Assembly as the party which alone possesses the right, to express its own will, its aspirations and objectives.\n307.\tIt is accordingly imperative that the PLO which my Government, along with the Governments of the majority of the Member States, recognizes as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Palestine should be invited to participate in the deliberations of the General Assembly on the question of Palestine. Extending this invitation must be the first action to be taken by the General Assembly when it takes up this item on its agenda.\n308.\tIt is our hope that the United Nations will begin, in 1974, to correct the mistakes which it began to commit in 1947.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish at the outset to congratulate you most sincerely on your unanimous election to the presidency of the present session of the General Assembly. We recognize your numerous qualities, both as a diplomat and as a statesman, and we are certain that you will conduct our work here with distinction and success. Your election is not only a recognition of your personal qualities but also a homage to your country, to the Arab nations and to the great continent of Africa where a great step towards decolonization has been made, Which we hope will be a decisive one.\n36.\tAnother reason to rejoice is the admission of three new Member States, to the representatives of which I should like to extend a welcome in the name of my country and of my delegation. We are convinced that the contribution of Bangladesh, Guinea- Bissau, and Grenada will be most fruitful for the Organization in its strides towards achieving universality.\n37.\tI should also like to express our thanks to His Excellency Mr. Leopoldo Benites for the admirable way in which he presided over the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n38.\tFinally, to our Secretary-General I wish to renew our support and the expression of our confidence.\n39.\tSignificant events have happened in the period since the preceding session of the General Assembly, some of which have changed the world scene beyond recognition. At this late stage of the general debate, however, I do not wish to comment upon all, or even most, of these developments. I shall dwell only upon the global economic situation and the question of the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. But, before reviewing these two questions I wish to say a few words on the situation in the Middle East, in the Indian sub-continent and in Cyprus.\n40.\tThe October war last year changed the whole picture of the Middle East. The establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force last October at the height of the crisis, followed by agreements on disengagement of forces, marked the beginning of a new era in the tragic history of the Middle East protest. Thus, a glimmer of hope emerged on the horizon\na political landscape which had remained sombre for such a long period of time. However, there is not much reason to be over-optimistic, and there can hardly be any doubt that unless the root causes of tension are removed, military conflicts may recur.\n41.\tAs I said in this Assembly last year, negotiations among parties can only be undertaken if there is a reasonable guarantee of withdrawal by Israel from occupied Arab territories and of implementation of all the other provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), including recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.21 do not intend to stress the serious potential consequences of the intransigent policies pursued by Israel, nor do I need to emphasize the adverse effects of such policies on the sorely needed trust which must be painstakingly built between the parties involved in the Middle East tragedy.\n42.\tAs was demonstrated by the war last October, the physical security of Israel can by no means be guaranteed by the occupation of Arab lands, and the only viable alternative continues to be the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which provides the best practical framework for the realization of a just and lasting peace.\n43.\tPeace and security in the Indian sub-continent is one of the essential elements of my country's foreign policy, and in order to preserve it we shall continue to seek the friendship and co-operation of all parties concerned. In this connexion I should like to express the satisfaction of my Government over the developments in the sub-continent, culminating in the recent agreement which will open the channels of communication among the countries concerned and pave the way for the resumption of full diplomatic relations between Pakistan and India. It is hoped that further efforts will be made to settle outstanding problems between the parties concerned through peaceful means.\n44.\tRegarding the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, which is item 31 on the agenda, I should like to make a brief reference to a statement made by His Imperial Majesty to the countries of the Indian Ocean for the purpose of studying and establishing extensive ties of economic co-operation between the countries bordering on that ocean. Such co-operation is bound to assist the efforts that have been undertaken here in the United Nations for that same purpose. I would also add that we are maintaining friendly relations that are constantly growing with all the other nations of the subcontinent as well as with adjacent countries. In this connexion I wish to emphasize the excellent state of our brotherly relations with Afghanistan.\n45.\tIn Cyprus, we were most concerned when the military coup took place, and we immediately said that the status of Cyprus as an independent and sovereign State, based upon international agreements, should be safeguarded as should the rights of the Turkish community on the island. While the reasons which prompted the Turkish military action in Cyprus are understandable, we are convinced that in the long run the problem can only be solved through negotiations among the countries and communities concerned on the basis of the independence of Cyprus and the observance of the legitimate rights of both the Turkish and Greek communities. The Government of Iran hopes that the problem will be solved as soon as possible because, apart from the political problem, the fate of more than 200,000 refugees is at stake.\n46.\tThe plight of refugees is not unfamiliar to us. Indeed, we are at present confronted with such a problem ourselves. About 100,000 Iraqi-Kurdish refugees all of them women, the elderly and children have flooded into Iran as a result of calamitous and heart-rending bombings. The Government of Iran has already allocated more than $100 million for the care of these refugees. But it is evident that money, food and housing alone cannot alleviate all their sufferings.\n47.\tIt was not my intention to speak here today of the relations between my country and Iraq. Indeed, fol-lowing upon the talks between the delegations of the two countries at Istanbul last August, it was agreed that I should meet my Iraqi opposite number here in October so as to enter into discussions with him, and I felt that, in accordance with the very spirit of a bilateral agreement reflected in Security Council resolution 348 (1974) for the \\\"creation of a favorable atmosphere\\\" that would encourage these talks, we should abstain from repeating what all Members of our Organization are already familiar with, particularly through the letters addressed by our permanent representative to the President of the Security Council.\n48.\tI note once again that, to my great surprise, at the very time when the talks are to be resumed, the representative of Iraq [2262nd meeting] has once again launched groundless accusations in the United Nations. This strange conduct has been repeated over the years, and is all too familiar. Our wish, nevertheless, as we have indicated on a number of occasions, is to settle our differences peacefully and on the basis of the United Nations Charter and the recognized principles of international law and international practice. Of course, I could take up, point by point here, all the allegations of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq and reply to them, but since no new point has been raised, the refutation of those groundless accusations can be found in the many letters addressed to the Secretary-General and to the Security Council, distributed as official Council documents. Moreover, our position in this respect has been stated on numerous occasions from this rostrum, and I shall therefore not dwell on these matters. Nevertheless, I am prepared, if necessary, to provide all the necessary clarifications that may be called for, should it be the intention of the head of the Iraqi delegation to enter into further controversy.\n49.\tBefore dealing with the world economic situation, I should like to clarify one point. Voices have been heard in recent weeks trying to relate the present economic disorder to the increase in the price of oil. There has been talk about artificially rigged, distorted, exorbitant and outrageous prices. According to their ominous prophecies, unless these prices are lowered immediately, the world could be heading towards disaster. There have even been implied threats that the flow of foodstuffs to the oil-producing nations might be cut off.\n50.\tSuch assertions might impress the uninitiated layman, but they fail to convince the sober, worldly- wise observer. Indeed, in the course of the present debate, two heads of State and many foreign ministers, including representatives of some non-oil-producing nations, have already rebutted those assertions and have dealt with the subject in a most convincing fashion. Nevertheless, considering the fact that Iran is a major oil-producing country, I consider it my duty to set the record straight.\n51.\tIt is often said that the plight of the world economy and inflation were by-products of the rise in the price of oil. The fact is, however, that the rate of inflation began to escalate and to assume astronomical proportions some few years f>go, thereby eroding the purchasing power of the oil-producing countries. Each year the producers of raw materials have had to give more of their products to import the same, if not a lesser, amount of machinery and manufactured goods from the industrialized countries - a process that, as we have stated time and again in the past, has led to a systematic impoverishment of the developing nations, while at the same time the industrially developed nations have proceeded to enrich themselves further.\n52.\tAt the same time, despite assertions to the contrary, the higher oil prices have had little inflationary impact; for according to the statistics -and I am not referring to our own statistics, but rather to those made available by experts of the industrialized countries themselves - imported oil accounts for as little as 0.45 per cent of the rate of inflation in the United States, and only about 1.5 per cent of the current inflationary trend in the Western European countries, while in all those countries the general price rise approximates an average of 12 per cent. In other words, the disorder in the world economy and in monetary markets preceded the oil price rise and was due mainly to mismanagement of the economy in the European States and in America, as well as to excessive consumption in the more advanced countries.\n53.\tThe reasons that prompted the oil-producing countries to raise the price of their product were, however, manifold.\n54.\tFirst of all, in a competitive market the price of any commodity should be comparable to the price of its closest substitute, which in the case of oil must take into account the cost of obtaining energy from other sources, such as coal, shale oil and atomic energy. Similarly, the price should reflect what is termed the \\\"opportunity cost\\\" of the commodity. Thus the price of crude oil used as a source of fuel should correspond to its alternative value when used as a base for petrochemicals.\n55.\tSecondly, the components of the selling prices in the major importing nations were in no way equitable to the oil-exporting countries: for every dollar paid by the consumer for oil, only nine cents reached the producer, and the rest went mainly to the oil companies in the form of profits, and to the Governments of oil-importing countries in the form of taxation.\n56.\tThirdly, it must be recognized that oil is a non-renewable commodity, and therefore the Governments of oil-producing nations have a duty to their peoples and to future generations not only to take measures to conserve this highly valuable asset, but also to trade it on optimum terms.\n57.\tFourthly, for nearly a quarter of a century, the uninterrupted supply of cheap oil from the developing countries served as the main factor enabling the industrialized countries to raise their production levels, expand their exports, improve their balance of payments and accumulate excessively large foreign exchange reserves, as well as save their own solid fuel resources. It therefore follows that in the period in question there was a net transfer of resources from the developing countries to the developed countries.\n58.\tThroughout that period, the multinational oil companies controlled the flow of supply and therefore the demand and fixed the price of (oil at their own discretion, unilaterally. Their price policy bore no relation to the true value of petroleum: it was a deliberate policy of the rich countries of the world, designed to keep energy prices below their true value. Thus, for example, the posted price of Iranian crude oil was fixed by the oil companies at $US 2.17 in 1947. Thirteen years later, the posted price had dropped to $US 1.79, and remained the same throughout the 1960s. At the same time, the developing countries had to import their requirements from industrial countries at ever-rising prices. Between 1947 and 1973 the price of 28 commodities, excluding crude oil, increased by an average of more than 350 per cent. The increasing consumption of low-cost petroleum combined with its declining price in industrialized nations contributed greatly to the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor countries that is, the developed countries advanced at a rapid rate at the expense of the outproducing countries. However, those countries that had become rich at our expense never paid any attention to the tragic problems of the developing countries and did not even consent to allocate 1 per cent of their gross national product to the development of the under-developed countries.\n59.\tAs regards Iranians have constantly taken into account the problems facing the developing countries, and as soon as readjustment of the price of oil became a reality we started giving bilateral as well as multilateral aid to developing and developed countries alike a matter to which I shall refer later. We are also aware that recycling is necessary and have therefore begun negotiations to that effect-. But that can be done only through reasoned deliberation and mutual discussion. Accusations or threats against the oil producers do not solve anything. The sixth special session of the General Assembly had the merit of seeing the problem from the right angle and devoting itself to examining and recommending practical solutions to the problem of raw materials and development.\n60.\tIn the main, what emerged from the sixth special session of the General Assembly was a Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and a Program of Action [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)). Those decisions constitute historic landmarks in the evolutionary process of the international economic system. Whatever shortcomings might be evident in the two documents adopted by the special session, we cannot deny that that session was a turning-point in the economic environment of our world, and, more particularly, in relations between the industrialized and the developing countries. More vividly than ever, they have brought out in bold relief the new reality of the condition of interdependence prevailing among nations regardless of whether they belong to the developed or developing regions of the world.\n61.\tIt has also been conclusively demonstrated that the time when certain industrialized countries ruled and were able to take decisions that committed the whole world belongs to the past. Instead, a new era has dawned in which it is clear that the seemingly overwhelming problems of the world can be tackled adequately only within the framework of relations based on co-operation and equality among sovereign States.\n62.\tThat is the kind of potential transformation in the international economic situation to which my august Sovereign was referring in his message of 5 April 1974 to the General Assembly on the opening of the sixth special session when he said:\n\\\"... Nothing better reflects the spirit of our time than the fact that this special session, unlike previous ones, emanates not from war and conflict among nations but comes out of a growing recognition of interdependence among them. . . .\n\\\"The time has now come to make a beginning towards a more rationalized world economy. This means, among other things, that the raw materials in the hands of the developing nations should maintain constant and real value in relation to the prices of goods imported from the industrialized market. Trade must be made an instrument of progress for all while recognizing that the prosperity of the poor need not diminish the affluence of the rich.\\\"3\n63.\tHowever, the economic imbalance persisting in relations between developing and developed countries is so serious and the process that continues to widen the gap between them seemingly so inexorable that action can no longer be confined, as in the past, to corrective or ad hoc measures. If we are to succeed, we shall have to make a concerted effort to carry out a major review of the concepts and practices underlying the international economic system. Real structural changes will have to be instituted if we are to evolve a new economic order' based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and cooperation among all States. And in this context it is to be hoped that the industrialized countries of the world will not fail to take advantage of the opportunities which now exist for co-operating with others in finding suitable solutions.\n64.\tFor its part, Iran remains fully aware of the need to co-operate with other countries, especially the developing ones. I shall not attempt here to give a detailed picture of my Government's wide-ranging efforts in this respect, but it perhaps bears repeating that the total amount of Iran's bilateral and multilateral commitments to other countries has already reached $9,000 million.\n65.\tMeasured by any yard stick be it gross national product, per capita income, oil revenue, size of population or any other criterion that amount heads all contributions. Indeed, the total amount of our assistance relative to our gross national product exceeds the contribution of any other country in the whole history of development assistance.\n66.\tFurthermore, negotiations have been in progress with UNDP with a view to increasing and diversifying the assistance which Iran is supplying to the developing countries through that body, to which our country has become a net contributor. Although Iran has made substantial emergency and development aid available to the developing countries during the current year, it has nevertheless decided to make a contribution of $20 million to the United Nations emergency operations.\n67.\tIt was also with a view to alleviating the burden imposed upon developing countries because of the rising prices of foodstuffs, raw materials and industrial goods, and in order to take a major step towards bridging the gap between the rich and poor nations by effecting, for the first time, a real transfer of resources, that, on 22 February 1974, His Imperial Majesty proposed the establishment of a new special development fund which would be fully responsive to the urgent needs and requirements of the developing countries.\n68.\tThat special development fund would be set up with an initial capital of $2,000 million to $3,000 mil-lion to be financed jointly by the oil-exporting as well as the industrialized countries. To guarantee an objective, fair and impartial approach, the fund was to be administered by a governing body in which all the oil-exporting, industrialized and aid-receiving countries would be equally represented on a one-man, one- vote basis. The establishment of such a voting mechanism would give a new content to the concept of multilateral assistance.\n69.\tYet the results of our efforts towards the establishment of the fund have not been very encouraging so far. However, undeterred by the results of its international efforts, Iran has eagerly and in all good faith been following its own program of assistance on a bilateral as well as on a multilateral basis along the lines I have already outlined above.\n70.\tIn any case, the continuation of the work so nobly conceived during the sixth special session is by now assured. The over-all review of the implementation of the Program of Action adopted last spring has been assigned to the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly devoted to development and international economic co-operation, which is to meet next year prior to the thirtieth regular session. Perhaps by then some of the reservations which marked the adoption of the consensus regarding the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of the Program of Action will be less categorical.\n71.\tWhereas the lack of any appreciable progress in the field of disarmament has been among the more dismal aspects of recent international life, we are, nevertheless, pleased to note that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has recommended an expansion of its membership, and that the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference has finally convened and has completed its work. It must, however, be recognized.that in the field of disarmament no significant progress has been achieved with regard to substantive matters.\n72.\tAs I pointed out in this same forum last year, it is our view that a disarmament program should be devised which will continue to maintain a constant link between the partial measures and the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.4 In the absence of such a program, and until the goal of general and complete disarmament is achieved especially when we see that the world has made no progress towards peace and stability and that the United Nations has never been weaker countries cannot fail to look after their own defense requirements.\n73.\tWe all know that meetings take place for the sake of discussion and, once in a while, recommendations are made or decisions are taken, but we do not witness their implementation especially when they are concerned with the maintenance of peace and security. Nevertheless, efforts aimed at the achievement of the goal of general and complete disarmament must continue to be pursued, and I can say that, as far as Iran is concerned, we have not failed to do our part in a constructive spirit. We have felt that, in this connexion, there appears to be no justifiable reason for the lack of adequate and effective negotiations, especially on the question of the cessation\\\" of all nuclear weapons tests and the prohibition of chemical weapons, which the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly requested to be dealt with as matters of \\\"first\\\" or \\\"high\\\" priority.\n74.\tWhile I am on the subject of disarmament, I wish to express my disappointment at the lack of progress with regard to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons which has not been as thorough or wide-ranging as expected. The world of today is precariously poised on the threshold of a new age in which countries will increasingly move from the use of the more traditional sources of energy to that of nuclear energy. A; host of forces social, economic, demographic and technical have converged and conspired to give rise to this impending revolution in the field of nuclear technology. In a world, then, where the uses of atomic energy are about to be proliferated, it becomes all the more imperative that the existing international framework for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons should be strengthened.\n75.\tAs a result, while by no means abandoning a global approach with regard to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the world has become more acutely aware of the pressing need for collateral measures in dealing with the problem on a partial or regional basis. Thus, the continent of Africa was the subject of General Assembly resolution 1652 (XVI) of 24 November 1961 in which Member States were called upon to refrain from testing, storing, or transporting nuclear weapons in Africa and to consider and respect the continent as a denuclearized zone. Subsequently, by its resolution 2033 (XX) of 3 December 1965, the General Assembly endorsed the Declaration on the denuclearization of Africa issued by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity in July 1964.\n76 Furthermore, the outstanding success, to date, of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which entered into force in 1969, and which prohibits nuclear weapons in Latin\nAmerica, has blazed a trail which others might follow with equal profit.\n77.\tIt is considerations such as those I have cited above that prompted my august Sovereign to propose the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East a few years ago and to send a message to this effect to the opening of this session of the Assembly. Inspired by His Imperial Majesty's proposal, my Government has, as you know, requested the inclusion of an item entitled, \\\"Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East\\\", in the agenda of the current session. As we have indicated in our explanatory memorandum accompanying this request:\n\\\"While prospects for implementation of an all- encompassing denuclearization scheme in the region of the Middle East appear now to be more promising, greater access by States to nuclear technology has rendered the danger of nuclear weapon proliferation and a concomitant collapse of the non-proliferation structure, a more acute problem\\\". [SeeAl9693]\n78.\tIt should be readily apparent to any thoughtful person that, given the political conditions prevailing in the region, if nuclear weapons were developed or acquired by any country, the other countries in that area would be rapidly overwhelmed by a ruinous, senseless and potentially disastrous nuclear arms race. Furthermore, the astronomical costs involved in building an inventory of such weapons of mass destruction and in elaborating a viable system for their delivery, would divert resources which are urgently needed if the socio-economic aspirations of these countries are to be adequately realized.\n79.\tIt is our intense sensitivity to the monstrous problems that would be created if nuclear arms were ever to invade the region of the Middle East and to the great challenge facing all of us to prevent such an eventuality from occurring, which makes my Government fervently hope that the General Assembly, during the current session, will commend this proposal to the attention of the States of the region and make a recommendation to those States as soon as possible to achieve this objective and report back to the General Assembly.\n80.\tOf course, many problems and complexities need to be faced and overcome as we move from the realm of aspiration to that of implementation at the operational level. Among others, the question of defining the geographical concept of the Middle East, the limits of the denuclearized zone and of an adequate safeguard system, will have to be settled.\n81.\tMy Government wishes to avail itself of this opportunity to express its deep appreciation to the Egyptian Government for its valuable support in co- sponsoring our proposal, and to all other countries that have expressed their support. The urgency of the situation and the complexity of the road to be traveled summon us all to engage purposefully in an early effort to foster the establishment of a nuclear-weapon- free zone in the region of the Middle East in as expeditious a manner as possible.\n82.\tBy taking the necessary action, the General Assembly will clearly demonstrate its concern about this matter, which is of such vital importance to the peace and security not only of our region, but of the entire world. Indeed, it will represent the taking of a historic step towards a more secure and a happier future for us all.\n83.\tTo cope with the complex problems of today, anachronistic concepts and methods must give way to approaches based on new realities in the world, a world in which no country or group of countries can alone provide leadership or can dictate their terms. Such problems can only be dealt with through a spirit of mutual accommodation, dialog and co-operation.\n84.\tPeace for the world and prosperity for our peoples are goals we all seek to achieve. To this end, we who have always acted in accordance with the principles of the Charter, are prepared to engage in a dialog to find a rational basis for the solution of the existing problems in a manner which would safeguard the interests of all concerned without prejudice to our legitimate rights under the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "I take great pleasure in joining speakers who have preceded me in congratulating the President on his election to that high office. My delegation is confident that under his wise guidance this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will create the climate necessary to deal with the new world outlook so many speakers have foreseen during this general debate.\n69.\tWe are particularly aware of the leading role of the President's country in the non-aligned movement. Indeed, the initiative which Algeria took in calling for the special convocation of this Assembly earlier this year will be of signal importance to the work of this Organization in the months and years ahead. The aims of the non-aligned countries as enunciated by President Boumediene in this Hall at the sixth special session [2208th meeting] merit recollection as we commence our work: the emancipation of all peoples in the context of international co-operation based on the equality of States, respect for national sovereignty and the establishment of a just peace throughout the world. These are ideals to which we can all readily subscribe.\n70.\tThe presence among us for the first time of the delegations from the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, following the accession of those three States to membership, is evidence of the continued march of this world Organization towards universality. Canada was a sponsor of each of the three resolutions supporting their membership and we are confident that each of those countries will make a distinctive contribution to our work at this session and in the future.\n71.\tWe in Canada have been deeply moved by the tragic aftermath of the hurricane which has devastated Honduras and surrounding regions. We heard this morning from the Foreign Minister of that country an appeal for international assistance. In this connexion the Government of Canada has decided to allocate $525,000 for emergency relief efforts in areas affected by this natural disaster.\n72.\tSome of the major political problems which faced the United Nations during its early years have now receded and no longer figure so prominently in its deliberations. In particular, the cold war is giving way to growing co-operation and detente.\n73.\tThe last two decades have witnessed the resolute progress of peoples under colonial rule towards self-determination and independence. The past few months have seen particularly encouraging developments in the African Territories which have been or remain under Portuguese administration. Guinea-Bissau has now attained its independence and negotiations to the same end are under way with regard to Mozambique and Angola. It is a matter of satisfaction to all supporters of the United Nations that Portugal has agreed to work with the appropriate United Nations bodies in the process of decolonization. We in Canada welcome these developments and offer our encouragement to the Portuguese and African peoples concerned in their search for early equitable and peaceful solutions to remaining problems.\n74.\tElsewhere, some fragile yet hopeful progress has been made in the past year towards settling certain of the regional conflicts that still exist. Lest we be lulled into an unrealistic sense of security, however, the recent events i\\\" Cyprus serve to remind us how quickly a slowly simmering dispute can degenerate into a serious threat to international peace and security.\n75.\tIf we have in the past months been reminded of the fragility of international peace and security, we have also come to realize the fragility of international monetary and trade relations. Accelerating rates of inflation and declining rates of growth, high interest rates and low stock prices, together with a widespread sense of unease, mark the problems facing the international economy. There is no doubt that the higher energy costs will require much more financing and in time massive adjustments on the part of those countries, both developed and developing, whose payments positions have been most severely affected.\n76.\tNo people or government can of itself deal with the problems of inflation and unemployment, of trade imbalances and currency fluctuations. None will be immune if short-sighted and selfish policies lead to graver repercussions. These are not simply technical problems questions of currency flows, trade barriers, and exchange rates they are matters of human dignity. Unemployment, malnutrition, starvation and lack of shelter are an affront to all of us. We ignore them at the risk of our own welfare and security.\n77.\tA renewal and strengthening of international co-operation is an urgent requirement if we are to sustain social progress and economic development. We all have a responsibility to contribute to such co-operation. Those countries which command massive financial resources have, however, a special responsibility for seeing that such resources are invested in a helpful and constructive manner, and that their use strengthens, rather than disturbs, the health of the world economy.\n78.\tAt the present time there is no more urgent development issue than the vigor of the world economy. When production and demand falter, all of us whether developed or developing suffer. Difficulties in the developed countries translate into distress in developing countries and something akin to disaster in the most seriously affected.\n79.\tIf there are grounds for apprehension there are also signs of hope: some important steps have been taken in IMF towards a systematic and progressive reordering of the monetary system; the onset of a major trade negotiation appears to be drawing nearer; a number of industrialized countries have pledged themselves to exert their best efforts to avoid measures restrictive of trade in response to balance-of- payment difficulties.\n80.\tBut much more still needs to be done. Development assistance should be maintained and, where possible, increased.. The responsible international institutions should be strongly supported. The habit of consultation should be strengthened.\n81.\tThose considerations will influence Canada's thinking at this session of the General Assembly, as at other international meetings. There are two such meetings to which I wish to draw special attention. This autumn, Governments will meet at the World Food Conference to adopt a program aimed at securing a sufficiency of food for all. Next year they will meet here in New York at the seventh special session, on development. The Canadian Government attaches great importance to the work of these conferences. We will exert our very best efforts to ensure their success.\n82.\tIn seeking solutions to our political and economic problems we cannot forget that we face another pressing task: to ensure that human beings are alive to enjoy the improved circumstances that we are seeking for them.\n83.\tOur security is threatened more than ever today by developments in nuclear and conventional warfare. One of the most urgent problems of our time is how to bring the nuclear arms race under CGntrol in order to ensure international stability and the avoidance of nuclear war. The nuclear Powers have a direct responsibility for overcoming this grave problem. At the same time that we face-the immediate dangers of existing nuclear arsenals we are confronted as the Secretary-General has warned-\u2014 with a heightened risk of the wider dissemination of such arsenals. Here all States have a responsibility. Canada takes seriously its share of that responsibility.\n84.\tSpecifically, the problem we face is to devise a system which will allow the dissemination of the benefits of nuclear energy without at the same time contributing to the spread of nuclear weapons. The international community has attempted to devise a system to cope with this problem. Canada has been very active in this endeavor. But the system could be strengthened further.\n85.\tWe have developed a valuable system of nuclear power generation and we believe that nuclear power should not be withheld from those whose energy needs can best be met by this method. We are deeply committed to the cause of international development, but equally we are anxious to avoid contributing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n86.\tIn addition to our requirements, and subject to security and resource limitations, we want to make our nuclear power generating system available to other countries. However, until more adequate internationally agreed measures are instituted, Canada intends to satisfy itself that any country using Canadian-supplied nuclear technology or material will be subject to binding obligations that the technology or material will not be used in the fabrication of nuclear explosive devices for whatever purpose. To that end Canada attaches special importance to the role of nuclear safeguards applied by IAEA.\n87.\tThe need for truly effective anti-proliferation measures fully accepted and applied by the international community is now pressing. The nuclear technology involved is. no longer beyond the reach of a growing number c. countries. The costs of developing a nuclear explosive device are no longer prohibitive. The principal problem is to obtain the necessary materials. Every day more and more of these materials are being developed throughout the world and the problem of controlling their movement, as well as their use, is becoming proportionately greater.\t\n88.\tThe phenomenon of proliferation is, in political terms, something like a nuclear chain reaction. With the successful explosion of a nuclear device by each newcomer to the ranks of the nuclear Powers, greater grows the desire of other countries to \\\"go nuclear\\\". In a world without truly effective safeguards they feel their national existence threatened. If each new nuclear-weapon State prompted its neighbor to follow its example, all concerned would find their security quickly undermined.\n89.\tWe believe that it is the very existence of nuclear explosive devices that presents the hazard to humanity and it increases in proportion to the number of countries possessing them. One net J make no distinction in terms of what countries possess such devices. The danger lies as much in the number of countries that have them, as in the policies of the possessors.\n90.\tIf we are to avoid a nuclear catastrophe we must accept the fact that there are practical limits to the application of the principle of non-discrimination. The Canadian Government urges the international community to accept the obligation not to contribute to the uncontrolled spread of nuclear explosive capability, and the safeguards required to ensure compliance with that obligation.\n91.\tOur aim is to secure international measures which will halt both the multiplication and the wider dissemination of nuclear weapons, and which, will check the spread of the technology of nuclear explosive devices and the further development of that technology as applied to nuclear weapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the efforts to limit strategic arms, and the achievement of a comprehensive test ban are designed to achieve these objectives.\n92.\tAs for the halting of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, all States should undertake not to transfer nuclear technology or materials except under inter-national supervision aimed at ensuring that the transfer is not used for fabricating nuclear explosive devices. In addition, all States should place the inventories of the nuclear fissile material that they hold for peaceful purposes under international supervision. Nuclear- weapon States should, as a first step towards this objective, place their peaceful nuclear facilities under this supervision and seek to halt their production of fissile material for weapons purposes. International supervision of fissile material is the best available means for .the international community to be assured of each State's peaceful intentions. This would allow States to concentrate on the development and distribution of much-needed nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n93.\tThe nuclear threat to our security may be dramatic and awe-inspiring but we cannot neglect the more prosaic and lethal threat from the use of conventional force. One of the few useful tools we have developed so far to deal with this problem is peacekeeping by a force sponsored by the United Nations. Canada has responded positively to United Nations requests and has engaged in virtually all the United Nations peace-keeping operations to date. This has not been without cost in livings of Canadians or of those from the forces of the other participating countries.\n94.\tOur interest is therefore obvious. There is no doubt in my mind that an overwhelming majority of Canadians continue to accept the importance and the usefulness of a United Nations peacekeeping role. But I would be less than candid if I did not admit that Canadians \\\"are today less inclined to accept in an unquestioning way the burdens of participation. Their concern springs mainly from the fact that peace-keeping endeavors often seem to do no more than perpetuate an uneasy status quo.\n95.\tIf United Nations peace-keeping is to be fully effective, it must be accompanied by a parallel effort on the political level, especially by the parties most directly concerned, to convert the temporary peace that a peace-keeping force is asked to maintain into something more durable. If this is not done, and if those who contribute to peace-keeping are faced with indefinite prolongation of their hazardous tasks, I am afraid that Governments will be less willing to respond to future requests for troops.\n96.\tThe past year has seen two new peace-keeping operations established in the Middle East and the Force in Cyprus reinforced. These developments were important in themselves, but they are also capable of teaching us lessons for the future. From the Canadian standpoint the operations in the Middle East are working effectively and are making an essential contribution to the maintenance of the ceasefire and disengagement agreements. But equally important, new principles have been established in the process. Participants have been drawn from a broader base than in the past, and a sounder financial foundation for the operations has been laid through a general assessment of the United Nations membership. These innovations have contributed to effective peacekeeping in the Middle East for the present, and will enhance the prospect of greater effectiveness in the future.\n97.\tThere are fewer grounds for satisfaction in the case of Cyprus. There, despite the presence of United Nations peace-keeping forces, fighting has taken place on an unprecedented scale because the long-smoldering political problem remains unresolved. Moreover, it has been demonstrated once again in Cyprus that without the agreement and co-operation of the disputants the constructive role of a peace-keeping force is severely circumscribed. \n98.\tIf the usefulness of the United Nations in peace-keeping is to be maintained and expanded, new principles and techniques to strengthen it must be found. The machinery is at hand under the Charter to ensure an effective United Nations response to future peace-keeping needs. The advantages of agreement in advance on how United Nations peace-keeping should be directed and controlled are obvious. The experience of the United Nations Emergency Force could point the way to such agreement or to the formulation of guide-lines for peace-keeping operations under the overall authority of the Security Council, with a system of sharing responsibilities among the Security Council, the Secretary-General, the troop contributors, and the parties directly concerned in the field. This Organization can scarcely afford to neglect any instrument that might have a contribution to make in helping to defuse situations of armed conflict. It is the hope of the Canadian Government that Member States will continue to give this problem the attention it deserves.\n99.\tI have touched upon a few of the pressing political and economic problems that demand the attention of this Assembly. But I have dwelt upon two major problems of security: peace-keeping and the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices. As the Secretary-General has pointed out, a proliferation of nuclear explosive devices could help to . . create almost unimaginable dangers for the survival of our civilization and the human race.\\\" [Al960llAdd.I, p. 7.] I do not therefore apologize for my preoccupation with these problems.\n100.\tI would not wish to conclude without paying tribute to the work of the Secretary-General and his staff at Headquarters and throughout the world in carrying forward the wide spectrum of tasks which challenge our Organization. In the introduction to the Secretary-General's report, he said the following:\n\\\"We are reminded every day of how thin the margin is between order and chaos, between sufficiency and desperate want, between peace and annihilation. If we wish to overcome the vast anxieties and uncertainties of our time, we have to make a conscious and concerted effort to change course and to make some , of our stated objectives\\ into realities.\\\" [Ibid., p. 9]\nAt this twenty-ninth session, the Canadian delegation pledges itself to work with all other delegations to move towards our common goals.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives the Moroccan delegation real satisfaction to see the representative of a sister country presiding over this important session of the General Assembly of the Organization. Through you, Mr. President, all Africa is honored today. Consequently it is with true pleasure that I express to you, on my own behalf and on behalf of all the members of my delegation, warmest and most fraternal congratulations. I now pledge to you the total co-operation of the Moroccan delegation in the accomplishment of the tasks which the members of this august Assembly have unanimously entrusted to you. This is no doubt that, thanks to your competence and your great experience of international problems, the work of the present session will be crowned with success.\n156.\tI must not fail in another equally pleasant duty, that of addressing to Mr. Benites my heartiest congratulations on the manner in which he guided the work of the twenty-eighth session, in the course of which he demonstrated his great talent and his attachment to the ideas of peace, freedom and cooperation between all the peoples.\n157.\tThe present session opened under the best auspices. It started its work by welcoming three new Members to the Organization. We offer the representatives of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau our cordial congratulations and our warmest wishes for the greatness and prosperity of their countries and their peoples. We rejoice that they have come here to reinforce our ranks in the struggle-of a different nature this time- which we are waging here for a more just and fraternal world and society.\n158.\tWe realize that in the year which has just elapsed progress has been made in the efforts to establish peace in troubled areas, to accelerate the process of decolonization in Africa and elsewhere and to search for economic co-operation for the good of all. These efforts led us to hope that the process of detente and co-operation would continue. Unfortunately, the world finds itself confronted once more by dangerous events with grave consequences which threaten to jeopardize all the achievements of recent years.\n159.\tThe international situation as it appears today is, to say the least, confused and uncertain. It does not encourage optimism. There are still numerous problems which threaten, at the same time, co-operation, peace and international security . It behooves us.\n150.\tWith regard to the regime for the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, the delegation of Dahomey believes that the international authority to be established should be endowed with extensive powers in connexion with not only the exploitation and exploration but also the sale of the resources, in order to prevent a decline in the prices of the minerals from the deposits on dry land, and in particular of those produced by the developing countries. In any event, exploitation of the international zone must not be entrusted to multinational corporations on the unconvincing pretext that the international authority does not have the required technical and financial means\u2014a formula that would betray the concept of the common heritage of mankind. The industrialized countries that already have the means necessary to undertake the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the international zone can demonstrate their willingness to co-operate by placing themselves at the disposal of the authority until it is financially capable of acquiring those means itself.\n151.\tThose were the various agenda items on which my delegation wished to share its thoughts as the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly begins its work. While the Organization can take some pride in the fortunate outcome of some of the burning problems that had been before it recently, 'we must note with some bitterness that most of those problems have been solved virtually outside the United Nations. The changes in Portugal and the progress achieved in colonial matters seem to have been less the result of positions we have taken or recommendations we have adopted than the normal outcome of the struggles and sacrifices by the peoples concerned.\n152.\tAt the very most, our support -often very timid support- for the liberation movements may have helped to galvanize the energies of the freedom-fighters. Today more than ever before it has become essential that we should pause for thought, should seek the causes of the paralysis and impotence of the Organization in respect of the tragedies confronting mankind. We can no longer wait to see \\\"the dead bury their dead\\\" to devote our efforts to seeking solutions common state with the problems with which we are confronted.\n160.\tIn the Middle East, war broke out for the fourth time in a single generation. It succeeded in destroying certain myths. It destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the aggressor. It destroyed the myth of the division of the Arab countries. It proved that the Arab countries were fully capable of mobilizing all their potentialities in defense of their just cause. In doing so it threw into relief the far-reaching repercussions and nefarious consequences for all of allowing the situation to fester.\n161.\tAbove all, this latest war made possible the consecration on the international level of the existence of the Palestinian people as a people. That is a fundamental element which, from our point of view, happened rather late, but which is at the heart of the problem. There is not and there cannot be any true, just and lasting peace in the region without recognition of the national rights of the people of Palestine. We welcome the decision taken by the Assembly to place the question of Palestine on its agenda with a view to permitting the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] representing the Palestinian people, to make the voice of the Palestinian people heard at last in this body.\n162.\tToday it is no longer a question of doling out subsidies to refugees who are denied their own homeland. It is no longer a question of keeping alive from day to day hundreds and hundreds of thousands of human beings herded into temporary camps. The international community is aware today that those refugees have a land, their homeland, that that land has a name, Palestine, and that they will never give it up.\n163.\tMoreover, some of the territories of certain of our sister countries, Members of the United Nations, are still occupied by Israel as a result of successive aggressions. Egypt, Syria and Jordan cannot tolerate this situation. We reaffirm our active solidarity and assure them of our participation at their side for the liberation and recovery of their territories of all their territories occupied by Israel.\n164.\tI need hardly recall briefly the behavior of Israel. Israel continues to occupy by armed force the territories of States Members of the Organization. It is systematically establishing settlements and it does not hide its intention of definitive occupation. It declares that it has made Jerusalem the new capital of the Zionist State, cynically disregarding the fact that the Holy City is the spiritual center of hundreds of millions of men belonging to the Christian and Moslem world, and not hesitating to mock their religious convictions.\n165.\tIt does not hesitate to violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another State of the region. Thus it constantly resorts to bombardments by its aircraft and artillery against agglomerations in Lebanon, causing destruction and heavy losses among the populations.\n166.\tIt defies all the principles of the Charter, that same Charter it needed to get itself recognized as an entity, and all the resolutions adopted by various organs of the United Nations and the specialized agencies. As far as violations of the Charter are concerned, we can say that the Zionist State has beaten\nevery record. By its strategy of provocation and terror, Israel demonstrates its contempt for international law and morality by strengthening its challenge to the community of nations and mainly to the Organization.\n167.\tTo give but one example, here is the statement made by the representative of Israel before this Assembly on 21 September. If the question of Palestine is included in the agenda of the General Assembly, he said:\n\\\"Would a single tenet of the Charter remain intact after such a development? Would any sensible human being find it possible to take the United Nations seriously if it were to act in so irresponsible a manner?\\\" [2236th meeting, para. 30.]\n168.\tI will simply add that the question of Palestine has been included in the agenda without any opposition, except for that of the Israeli representative.\n169.\tThe result is that tension continues to prevail in the area and that Israel is deliberately fomenting it. The situation is clearly worsening and is a source of increasing anxiety . Israel seems to have drawn no lesson from the war of last October. It is preparing a new aggression. The disengagement of forces is not peace and cannot be used as a soporific to put the Arab people to sleep. We had thought that it would be the start of the thaw on the road to peace. Yet, by its behavior Israel persists in vitiating all the industrious and indefatigable efforts undertaken by Secretary of State Kissinger and by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, as well as by various other statesmen.\n170.\tAs was recently brought to mind by His Majesty Hassan II, the military disengagement agreements should be looked upon as a step towards the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all occupied Arab territories, including the city of Jerusalem, and the recognition and restoration of the national and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n171.\tIt behooves the United Nations to adopt all the necessary measures to implement its decisions and to lay the foundation for an over-all solution which would guarantee, the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the area.\n172.\tAt a time when international opinion was anxious over the development of the situation in the Middle East and was following with a great deal of interest the efforts undertaken to attempt to find a solution to that situation, the Mediterranean, which was already seriously affected by that problem, found itself once more the scene of a conflict which, by the passions it provoked and the interests involved, could have led to a situation seriously threatening world peace and international security .\n173.\tAs a Mediterranean country and therefore one which could hot be indifferent to the future of Cyprus\u2014'Morocco, as early as the proclamation of the Cypriot State, felt that lasting' peace and stability could not be ensured without full respect for the constitutional and international edifice on which was based the independence of a country composed of two communities which history and interests should have united.\n174.\tConsequently, Morocco examined developments on the island very carefully and somewhat anxiously. It had to admit that, in violation of existing agreements, the Turkish community was systematically deprived of its constitutional rights. From being a two-nation State, Cyprus was being transformed into a single-nation State, which some responsible authorities wished openly to restore to Greece some day. That is what nearly happened this summer.\n175.\tThe old agreements are now out of date and should be replaced by a new constitutional charter negotiated with the participation and agreement of the representatives of the two communities of the island. Morocco believes that the new status of Cyprus should ensure its independence, its territorial integrity and its neutrality. Morocco feels, moreover, that the Organization has an important part to play , first by helping to solve the island's grave humanitarian problems and also by guaranteeing the agreements reached by the parties concerned. Only thus can peace and concord be achieved and harmony and understanding among the States in the area concerned by this drama.\n176.\tUnfortunately, these are not the only problems which require vigilance and careful attention on the part of the international community, in order to find adequate solutions. Colonialism has for many years been receding throughout the world. We are now witnessing the end of the Portuguese colonial empire. My delegation wants to hail here this great victory of the national liberation movements of Guinea-Bissau, which we have already welcomed here among them, and of Angola and Mozambique. This victory has been acquired thanks to their political maturity, their courage and the great sacrifices which for years the leaders and the people have made for the success of their just cause.\n177.\tMy delegation would also like to express its sincere and cordial congratulations to the Portuguese Government, whose realism and perception of the sense of history and of its true and lasting interests have facilitated and allowed such a change. We profoundly rejoice in this new attitude of Portugal because of the ties of friendship and good neighborliness which both of us have always sought to maintain.\n178.\tThis development, however positive it may be, must not allow us to forget the tragic state of the people of Zimbabwe and our brothers in Namibia and in South Africa. The Organization must adopt precise and concrete measures which will be more clearly understood by the illegal Ian Smith regime.\n179.\tThe segregation in which the people of Zimbabwe live has no equal in the world save that which is inflicted upon our brothers in South Africa. Despite the many resolutions adopted by the United Nations condemning apartheid in that part of the world, not a single gesture has been made by the leaders of Pretoria which would lead us to believe that action has been initiated to put an end to a policy rejected and condemned unanimously by the international community.\n180.\tMoreover, the racist Government of South Africa maintains and accentuates its policy of domination and discrimination in Namibia in total disregard of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.\nIt is fitting to denounce here the strange understanding, even the complicity and the military support received by South Africa from certain Powers, allowing it to continue unrestrainedly an action unreservedly condemned by the Assembly.\n181.\tThe Pretoria Government, deliberately disregarding the resolutions of the Organization and of the specialized agencies, remains obdurately adamant. We cannot remain inactive in the face of such a challenge. Energetic measures must be taken to put an end as quickly as possible to the intolerable situation which prevails in Rhodesia, South Africa and Namibia.\n182.\tDecolonization has always held a high place in the debates of the Assembly, and the Moroccan delegation has always considered it to be a question of high priority. It could not have been otherwise for a country which not only has known colonization under its usual form, of occupation by a single foreign Power, but which has also been the victim not only of a division but a real carving up by colonialism: one part was under the protectorate of France; one so-called international zone, Tangier, was under the administration of 13 Powers; another part was under the protectorate of Spain, including a northern zone and a southern zone\u2014Tarfaya, Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro -as well as the enclaves, the zones of Ifni and the cities of Ceuta and Melilla. Although important parts of our national territory have been liberated, it is nevertheless true that vast areas of our country are still occupied by a European colonial Power, namely Spain.\n183.\tOn 27 April 1956, the Moroccan-Spanish agreement proclaimed the end of the regime of protectorate and the independence of Morocco, on the basis of the unity and integrity of its territory. It was the end of colonialism, at least on the official level.\n184.\tThe northern zone of Morocco was restored. The southern zone, Tarfaya, was restored in 1958 only after lengthy negotiations with Spain and various local confrontations with the occupation troops. The two Saharan provinces of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra were still to be liberated, in addition to the Ifni enclave. As far as these parts of our territory were concerned, which Spain was, committed to restore to us in 1956 similarly to the northern and southern zones, the Government of Madrid sometimes met our request with an obdurate refusal and sometimes with successive and interminable dilatory maneuvers. This attitude meant that it intended to maintain its domination over these parts of our national territory.\n185.\tIn various areas of these zones the Moroccan people have resumed the struggle against colonial occupation. The armed struggle of Ait Ba Amrane, to cite only one example, against the Spanish troops established at Ifni or at Sakiet El Hamra was proof of the determination of our people to bring about the liberation of their territory. However, the successive governments of His Majesty the King never despaired of seeing Spain display reason and wisdom. It is because of our moderation and also our will to further develop ties of friendship and co-operation with Spain that this question -that of the continued Spanish domination over the western part of Morocco continued to be a problem for 18 years. It is still, today, on the agenda of the Assembly.\n186. Such are the fundamental facts of this problem, Meanwhile, Algeria and Mauritania, neighboring countries of the Sahara, recovered their national independence, Our territory atone was still being mutilated because of the Spanish occupation. That is when the Moroccan Government, always opting for peaceful means, decided in 1964 to request the inclusion of the question in the provisional agenda of the General Assembly. Since then, and throughout the vicissitudes of our debates, one constant and important fact appeared: for Morocco the decolonization of the two Saharan provinces implied their reintegration into the Moroccan State. All our interventions and declarations are there to bear witness to the facts, The first decision was adopted on 16 October by the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, This decision refers explicitly to resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, which constitutes the charter for decolonization. In December IMS, it was the turn of the General Assembly to approve almost unanimously, with only two votes against -those of Spain and Portugal- resolution of paragraph 1 of which reads;\n\\\"Urgently requests the Government of Spain, as the administering Power, to take immediately all necessary measures for the liberation of the Territories of Ifni and Spanish Sahara from colonial domination and to this end to enter into negotiations on the problems relating to sovereignty presented by these two Territories\n187. Thus, the General Assembly voted that it was urgent to decolonize the Saharan Territories, But it also called Spain at the same the to start negotiations concerning the problem of sovereignty which was posed by these Territories: the Rio de Oro, Sakiet El Hamar and Ifni. Consequently, there was a problem of sovereignty to be settled by negotiation, which underlines in a very clear manner the specific character of these provinces and the specific process to be applied to part an end to colonial domination.\n188. Who was the partner who Spain was called upon to enter negotiations? The Moroccan State, which ever since 1956 has not ceased to claim the restitutions of these zones as an integral part of the territory; the Moroccan Government which took the initiative of putting the question on the agenda of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Of course, the Spanish Government refused and continues to refuse to enter into such negotiations concerning the problems of sovereignty for the particular zones.\n189. I quoted resolution 1514 (XV) which constitutes the Charter of United Nations on the problem of decolonization. A few brief clarifications seem necessary in order to put an end to any sort of confusion that may persist, voluntarily or involuntarily.\n190. Resolution 1514 (XV) was completed and made explicit on the very next day by resolution 1541 (XV) o 15 December 1960. In the principles approved by the resolution, particularly in Principle VI the General Assembly affirmed:\n\n\\\" A Non-Self-Governing Territory can be said to have reached a full measure of self-government by:\n(a) Emergence as a sovereign independent\nState;\n(b) Free association with an independent State;\nor\n(c) Integration with an independent State\\\".\n191.\tThus the correct and loyal implementation of the principles of decolonization and self-determination does not necessarily and automatically lead to the status of an independent State. It all depends on the particular situations for each Territory, and particularly on the origins of colonial conquest, and imperialist deals to which some countries fell victim. Such is the case of Morocco, which witnessed its national territory, towards the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, become a victim to the carving up into several zones of influence, as 1 have just mentioned.\n192.\tYesterday and today, we ask only for the just and correct implementation of the principle of decolonization, which should lead to the integration of the provinces of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra into the national territory.\n193.\tBut let us come back to the other resolutions adopted by the United Nations. From year to year, ever since 1964, the same recommendations have been taken up, with the addition, according to the forms of the debates, of some paragraphs. But all come back to some basic ideas. First of all, Spain is called upon to hasten the process of decolonization. Secondly,, it is constantly invited and called upon to adopt all measures which would allow the free and democratic expression of the local populations, which implies putting an end to the police measures and the evacuation of occupation troops. Thirdly, it is called upon and invited to allow the refugees who have been expelled by the Spanish administration to go back to their homes and participate in an eventual local consultation. Fourthly, it is invited and called upon, first of all, to negotiate, and then to proceed to the necessary consultations with Morocco, Mauritania and all the other interested parties, which implies tot like United Nations does not admit that Spain should act alone and unilaterally, which also implies - as was said before- that the decolonization of the two Saharan provinces poses a problem of sovereignty, without which the negotiation and recommended consultation would have no valid Justification. Fifthly, Spain is invited and called upon to allow a mission of the United Nations to ensure that the consultation of the local population will take place In a climate freedom and democracy , and so forth.\n\n194. What has been the behavior of the Madrid Government throughout these 10 years? The Spanish Government throughout the years has shown how well fit $an profit to certain confusion, fed by repeated discussions and the multiplicity of motions voted upon. The same idea of this behavior is to make much play with the principles of decolonization and self-determination with the very purpose of maintaining colonial domination over and exploitation of these two provinces. Initially the Spanish Government simply disregarded the substance of the resolutions adopted. It intended, and still intends today, to act alone and according to its own wish. This is a constant factor in Spain's policy. Thus, it has refused all negotiations or consultations concerning the problem of sovereignty posed by these Territories; it has refused to allow the refugees who have been expelled from their homes (numbering 20,000 persons, according to the Spanish press itself) to go back home in order to participate in a possible local, popular consultation; it has refused to allow a mission from the United Nations to go to the area to check the organization of this consultation and to make sure that it takes place in an atmosphere of free expression of views.\n195.\tAn array of military, police and administrative arrangements have been set up there: thus the occupation troops today number 70,000 to 80,000, for a population of approximately 45,000 to 50,000. If we assume that in a population of that size only 20,000 to 22,000 are adults in other words, those who can effectively and theoretically participate in a consultation then we note that there are more than three Spanish soldiers for each potential voter. That is how the Spanish Government intends to implement the United Nations resolutions and allow the local population free expression of its wishes.\n196.\tMoreover, once the military and police machinery was strongly entrenched, an assembly, entitled Jema'a, has been purely and simply nominated by the Spanish authorities. It is directly under the authority of the military governor. The so-called Assembly has been authorized by the Spanish Government to speak for the population of the two provinces. It alone has been authorized to express its vision of the future. This has been very clearly stated: it does not accept the principle of decolonization. It wants the Spanish administration to continue for years. Meanwhile a \\\"statute\\\" is being worked out for the Sahara, and will be granted by the Spanish Government without, of course, any negotiation or consultation with the United Nations or the States concerned. But as the approval of the United Nations is absolutely necessary for the consecration of this pseudo-decolonization, the Spanish Government deems the time ripe to inform the Secretary-General of its intentions* These consist of defending the people of the Sahara against designs of annexation or expansionism on the part of certain neighbors and to \\\"guarantee ... the free and authentic expression of their wishes\\\". That is the significance of the information notes in documents A/9655 and A/9736, transmitted on 11 July 1974 and on 13 September 1974 respectively. Spain goes so far as to promise to give all facilities to the United Nations so that it may participate in the projected process of self-determination. But even at this stage, it is only a promise: it is up to the Spanish Government alone to fix the date for this \\\"in due course\\\".\n197.\tSuch mystification seems to be really going too far. The Government of His Majesty the King of Morocco is convinced that the international community cannot endorse the unilateral policy of the Spanish Government. It amounts to creating out of nothing a fictitious entity, with an active population of 22,000 persons in a Territory of 280,000 square kilometers, and an Atlantic coastline stretching for 1,500 km. This fictitious entity is destined to perpetuate the reality of the colonial presence, and the robbing of our country of two provinces which have always been an integral part of our Territory. That is why His Majesty the King was forced to proclaim publicly on 5 July 1974 that the patience and moderation of the Moroccan people have their limits; that our people, who have struggled, weapons in hand, for their independence and the integrity of their territory, can in no way accept a fait accompli in the two provinces which fall under our sovereignty.\n198.\tThus, the unilateral policy of the Spanish Government being thus revealed in its crude reality, and the position of Morocco being what it has always been since 1956, since we were\\\" admitted to the Organization, the situation seems to be the same as at the outset. We are forced, if we want to safeguard peace in this area, to study this problem once more without questioning the principles of decolonization and self-determination. We must rather give these principles real content, and apply them honestly, with regard for the particular and specific character represented by the liberation of the western Sahara.\n199.\tIn seeking to find some justification for its unilateral policy, the Spanish Government claims that the provinces of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra were originally Territories which did not fall under any sovereignty or administration. According to the Spanish Government, at the moment of colonial conquest they were res nullius, or Territories without a master, and that implies that the Spanish Government does not have to negotiate with Morocco for the process of decolonization.\n200.\tAs against that attitude, there is the attitude of Morocco, which, based on its historic, legal, ethnic and cultural rights, has always considered those two Territories as being an integral part of the national Territory. That is why the Moroccan Government is determined not to accept the artificial creation on its own territory of any entity whatsoever, particularly a fictitious entity intended to maintain the colonial system.\n201.\tThe formulation of these two attitudes allows us to discern clearly the basis of the dispute between Morocco and Spain since 1956. First of all, we must answer the following question: originally, were the two Territories of the Sahara in question, as the Spanish Government claims, res nullius, or Territories without a master, and open to occupation? Or were they at the moment of occupation under the sovereignty and administration of the Moroccan State? Only the answer to that question will make it possible to give real meaning, based on law and reality , to the principles of decolonization and self-determination. This is a prior question which we are all called on to settle, and it is of an exclusively legal character.\n202.\tUsing this analysis as a starting point, and anxious to safeguard peace, His Majesty the King has once more chosen the peaceful method of settling the dispute between Morocco and Spain. In his press conference of 17 September 1974 His Majesty Hassan II proposed to submit the case to the International Court of Justice, one of the most important bodies of the United Nations. The Court is competent to proceed to an arbitration between the parties concerned on a purely legal matter. As Members of the United Nations, Morocco and Spain are necessarily parties to the Statute of the Court. Further, it must be added that the Charter of the United Nations lays down, in Article 36, paragraph 3, a general principle making referral to the International Court of Justice mandatory in all cases. That Article states that \\\"... the Security Council should also take into . consideration that legal disputes should as a general ' rule be referred by the parties to the International Court of Justice\\\".\n203. The Government of Morocco sent Spain a note dated 23 September 1974 inviting it to join Morocco in submitting a request in accordance with the rules of procedure of the International Court. If that step, taken by the parties concerned Spain and Morocco-had been adopted, the prospects of a peaceful solution of the problem of the Western Sahara would have become clearer because they would have been based upon law and equity.\n204.\tIf for one reason or another that direct method had not been adopted, we would still have requested the Court, not for an arbitrary decision, but simply for an advisory opinion on a simple matter of law. It is for the General Assembly or for the Security Council to request such an opinion, in accordance with Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter, and Article 65 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. The opinion given by the International Court of Justice on, a point of law can have a considerable effect as a decision of arbitration. In any case the General Assembly would be in a position, on the basis of such opinion, definitively to find a solution to the political question of the future of the two provinces, Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro.\n205.\tThat is why my Government has decided, in case the first procedure might not be adopted by the Spanish Government, that it should ask the General Assembly, which is in a position to do so, to seek such an opinion of the International Court of Justice.\n206.\tThe dispute which opposes us to Spain has lasted for the past 18 years and it has been on the agenda of the General Assembly for the past 10 years. AH the resolutions and recommendations which have been voted concern the main question: that of knowing whether the two provinces of Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro belong to a certain sovereignty and authority or whether they have been free territories, open to any occupation. My Government is firmly convinced that the members of the Assembly, particularly the peace- and justice-loving peoples, cannot remain indifferent to this last appeal launched by Morocco that international law and morality and the principles of the United Nations should prevail.\n207. In the same context, may I now make the same appeal more directly to Mauritania, since we know that country is as anxious as we are to safeguard peace in the area and to undertake all measures in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, so that law and justice may prevail. Morocco and Mauritania are bound by historic, ethnic, economic and cultural ties and their peoples and leaders are fully conscious of the fact that the fraternal links which tie the two countries and peoples ate harbingers of a future of development for both countries.\n208. Basing itself on these facts, Morocco declares that Mauritania is concerned in the future of the Sahara and can surely be associated, because of its rights, with the settlement of the disputes between Morocco and Mauritania and Spain. It is in that spirit that I call upon the Government of Mauritania to associate itself with us before the International Court of Justice to obtain the advisory opinion which the Moroccan Government is seeking.\n209.\tMy Government hopes to have contributed, as a Member respectful of the Charter of the United Nations, to the clarification of the problem of the liberation of the two provinces of the Sahara and their political future. However, I also owe it to myself to say, in the most courteous yet firm manner possible, that Morocco cannot accept being faced with a fait accompli imposed by the \\\"Spanish Government. That Government has been acting in such a way as to make final the dismemberment of our national territory and of the two provinces where the Moroccan Government has exercised sovereignty for centuries.\n210.\tBy persisting obdurately in a manner which seems to s irresponsible the Spanish Government is endangering the unity and territorial integrity of our country and threatening and jeopardizing the cause of peace and international co-operation. Resolution 1514 (XV) contains the following significant passage:\n\\\"Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\\\"\n211.\tMay I say to the Government of Spain that I quote that passage because it has been quoted relevantly by the representative of Spain in the United Nations on the question of the restoration of Gibraltar to Spain. The question of Gibraltar has been defined by the General Assembly as a question of the restoration of the national unity and territorial integrity of Spain and not as a question of self-determination. That is the case so far as we are concerned in the matter of the provinces of Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro, because they have always been an integral part of our national territory, as history, geography, culture and language bear witness and of which proof is given by numerous international treaties. Spain is in a position to understand that what it considered to be unacceptable for Gibraltar cannot be acceptable for the two provinces of the Sahara, and for the same reason.\n212.\tThe Spanish Government is in a better position than anyone else to recognize that the proper and loyal interpretation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) rests in the judicious application of the principles of decolonization and respect for the unity and territorial integrity of sovereign States. Our national territory as a whole was the subject of deeds behind its back at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of this century, deeds which led to the carving up of these provinces into various spheres of influence. Those deeds and other ententes cordials between colonial Powers cannot be accepted by us, as is underlined by international law and international morality.\n213.\tOur people have struggled for centuries against foreign penetration, whatever it might be, in order to safeguard their independence and the integrity of our national territory. To give but an historic example, let us recall that the fighting Ma EI Ainine, who came from the provinces of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra, undertook an armed struggle against the colonial conquerors in those provinces in order to penetrate as far north as Marrakesh in 1908. Is there a more striking historical example of the determination of the Moroccan people to preserve their national unity and territorial integrity?\n214.\tThere is a lesson which we have learned from this long struggle, similar to that drawn by other peoples under the colonial yoke: the liberation of peoples is above all accomplished by the peoples themselves.\n"

        "file_text": "As representative of Spain to this session of the General Assembly, I should like first, Sir, to congratulate you on your election as President. Your personal qualifications are very well known and highly appreciated, as are your tireless efforts towards better understanding among peoples, and especially your efforts to benefit the developing countries.\n150.\tI greet and congratulate also the people and Government of Algeria, an Arab country with which we have all kinds of ties and with which we maintain today fruitful co-operation.\n151.\tI should like to congratulate also Mr. Leopoldo Benites on the skillful and wise way in which he guided the work of the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session.\n152.\tOn behalf of the Government and people of Spain, I welcome the new States which at this session have joined our Organization: Grenada, Bangladesh and Guinea-Bissau.\n153.\tI should also like to express our condolences to Honduras and the other countries of the region on the catastrophe they have suffered. We wish to express our sympathy to our sister Republic and to assure it of our solidarity. The Government and people of Spain have already given some emergency aid. \n154.\tThe year that has elapsed since the last session has witnessed some striking events which will doubtless bring about a profound change in contemporary international relations. Along with the changes that have occurred in the direction of the public affairs of various countries, there has been an acceleration of the process of decolonization that has facilitated the legitimate access of new nations to international life, thus removing one of the most dangerous causes of conflict undermining the maintenance of peace.\n155.\tA series of unprecedented economic events has made clear the urgent need for a just and rational use of the resources of the world. Similarly, it is necessary, as part of that effort, to adopt regulations governing the use of the sea as a source of wealth, without disturbing the ecology of the marine environment through exaggerated claims or improper exploitation. Joint action in all those sectors must be compatible with the interests of everyone, thereby eliminating reasons for conflict. Undoubtedly we are moving in that direction through the efforts designed to achieve an equitable exchange of goods and products. An example of that is the sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and resources, a session which attempted to lay the bases for co-operation between producers and consumers and for assistance to the least-endowed countries.\n156.\tIf those efforts and others with the same aim succeed, we shall have taken a large step towards the international organization of a new political and economic order. But mankind has an inexhaustible capacity to find new problems and thus faces new questions in meeting the issues that historically have been created by the distribution of the land and its resources. Today* it is the violence and subversion carried out by a few against the organization which the others have created. That has become a new battlefield, and concerted international action against it is required.\n157.\tDuring the past year Spain has suffered the loss of its Prime Minister through assassination. All the facts lead us to think that those who perpetrated that crime have their base and have taken refuge in a foreign country.\n158.\tThis experience and other similar experiences suffered by ourselves and by many countries demonstrate the urgent need for international co-operation in preventing and punishing terrorism and-subversion.\n159.\tThe universal crisis of values is responsible for the rise in terrorism, subversion and violence as political weapons. The course of contemporary history has given rise to a loss of faith in moral concepts, contempt for the human being, pessimism and despair among the masses, and this despite the considerable material progress achieved. For their part, Governments, lacking adequate means and chary of internal political complications, neglect their co-operation and practically refuse it in cases where they are not directly involved. This selfish lack of solidarity may endanger peace and security.\n160.\tThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations\u2014General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) -proclaims that it is the duty of every State not to tolerate terrorist or subversive activities directed against other States. Yet we cannot in future simply enunciate general principles for the conduct of States to prevent subversive action directed from their territories against those of others. We must go on to effective measures which will prevent those activities from acquiring substance within one country and with impunity projecting themselves on others, with total disregard for the fundamental duty of every State to comply with the obligations imposed by international law, and to have these complied with by all those who reside in their territory, both nationals and foreigners.\n161.\tThis must not make us forget that there are many unjust situations throughout the world, that there are many legitimate claims, and that means must be devised to act positively to solve those problems. In this connexion, international co-operation again offers channels which should be studied and used because, unless we go to the root of what continue to be the causes of tension and conflict, the motives for violence will subsist in part. My delegation intends to reiterate and expand on these views in the relevant committee of the General Assembly.\n162.\tOn reviewing the international issues most closely affecting Spain, I must give preference to those questions on which the United Nations has acted with all its authority and in regard to which I have to report to this General Assembly.\n163.\tI shall refer in the first place to Western Sahara which Spain administers. I think it appropriate to make it clear above all that on this matter Spain has no dispute or controversy with any country in particular, since all States Members of this Organization are equally bound by the resolutions which advocate self-determination as the appropriate means to bring about decolonization of this Territory. Iii the process of the self-determination, which brings the United Nations closer to its objective of universality, the indigenous peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories are the undoubted protagonists, while the administering Powers have a dual responsibility, not only to the population, but also towards the international community as a whole. TQ the peoples under their administration they have an obligation to create the material conditions and the conditions of political development which will enable those peoples to exercise their right to self-determination and independence and an obligation to guarantee the free exercise of that right. Their responsibility to the international community is to ensure that the process is carried out pursuant to the rules embodied in the Charter and in General Assembly resolutions, and with the participation of this Organization. \n164.\tIn the last 12 months a series of important events have occurred in relation to Western Sahara on which my Government has duly reported to the Secretary-General. During the twenty-eighth session the Permanent Representative of Spain to the United Nations, on 28 September 1973,2 communicated the letter from the General Assembly of the Sahara to the Spanish head of State, and his reply. The General Assembly of the Sahara requested then that \\\"in a continuous manner an impetus be given to the process which will effectively ensure the possibility for the people of the Sahara to decide their own future\\\". In this request and in the reply of the Government, the Spanish position, repeatedly stated here, was confirmed. It is that the Saharan people alone are the masters of their destiny, that no one must oppose their will, and that it is up to Spain to set in motion the process of self-determination.\n165.\tAfter appropriate consultations with the representatives of the indigenous population, the Spanish Government announced the holding of a referendum under the auspices and supervision of the United Nations within the first six months of 1975, to be carried out in accordance with the steps set out by this General Assembly in resolution 3162 (XXVIII) and previous resolutions on the Sahara question. It communicated this to the Secretary-General by letters from the representative of Spain dated 20 August [AJ97I4] and 13 September 1974 [AI9736].\n166.\tThe Government of Spain has adopted and is adopting\\\" specific measures to guarantee to the indigenous inhabitants of the Sahara the free and genuine expression of their will so that they alone, in accordance with the relevant resolutions, will exercise that right. At the same time we have initiated contacts with Morocco, Mauritania and Algeria, for the purposes provided for in the resolutions of this General Assembly.\n167: We have been at pains to keep the Arab Governments informed of all these events and decisions, in recognition of their close friendship for Spain and the ties of blood, religion and culture which unites the Arab countries with, the Saharan people. We know that our attitude has been understood and we feel sure that our intentions will be duly appreciated by the Arab Governments, whose views we esteem highly.\n168.\tIn regard to the ability and right of the Saharan population to determine their own future, the inter-national community has expressed itself through this Organization in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly . Some States have claimed they have special interests in and title to the Sahara, the relative value of which is today illustrated by the claims and counter-claims which have repeatedly been stated before this Organization. But the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the Organization have never doubted the personality of its population, nor has that majority tried to predetermine their future with exclusive options which in practice would imply the negation of the right to self-determination, which has been clearly proclaimed and recognized in every vote taken in this forum. Accordingly, the Government of Spain is pleased today to say to the General Assembly that the preparation of the referendum will be carried out in accordance with the directives contained in General Assembly resolutions, since we consider them to be the most suitable to ensure that the Saharan population may express its will independently.\n169.\tThe referendum will thus be the decisive mile-stone in- the historical development of the Saharan people and their relationship with Spain, and will put an end to the divergences of view which have been expressed with regard to the Territory, because the freely expressed will of the population will place the stamp of legitimacy on whichever option prevails.\n170.\tSuch co-operation with the Saharan people to enable it to take the road it finally decides upon will be the culmination of a long labor of promotion and development, which is now evident, since this population has been given the opportunity to accede to international life by the peaceful course of self-determination.\n171.\tIn sum, Spain intends to respect the will of the Saharan people, the manifestation of which will take place with all internal and international guarantees, in accordance with the resolutions of this Organization, and we shall develop our co-operation with the countries of the area\u2014Morocco, Mauritania and Algeria -so that they may become a factor for peace and progress in the region with which Spain feels so closely bound.\t\u00a3 \\\n172.\tMy delegation reserves its right to refute in the relevant Committee the allegations made which would tend to render difficult or place condition^ on the exercise of self-determination by the Saharan people, and we shall correct the inaccuracies stated on facts and data relating to the Sahara.\n173.\tNow I am bound to refer to the serious and long-standing problem of Gibraltar which affects the territorial integrity of my country, the security in that geographic zone, and the moral authority of this Organization, whose resolutions are ignored by a State Member which is a permanent member of the Security Council. \n174.\tUnlike the question of the Sahara, in regard to which the United Nations advocates self-determination for the decolonization of the Territory, the question of Gibraltar has always been considered, in the relevant resolutions of this Organization, as a conflict between two States, Spain and the United Kingdom, which must clear up the problem of Spanish sovereignty and territorial integrity, which is implicit in the decolonization of the Rock.\n175.\tI shall not go into a history of the negotiations and incidents which have succeeded each other year after year in the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, in the Fourth Committee and in the plenary meetings of successive General Assembly sessions since 1966, nor shall I quote the conclusive text of accumulated resolutions. The documentation is clear, specific and public, as are the rights and will of Spain to negotiate in respect of the legitimate interests of the population. I am not afraid that I shall exaggerate if I add that what is also clear and public is the certainty that the other party has not so far shown that it is prepared seriously to seek a reasonable, just and effective solution.\n176.\tGeneral Assembly resolution 2429 (XXIII) indicated that 1 October 1969 was the deadline for the decolonization of Gibraltar. Five years have elapsed since then. This situation cannot go on indefinitely because it implies failure to comply with the obligation imposed on the colonial Power by the Charter, the resolutions of this Organization, and its membership in it, and because of the requirements of security, dignity and the public opinion of my country.\n177.\tSpain has adopted every possible peaceful attitude in regard to this problem. We have stated and defended our rights before this supreme international Organization and we have sought a formula for a solution by means of bilateral contacts with the United Kingdom safeguarding the interests of the present population.\n178.\tI shall now refer to the latest events which have occurred in relation to this matter. The consensus which was adopted by this General Assembly on 14 December 1973* called on both parties to report to the Secretary-General and to this General Assembly session on the result of the negotiations which were to be undertaken. I regret it profoundly, but it is my duty to inform the Assembly that there has been absolutely no result since there were even no negotiations.\n179.\tThe report of the Secretary-General of 8 August 1974 states that on 30 and 31 May of this year, in Madrid, new talks were held between the officers of the two Governments. To dispel any error, I wish to inform the Assembly that in fact the Government of the United Kingdom, in April last, proposed holding talks at the level of diplomatic officers as \\\"the best means to carry out the provisions of the consensus of 1973 on Gibraltar\\\".\n180.\tAlthough the consensus doubtless referred to genuine negotiations on the substantive question of decolonization, in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 2429 (XXIII), we wished to accede to this request for talks as proof of our good will and with the hope that those exploratory contacts proposed by the British Government might contribute to a'Start of genuine negotiations.\n181.\tWe were soon able to note that the British side was not prepared to go into the substantive question. The British representatives limited themselves to a specific but marginal item and to a request that Spain should facilitate over-flights of the security air zone neighboring on Gibraltar. Thus it was a claim to create a transit right, which virtually implied a new claim further to consolidate British colonial presence on Gibraltar. In return, it was suggested to us that that would increase the affection of the present population of Gibraltar towards Spain.\n182.\tThe offers and guarantees of Spain to respect the legitimate interests of those inhabitants by a special regime are well known. Brandishing the interests of the inhabitants, as was done initially, or their will or desires, as was done lately, is but a pretext to perpetuate colonial occupation; Their interests will remain guaranteed. What cannot be alleged is that they have any right to decide or dispose of a territory which never belonged to them and where they were introduced by the occupying Power serving its military bases, when the real population, the indigenous Spanish population was expelled. The question of Gibraltar is a question of territorial sovereignty to be decided in accordance with the resolutions of this Organization, and only the States concerned are legitimately authorized to do so as the parties to the Utrecht Treaty of 1713, who are exclusively entitled to decide on the consequences of its obsolescence.\n183.\tThe United Kingdom has never manifested any desire to negotiate. It invoked the consensus in the General Assembly to give the impression of abiding by it when its true intention was to evade it. With this evasive attitude, the United Kingdom, doubtless consistent with its strategy of a presence on the\nGibraltar Strait, renders difficult the prevalence of the necessary relaxation of tension for complete stability in the western Mediterranean, and this runs counter to the present requirements of international life and is hardly propitious for the survival of positions of domination and advantage. While a foreign country continues to hold a strategic enclave to influence it politically, exerts an implicit control over navigation and increases its military powers, its purposes are not exactly those of co-operation but of preponderance.\n184.\tThe Gibraltar base represents a threat to Spain because it disturbs security as a result of the competing greeds which are created, and is therefore a continuous challenge to the policy of peace of the external action of Spain. Furthermore, the presence of this foreign element in the Strait renders difficult any new regulation of its territorial waters and transit through them because of the interference of sovereignties which the colonial Power installed on the Rock and causes to be felt at all times. It is therefore a disturbing factor for any possible rational solution of the problems created by navigation in that space, because of technological development.\n185.\tA violation of the territorial integrity of Spain, a danger to its security, interference in its external policy of peace and a barrier to bringing up to date the legal regulation of the waters of the States -those are the most outstanding injuries which at present result from the British presence on the Rock and which the people of Spain has patiently endured although the United Nations has recognized the justice of its claims. Thus a colonial situation, the last existing colonial situation in Europe, is perpetuated, and this in a year such as 1974, which is so particularly marked by the stamp of decolonization.\n186.\tIt is discouraging and dangerous for the future of the community of nations to note the obstinate, rigid and selfish position of one of its members, a permanent member of the Security Council, a position taken in total contradiction of the opinion and feelings of the majority of this Organization. This cannot fail to jeopardize seriously the moral force on which the effectiveness of the United Nations must be based, because what affects one member of the community in the sphere of moral and legal values, affects all.\n187.\tOnce again Spain comes to this supreme body. With a feeling of responsibility and with the greatest good faith, but also with all seriousness, we request the General Assembly solemnly to reiterate to the United Kingdom its obligation to negotiate with Spain for the decolonization of Gibraltar and the reintegration of that territory in the Spanish nation, which will pay due attention to the interests of its present inhabitants.\n188.\tThe achievement of security by eliminating tension and by peaceful co-operation will make it unnecessary one day to maintain present defense systems. Until this occurs, however, no country can fail to look after its own security. But Spain, like other States, wishes to make its defense requirements compatible with efforts aimed at the relaxation of tension, and thus contribute to overcoming the contradictions of our time.\n189.\tThe Government of Spain has noted with approval the initiatives taken with a view to creating a progressive atmosphere of world detente, and we think that support should be given to the great Powers in the steps taken in this direction. The reduction of tension and increased understanding would no doubt eliminate serious sources of danger in which third countries might be involved. We therefore endorse efforts to secure a better atmosphere and the points of agreement which seem to be emerging between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the steps being taken towards a normalization of relations between the United States and China.\n190.\tNevertheless, our attitude is complemented by a very important consideration. In no case can agreement among the great Powers be achieved at the expense of the rest. An unrenounceable victory of our civilization is the right of all States to freedom and independence, to security, to peaceful development and to the promotion of their legitimate interests. The first duty of every State -and the stronger it is, the more this is to be demanded -is respect for the rights of others, and no type of hegemony or imperialism can today be accepted by the international community.\n191.\tThe community of European nations, despite its positive achievements, still awaits its constitution as a great Power, as would be consistent with the creative past of Europe and the hope of its peoples. Spain cannot fail to affirm once again its vocation to contribute to efforts aimed at European construction and its will to participate in any undertaking which will facilitate solution of the problems which Western Europe faces today.\n192.\tOn the other hand, the Government of Spain has been following with particular attention the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and will continue to make constructive and realistic efforts to achieve the objectives of lessening conflicting tensions and creating real confidence and a desire for effective cooperation. Although the work of this Conference always takes into account the broader context of world security and is in no way directed against any State or continent, we must emphasize the close relationship between European security and Mediterranean security, which gives our continent its true and genuine dimension. Hence my Government sponsors and often leads efforts to have presented to the Conference the ideas and proposals of the non-European coastal countries of the Mediterranean, which have made in the past and no doubt will make in the future an important contribution towards laying the foundations for security and cooperation, with mutual respect for certain legitimate interests that must be harmonized with justice and equity.\n193.\tSpain, which besides being European has particularly close ties with the Arab countries, has believed it has served the general interest by following a policy designed to lead to a promising future when the European-Arab dialog will open up new channels of expression. The ancient and permanent friendship of Spain with the Arab world makes us wish for a just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East. The agreements which put an end to the fighting in October 1973 give reason to believe that this hope will be fulfilled. Accordingly, the Government of Spain considers that it is of the utmost importance that the negotiations on the restoration of peace in that region be successful.\n194.\tWhat is needed is the total cessation of war operations and every kind of violence, withdrawal from the territories occupied by force, scrupulous respect for the oft-repeated resolutions of United Nations organs, a quest for just and permanent solutions as regards legitimate interests and, first and foremost, recognition and implementation of the human and political rights of the people of Palestine. The task is great and the entire international community must be associated in it. For its part, Spain supports the consideration of the Palestine question in all its aspects at the present session of the Assembly.\n195.\tIt is Spain's firm purpose to give its relations with Latin America increasing effectiveness and dynamism which will renew our old and indestructible links. Spain believes more than ever in the future of Latin America, with which it wishes to be united. The awareness that we are indissolubly linked in all that is deepest and most essential enables each one of us to find in the political, social and economic fields specific solutions, which are favored by present trends of understanding.\n1%. The ideal of unity proclaimed by Simon Bolivar is now being given shape in Latin America by promising movements of co-operation which Spain views with special interest. The entire Hispanic community feels satisfaction at this attainment of regional and subregional co-operation in the political, economic and cultural fields.\n197.\tWe consider our special relationship with Latin America as involving a particular effort to complement and co-operate with one another in the spheres of culture, economics, technology and human relations. This understanding has been fully endorsed by the Governments and peoples of Latin America.\n198.\tMany countries of Latin America today need investments of capital which they can view without suspicion, and technology in accord with their respective levels of development. In this field, Spain is making a great financial effort both with individual countries and through international organizations and, while there was a tradition of emigration of Spaniards to Latin America, this has been replaced by a growing exchange of technical experts, professors and managerial personnel, who contribute with their specialized qualifications to the development of the countries of the Latin American community.\n199.\tAt the beginning of my statement I said that mankind faces the problem of organizing in a rational and just manner the enjoyment of its resources. At the present time new critical factors have arisen in the already existing economic problems. To the monetary and trade imbalance and the growing gap between the industrialized and the developing countries has been added runaway inflation, a decline in the growth rate of many countries and a sharp rise in the prices of various energy products and raw materials, all of which is causing disturbances in the mechanism for the distribution of resources and income on the international level.\n200.\tAt the present critical phase of adjustment and in addition to its efforts to achieve an atmosphere of confidence and understanding among the various countries and groups of countries, we believe that the United Nations can help by drawing up positive and acceptable formulas for the solution of these problems taking into account all the conflicting interests. That is so because the only real choice open to us is international co-operation for development on a far broader scale and on a more committed basis than what has been done so far.\n201.\tThe present crisis has had different effects on different members of the international community. Those most affected were the developing countries which lack natural resources. To them must be directed the priority efforts of the United Nations, bearing in mind that the criteria followed so far for their classification according to their level of development have not proved satisfactory.\n202.\tSpain is suffering acutely from the consequences of the present crisis because of the impact on our economy of the rise in the prices of raw materials, oil and food products which are indispensable to maintaining continuity in our development. Nevertheless, as a country of intermediate development we have subscribed to the commitments which are now being agreed to in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and IMF; we have participated in the efforts to restructure the international monetary order in accordance with present needs; we have undertaken to participate in the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations with the desire of obtaining a substantial increase in trade in the products most important to the developing countries; we have joined the African regional development organization and we hope to join that of Latin America in the near future; we likewise supported the establishment of the Special Fund for emergency relief and development assistance to the most seriously affected countries, established by the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order which we have also accepted.\n203.\tLastly, Spain recently renounced the financial benefits which it had been receiving from UNDP. This decision was taken at the same time as our decision to increase our contribution to that Program not only as regards financing, but also in terms of technological co-operation.\n204.\tBefore concluding I should like to make some remarks on the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which has just ended in Caracas.\n205.\tThe geographical situation of Spain between two of the principal seas of the world, its long coastline and the inclusion in that coastline of the Strait of Gibraltar, the importance of our shipping and fishery activities, our interest in shipbuilding and our hopes of participating in the future exploitation of the sea-bed, has resulted in the Government of Spain taking clear-cut but fully co-operative attitudes on the main items considered by the Conference.\n206.\tToday, the concept of the territorial sea as a zone of defense and protection for a State is more significant than ever. A territorial sea of up to 12 miles is now acceptable in international law, and the historic concept of innocent passage through territorial waters, which combines freedom of navigation with the security of the coastal State, must be maintained without exception, with agreed particulars when they are considered necessary.\n207.\tTo protect the ecology of the marine environment is also vital to ensure that there will be no reduction in the living resources now threatened by in-creasing pollution of the sea. Regulating catches in all maritime areas, including the high seas, will avoid the abuses of modern fishing methods. We must reconcile the recognition of a broad economic zone of preferential interest for the coastal States with the fishing rights of third parties, in a manner compatible with the interests of both.\n208.\tSpain is traditionally a fishing country and an important sector of our population lives by fishing; we declare our intention of co-operating with the countries adjacent to maritime zones of abundant fishing wealth, and in this co-operation we can contribute our industrial and technical capacity. We also reaffirm that the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction is the common heritage of mankind and we advocate reconciling their effective and rational use with justice in the distribution of the benefits of every kind; we therefore support the establishment of an international organization which will regulate and adequately control the exploitation of the sea-bed.\n209.\tThe difficult times we face require of all Governments, and of all those in positions of influence in the community, the greatest efforts of imagination, of decision and of good will. Let us make those efforts at every level -within our respective countries, in bilateral relations, in regional co-operation systems, and within the broad universal framework of the United Nations. From the last generation of statesmen we received this Organization, with its qualities and its shortcomings, with much of its potential still unrealized. Let us fulfill that potential not only \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\", but also so that they may attain a more prosperous, more dignified and more just way of life through international co-operation.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, my first words will naturally be to express to you the sincere congratulations of the delegation of Mauritania. In more ways than one, no choice could have been wiser than ours in making you our President. Your qualities as a statesman and a distinguished diplomat and your experience of international problems are for us a sure guarantee of success. Your election to the presidency of this important session is not only a tribute to your persona! qualifications; it is also proof of our esteem and respect for and confidence in Algeria, the Revolutionary Council and the people of Algeria. It is also a great honor conferred upon Africa, of which you, Mr. Minister and dear friend, are a worthy representative.\n129.\tMay I say, Mr. President, how very much my country appreciates any honor conferred upon Algeria. Not only do we think alike politically; history, geography and Arab culture have throughout the centuries woven between our two countries and our two peoples ties of friendship and solidarity, ties which have become richer and more fruitful in the course of time and which now distinguish our day- to-day relations. You may therefore rest assured of our co-operation in the exercise of your lofty responsibilities. Certainly they are difficult responsibilities, because you have been entrusted with the direction of the work of this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, whose aim is to trace the pattern of international events, make clear their meaning and draw up guidelines for short-term and long-term action by the Organization,\n130.\tOn looking at the international situation today one cannot fail to see prophetic signs, even auguries, of profound changes on both the political and the economic level. On the economic level, the crisis of the international monetary system, the constant deterioration in the terms of trade and related difficulties are problems that have been accumulating for many years. These problems finally brought the international community, and in particular the developing countries, face to face with the threat of a break-down of unprecedented scope.\n131.\tThe inequalities, the characteristic injustices of this system, which already weighed heavily on the countries with weak economies, finally were going to jeopardize dangerously the prosperity of the rich and industrialized nations. In fact, no nation and one becomes increasingly aware of this today can, in an era when large groupings prevail, prosper and live in isolation, while its destiny is more than ever tied to that of the other members of the international community. It is with interdependence, co-operation and mutual assistance that we can jointly build a better world from which we shall banish poverty, ignorance and social and economic injustices. We know that this is still a pious hope, but we believe that an awareness of the need for solidarity and concerted action is already a factor of considerable importance. It so happens, indeed, that all the delegations that spoke during the course of the sixth special session, and the documents adopted as the result of that debate, placed particular emphasis on this urgent need for solidarity. Need I recall that the developing countries, far from seeing the problems in terms of confrontation, wish to have recognized for each State its own rights, which naturally imply obligations. The new international economic order proposed and adored by a general consensus constitutes, in the opinion of my country, an important step in that direction, and must be Sincerely supported by all nations, and in particular by the industrialized and developed countries. It is owly thereby that the international community can overcome the contradictions of the existing system and establish co-operation based on real equality and the interests of all.\n132.\tPolitically, the forces of oppression and domination see their end approaching with each passing day. In the Middle East, Zionism, despite the diversity and variety of the support it enjoys, can no longer resist the unshakable will of the Arab peoples to defend their freedom, their sovereignty and their territorial integrity. The October war, which was a defeat for the Israeli forces of aggression, showed an astounded world the determination of the Arab countries to ensure their complete mastery of their own destiny. International opinion, which seemed to have far more faith in force than in right and reason, today has come to see the situation in the Middle East in true light. Sovereign and independent countries, Members of the United Nations, have in the course of the year seen their territory become smaller like a shrinking skin, their sovereignty diminished, and even their existence threatened. Israel, strong in its impunity, pursues its policy of force and destruction in this region, sparing neither innocent civilians nor peaceful villages. In this connexion, we must recall the perfidy, the indescribable act of the destruction of the city of Quneitra by the Israeli soldiery. It is difficult not to be deeply indignant at such an act of sadism which is nothing other than a repetition of the methods of Hitler. Thus those who yesterday were the victims of Hitlerism have today become its most fervent practitioners, but whatever may be the perfidy and arrogance of Israel, it 'can never break the will and determination of the Arab countries.\n133.\tEven the Palestinian people, expelled from their homeland, reduced to a wandering existence since 1947, deprived of its most elementary rights, is today more than ever determined to carry on its heroic struggle to recover its national territory. It is, furthermore, now admitted and we rejoice at this that the solution of the problem of the Middle East as a whole must necessarily include a settlement of the Palestinian question. In this regard the inclusion of this question on the agenda of the present session should enable the United Nations to give this general feeling specific form.\n134.\tIt goes without saying that the PLO must speak before the General Assembly and effectively participate in this debate, which concerns it primarily and which will decide its destiny. I here reaffirm our permanent and effective solidarity with our brothers of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine.\n135.\tIn Asia everybody knows of the sacrifices and sufferings imposed on the Cambodian people by foreign forces which continue, financially and militarily, to support the regime at present in power at Phnom Penh. In spite of the massive aid given to the unpopular Lon Nol regime, the balance of forces on the battlefield is in itself sufficiently eloquent to make our Organization finally heed the clearly expressed will of the Cambodian people. Thus it is the duty of our Assembly to restore the legitimate rights in the United Nations to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia under the direction of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the sole genuine representative of the Cambodian people.\n136.\tThe South VietNamese people, in its National Liberation Front and in its Provisional Revolutionary Government, gives striking proof of its will to sacrifice and its determination to face the difficulties on its road to independence and freedom. This people will not rest as long as foreign forces are not with-drawn from South Viet Nam and as long as the Saigon authorities do not scrupulously comply with the Paris agreements.\n137.\tIn Korea the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in South Korea, and the abolition of the use of the United Nations flag, should enable the Korean people as a whole to exercise its right to self-determination and freely to decide its future. The United Nations, which had the chief responsibility in the artificial division of the territory and people of Korea, today more than ever has the duty to facilitate the peaceful and independent reunification of that country. \n138.\tAs regards the problem of Cyprus, our delegation in the Security Council has on numerous occasions had an opportunity to express the view of the Government and people of Mauritania. Our position with regard to this painful problem is based on our support for three fundamental principles, namely, the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Cyprus.\n139.\tLately, under the pressure of liberation movements and of forces favorable to peace, there has been an irreversible acceleration in the process of decolonization in Africa. The sacrifices of every kind and the sufferings that the African liberation movements imposed on themselves, their heroic struggle for the freedom and dignity of their people have obviously been the decisive element in that change. Nor can I fail to mention the critical contribution still being made by the United Nations and by all peoples that love peace and justice, which have at no time spared their support for and solidarity with OAU and the African freedom fighters. Nor could I fail, in speaking of decolonization, to pay a heartfelt tribute to the Government and people of Portugal for their sense of realism and for having understood the need for decolonization, a need which has often been recalled before this Assembly.\n140.\tAs a result of the combination of those elements, we are able today to welcome the admission to the United Nations of the Republic of Guinea- Bissau, which, after almost two decades of struggle and sacrifice, has finally regained its dignity and its freedom. That is a decision which my country, from this rostrum, has constantly and whole-heartedly called a just decision, a decision in conformity with the right of peoples to self-determination and to choose their destiny freely. Hence, I should like to extend my country's congratulations to the delegation of Guinea-Bissau, whose presence in this hall constitutes for us Africans the living symbol of the lightness of our cause and encourages us to pursue our action. We hope that we shall soon be able to address ourselves in similar terms to the true representatives of the peoples of Mozambique, Angola and still other Territories and I would stress those words: \\\"still other Territories\\\". For it is a fact a fact that each day becomes more obvious that the will of the peoples is invincible.\n141.\tIt is equally true that the liberation of the colonies under Portuguese domination places the general problem of decolonization at the forefront of present events. The anachronistic colonial situations still prevailing in southern Africa and other parts of the continent can no longer resist that will of the peoples and that irreversible pressure of events. Portugal's example must teach the racist minorities of South Africa and Zimbabwe to stop clinging to obsolete and criminal values, must make them try, while there is still time, to take their places with honour in the great human family.\n142.\tI come now to another colonial African Terri-tory\u2014Sahara, under Spanish administration. Every-one is aware of the position of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania on that problem; it is a constant and, we think, logical and consistent position. Indeed, our position regarding that part of the national territory draws its strength as much from history and geography as from the nature of the population.\n143.\tHistorically Mauritania or what was then called \\\"Bilad Shinguit\\\" has always been, throughout the last 14 centuries, that Saharan entity which extends from the southern frontiers of Morocco to the Senegal River and from the Atlantic to Telemsi Morocco or the extreme west has often been called \\\"Jazirat Al-Maghrib\\\", the Isle of the West. That very fortuitous expression means that the Moroccan domain is encompassed by the Mediterranean to the north, the Atlantic to the west and the Sahara to the south. The Sahara and I must stress this-- has been and remains a much more difficult barrier to cross than the maritime frontiers. That is the result as much of the nature of the terrain as of the centuries- old determination of the inhabitants of that region to resist any threat to their freedom and to allow passage only to beneficial influences that they have voluntarily accepted.\n144.\tNo one and certainly not the Mauritanians can deny that brotherly and mutually beneficial relations have been established between those two entities throughout the centuries. But history attests to the fact that deep frictions also have arisen between them. However, there is one unchanging element in the long history of this Saharan region: from the beginning of history and up to the first part of this century, the region was never administered from outside. It was always governed by emirs who were genuine inhabitants of the region. On the other hand, that region was able to govern the Saharan and Moroccan entities and to unite them under one authority. That happened in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The unification that took place then was the work of the Almoravides, who had come from the central and western parts of Mauritania. For the first and last time, Mauritania and Morocco were one empire, the empire of the Mauritanian Almoravides.\n145.\tAt the beginning of this century, a similar attempt was made by El He'iba Ould Sheikh Malatnine, or the \\\"Blue Sultan\\\", the descendant of an old and noble family from Nema, a city in the south-eastern part of Mauritania. It was only the intervention of French troops that defeated that attempt to recreate the glorious age of the Almoravides.\n146.\tBetween those two dates the eleventh century and the beginning of the twentieth century all the attempts made in the north-south direction failed. Some expeditions undertaken in the last century got as far as Sous, in the region of the present city of Agadir. A more successful undertaking brought Sultan Moulaye El Hassan in 1886 as far as Wad Noum, in the G'leimim (Goulimin) region.\n147.\tIn that very same year, 1886, Spain succeeded in establishing itself in the Sahara, having concluded treaties with some Mauritanian chiefs, particularly the Emir of Mauritanian Adrar, Ahmed Ould M'Hamed Ould Ai'da; all other parties were excluded. That proves that at the time of the Spanish penetration there clearly was a traditional power in the Sahara, as there was everywhere else in Africa. Of course, the simple existence of that power does not automatically lead to the existence of rights. But the links between that power and independent Mauritania do not need to be demonstrated in any way. Indeed, that treaty was signed by a Mauritanian Emir who came from the city of Atar in the north-central part of present-day Mauritania.\n1481 A few years after the signing of that treaty between Emir Ahmed Ould M'Hamed Quid Ai'da and Spain, France began its penetration into southern and eastern Mauritania, through agreements reached with the Mauritanian Emirs and excluding all other parties. Furthermore, the existence of that distinct Mauritanian entity, with its own identity, has been recognized on many occasions in old international treaties and recent official documents. As proof I need cite only the peace treaty concluded between Morocco and Spain on 28 May 1767, during the reigns of Sultan Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdallah and Charles III and more specifically article 18 of that treaty, reading as follows:\n\\\"His Imperial Majesty will not discuss the establishment that His Catholic Majesty wishes to create south of the Noum River, because he cannot be held responsible for the accidents and misfortunes that could occur, in view cf the fact that his sovereignty does not extend that far and that the fierce roving tribes living in that country have caused harm to the people of the Canary Islands and reduced them to slavery.\\\"\n149.\tAnd yet Wad Noum is well north of the Tarfaya region, ceded to Morocco by Spain in 1958. Thus, Sultan Mohamed did not hesitate to grant, through that treaty, fishing rights to the Spanish starting at Santa Cruz that is, Ifni towards the north, in the Moroccan territorial waters where he believed he had sovereignty.\n150.\tThere are other official and irrefutable pieces of evidence that that Territory is Mauritanian; they are dated 1960 and come from our Moroccan brothers.\n151.\tAs can be seen, both the historical background that I have just referred to without any bitterness or rancor and official acts of the fraternal Moroccan Government prove that the southern frontier of Morocco is a genuine delimitation between two worlds, or, as the historian Robert Montagne wrote, \\\"the demarcation between two different social and political systems\\\".\n152.\tHence, historically Mauritania, with its \\\"fierce roving tribes\\\" as they were so politely called was to remain that mysterious, unknown and feared country until the \\\"Franco-Spanish\\\" penetration.\n153.\tGeographically, the present frontier of the so- called Spanish Sahara has been defined by the Franco- Spanish Conventions of 22 June 1900, 30 October 1904 and 27 November 1912. Although the Sahara has common boundaries with Morocco and Algeria, extending over some 400 and 40 kilometers, respectively, its entire area of 280,000 square kilometers lies within Mauritania and along a 1,600 kilometer- long administrative boundary.\n154.\tIndeed, like Mauritania, so-called Spanish Sahara extends from longitude 17\u00b0 W to latitude 27\u00b0 N. This means that it is pointless to emphasize the artificiality of the Saharan frontier which arbitrarily divides regions whose ethnic, linguistic and geographic unity is beyond challenge. I must recall, as was emphasized in 1963 by the Mauritanian Minister for Foreign Affairs before the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, that the so-called Spanish Sahara is inhabited solely by Mauritanian tribes differing in no way from other tribes living in the north-western part of independent Mauritania.6 Indeed, they have everything in common; their language\u2014Hassania (the Mauritanian dialect of Arabic), culture, race and customs. Even in their daily activities and their nomadic nature, those tribes give proof of the artificiality of the frontier which divides them. The examples of CMad Dleym, Rguebatt, Oulad Tidrarine, Ehel Baricalla, Laroussyne and so on attest to the inter-penetration of those tribes and to the homogeneity of that whole north-western region of Mauritania.\n155.\tThus it is clear that history, geography and human habitation have made that region, formerly called \\\"Spanish Mauritania\\\", an integral part of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. My country's position on this problem derives, quite naturally, from these fundamental facts.\n156.\tThus it was that in 1957 and more precisely on S July 1957, i when we were able to free ourselves partially from colonial subjugation, three years before our independence the Mauritanian Head of State, then Vice President of the Council of Government, declared at Atar:\n\\\"Mauritania is no longer that vast desert which was once so difficult to cross and which formed a sort of barrier between the Mediterranean world and black Africa, difficult for men and ideas to traverse. I am addressing myself more particularly to our brothers of the Spanish Sahara. I cannot help but recall the innumerable ties that unite us: we have the same names; we speak the same language; we have the same noble traditions; we venerate the same religious chiefs; we graze our herds on the same pastures, which we water from the same wells. I therefore invite our brothers of Spanish Sahara to reflect this great economic and spiritual Mauritania which from now on is always in our thoughts.\\\"\n157.\tThat policy has subsequently been constantly expounded at every African and international gathering, and, in particular, by the most authoritative spokesmen of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania: its Chief of State, its Ministers for Foreign Affairs and its United Nations representatives. Therefore, I need hardly reiterate in detail those various policy statements, as they appear in the relevant documents of the Organization; nor do I wish to take up more of the Assembly's time.\n158.\tFor the sake of historical truth, however, I must recall that on 13 December 1962, here at the United Nations, my country subscribed to the principle of the self-determination of the people of the Sahara; for we were sure that our brothers in the Sahara, if they had to choose between Mauritania or another country, would choose to march with us. But beyond that certainty, there is all our loyal and sincere support for the right of peoples to self-determination, in accordance with the Charter and with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), which contains the Declaration of the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\n159.\tThe United Nations itself, on the basis of a decision taken on 9 September 1966 by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, acknowledged the inalienable right of the people of the Sahara to self-determination [resolution 2229 (XXI)j. That right has subsequently been reaffirmed in all resolutions and decisions taken by the non-aligned countries, the OAU and the United Nations. As proof I need only cite the resolutions adopted on 9 September 1973 by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries; on 14 December 1973 by the General Assembly [resolution 3162 (XX VIII)]; and on 11 June 1974 by the Summit Conference of the OAU. Need I recall that all those resolutions were drafted, submitted and supported by my country and by those directly concerned with the problem, notably Morocco?\n160.\tAlong with that action, my country has sought internationally, by every means, to preserve and consolidate friendship among the fraternal peoples and Governments of the subregion. Thus, in 1969, when the subregion witnessed a happy turn of events the normalization of relations between Morocco and Mauritania my Government, without departing from its fundamental position, unhesitatingly placed the problem of the so-called Spanish Sahara within the framework of concerted action. We proposed to the Governments of our brother States that they unite their efforts so as to achieve as soon as possible the settlement advocated by the United Nations. Above all, our concern and desire was to maintain peace and stability in the subregion, but also to have the African and Arab groups regain the necessary cohesion to be able to face the scope and gravity of the decolonization problems in Africa and the Middle East.\n161.\tMy country, which more than ever is prompted by the same desire, cannot fail to respond favorably to the appeal addressed to it yesterday on behalf of the Moroccan Government by my colleague and brother Mr. Ahmed Laraki, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Morocco [2249th meeting]. We can do so with all the more alacrity and serenity since the Government of Morocco has expressly recognized our rights over that Saharan region. We do so, too, because we are certain that, beyond transitory misunderstandings fostered by colonialism, the Mauritanian and Moroccan .peoples are keenly aware of their responsibility to combat colonialism, which continues to dominate the Territories of Ri'o de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra. Mauritania, which understands the legitimate motives of the Government of Morocco, declares that the only problem at present is the liberation of those Territories liberation, which will strengthen understanding and cooperation between our two peoples.\n162.\tWe have sufficient historical, legal, linguistic and human proof that those Territories were not lands without masters or administration. That is why the Mauritanian Government accepts recourse to the International Court of Justice, whose opinion cannot fail to enlighten the General Assembly on the well- founded nature of our position and enable it to ensure proper implementation of the resolutions adopted. This attitude, which shows the constant interest and solidarity of our peoples, is further warranted by the need to maintain harmony within the ranks of the\nArab and African countries in the face of our serious and multiple concerns. It is based also on my country's devotion to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, particularly when those disputes are likely to lead to a confrontation between two countries and peoples which geography and common civilization have destined to enjoy relations of understanding and co-operation.\n163.\tSpain, as the colonial Power, must in any event soon end its presence in the Sahara. History, the United Nations and international morality demand it, and Spain itself has agreed to meet that requirement.\n164.\tThus the International Court of Justice, in establishing the existence or non-existence of a Power in the Sahara, will have to determine the Sahara's links with Mauritania and Morocco.\n165.\tWhatever might be the opinion of the Inter-national Court of Justice, however, the right of self- determination of the people of the Sahara cannot be subject to any impediment. That population has the right freely to choose its destiny and no international organization or institution can deny it that right. My country solemnly undertakes here before you to abide by the freely expressed will of that population.\n166.\tThis, of course, leads me on to speak of the referendum in which the population of the Sahara is to decide its future. That referendum cannot be organized and carried out on a completely free, democratic and impartial basis unless the administering Power scrupulously respects the procedures which have so often been advocated by the United Nations. Above all, a special mission to the so-called Spanish Sahara must be sent by the United Nations, and it alone should recommend to the United Nations the practical measures for the organization and holding of the referendum. For our part, we understand that these measures would refer not only to the preparation and supervision of the referendum by the Organization, but also to the practical and specific arrangements that would enable the genuine Saharans, within and outside the territory, to participate in that consultation.\n167.\tWe have, of course, taken note with satisfaction of the reiterated commitment of the administering Power to apply all the provisions of resolution 3162 (XXVIII). And yet we must deplore the slowness of the administering Power and at times the vagueness of its intentions about the future of its Territories. This is all the more resented because any colonial situation is anachronistic in our era, and because recent statements made by Saharan figures of consequence would, if confirmed, give us no grounds for optimism.\n168.\tHowever, we feel certain that Spain, which has already shown a positive attitude with respect to decolonization, will avoid anything that might affect its past and present relations with Mauritania and the other States of the subregion.\n169.\tIn concluding this statement, I should like to say again how happy I am, Mr. President, to be ad-dressing the Assembly under your presidency. I also wish to express our admiration and appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Benites, for the outstanding manner in which he guided the work of the twenty- eighth session and of the sixth special session of the General Assembly. I hope that the Republic of Bangladesh and the Republic of Grenada will accept our friendship and our warmest congratulations. I wish to assure the Secretary-General that we follow with deep sympathy his tireless efforts to make of the United Nations a true instrument of peace, understanding and harmony among peoples. We express again our confidence in him and assure him of our support in his efforts. We sincerely hope that each Member State will work for the respect of the principles embodied in the Charter and for the implementation of the decisions taken by the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of my delegation, I wish warmly to congratulate you on your election to the office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a fitting tribute not only to you personally but also to the Government and the people of your great country, Algeria. My delegation is confident that, with your diplomatic skill and the long experience which you have had in the work of the Organization, you will guide this session through to a fruitful conclusion. I pledge my delegation's co-operation and support to you.\n78.\tMay I also take this opportunity to express my delegation's gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Benites of Ecuador, who presided so skilfully over the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly.\n79.\tI wish also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts and contribution to world peace and devoted service to humanity.\n80.\tFor my country and my delegation, it is always a welcome pleasure to see new Members admitted to the United Nations. Thus, I salute the delegations of Bangladesh and Grenada and, through them, extend our hearty congratulations to their respective Governments and peoples.\n81.\tBut, on this particular occasion, I wish to beg representatives' indulgence for speaking emotionally on the admission of Guinea-Bissau. Guinea-Bissau's admission to the United Nations is to the African continent an act that marks the beginning of a new era in southern Africa an era which, we hope, shall at long last bring independence and freedom, peace and stability to that region. In our view, nothing will ever be the same again in that part of Africa, following the April coup in Portugal. We are happy to see our brothers from Guinea-Bissau among us, we welcome their presence and we congratulate the Government and people of Guinea-Bissau on their victory. We are aware of the enormous task ahead of them as they set themselves to the business of reconstruction and development of their country. We therefore urge the international community to give them material support.\n82.\tIt is our hope that the cease-fire of 7 September 1974 between the Frente de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] and Portugal will indeed lead to the total independence of Mozambique on 25 June 1975. We welcome that cease-fire and look forward to the admission of Mozambique to membership in the United Nations.\n83.\tIn September 1969, on the occasion of Botswana's third anniversary of independence, the President of my country, Sir Seretse Khama, addressed the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth session [1764th meeting] from this rostrum. It is now five years since that address, and Botswana has, only a few days ago, celebrated its eighth anniversary of independence, before going to the polls in less than a fortnight from today to elect a new Parliament. It is therefore fitting for me to begin by recalling the belief expressed by the President of my country in the United Nations.\n84.\tI reaffirm the faith of my country in the principles and purposes of the Charter of the Organization. We in Botswana view the United Nations as an effective Organization through which enduring peace and progress of mankind can be assured. We believe that this world body is eminently suited to deal not only with major problems of peace and security for all nations but also with the pressing problems of human rights, self-determination, poverty and economic development. It is our view that what may be regarded as the failure of the Organization is, in fact, a reflection of the world it seeks to serve. To that extent, we share the wish of those who seek to improve it and to make it more effective.\n85.\tThe value of the United Nations to small nations, like my own, whose interests may on occasion be threatened, should not be diminished. On the contrary, the Organization should increasingly play a very important role in safeguarding peace and security for us all, in calling the attention of the international community to the pressing economic problems, and in bringing pressure to bear on the colonial and white minority regimes which practice racism and apartheid.\n86.\tTo my country, the specialized agencies of the Organization continue to be a significant source of economic development and technical assistance, and we feel honored to have benefited from such assistance.\n87.\tThe events of the past 12 months are of significance to the Organization. When the Security Council adopted resolution 242 (1967) on 22 November 1967, it was hoped that its provisions would be a framework for peace in the Middle East. The Organization of African Unity [OA U] attached great importance to the provisions of that resolution. But peace has continued to prove elusive. The prolonged tension in the Middle East, which led to the October war in 1973, was for my country a truly sad development.\n88.\tBotswana has never supported any view which denies the existence of the State of Israel. Equally, we reject as inadmissible Israel's acquisition of Arab lands through the use of force. Regrettably, both the 1967 and 1973 wars have resulted in such acquisitions by Israel. We urge Israel to vacate those lands, if only in deference to international law, which protects all States alike. In our view, such withdrawal would constitute a serious step towards peace and security in the region. My delegation believes that any settlement of the Middle East issue must also take into account the interests of Palestinians if it is to guarantee any measure of permanent peace in the area.\n89.\tAnother dangerous conflict has recently occurred in Cyprus. Apart from membership in the United Nations and in OAU, Botswana is a member of the non- aligned group of nations, and so is Cyprus. The independence of Cyprus should be safeguarded out of respect for the principle of self-determination. We hope and trust that peace and calm will return to that em-battled island. We equally hope that, with such calm, that nation's independence will be guaranteed through a negotiated settlement. Consequently, my country does not favor any annexation of that State, or of any part of it, by any Power.\n90.\tWe commend the efforts of the United Nations in seeking to restore peace to that country, and hope that the parties concerned will respect its role in this connexion. My country continues in a modest way to contribute to the maintenance of UNFICYP.\n91.\tThe consequences of the recent hostilities, which have rendered homeless almost one third of that country's population, are of concern to us. We trust that other nations, particularly the non-aligned, as well as the parties directly concerned, will continue jointly to co-operate with and support the efforts of the United Nations.\n92.\tMy country continues to observe with keen interest events in other parts of the world. We know that in South-East Asia fighting is still raging, and that areas of friction and conflict still exist. Closer to us, in southern Africa, wars of liberation are continuing. The relations of world Powers are of immediate interest to us. The possibilities for world-wide conflict and confrontation have yet to be totally eliminated. If, indeed, the spirit of rapprochement and accommodation, which has been talked about so much over the past few years, is a new development which augurs well for the future of mankind, it is to be hoped that its forces will be used to eliminate the lingering areas of conflict. We hope that this spirit of detente, which we welcome, does not contain elements which could lead to greater rivalries and greater confrontations.\n93.\tThe developing nations cannot be expected to welcome a new development which seeks to serve only the desires of a club of nations, leaving aside other pressing problems of the world which continue to confront the United Nations. It is the hope of my delegation that the developing nations as well as the major Powers will join together, in the interests of peace and security, equality and self-determination, to work for the creation of a new spirit that can benefit all of mankind.\n94.\tBeing only eight years old, my country is relatively new to the international scene. However, the aspirations of mankind today are obvious to all of us. None of us can remain aloof any longer. The new spirit of co-operation which I have referred to should address itself to these aspirations by providing solutions to the most pressing problem facing us: the realization of economic and social progress. My Government has committed itself fully to pursuing this task as vigorously as ever. Therefore, in the international context, it is the view of my delegation that economic and social progress is also one of the main concerns of the United Nations.\n95.\tAlthough this concern has been clearly reflected also by the many conferences held in the past years, it seems to us that those held with the last 12 months demonstrate beyond any shadow of doubt the concern of all Members of the Organization in this regard. And here we can recall the attempts of the sixth special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and development, held in April this year; the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas recently; and the World Population Conference, held at Bucharest several weeks ago. In all those Conferences the concern of the world community was the same: economic and social progress or, more specifically, the ever-widening gap between the standard of living of the developing nations and the industrialized Powers; the world food situation, which is becoming more and more critical; the problem of population management and the equitable sharing of resources; and the havoc wrought on the economies of nations by the energy crisis.\n96.\tIndeed, the eradication of poverty, illiteracy, hunger, disease and other sources of human suffering and misery should remain the concern of us all, individually as well as collectively. Our desire for economic and social progress should be translated into meaningful schemes and programs of assistance from which the needy and most deserving can benefit.\n97.\tI speak openly on the problems of economic and social progress, fully aware that my nation is small, and with the full knowledge that compared with other nations our effort or contribution is bound to be small. For indeed, my country has no assistance programs or financing schemes to offer to the international community, in this regard, we are recipients of aid. However, we developing nations are eager to make any contribution, however small. Thus my country has every reason to be proud of its effort and contribution, given the state of its economic development.\n98.\tMy delegation wishes to commend the spirit with which the sixth special session of the General Assembly was convened. Yet we must bemoan the fact that no sooner had that session ended than the enthusiasm for it vanished. The economic situation in the third world has worsened over the last 12 months. Economic growth is at a standstill. In some cases, the reversal of economic progress has been the result, especially following the recent energy crisis.\n99.\tIf the apparent lack of enthusiasm is the unfortunate result of pointing accusing fingers at any one group of countries as being responsible for some of these problems, might I add that it is neither the wish nor the intention of my delegation to find a scapegoat. And in this regard, may I compliment those countries, developing or developed, which have come to the rescue of the less fortunate countries.\n100.\tClearly, the magnitude of recent as well as perennial economic problems has emphasized the need for multilateral action. We hope that the international community, especially those countries with the means to do so, will respond to this situation. The tendency to emphasize, either unilateral or bilateral action might prove self-defeating. We must come to the rescue of those among us who need help most.\n101.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which convened in Caracas, Venezuela, this past summer, dealt with issues of importance to our community of nations. It is no surprise to my country that the international community should attach such great importance to the development and codification of the law of the sea. This is indeed a welcome development.\n102.\tThe Caracas session and indeed its predecessors was significant in more than one way. First, it had representation from all sectors of the international community. In this connexion, it broke with past traditions. Secondly, for the first time the Conference has a comprehensive agenda. We were happy to note that most, if not all, interests were reflected in it.\n103.\tMy country is land-locked. And while we appreciate the rationale for devising a law which will create order and promote a rational management and exploitation of the resources of the sea, my country, as a land-locked State, has specific interests to protect and promote. Hence our effective participation at the Caracas session and our intention to continue to do so at future sessions. It is vital to my country that the right of free access of land-locked States to and from the sea should be recognized and enshrined in any future treaty on the law of the sea. Equally important is a guarantee in any such treaty of an unfettered transit of goods and persons of land-locked States.\n104.\tWe naturally attach great importance to the question of the common heritage of mankind. Therefore, it is important to us that the international seabed be a viable area, and not just a barren left-over. We also attach significance to the type of international sea-bed authority which will be created to govern the area. In our view, the authority should not only control and manage the area and its resources but should also have title to it. Consequently, the authority must be vested with full powers to function effectively as a trustee of mankind as a whole. Above all, we envisage an authority which would engage directly in exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed.\n105.\tI would like to affirm that my country supports the creation of economic zones by coastal States. However, it is the view of my country that regional land-locked States should participate on an equal basis with regional coastal States in the exploitation of the marine resources of such zones. Equally, the question of scientific research and the dissemination of the results of such research, in both the economic zone and the international sea-bed area, is important to my country.\n106.\tMy delegation would also urge that the interests of developing countries which produce land-based minerals similar to those found in the sea-bed areas be borne in mind. We look forward to promoting these interests at the next session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n107.\tDecolonization and self-determination are some of the major preoccupations of the Organization, as are racism and apartheid. For many important reasons our white minority-ruled neighbors continue to be our major preoccupation. For my country, the continued existence of colonial and white minority regimes in southern Africa is an everyday reality. One has only to recall the tracts of land on which we have settled several thousand refugees, or the explosions which have already spilled innocent African blood on our own soil, to understand the situation. Hardly a day goes by without our being affected in one way or the other.\n108.\tThe emergence of a new Government in Portugal several months ago brought to an end almost half a century of dictatorship in that country. The crumbling of that dictatorship should in real terms signal the crumbling of colonialism in Africa. My delegation is confident that all States Members of the United Nations will feel able to support this view. As for the third-world countries, there can be no doubt about their commitment to this cause.\n109.\tThe new Portuguese Government has already made known its preparedness to grant independence to Mozambique and to Angola. My delegation welcomes the cease-fire declaration of 7 September 1974 in Lusaka between Portugal and FRELIMO. The arrangements for the transfer of power from Portugal to the heroic people of Mozambique are, indeed, a fitting tribute to the valiant struggle for self-determination and independence waged by FRELIMO.\n110.\tWe hold in contempt the futile attempts by reactionary white settlers in Mozambique to seize control of that African country in total disregard of the constitutional rights of the people and in violation of the constitutional method for the transfer of power to the legitimate representatives of Mozambique. The responsibility of Portugal and of the international community to ensure the success of the transitional Government in Mozambique, so that the preparations are completed for full independence in June 1975, is now very obvious.\n111.\tThe reactionary element of the white settler community in Mozambique is inspired by the existence of minority-ruled States- in the neighboring areas. It is in the interest of Portugal and of the entire international community to liquidate the resistance of such communities wherever such resistance occurs. The total liberation and independence of Mozambique is a further contribution to peace and stability in the region and to peace and security in the continent. We commend the new Portuguese Government for recognizing the right of the people of Mozambique to independence. We salute the heroic people of Mozambique for this victory and in the same vein welcome the Government in Mozambique.\n112.\tIn any situation of colonialism where issues are unclear, where directions remain equivocal, and where negotiations remain meaningless, the liberation forces can have no alternative but to intensify the struggle. The right to independence is not negotiable, and, consequently, we reject the notion of referendum s. We consider that the freedom movements concerned express the wishes and sentiments of the people of these Territories, and that, in collaboration with these peoples, those' movements are capable of engaging in meaningful consultations to work out an acceptable method for the transfer of power. Therefore, we would like, while commending Portugal, to urge that efforts be intensified to speed up the total liberation of the State of Angola.\n113.\tThe African countries still feel committed to, and are prepared to honor, the Manifesto onJSouthern Africa, signed at Lusaka on 16 April 1969. However, this noble commitment continues to be conditional upon colonial and white minority regimes in southern Africa first accepting fully the principle of self-determination. We urge all of them to adjust to the new situation.\n114.\tWe all witnessed a very sad development on 30 July 1974, when 80 per cent of the white voters in Southern Rhodesia all in all numbering only around 83,000 in an African country with a population of close to 5 million voted Smith's regime back to power. My delegation finds that intolerable.\n115.\tInstead of negotiating in good faith with the African nationalists, the Smith regime has chosen to harass them while consolidating itself. It can thus be seen why the African people in Southern Rhodesia would vow to dislodge this regime by all means avail-able. We urge the international community to intensify its efforts towards a just solution to the Rhodesian problem.\n116.\tThere is no doubt that the United Kingdom has an outstanding responsibility in Rhodesia, and we agree with those who have said that there can be no satisfactory settlement without the agreement of the African people in Southern Rhodesia. We hope that the United Kingdom will intensify its search for a solution of this problem. My country continues to make sacrifices, economically as well as otherwise, in an effort to assist and join with those who seek a lasting solution to this problem. In our view, the search for a solution should take into account the importance of the participation of the recognized leaders of the African people in Rhodesia. A concerted effort should be made to eliminate foreign elements in Rhodesia which could make the white minority regime even more intransigent. The international community should call on those among us who are in a better position to do so to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Smith regime.\n117.\tAs with Southern Rhodesia, the situation in Namibia shows no sign of meaningful change. While, because of our geographical position in southern Africa and our long border with South Africa, the functional relationship between my country and South Africa has not changed in any way, we continue to disapprove very strongly of South Africa's racial policies. And in this connexion, we regret that such policies are being extended to Namibia, a Trust Territory of the United Nations. Namibians are our neighbors and brothers. We have always recognized the legitimacy of their struggle for freedom and independence. My country continues to support General Assembly resolution 2145 (XXI) of 27 October 1966, the effect of which was to transfer the administration of Namibia to the United Nations. My Government abides by the most recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice with respect to that Territory.1 Consequently, my country deplores the present situation, as well as the continued suppression of liberties by South Africa in that Territory.\n118.\tMy delegation believes that there can be no future for white minority regimes in Africa. However, the choice of whether democracy and equality will come peacefully or through a violent struggle clearly rests with those regimes. The ultimate objective of liberation itself will never be compromised. Adjustment now could avoid a situation which threatens peace and stability in the region. Since its independence, my country has, with little effect, made its own efforts to influence those concerned to refrain from intensifying racial policies and to work for the bringing about of change, in recognition of the rights of black people in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa.\n119.\tWe have called increasingly upon the inter-national community to pay attention to white-ruled southern Africa and the suffering of the black populations there as a result of their being denied freedom, self-determination and equality. We continue to deplore the rigorous oppression and suppression of liberties in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. We renew our appeal to the international community to strengthen its efforts to influence events in the region. In this connexion, it is our hope that all nations of the world, particularly the western countries, will demonstrate in word and in deed their total abhorrence and rejection of the institutionalized system of racism and apartheid. As for ourselves, there can be no other way.\n120.\tWe have been invited to engage in a constructive debate during the current session. Indeed, proposals have already been placed before us for our consideration. My delegation will respond positively to this when we come to consider the resolutions and decisions which we shall make and adopt at a later stage. Allow me, therefore, to conclude by conveying to the Organization, and through it to the delegations of Member States represented here, as well as to our brothers in the freedom movement, the greetings of the people of Botswana. Our foreign missions and embassies are very few in number. But we have friends in all continents. It remains our ardent desire to have more friends. Our membership of the Organization is in itself a source of strength. We take comfort in the knowledge that our problems are also the problems of our friends.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all in addressing this Assembly I should like to express the sorrow of the people and Government of Guatemala at the tragedy which at this time has thrown the Republic of Honduras into mourning and, with that Government, the entire family of Central American Nations. The devastating storm which raged through the Caribbean Sea has caused tremendous material losses in various countries of Central America and has strewn death and desolation in that sister country, to which we are bound by very close historic ties and a common destiny. These relations cause us to feel in our own flesh the sorrow that has afflicted the people of Honduras. I should like from this rostrum of the United Nations to convey the feelings of brotherly solidarity on behalf of the people and Government of Guatemala to our neighbors in Honduras at this tremendous catastrophe that has struck them, and may our voice be joined With those of other countries which, from this same rostrum, have appealed for international co-operation to assist the people of Honduras to overcome the serious emergency which it is confronting today.\n167.\tI am not going to convey to the President, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika one more congratulation on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I shall pay him a sincere tribute of admiration and respect for his great talent, his brilliant qualities as a statesman and the very valuable contribution which both he and the members of his delegation have always made to the achievement of the purposes and principles of the world Organization. I should rather congratulate the General Assembly for the wise decision that it took in choosing him as President for such an important and delicate task, a choice which I am sure will be the guarantee of the success of our deliberations at the current session..To that end, I offer the loyal and resolute collaboration of the delegation of Guatemala.\n168.\tIn coming before this Assembly, Guatemala repeats once again its unswerving faith in the effectiveness of the efforts we are making to maintain throughout the world a peace founded on justice and the attempts to attain and guarantee the maximum of well-being for all of mankind.\n169.\tThis faith that the peoples of the world have placed in the world Organization is the reason why, year after year, the number of its members grows, and as of this session we are gratified to count in our midst Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. My delegation extends a warm word of welcome to these new Member States.\n170.\tThe course of events and the evolution of world politics in recent times lead us to cherish well- founded hopes that, day by day, the relaxation of tension will become more marked, which will enable States to resolve their fundamental problems through friendly dialog and conciliatory negotiation and to avoid explosive confrontations and an escalation of violence which feeds on nationalistic passions. We hope that it will put an end to acts which today strew terror and death in various regions of the world.\n171.\tThe international law of the United Nations, which enshrines the fundamental principles of the equality of States, non-intervention, self-determination, respect for the territorial integrity of States, good faith in the discharge of contractual obligations, the prohibition of recourse to the threat or use of armed force or aggression against another State for the settlement of international disputes, respect and protection for the rights and fundamental freedoms of the human person these will be the unswerving laws followed by the new Government of Guatemala over which General Kjell Eugenio Laugerud Garcia is now presiding and whom I represent today in this Assembly .\n172.\tMy Government, concerned to bring about effective, social justice, has undertaken specific programs aimed at raising the standard of living of the people of Guatemala, and is devoting what resources are available to improving the levels of living of the less fortunate classes and to attempting to find a solution to their vital requirements, despite the difficult circumstances obtaining in the national economy as a result of growing inflation and the energy crisis which today is affecting most of the countries of the world. Nevertheless, we are determined to fulfill, in so far as possible, the legal and moral undertakings to which we are committed in accordance with the norms prevailing in the international community today.\n173.\tFor this purpose, we require from countries the understanding, solidarity and co-operation which have so often been mentioned as imperatives for the present community of nations if it is to attain a just world order, since the circumstances of contemporary living throughout the world impose a closer and more equitable relationship among States. To this end it is essential to undertake an in-depth revision of the economic models prevailing in relations among States. In Latin America; 'particularly, the joint action of the countries of the region is aimed at a just channeling of their trade relations with highly industrialized nations, strengthening the inalienable right of developing nations to have access to suitable technology and to adopt a policy of defense of the basic export commodities of a great number of American States, such as coffee, sugar, cotton, beef and bananas among others.\n174.\tThe United Nations, through its competent bodies, is called upon to play a most important role in this field at the world level. A priority task for the developing countries is to ensure a just and equitable relationship between the prices of raw materials and of manufactured goods exported by our nations and the prices of the products they import from the industrialized nations. We must also counteract the trend towards the stagnation or reduction of the real prices of basic commodities; we must promote the production of primary materials in the under-developed countries that produce those commodities and agree on the inclusion of those countries in a system of trade preferences in accordance with their degree of economic development.\n175.\tThe problems of food shortages as well as of shortages in raw materials, inputs and services which most severely affect developing nations are an indication that, despite the exhausting efforts made by the peoples of these countries, a greater spirit of co-operation and understanding will be needed on the part of the others who enjoy more favorable conditions, especially as regards an appropriate treatment of international trade relations, the timely and inexpensive supply of the goods that contribute to the stability of the economy and the broader availability of technological and scientific advances.\n176.\tThis decision, it must be understood, is based on ethical and just principles which in no way may be interpreted as a condition of adherence to political blocs of any type. Our adherence to democratic principles is inherent in our national character and will in no way depend on the granting of preferences or on external conditions.\n177.\tWe are convinced that, regardless of political, economic and social differences among them, the States have the duty to co-operate among themselves to obtain mutual benefit from their economic relations in order to attain the objectives of their national development.\n178.\tWithin this spirit of understanding, of tolerance and of universal bonds an order of stable peace may be attained, which is the supreme aspiration of the United Nations. Such basic principles of international coexistence are contained in the Draft Charter on the Economic Rights and Duties of States which is to be considered during this session of the General Assembly and which is destined to become one of the basic documents in the future international legal order. Among its most important provisions we must emphasize those regarding the promotion of collective economic security and the economic development of States and, with regard to the latter, those providing for general disarmament and the utilization of the resources thus released for application to the needs of developing countries. Equally important are the provisions giving each State sovereignty over the wealth and natural resources within its land and maritime jurisdiction.\n179.\tFurthermore, the United Nations has given capital importance to protecting the environment, sponsoring to that end various meetings and the establishment of an organization to deal with this question. We consider that environmental policies must be adopted in accordance with the needs of economic growth in order to safeguard health and the possibilities of improving the standards of living of the peoples and to provide that competent national bodies in the various countries share their knowledge, experience and documentation.\n180.\tGuatemala participated with the utmost interest in the World Population Conference which was recently held in Bucharest, as well as in the preparatory activities which have been undertaken at the regional level, with the awareness that the problem is a justifiable concern for mankind. It defended as fundamental premises the principles of respect for the dignity and freedom of man and respect for the sovereign decision of each State on the basis of its particular circumstances. That is why, in general terms, we have given our approval to the world plan prepared at that conference, since it included recommendations which coincide with the policy my country follows, which is aimed at improving the quality of life of its inhabitants, at economic and social development and at affirming the independence of peoples.\n181.\tIn celebrating the first year of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, as undoubtedly will be noted in the report* requested from the Economic and Social Council by the Assembly, in resolution 3057 (XXVIII), sincere interest has been noted, if not absolute adherence to this campaign. All States have expressed their willingness to co-operate in the implementation of the Program prepared in 1973 and annexed to the resolution; the directives of which may be a guide for more effective action, since the vigilant attention given has emphasized some grave and dramatic events, vestiges of discrimination or results of dislocation in the social integration of some regions of the world, to which the influence of the United Nations must be extended. The mixture of races, the biological value of which is also found in the social environment, has been a natural catalyst, but, even where there is no racial discrimination properly speaking, there is need for a greater integration of sectors of the population; with lower economic and cultural resources, in regard to which timely assistance could promote higher levels of living and better living conditions. Accordingly the Government of Guatemala supports all measures adopted by the Organization against discrimination of all kinds and at this time expresses its satisfaction at the fact that the United Nations has opportunely proclaimed the year 1975 to be International Women's Year [resolution 3010 (XXVII)].\n182.\tIn connexion with the proclamation of the International Women's Year, during which the merits of women will be extolled, and as a consequence of which the path to full equality will be opening up to women, I am happy to say that my country, in this regard, has encouraged the greatest possible participation of women in political, professional, educational and working life. It is thus that more than 50 per cent of the posts in the public health and education sectors are occupied by women, and there is no legal discrimination whatsoever with regard- to their electoral and civic rights or their right to free access to culture. In the educational system we see an ever-increasing number of girls and women attending school, with the result that the illiteracy rate among them is falling. However, we recognize that there are still centuries-old limitations which interfere with the social equality of women, but we trust that legislation and the action we have taken will open the way to an ever-increasing degree of development and that these national efforts will be considerably increased by the promotion of support which the United Nations may provide.\n183.\tSince we are interested in recognizing the personalities who through philanthropy and their actions have contributed to establishing suitable living conditions for man, we consider the United Nations as a proper forum to pay a tribute to Fray Buiivume de Las Casas, since five centuries after his birth his thoughts are still with us, among them one of the great aspirations of this Organization, the protection and defense of the essential rights of man, to which the illustrious bishop of Chiapas and Verapaz in the former captaincy general of Guatemala devoted his most noble endeavors as a true pioneer of the declarations of human rights we have today.\n184.\tAs is well known by the States represented in this Assembly, the position of Guatemala has always been in solidarity with that of the countries of Latin America and other continents in the struggle to attain the liberation of all peoples under the yoke of colonial regimes and particularly to eliminate that system from American territory. There are numerous proofs of this attitude in the records of various committees of the General Assembly, particularly the Fourth Committee, as well as of the plenary meetings of the Assembly.\n185.\tIn the same spirit, Guatemala took part in the work of the group of countries that drafted the supremely important resolution 1514 (XV) of the General Assembly, which included a paragraph stating that \\\"any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations\\\".\n186.\tWith that single reservation, which excludes the secession of territories from its scope, Guatemala continues to maintain its anti-colonialist position unwaveringly and its firm adherence to the principle of the self-determination of peoples. In that spirit it will support every Assembly resolution aimed at freeing peoples that are still under colonial oppression.\n187.\tThe obsolete, anachronistic system of colonialism still persists in the Americas and in some enclaves occupied by Powers from outside Latin America, despite the fact that sovereignty over them legally belongs to American States. Such is the case of the Guatemalan Territory of Belize, the restitution of which by the United Kingdom has been demanded by my country for more than a century. This claim has been maintained uninterruptedly, based as it is on unimpeachable legal principles and all kinds of efforts have been made, within the canons of international law, to find a solution. In the last 10 years new roads have been zealously explored, and numerous formulas have been tried in an effort to reconcile the just claims of the Guatemalan nation, as well as its legitimate rights over the territory which was taken from it, with the most honorable aspirations of the people of Belize, who also are interested in freeing themselves from colonial domination, and to whom my Government reiterates its feelings of sincere friendship and of respect for their local traditions and institutions.\n188.\tWe trust that the dialog will continue between the parties to this century-long dispute, with no efforts spared that might lead to a solution which would satisfactorily reconcile Guatemala's territorial rights with those of the people of Belize. In the meantime, until there is such an understanding that will permanently ensure the peace of the region, Guatemala once again expresses its definite reservation with regard to its sovereign right over the Territory of Belize, at present occupied by the United Kingdom.\n189.\tIn its traditional spirit of international brother-hood and solidarity, Guatemala views with satisfaction the possibilities of attaining greater harmony and understanding among the countries of the Central American region and of speeding up the process of integration of the countries of the regional common market, an essential factor for its development. All efforts aimed at attaining these objectives will have our entire sympathy and support.\n190.\tIn concluding the statement, I should like to express my Government's hope that the deliberations of the Assembly, with the goodwill and mutual understanding of the States here represented, will lead to the solutions so urgently required for world peace and to meet the serious economic and other problems confronting our peoples today, and for the achievement of the aspirations to freedom, security and well-being of all the inhabitants of the earth.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, all of us assembled here have worked, negotiated or chatted with you at one time or another. We know that you are the outcome of prowess in war and peace in a country which is almost a latter-day Sparta. Algeria made history and made men. Guided and inspired by the genius of your people, you have cultivated over the years a talent for getting over the many hurdles you had to leap while operating at home in Algeria, in the OAU, in the League of Arab States, in the group of non-aligned States, and, indeed, in the councils of the Organization. What more could we ask of one who will preside over a session fraught with hope and risk, a session gathering together world leaders, bewildered by an era most certainly in the grip of a value-shift.\n179.\tThis is not just another session. Several memorable dates, many political episodes, and numerous battles have been called epoch-making or turning- points in history. A case in point is 1848, which was marked by the discovery of internal combustion, and 1815, which was marked by Waterloo, The mid-1970s will be looked upon as one such period. The decade between now and 1985 is bound to be a watershed in the long march of man, a decade of shifts and changes: shifts in the centers of economic power; changes in the chemistry of international politics -the crumbling of old colonial empires and the retraction of imperial outposts. For this reason it will be the decade in which the gravest decisions man has ever been required to make will be made. Man must make these decisions as a unit and not as individual centers for, after all, one center's decision ultimately affects all. And it is here that many of those decisions will be initiated or formulated. The Assembly is the only instrument, and with all its inadequacies the United Nations is our anchor.\n180.\tThe gravest of all these decisions is this: will the rich and the poor work out the new economic order we decided upon last spring? Some of us are frustrated indeed, alarmed because very little has been done to further those proposals. There is a redeeming feature, however. The many sicknesses plaguing the world have been noted and pointed out by a world press awakened to responsibility. There was a conscious effort by intelligent, educated young men who have dared hunger and disease, in camps and tents, in drought-stricken regions of Africa, exposing the cynicism of some and showing the world what it is like to live in despair. Thanks to them we have had an abundance of books, broadcasts, brochures, seminars, symposia and conferences. The world is better informed and no longer blind to the need for proceeding with the decisions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly. But it remains for this Assembly to take stock of these ideas. Leaders of eminence are now in the thick of the battle to save a world adrift, and adrift it is. Let us help them.\n181.\tThe facts and figures are there. I realize that our heads are buzzing with figures and that they need not be disturbed further. A few figures, however, must be urgently considered to indicate the magnitude of the problem we face.\n182.\tThe ILO tells us that in 1970 2,542 million persons lived in the developing world, while 1,090 million lived in the industrialized world. In less than 30 years from now, twice as much food, water, power and jobs will be needed if present standards are to be kept. By then the labor force in the world will have increased by 30 per cent. There will be 457 million newcomers between now and 1985. The share of the rich countries from this influx will be a mere 10 per cent; that of the poor is staggering: 289 million new hands in Asia, 55 million in Africa, and 42 million in Latin America. This is the magnitude of the crisis that is shaking the world, and whose greatest impact is falling on the hard core of the developing countries.\n183.\tThe deliberations of the sixth special session of the General Assembly last April have identified the new opportunities as well as the new dangers that surround the world economy. And though the outcome was not entirely satisfactory, it is none the less conducive to optimism. If nothing else, we have examined and brought to a fruitful end ways and means of employing international machinery for bringing about a rapid transformation of the world economic system so that economic domination would yield to economic co-operation and confrontation in matters of trade, finance and technology would yield to negotiation and conciliation.\n184.\tA much greater sense of interdependence has emerged. A healthy sign of balanced progress is already taking shape. Yet a range of adverse factors still persists. Negative symptoms tend to overshadow our efforts to create an atmosphere of goodwill and confidence, and many they are. To mention only a few: there are inadequacies in the flow of finance that hamper the emergence of a mutually advantageous international division of labor; rigidities in trade patterns that generate instability in currency markets; inadequacy in the rate of growth in the export earnings of the developing nations that impair their capacity to service accumulated debts.\n185.\tObviously, international adjustment will be impeded and rendered more costly so long as the policies pursued by some of us are mutually inconsistent. For a properly functioning adjustment process, we require a minimum of conflict among national and international objectives. We require a high degree of awareness of the notion of economic solidarity. More than that, we require in this decade of change and shifts a will to accept the idea of change itself -change of roles and change of rights and duties. That is a necessary prerequisite for mutual confidence.\n186.\tStatements we have been hearing of late reveal a lack of will to accept change and a tendency to fly in the face of reality. The oil crisis hit everybody bang in the face. It exploded old myths. But instead of facing the new reality with objectivity and reason we decided to obliterate the picture. We have practically been told that it was all milk and honey till the oil crisis dominated the scene. Nothing is further from the truth.\n<m\n187.\tThe operation of inflationary trends in the Western economy started long before the increase in oil prices. For years the rich industrial countries, particularly the erstwhile colonial Powers, have been balancing their budgets at home while exporting inflation to others, building welfare societies at home while perpetuating pauperism elsewhere, engaging in willful waste at home while prolonging woeful want in the poor countries of the world. And to the pleas of those who suffered most, there was lip service some-times and cold economic justification often- if only to make the soul of John Meynard Keynes rest in peace.\n188.\tThe world economic system is dislocated today because the rules of the game have changed. The new facts are to be understood. Some of us cannot go on living with colonial and neo-colonial hangovers. When Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the devaluation bill, the first in the United States, his Director of the Budget cried, \\\"This is the end of Western civilization\\\". That was in 1935. Since that date many things have happened. The mighty economic horse on which some of us had been riding is no longer that mighty. Nor do its riders want to agree to dismount with grace. The fireworks we have been seeing in the past few weeks in Detroit and Washington, and indeed in the Assembly, are but evidence of that attitude in the face of those statements one cannot be asking, are we honestly ready to accept the new economic realities of the day, or do we wish instead, as I said, to fly in the face of those realities through willful distortion? Do we really mean to engage in a sincere dialogu or do we still think that we can change the world through Olympian declarations and veiled threats? Do we seriously wish to undertake an objective appraisal of the situation, or do we seek an alibi in the guise of such an appraisal?\n189.\tThe facts of the situation are not what those statements and declarations purported them to be. The record of the last two decades is a record of frustrated hopes and broken promises: the inconclusive first, second and third sessions of UNCTAD; the unaccomplished target of 1 per cent of the gross national product in aid to development; the un-replenished funds of the International Development Association; the empty coffers of UNDP; and the empty silos of the World Food Program. The millions of dear souls that we lost in the Niger, in Ethiopia and in Bihar could have been saved if the \\\"haves\\\" had been more responsive- and, indeed, more responsible.\n190.\tWe understand that those established rich countries have their problems. We understand the impediments in the way of a change of heart and attitude. One of the most stubborn impediments and we have said this time and time again -is the multi-national corporation, the major culprit in the world economic crisis. That is not wild talk, nor is it un-substantiated accusation. By the end of 1971, $268,000 million of short-term liquid assets were held by private institutions on the international financial scene. These institutions were mainly American banks and multinational corporations. That sum represented more than twice the total of all the international reserves held by all the central banks and international monetary institutions in the world at that date. Those huge sums are called legitimate profits. To us in the third world they are unearned increments. One cannot help but feel sorry for the many Governments of the rich, tossed hither and thither by those who sustain them or mislead them: multinational corporations and groups of producers and consumers. Just think of the way in which Governments have been exposed by an intelligent world press over the past few years. More disquieting still is the way ideals and codes of behavior that we conceived here have been mocked or dismissed out of hand as unrealistic fantasies of radicals. The new voices and forces will eventually prevail, as they must, as they have always done in the darker times of the past. But here again we have to move fast, for the world cannot wait any longer for the soldiers of justice and sanity to conquer the iron gates of greed and for the advocates of a return to codes of morality in public and international affairs to find their way.\n191.\tThe crisis cannot be solved by mutual recrimination nor by the apportionment of blame. We know that. The solution requires reconciling ourselves to the new realities; it requires the establishment of a modicum of mutual confidence between the rich and the poor; it requires our joining hands in a concordant effort to create a better world. And to that end, again we should move fast. The Assembly should move fast. The rich industrialized countries should move fast. The oil-producing countries should move fast. We all have a stake in acting with alacrity. The Secretary- General rose to the occasion and created the machinery to convert the ideas expressed then into action, both for aid and for trade. How much help that machinery received from those who hold the keys of the kingdom conceived by us all I would hot like to say.\n192.\tAs I speak here, 25 million poor are facing death in Africa alone. For them it is either now or never. And, equally foreboding, is it not likely that the poor of the world will rise in revolt and ruin whatever resources they happen to possess in their lands? Are these resources not geared to benefit others under their very noses? And in the same vein, why preclude another sinister possibility? Did not some catastrophe- bound minds interpret the sixth special session as a ganging up by the poor against the rich? Did not some \\\"superior minds\\\", in Washington primarily, plan counter-offensives? I assure you that there are rumblings among the not-so-very-poor. Some leading economists are asking questions that should jolt the established rich into action. One repeatedly hears of the inability of the industrialized rich to curb inflation or manage the vagaries of currency. The suggestion is to establish the Arab dinar as a new economic basis. The idea is not to dislocate money matters further but to earn money that can be managed. Other moneys are managed by others. If that is not ganging up, what is it? And who is to blame for the fissure in the world community?\n193.\tAs I said earlier, there are few signs of awareness of some aspects of the problem. The World Food Conference to be held in Rome is certainly a sign in that direction. Many men and women are beginning to awaken to the perils ahead. The Sudan pledges here and now its support for the Conference. A large team of our experts on meat, grain, fish and related resources has for some time now been preparing itself assiduously for that Conference. We feel that our contribution must reflect both our potential and our will- for our sake, and the world's sake. In co-operation with some of our many friends, we have taken a few steps, but we realize that the road is long and that the more co-operation we get the more quickly we can help.\n194.\tWhat we know of population growth and food shortage leaves us little time to maintain even the miserable standards of today. As I said from this rostrum last spring at the sixth special session [2219th meeting], the world food crisis is an artificial one. Perhaps the Sudan is one of the most striking examples to prove this. Its enormous untapped potential can substantially contribute to the alleviation of the world shortage if the necessary requirements are met. The Sudan is endowed with an abundance of water and 50 million hectares of land suitable for agricultural and livestock production. By contrast the population is only 18 million. The conditions for much faster agricultural development are inherent in this endowment of ample agricultural land free from the pressures of population. A necessary condition for harnessing this potential is the availability of adequate and concessionary financial and technological aid and particularly the intensification of investment in the agricultural sector.\n195.\tWe are discussing development and conditions for creating a better world economic order. But development and progress are not isolated concepts. We need peace and tranquility to develop and to progress. Let us now ponder a little the conditions required to make effective the ever-increasing voice of sense and sensibility -the voice calling for peace, I mean. Every time we think one hot area of the world has cooled off, or is on the point of doing so, another area explodes. This has been the story of peace ever since that war to end wars ended in Versailles, sowing in its Peace Conference the seeds of wars to come.\n196.\tAn instance of this phenomenon is the predicament of Cyprus and the Middle East. Were the events that occurred in Cyprus really necessary, while the latter is trudging along a weary route to peace? I am not thinking of the few hundreds that descended on the island like thieves in the night. They could not have been anything but instruments of a design bigger than the biggest of them. I am not thinking of the other party, which went in on behalf of its kith and kin. It did that in a desperate effort to settle old scores. I am thinking of neither. I am thinking of the apparent waywardness of events. The great Powers sat watching the outcome, and the United Nations, hamstrung by obsolete limitations of the Charter, could neither foresee the oncoming gale, nor do much about it when it was on. This is what I call the waywardness of events. Nobody seems to be in control.\n197.\tFor what it is worth, the Sudan would like to be explicit on the subject of Cyprus. First, the Cyprus question should be isolated from other entanglements. Land and sea frontiers, disputed areas and other problems have to wait, I hope not long, for a fair solution of the current crisis. A fair solution in out view would put the island on its feet; there could be minor rectifications, of course, but there must be a return to the sensitive balance so well guarded by Archbishop Makarios and his Turkish colleagues in the administration that ought to be restored even in its personnel, if that is acceptable to the Cypriots. One hopes it will be. The Cypriots will be giving a lesson to the world: force cannot be allowed as a means of making and breaking Governments.\n198.\tIt is a lesson relevant in the area. Israel, built and maintained by fire and sword, has thrown the area into a cauldron that often blazes and simmers all the time, working itself up to an explosion. I am afraid such a situation is prevalent in the area at the moment. The talk of war is everywhere, the smell of war is everywhere, and again the world is merely watching. Our indefatigable Secretary-General has been in and out of the area several times after the initial talks in Geneva but his clarion calls to hurry up to Geneva are drowned by the din and clash of arms pouring into the area and the bellicose pronouncements polluting the climate of peace that was worked out by protracted agony.\n199.\tWhen I spoke here at the twenty-eighth session [2142nd meeting], I saw a glimmer of hope in the younger men at the helm in Israel, who were mostly born in Palestine, and who have their hearts in the right place regarding the Arabs. But alas! These young men must be under some constraint. The talk is the same. It has not yet dawned on them that there is no getting away from a Palestinian State, that the world including the United States of America is getting weary of a seemingly endless wrangle. The freedom fighters, in and outside Israel, have won the right to speak on behalf of all Palestinians. This right was not granted them; they earned their way to it by sweat, and shall do the same as regards Geneva.\n200.\tThe angry blasting of southern Lebanon and the carrying on with creating facts in Jerusalem and Sharm-el-Sheikh cannot undo what the sequence of events since 1967, culminating in the October war, has done. Like the older persons that gathered in Israel from the four corners of the earth, the younger ones count on the supposed rift between the Arabs. One day it is Sadat versus Arafat, another day it is Arafat and Habash, a third day it is Hussein and the fedayeen. It is true that points of view are not identical; how could they be in a situation that has been building up over generations? What is true and incontestable is that the goal is one: to retrieve their home. There is no quarrel over matters of principle; there is dialog about matters of detail. If the Israeli illusion were right, Palestinian leaders would not have been here among us. Palestinians are no longer an appendage to a crisis. They are the nub of that crisis. And so said the world. They are here to tell their tale of woe and valor. They are nobody's wards now.\n201.\tThe role of the super-Powers is greater than that of any of us. And here is where detente comes in. If detente means peace for all, and not peace among the mighty, there is need for quick action in the Middle East. The traffic between Moscow and the Arab capitals is heavy; so is the traffic between those capitals and Washington. Nobody except the participants knows what goes on. The little that percolates to the press, however, leads one to feel that a cold war of sorts is now on. One often is led to think that detente seems to do with short-term trading of grain for vodka. How else shall we explain the fivefold increase in United States aid to Israel after the October war, at a time when all Israel's losses in that war had been replaced. The jittery atmosphere pervading the area is justified. The big Powers that take it upon themselves to handle the problem by themselves have to prove that they are doing it. Perhaps they are, but how do we know? What we know for certain is not reassuring. Israel's defense expenditure accounts for twice as much as its gross national product a year ago. Firebrand generals, who retired or were retired after the war, are back in the service. The fiscal aid in the coming year will rise from $50 million to $250 million. The Jewish lobby is fuming and thundering -indeed, it is challenging) a Secretary of State the like of whom the United States has rarely had, a man who fits the times. The head of the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee could not have been more arrogant when he threatened: . . I am not going to sound the fire bell yet, but when I do you will hear it\\\". One wonders whether Americans have not grown weary of this kind of talk and behavior. It is not prudent to say that the American citizen is taken too much for granted by such organizations and institutions, but it is too obvious a fact not to face up to.\n202.\tThis session must help. What is to be done is not that complicated. First, let us impress on Israel that it must refrain from acts likely to lead to another war. We have had four major ones and several minor ones. None of them brought the much cherished security to Israel. Geneva, if we ever get there, might do it. Secondly, let us urge the permanent members of the Security Council not to abdicate their right to know and help to the extent they see fit. They have a responsibility, and they have a stake.\n203.\tAnother area of the world should teach Israel a lesson. Salazar and' Caetano lived ancient fantasies similar to those of Israel, but five centuries after their beginning, these fantasies- turned to ashes. At the OAU, the Sudan had occasion to say many kind words about the new men in Portugal battling against impossible odds. We warned of settlers in Portuguese territories going the way of Ian Smith and his friends. J wish to maintain the sentiments we expressed in Mogadishu. We have all the more reason to do so because of our admiration for those who had the courage to subdue the insurgents instantly by force of arms. The new men have earned our respect, and Africa hopes nothing will interfere with their plans and endeavors. We are not ashamed to say that the hand held out by Portugal must be taken with sincerity. The Sudan sees more than the proffering of a hand in what has already been achieved. Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau have regained their independence, and the infighting in Angola cannot go on much longer. The way things are shaping up, a powerful State composed of Mozambique, Zambia and Angola might emerge in the years to come and deliver areas around them from an alien rule rejected by the majority of mankind.\n204.\tWhat is happening in southern Africa today is bestial; it is provocative; it is an ever-present incitement to Africa. As a philosophy, it is a challenge to the very basis of African independence. The world did not fail to express its detestation. But in the face of global reprobation there was only crass defiance by South Africa and Rhodesia. South Africa had its reasons; Rhodesia had its reasons.\n205.\tThe United Nations sought to induce change through measures provided for in the Charter: sanctions. But the effectiveness of those measures was diluted, and the act itself was reduced to a mere political gesture. Sanctions are conceived to be forged into a viable instrument of collective action short of force. But that action was frustrated; it is frustrated. And who is to blame? The very monitors of international order, the very champions of human rights. Recent events in southern Africa are leading Africans to ask a number of questions which bear upon the formulation of western countries' policies towards southern Africa: the extension of their defense network to protect what they have come to perceive as their global system of interests and the belief that they have political, economic and strategic interests in the southern African subcontinent which should be defended at any cost. These now appears to be a clear commitment by NATO planners to work for the military defense of the southern African region. That crucial step carries NATO towards a de facto military alliance with the white settler regimes in southern Africa.\n206.\tWe do not question any country's right to perceive its own interests in its own light. What we ask those countries, however, is if it is in their interest to isolate themselves on the side of anachronistic regimes. Are they not really wearing blinkers as they look at realities in southern Africa? Are they not missing the whole lesson of 25 April in Portugal? The lessons of the last two decades go to prove that no single country or bloc of countries has mastery over historical changes. Those who thought otherwise have been proven wrong in Algeria; they have been proven wrong in Viet Nam; they have been proven wrong in Mozambique. And they will be proven wrong in southern Africa, and no less so in the northern part of the continent, where the question of so-called Spanish Sahara still awaits resolution in a manner consistent with the interests of the peoples of the region as well as with the provisions of the United Nations Chatter and the successive resolutions on decolonization.\n207.\tThe Powers with special privileges in the Security Council must realize that there is a responsibility correlated to that privilege. The cynicism of Paris, the callousness of Washington and the vacillations of London are deplored by the whole of Africa, and they are deplored because of their short-sightedness.\n208.\tIn an over-all assessment of global security we must guard against making partial references to realities with which the international community must come to grips in order to ensure better prospects of a strengthened world order. Attention given to one set of facts which reflect incipient conflict must not mean relative neglect of another set of facts with a similar conflict potential. In a world made more precarious by the existence of nuclear weapons, it is wise to stress the need for international peace, the need for global peace. That need is certainly more apparent to those who have much to keep than it is to those who have little to lose. Destitute Africans in the shanty towns of Johannesburg or Bulawayo feel themselves somewhat closer to death because of the deprivation and the cruelty of the white settlers' regimes, rather than because of nuclear conflagration. What we have in southern Africa today is despair so deep among Africans, and resentment so passionate against racial oppression, that normal fears are ceasing to exercise their expected restraint on governments and people alike. Mr. Kissinger has told us that if the underlying causes of conflict are permitted to fester unattended until the parties believe that their only recourse is war, then we cannot guarantee that it will not explode beyond control [2238th meeting, para. 46].\n209.\tThe colonial and racial war will continue in that part of the world, however many new intimidating weapons and alliances the settlers' regimes acquire. The question confronting us, therefore, is whether we will permit the spread of violence until the whites and blacks, the dominant and the dominated, are engulfed in mutual annihilation.\n210.\tThose are the challenges of the coming decade, the decade of shifts and changes. To face those challenges we need a contrivance of human wisdom rather than insane reactions arising from comfortless frustration. We need to accept with grace the reality of change. Facts do not cease to exist because we decide to ignore them. We need to recognize that the wealth of the world is big enough for everybody. The world will not endure half rich and half poor. We need to persuade our neo-Romans that vaulting greed will end by overlapping itself to fall on the other side.\n211.\tWe need to prove Nietzsche wrong. To him, \\\"The world is beautiful but has a disease called man\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues who have extended to you their warm congratulations on the occasion of your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your qualities of statesmanship will actively contribute to the success of the tasks of the session and the achievement of additional important goals. These same qualities were those of your predecessor and have earned him our deep appreciation and gratitude.\n267.\tI also take pleasure in acknowledging the sincere and continuous efforts of the Secretary General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in the course of fulfilling his duties and responsibilities and with the aim of consolidating the Organization.\n268.\tThe wide range of items on the agenda of this session represents to us, a people of the third world, a good step in the right direction as well as a very important stage in the strengthening of the ability of the United Nations to discharge its basic responsibilities.\n269.\tI note with optimism and appreciation the special attention that is being paid to industrial and agricultural development, particularly the efforts aiming at the establishment of funds for development, population settlement, health childcare and nutrition. I also note the role of the specialized agencies in offering expert assistance to the developing countries. The deplorable situation of millions of persons who suffer from poverty, disease and ignorance at a time of great scientific achievements by mankind not only is a cause for sorrow and shame but in itself constitutes a cause for doubting the morality of our civilization and the truth of its human values. We are therefore called upon to treat the inhuman situation of these millions by eradicating its root causes. This can be done through the establishment of a new world order of economic development that will provide to every developing country the kind of financial and technological assistance it needs. To this end we should work towards the creation of a favorable international climate devoid of tension; towards arresting the tidal wave of armament acquisition which has spread to small countries; towards confronting all forms of aggression with courage and determination; and towards re-channeling the huge sums of money that the powerful countries are expending on destructive weapons, in order to meet the needs of construction and development in those countries that lag behind as a result of subjugation by imperialistic and exploiting Powers.\n270.\tThe State of Qatar, firm in its belief that international cooperation constitutes the sound basis for all human progress is, in addition to its interest in building up its own strength, doing its utmost to contribute, in cooperation with its sister Arab nations, to the realization of a comprehensive regional and Arab development plan. It is, further, anxious to participate in a number of development activities in Africa and Asia and in the world at large. I shall refrain from giving the details of these efforts, but I earnestly believe that they are in the direction that we all seek and support.\n271.\tMy country, always welcoming every step towards international understanding, hopes that this understanding will spread to encompass the entire world community. We further believe that the achievement of the goal of international understanding and amity is contingent upon the peaceful and just solution of international problems within the framework of the Charter and the resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations. It seems natural, while talking of just solutions, to refer to the resolutions and recommendations of the Organization aimed at halting the chronic state of war that has existed for over a quarter of a century and that is . commonly known as the Middle East crisis, I especially note the earnest efforts that are being made at present with the aim of implementing Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 339 (1973). These efforts have kindled great hopes of arriving at a just and honorable settlement of the crisis. \n272.\tIn this context it is important for me to reaffirm a basic fact that faces all efforts made previously and being made at present to resolve the Middle East crisis. That fact is that the cause of the people and the land of Palestine lies at the root of the crisis; it is its origin as well as a continuous source of its exacerbation. Ignoring this fact has consistently led to the failure of international arrangements for the resolution of the crisis ever since the question of Palestine was first put before the General Assembly in 1947. Persistence in ignoring this fact will, quite naturally, not lead to new results. If the problem of the Palestinian people is still viewed as one of relief, employment and assimilation; if the land of the Palestinians is still viewed as an area of human agglomeration, with no borders and no existing structure; or if it is regarded as nothing more than a secure Israeli boundary liable to alteration and modification, then one must conclude that such an attitude is in conflict with the Charter of the United Nations and with its noble aims and purposes.\n273.\tTo disregard the natural desire of the Palestinian people for freedom and self determination in its own land, and to ignore its legitimate aspiration to the establishment of a national entity where it could bind up its wounds and cast off the burden of destitution that has weighed on its shoulders and its conscience for many years, would constitute open encouragement to the Israeli spirit of aggression. That spirit of aggression has attempted and continues to attempt to procure all of Palestine a Palestine without Palestinians and to thwart the struggle of the Palestinian people to regain its rights. The Israeli aggression has not contented itself with the collective and individual terrorism that it has practiced since its presence in the occupied land. It has indeed gone beyond that to haunt and pursue the Palestinian refugees everywhere. The daily strafing and bombardment of Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon is well known. I believe that the report of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East [A/9613 and Corr.l] includes details on the total destruction of the Nabatya camp in southern Lebanon as a result of an air raid.\n274.\tThe auspicious war of OctoberRamadan has left a deep imprint in so far as it served to acquaint the world with the realities of the Middle East crisis and to provide certain facts about the strength, condition and intentions of the parties concerned. In the light of these facts and for the purpose of averting a new and very powerful military conflict, it has become the duty of all, inside the Organization or outside it, to work actively and in a positive manner to ensure the implementation of the conditions of a just peace in the area. Such a just peace can be attained by implementing the Security Council resolutions and the recommendations of the General Assembly through ensuring the withdrawal of Israel from lands occupied in 1967 and through the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. This ought to be accomplished without any repetition of the bloody spectacle of the Syrian city of Quneitra. The blowing up by Israel of every house, mosque and church before its withdrawal from that city is a clear indication that the Israeli spirit of aggression views all international peacemaking efforts as undesirable pressure.\n275.\tI note with regret that a State Member of the United Nations has ignored the Special Committee formed by the Organization for the purpose of investigating Israeli practices in violation of human rights in the occupied territories. That Member State, further, has prevented the Special Committee from performing its role, thus acting in flagrant disdain of the resolutions of this Assembly. Everyone here knows that the abject violation of human rights in the occupied territories, in total disregard of elementary human, religious and moral principles, is the real reason why the Special Committee was prevented from carrying out its assigned tasks. If this indeed is the reason behind the Israeli position, scornful as it is of the United Nations, does it stand to reason that we should allow it to pass without curbing or punishing it?\n276.\tThe recent bloody and regrettable events in Cyprus have led to an increase in tension in the region of the Middle East and have added a huge and new international problem to those of the international community in general and those of the Mediterranean region in particular. It is our great hope that the parties concerned will appreciate that the implementation of United Nations resolutions aiming at the settlement of international conflicts is considered to be among the primary means for consolidating the authority of this Organization. Any weakening of this authority would be detrimental to the structure and prestige of an organization to which all humanity looks for the realization of international peace and security.\n277.\tIt is quite natural that the painful and bloody events that the Middle East is experiencing today and their increasing acuteness impel us to support the Iranian proposal for creating a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East [AI9693]. It appears clear that if Israel does not become a signatory to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, then the accelerating danger of military conflict may assume a more ominous form. \\\"}\n278.\tMy Government welcomes the step taken by the new Government in Portugal regarding the problem of imperialism in Africa. We hope that the representatives of Mozambique and Angola will join us in this Organization, so that both these nations will occupy the important place among us that they deserve.\n279.\tThe arm of liberty will continue to strike at the last remaining bastions of colonialism in Rhodesia, South Africa and everywhere else, until these bastions fall and vanish for ever from our world.\n280.\tI would also like to welcome the new States that were admitted as Members in the Organization at this session, hoping that their presence with us will have a positive bearing on the strengthening of international peace and security.\n281.\tWe have pinned great hopes on the accomplishments of this session. I pray to God to guide us in transforming these hopes from the realm of studies, proposals and recommendations to the realm of realization.\n"

        "file_text": "Last year, at the previous session [.2124th meeting], in my first address as Secretary of State, I spoke to this Assembly about American purposes. I said that the United States seeks a comprehensive, institutionalized peace, not an armistice. I asked other nations to join us in moving the world from detente to cooperation, from coexistence to community.\n41.\tIn the year that has passed some progress has been made in dealing with particular crises. But many fundamental issues persist and new issues threaten the very structure of world stability.\n42.\tOur deepest problem going far beyond the items on the agenda is whether our vision can keep pace with our challenges. Will history recall the twentieth century as a time of mounting global conflict or as the beginning of a global conception? Will our age of interdependence spur joint progress or common disaster?\n43.\tThe answer is not yet clear. New realities have not yet overcome old patterns of thought and action. Traditional concepts of national sovereignty, social struggle and the relation between the old and the new nations too often guide our course. And so we have managed but not advanced; we have endured but not prospered; and we have continued the luxury of political contention.\n44.\tThis condition has been dramatized in the brief period since the twenty-eighth session. War has ravaged the Middle East and Cyprus. The technology of nuclear explosives has resumed its dangerous spread. Inflation and the threat of global decline hang over the economies of rich and poor alike.\n45.\tWe cannot permit this trend to continue. Conflict between nations once devastated continents; the struggle between blocs may destroy humanity, ideologies and doctrines drawn from the last century do not even address, let alone solve, the unprecedented problems of today. As a result, events challenge habits; a gulf grows between rhetoric and reality.\n46.\tThe world has dealt with local conflicts as if they were perpetually manageable. We have permitted too many of the underlying causes to fester unattended, until the parties believed that their only recourse was war. And because each crisis ultimately has been contained we have remained complacent. But tolerance of local conflict tempts world holocaust. We have no guarantee that some local crisis perhaps the next will not explode beyond control.\n47.\tThe world has dealt with nuclear weapons as if restraint were automatic. Their very awesomeness has chained those weapons for almost three decades; their sophistication and expense have helped to keep constant for a decade the number of States which possess them. Now, as was quite foreseeable, political inhibitions are in danger of crumbling. Nuclear catastrophe looms more plausible, whether through design or miscalculation, accident, theft or blackmail.\n48.\tThe world has dealt with the economy as if its constant advance were inexorable. While postwar growth has been uneven and some parts of the world have lagged, our attention has been focused on how to increase participation in a general advance. We continue to deal with economic issues on a national, regional or bloc basis at the precise moment that our interdependence is multiplying. Strains on the fabric and institutions of the world economy threaten to engulf us all in a general depression.\n49.\tThe delicate structure of international cooperation, so laboriously constructed over the last quarter century, can hardly survive, and certainly cannot be strengthened, if it is continually subjected to the shocks of political conflict, war and economic crisis.\n50.\tThe time has come, then, for the nations assembled here to act together in the recognition that continued reliance on old slogans and traditional rivalries will lead us towards a world ever more torn between rich and poor. East and West, producer and consumer; a world where local crises threaten global confrontation and where the spreading atom threatens global peril; a world of rising costs and dwindling supplies, of growing populations and declining production.\n51.\tThere is another course. Last week before this Assembly [2234th meeting] President Ford dedicated our country to a cooperative,, open approach to build a more secure and more prosperous world. The United States will assume the obligations that our values and strength impose upon us. But the building of a cooperative world is beyond the grasp of any one nation. An interdependent world requires not merely the resources but the vision and creativity of us all. Nations cannot simultaneously confront and cooperate with one another.\n52.\tWe must recognize that the common interest is the only valid test of the national interest. It is in the common interest, and thus in the interest of each nation, that local conflicts be resolved short of force and 'heir root causes be removed by political means; that the spread of nuclear technology be achieved without the spread of nuclear weapons; that growing economic interdependence lift all nations and not drag them down together.\n53.\tWe will not solve these problems during this session, or during any one session, of the General Assembly, but we must at least begin to remedy problems, not just manage them; to shape events, rather that endure them; to confront our challenges instead of one another.\n54.\tThe urgent political responsibility of our era is to resolve conflicts without war. History is replete with examples of the tragedy that sweeps nations when ancient enmities and the inertia of habit freeze the scope for decision. Equally, history is marked by brief moments when an old order is giving way to a pattern new and unforeseen. Those are times of potential disorder and danger but also of opportunity for fresh creation.\n55.\tWe face such a moment today. Together let us face its realities. First, a certain momentum towards peace has been created, in EastWest relations and in certain regional conflicts. It must be maintained. But we are only at the beginning of the process. If we do not continue to advance, we will slip back. Second, progress in the negotiation of difficult issues comes only through patience, perseverance and a recognition of the tolerable limits of the other side. Peace is a process, not a condition. It can be reached only in steps. Third, the failure to recognize and grasp the attainable will prevent the achievement of the ideal. Attempts to resolve all issues at one time are a certain prescription for stagnation. Progress towards peace can be thwarted by asking too much as surely as by asking too little. Fourth, the world community can help resolve chronic conflicts, but exaggerated expectations will prevent essential accommodation among the parties. This Assembly can help or hinder the negotiating process. It can seek a scapegoat or a solution. It can offer the parties an excuse to escape reality or sturdy support in search of a compromise. It can decide on propaganda or contribute to realistic approaches responsive to man's yearning for peace.\n56.\tThe Middle East starkly demonstrates those considerations. In the past year we have witnessed both the fourth ArabIsraeli war in a generation and the hopeful beginnings of a political process towards a lasting and just peace. We have achieved the respite of a ceasefire and two disengagement agreements, but the shadow of war remains. The legacy of hatred and suffering, the sense of irreconcilability have begun to yield however haltingly to the process of negotiation. But we still have a long road ahead.\n57.\tOne side seeks the recovery of territory and justice for a displaced people. The other side seeks security and recognition by its neighbors of its legitimacy as a nation. In the end, the common goal of peace surely is broad enough to embrace all these aspirations.\n58.\tLet us be realistic about what must be done. The art of negotiation is to set goals that can be achieved at a given time and to reach them with determination. Each step forward modifies old perceptions and brings about a new situation that improves the chances of a comprehensive settlement.\n59.\tBecause these principles were followed in the Middle East, agreements have been reached in the past year which many thought impossible. They were achieved, above all, because of the wisdom of the leaders of the Middle East who decided that there had been enough stalemate and war, that more might be gained by testing each other in negotiation than by testing each other on the battlefield.\n60.\tThe Members of this body, both collectively and individually, have a solemn responsibility to encourage and support the parties in the Middle East on their present course. We have as well an obligation to give our support to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East and elsewhere. The United States applauds their indispensable role, as well as the outstanding contribution of SecretaryGeneral Waldheim in the cause of peace.\n61.\tDuring the past year my country has made a major effort to promote peace in the Middle East. President Ford has asked me to reaffirm today that we are determined to press forward with these efforts. We will work closely with the parties and we will cooperate with all interested countries within the framework of the Geneve Conference.\n62.\tThe tormented island of Cyprus is another area where peace requires a spirit of compromise, accommodation and justice. The United States is convinced that the sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity of Cyprus must be maintained. It will be up to the parties to decide on the form of government they believe best suited to the particular conditions of Cyprus. They must reach accommodation on the areas to be administered by the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities as well as on the conditions under which refugees can return to their homes and reside in safety. Finally, no lasting peace is possible unless provisions are agreed upon which will lead to the timely and phased reduction of armed forces and armaments and other war material.\n63.\tThe United States is prepared to play an even more active role now than in the past in helping the parties find a solution to the centuries old problem of Cyprus. We will do all we can, but it is those most directly concerned whose effort is most crucial. Third parties should not be asked to produce miraculous outcomes not anchored in reality. Third parties can encourage those directly involved to perceive their broader interests; they can assist in the search for elements of agreement by interpreting each side's views and motives to the other. But no mediator can succeed unless the parties genuinely want mediation and are ready to make the difficult decisions needed for a settlement.\n64.\tThe United States is already making a major contribution to help relieve the human suffering of the people of Cyprus. We urge the international community to continue and, if possible, to increase its own humanitarian relief effort.\n65.\tThe United States notes with particular satisfaction the continuing process of change in Africa. We welcome the positive demonstration of cooperation between old rulers and the new free. The United States shares and pledges its support for the aspiration of Africans to participate in the fruits of freedom and human dignity.\n66.\tThe second new dimension on our agenda concerns the problem of nuclear proliferation.\n67.\tThe world has grown so accustomed to the existence of nuclear weapons that it assumes they will never be used. But today technology is rapidly expanding the number of nuclear weapons in the hands of major Powers and threatens to put nuclear explosive technology at the disposal of. an increasing number of other countries.\n68.\tIn a world where many nations possess nuclear weapons, dangers would be vastly compounded. It would be infinitely more difficult, if not impossible, to maintain stability among a large number of nuclear Powers. Local wars would take on a new dimension. Nuclear weapons would be introduced into regions where political conflict remains intense and the parties consider their vital interests overwhelmingly involved. There would, as well, be a vastly heightened risk of direct involvement by the major nuclear Powers.\n69.\tThis problem does not concern one country, one region, or one bloc alone. No nation can be indifferent to the spread of nuclear technology; every nation's security is directly affected.\n70.\tThe challenge before the world is to realize the peaceful benefits of nuclear technology without contributing to the growth of nuclear weapons or to the number of States possessing them.\n71.\tAs a major nuclear Power, the United States recognizes its special responsibility. We realize that we cannot expect others to show restraint if we do not ourselves practice restraint. Together with the Soviet Union we are seeking to negotiate new quantitative and qualitative limitations on strategic arms. Last week our delegations reconvened in Geneva, and we intend to pursue these negotiations with the seriousness of purpose they deserve. The United States has no higher priority than controlling and reducing the levels of nuclear arms.\n72.\tBeyond the relations of the nuclear Powers to each other lies the need to curb the spread of nuclear explosives. We must take into account that plutonium is an essential ingredient of nuclear explosives and that in the immediate future the amount of plutonium generated by peaceful nuclear reactors will be multiplied many times. Heretofore the United States and a number of other countries have widely supplied nuclear fuels and other nuclear materials in order to promote the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This policy cannot continue if it leads to the proliferation of nuclear explosives. Sales of these materials can no longer be treated by anyone as a purely commercial competitive enterprise.\n73.\tThe world community, therefore, must work urgently towards a system of effective international safeguards against the diversion of plutonium or its byproducts. The United States is prepared to join with others in a comprehensive effort.\n74.\tLet us together agree on the practical steps which must be taken to assure the benefits of nuclear energy free of its terrors. The United States will shortly offer specific proposals to strengthen safeguards to the other principal supplier countries. We shall intensify our efforts to gain the broadest possible acceptance of IAEA safeguards, to establish practical controls on the transfer of nuclear materials, and to ensure the effectiveness of these procedures. The United States will urge IAEA to draft an international convention for enhancing physical security against theft or diversion of nuclear material. Such a convention should set forth specific standards and techniques for protecting materials while in use, storage and transfer. The Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], which this Assembly has endorsed, warrants continuing support. The Treaty contains not only a broad commitment to limit the spread of nuclear explosives but specific obligations to accept and implement IAEA safeguards and to control the transfer of nuclear materials.\n75.\tWhatever advantages seem to accrue from the acquisition of nuclear explosive technology will prove to be ephemeral. When Pandora's box has been opened, no country will be the beneficiary and all mankind will have lost. This is not inevitable. If we act decisively now, we can still control the future.\n76.\tLet me now turn to our economic problems.\n77.\tLord Keynes wrote:\n\\\"The power to become habituated to his surroundings is a marked characteristic of mankind. Very few of us realize with conviction the intensely unusual, unstable, complicated, unreliable, temporary nature of the economic organization.\\\"\n78.\tThe economic history of the postwar period has been one of sustained growth, for developing as well as developed nations. The universal expectation of our peoples, the foundation of our political institutions and the assumption underlying the evolving structure of peace are all based on the belief that this growth will continue.\n79.\tBut will it? The increasingly open and cooperation global economic system that we have come to take tor granted is now under unprecedented attack. The world is poised on the brink of a return to the unrestrained economic nationalism which accompanied the collapse of economic order in the 1930s. And, should that occur, all would suffer: poor as well as rich, producer as well as consumer.\n80.\tSo let us so longer fear to confront in public the facts which have come to dominate bur private discussions and concerns.\n81.\tThe early warning signs of a major economic crisis are evident. Rates of inflation unprecedented in the past quarter century are sweeping developing and developed nations alike. The world's financial institutions are staggering under the most massive and rapid movements of reserves in history. And profound questions have arisen about meeting man's most fundamental needs for energy and food.\n82.\tWhile the present situation threatens every individual and nation, it is the poor who suffer the most. While the wealthier adjust their living standards, the poor see the hopes of a lifetime collapse around them. While others tighten their belts, the poor starve. While others can hope for a better future, the poor see only despair ahead.\n83.\tIt can be in the interest of no country or group of countries to base policies on a test of strength, for a policy of confrontation would end in disaster for all. Meeting man's basic needs for energy and food and assuring economic growth while mastering inflation require international cooperation to an unprecedented degree.\n84.\tLet us apply these principles first to the energy situation. Oil producers seek a better life for their peoples and a just return for their diminishing resources. The developing nations less well endowed by nature face the disintegration of the results of decades of striving for development as the result of a price policy over which they have no control. The developed nations find the industrial civilization built over centuries in jeopardy.\n85.\tBoth producers and consumers have legitimate claims. The problem is to reconcile them for the common good.\n86.\tThe United States is working closely with several oil producers to help diversify their economies. We have established commissions to facilitate the transfer of technology and to assist with industrialization. We are prepared to accept substantial investments in the United States and we welcome a greater role for the oil producers in the management of international economic institutions.\n87.\tThe investment of surplus oil revenues presents a great challenge. The countries which most need these revenues are generally the least likely to receive them. The world's financial institutions have coped thus far, but ways must be found to assure assistance for those countries most in need of it. And the full brunt of the surplus revenues is yet to come.\n88.\tDespite our best efforts to meet the oil producers' legitimate needs and to channel their resources into constructive uses, the world cannot sustain even the present level of prices, much less continuing increases. The prices of other commodities will inevitably rise in a never-ending inflationary spiral. Nobody will benefit. The oil producers will be forced to spend more for their own imports. Many nations will not be able to withstand the pace, and the poorer could be overwhelmed. The complex, fragile structure of global economic cooperation required to sustain national economic growth stands in danger of being shattered.\n89.\tThe United States will work with other consumer nations on means of conservation and on ways to cushion the impact of massive investments from abroad. The preliminary agreement on a program of solidarity and cooperation signed a few days ago in Brussels by the major consumer countries is an encouraging first step.\n90.\tBut the long range solution requires a new understanding between consumers and producers. Unlike food prices, the high cost of oil is not the result of economic factors, of an actual shortage of capacity or of the free play of supply and demand. Rather it is caused by deliberate decisions to restrict production and maintain an artificial price level. We recognize that the producers should have a fair share; the fact remains that the present price level even threatens the economic wellbeing of producers. Ultimately they depend upon the vitality of the world economy for the security of their markets and their investments. And it cannot be in the interest of any nation to magnify the despair of the least developed, which are uniquely vulnerable to exorbitant prices and have no recourse .but to pay.\n91.\tWhat has gone up by political decision can be reduced by political decision.\n92.\tLast week President Ford called upon the oil producers to join with consumers in defining a strategy which will meet the world's longterm need for both energy and food at reasonable prices; he set forth the principles which should guide such a policy; and he announced to this Assembly America's determination to meet our responsibilities to help alleviate another grim reality world hunger. At a time of universal concern for justice and in an age of advanced technology, it is intolerable that millions are starving and hundreds of millions remain undernourished.\n93.\tThe magnitude of the longterm problem is clear. At present rates of population growth, world food production must double by the end of this century to maintain even the present inadequate dietary level and an adequate diet for all would require that we triple world production. If we are true to our principles, we have an obligation to strive for an adequate supply of food to every man, woman and child in the world. This is a technical possibility, a political necessity and a moral imperative.\n94.\tThe United States is prepared to join with all nations at the World Food Conference in Rome to launch the truly massive effort which is required. We will present a number of specific proposals: to help developing nations, which have the lowest yields and the largest amounts of unused land and water and whose potential in food production must be made to match their growing need; to increase substantially global fertilizer production, for we must end once and for all the world's chronic fertilizer shortage; to expand international, regional and national research programs because scientific and technical resources mus? hi mobilized now to meet the demands of the year 2030 and beyond; to rebuild the world's food reserves, as our capacity for dealing with famine must be freed from the vagaries of weather; and to provide a substantial level of concessionary food aid. The United States will in the coming year increase the value of our own food aid shipments to countries in need. We make this commitment despite great pressures on our economy and at a time when we are seeking to cut our own Government's budget, because we realize the dimensions of the tragedy with which we are faced. All of us here have a common obligation to prevent the poorest nations from being overwhelmed and to enable them to build the social, economic and political base for self-sufficiency.\n95.\tThe hopes of every nation for a life of peace and plenty rest on an effective international resolution of the crises of inflation, fuel and food. We must act now and we must act together.\n96.\tLet us never forget that all of our political endeavors are ultimately judged by one standard to translate our actions into human concerns.\n97.\tThe United States will never be satisfied with a world where man's fears overshadow his hopes. We support the United Nations efforts in the fields of international law and human rights. We approve of the activities of the United Nations .in social, economic and humanitarian realms around the world. The United States considers the World Population Conference, held last month, the World Food Conference to be held a month from now and the continuing Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea of fundamental importance to our common future.\n98.\tIn the coming months the United States will make specific proposals for the United Nations to initiate a major international effort to prohibit torture; a concerted campaign to control the disease which afflicts and debilitates over 200 million people in 70 countries schistosomiasis; and a substantial strengthening of the world's capacity to deal with natural disaster, especially the improvement of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator.\n99.\tWe have long lived in a world where the consequences of our failures were manageable a world where local conflicts were contained, nuclear weapons threatened primarily those nations which possessed them, and the cycle of economic growth and decline seemed principally a national concern. But that is no longer the case. It is no longer possible to imagine that conflicts, weapons and recession will not spread.\n100.\tWe must now decide. The problems we face will be with .us the greater part of the century. But will they be with us as challenges to be overcome or as adversaries that have vanquished us?\n101.\tIt is easy to agree to yet another set of principles or to actions other nations should take. But the needs of the poor will not be met by slogans; the needs of an expanding global economy will not be met by new restrictions; the search for peace cannot be conducted on the basis of confrontation. So each nation must ask what it can do, what contribution it is finally prepared to make to the common good.\n102.\tBeyond peace, beyond prosperity, lie man's deepest aspirations to a life of dignity and justice. And beyond our pride, beyond our concern for the national purpose we are called upon to serve, there must be a concern for the betterment of the human condition. White we cannot, in the brief span allowed to each of us, undo the accumulated problems of centuries, we dare not do less than try. So let us now get on with our tasks.\n103.\tLet us act in the spirit of Thucydides that \\\"the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding go out to meet it\\\".\n"
