        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to begin by extending our warmest and most heartfelt congratulations to the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Argentina, Mr. Dante Caputo, upon the occasion of his election to the post of President of the forty-third regular session of the United Nations General Assembly. We consider him to be a friend of our Government and of our people and we recognize his great experience and ability. We can therefore say that his presidency represents an assurance that the work of this Assembly will proceed in an orderly fashion.\nIt is also my pleasure to think Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic for his brilliant and efficient work as President of the Assembly during the previous session. I should also like to express our admiration for the Secretary-General for the efforts that he has been making for peace. His activities, intelligent, prudent and, at the same time, bold, notwithstanding the institutional and financial constraints upon the Organization, have represented an invaluable contribution to the resolution of various regional conflicts and they sure eloquent testimony to the value of the United Nations as a forum and instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. \nThe lengthy agenda of this session of the General Assembly reflects all the major issues of concern to mankind today. Taken as a whole, it shows that in fulfilling the purposes and principles laid down in Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter 43 years ago, we are continuing resolutely to search for and to safeguard international peace and security, which continue to be the raison d'\u00eatre of the Organization and which determine all its other activities and objectives.\nPeace has been declared to be a human right. Consequently, all the efforts made to preserve and to restore it are simply the consequences of this right, and the attainment of its objectives becomes a duty for the Organization and all its Member States.\nToday, as in the past, the efforts for peace call for direct action by the United Nations, which presupposes, in turn, that States must respect certain principles, such as non-intervention, renunciation of the use or threat of force, self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nEver since the early years of the United Nations, Uruguay has complied strictly with those principles which underlie the Organization and has promoted respect for them. It has also done everything within its modest means to contribute to the success of the United Nations peace efforts. At this time, as we celebrate the well-deserved awarding of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, I cannot but recall with pride that Uruguayan officers have been present since 1948 in the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UMOGlP), and recently in the Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG). Our effective participation in these efforts reflects our unswerving faith in the Organization as an instrument for peace. \nThe progress that the United Nations has made in the cases of Afghanistan, Angola and Namibia, in the Iran-Iraq conflict, and in the question of Western Sahara, must be hailed as a happy resurgence of the capacity for action and the negotiating ability of the organs and mechanisms operating within the framework of the United Nations. We earnestly hope and trust that the processes currently under way will culminate in a just and lasting peace for the nations currently embroiled in conflict.\nUnfortunately, we cannot be so optimistic with respect to the present situation in Central America and that in the Middle East. In the case of Central America, Uruguay believes that only by full compliance with the Esquipulas II agreements and the Arias Plan, and by strict compliance with the principles of non-interference, self-determination and non-use of force, combined in a process of international democratization in the countries in conflict, will it be possible to achieve a stable peace in the region.\nOur country has participated in the efforts of the Contadora Support Group with sincere enthusiasm, encouraging the parties to comply with the Esquipulas II agreements, and it is willing to continue to do so because it feels that the pacification and democratization of Central America are essential objectives for the harmonious development of all of Latin America, which is, in the end, an objective that is shared by all.\nAs for the Middle East, it is clear that there can be no lasting peace in the region without recognition of the right to exist of all the States in conflict, and without recognition of the full validity of the principle of self-determination of peoples. But at the same time, we must remember that the rights of those peoples are inexorably linked to the establishment of adequate safeguards, that the borders that have been set, or are to be set in the future, will be duly respected by all. Likewise, the continuation of artificial political divisions, such as those affecting the Korean people, do not contribute to the attainment of lasting peace in the region. \nAt the special session devoted to disarmament, Uruguay confirmed its conviction that the arms race could lead to a world war, and that we must continue the efforts already under way to bring about general and complete disarmament. This is essential for the creation of a climate compatible with the search for peace, in the hope that when this is achieved the resources that today are spent on weapons may be put to constructive uses, such as the economic development of the non-industrialized countries and their technological modernization.\nLatin America has given the world the example of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which proscribes the proliferation of nuclear weapons among developing countries, without affecting the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and scientific and technological progress, in this respect, we emphasize our support for the Declaration of the South Atlantic as a Zone of Peace and Co-operation, and we hope that the zone of peace in the South Pacific will soon become \u0105 reality as well. We think that the establishment of these zones of peace constitutes a promising attempt to preserve vast stretches of sea and ocean free from the tensions and conflicts that arise from the threat or use of force or from the dangers resulting from the deployment of nuclear weapons.\nAmong the conflicts that are still unresolved, we should like once again to emphasize our position with respect to the Malvinas Islands. Uruguay has supported Argentina's claim of sovereignty over the Islands. But we also are mindful of our historic ties with the United Kingdom, with which Uruguay has maintained relations of friendship and co-operation for over a century. We should like now to reaffirm our willingness to co-operate in the search for solutions to a conflict that, with its recent military events, opened a painful breach throughout Latin America. The wounds must as a matter of urgency be healed through negotiation and dialogue.\nThe world is currently undergoing an unprecedented process of rapid change. We have fully entered the information age and are witnessing the end of the so-called industrial age with no sense of loss. The United Nations must adapt to this process of change in order to be able to continue to fulfil its mission and to ensure the equitable distribution of technological resources and the enjoyment of their benefits by all States. The monopoly of advanced technologies in the hands of a few countries is turning a majority of nations into compulsory purchasers of imported technology. As a result of this, their political sovereignty is as much endangered as it would be by an act of war. Consequently, we need to universalise the availability of the new resources that are being produced through science and technology. This means an attitude of universal openness, on the part of all countries of the world, industrialized and developing, to the free circulation, not only of goods and services, but ultimately of ideas and knowledge.\nIf this objective is not faced with all its political implications, any attempts to overcome the world's current economic and financial crisis will be impossible.\nToday, we cannot think of the work of the United Nations without thinking of the question of human rights. These never were - and certainly are not today - a matter within the jurisdiction of States. The international promotion and protection of human rights, on the basis of the Charter and of many international instruments is an objective to which mankind as a whole is committed. In this context, we once again repeat our condemnation of apartheid, a shameful doctrine based on inequality and racial discrimination, which is a clear, institutionalized violation of human rights. In this connection there are other scourges in the world today such as terrorism and drugs. Terrorism is not merely a factor that contributes to - international insecurity and a form of action that violates fundamental principles of civilized coexistence\u00b7, it is essentially a flagrant violation of human rights, an attack upon the freedom and dignity of man, and especially on his right to life. Ws consider that the action by the United Nations against terrorism must be firm and clear, based on the view that terrorism is a crime against humanity, one that calls for the co-operation of all States. \nAs for the fight against the illegal use of drugs, international action roust be greatly expanded in order to confront this plague, which is particularly severe today. The United Nations is the appropriate setting for the adoption and promotion of economic, social, cultural and legal measures for its prevention and sanction. But such measures should not be considered as negating the responsibility of producer countries, nor of consumer countries since, if there were no large consumer market, there would not be any drug-producing market. We should also call attention to the responsibility of the countries that allow their territory to be used for drug trafficking. Our country confirms its determination to co-operate in the International fight against the narcotics trade and pledges its support to any co-ordinated effort at the regional or international levels.\nConservation of the environment is a matter of growing concern for the international community. The quality of man's life on Earth and his very existence are at stake.\nWe reaffirm our support for the recommendations in the report entitled \\\"Our Common Culture\\\", prepared by the World Commission on Environment and Development, and we agree with the basic principles of maintaining the steady productivity of the ecosystems and the biosphere as a whole. We are convinced of the need to increase efforts and to act in a co-ordinated fashion to avert the grave danger of altering the ecological balance and the progressive and rapid physical and chemical deterioration of the environment that is affecting the infrastructure of planetary life.\nThe achievement of full economic development has been the basic challenge of the last years of our century. Without balanced and global economic development, there can be no firm and lasting peace; the existence of both highly industrialized countries and countries hindered by underdevelopment is, over the medium- or long-term, a constant source of instability and tension and a threat to world peace.\nEven if one recognizes that development is also the responsibility of the developing countries themselves, at this time in our century it seems clear that, even in those developing countries that are willing to absorb the social and political costs of painful adjustments in their economies, there eventually comes a time when national instruments of economic rationality are exhausted.\nHence there arises the indispensable need for greater international solidarity, which starts with clear and stable trade regulations - free from irritating protectionism - and greater flexibility and co-operation in solving the financial problems caused by the current foreign debt crisis, the weight of which is frustrating the efforts of the debtor countries to promote their economic growth and placing the stability of their democratic institutions at risk.\nNevertheless, it must be said that the overwhelming debt burden is monopolizing international attention, pushing into the background the urgent need to discuss new resources necessary to promote the scientific and technological modernization and development of the non-industrialized countries.\nNaturally, the problem has transcended the mere economic nature of the issue. It is now time to recognize that the world's financial problems - the past debt and the future debt - are also political problems that must be faced from an international perspective based on a faithful and honest commitment by creditors and debtors alike, in which both recognize their due share of responsibility for the past and the future. To this end, I believe that it is constructive to highlight the recent commitment of the President of the Spanish Government at the close of the twenty-fifth meeting of Latin American Governors, Spain and the Philippines before the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. \nIt is useful to recall this here because it shows that the sensitivity which we have been calling for is starting to emerge among the leaders of industrialized creditor countries as well.\nPresident Felipe Gonzalez began by recognizing the failure of the strategy thus far pursued to resolve the debt crisis and recognized that from 1982 to date the situation of the banks and creditor countries has improved sufficiently for them to assume a more realistic and flexible attitude in this matter,. Consequently, he feels that the time has come for the creditors to redefine their debt strategy by specifically proposing the capitalization of interest and the reduction in outstanding debt, along the lines, I suppose, of explicitly recognizing the devaluation of the debt in the securities market.\nI believe that this is the appropriate forum and time to welcome views such as the one expressed by the President of the Spanish Government, which tend to bring balance into international attention by recalling that, in spite of the progress in political terms observed at the international level, at this level there still persist serious problems - with no clear solutions - affecting not merely the quality of life of millions of inhabitants of the world but also the possibility of building a world at peace.\nSoon, two international events will occur expressing our active commitment - Uruguay's - at the regional and international levels.\nThe first is the meeting of Latin American Presidents of the Group of Eight to be held at Punta del Este. This group, which was created in Rio de Janeiro, emerged out of the conviction of its democratic Governments that it is important for Latin America as a whole that there be a mechanism for co-ordination and consultation enabling it to harmonize its international activities, promote regional democratization and act in unity in analysing all the problems affecting the region. There can be no doubt that this group has acquired clear international standing and can now play its part in maintaining relations with other international organizations and countries outside the region. The forthcoming summit meeting at Punta del Est\u0117 will undoubtedly provide a timely opportunity to analyse what has been done since the Acapulco Declaration and to define a realistic plan of action to pursue in the future in the political, cultural, educational and technological fields.\nThe second is the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a result of the Punta del Este conference, where discussions were held which, we hope, will serve as an example of international wisdom, promoting international trade free from discrimination and protectionism and capable of promoting international trade exchanges on the basis of which the shared objective for development of all States on Earth can be solidly established.\nWithin this broader picture, the importance of multilateralism and the transcendental role of the United Nations is clear. But for our Organization to be active and respected, it is necessary that it have the wherewithal necessary for the attainment of the goals assigned to it by the Charter and the resources efficiently to conduct the operations for which its machinery was established.\nWe recognize, therefore, that in order to revitalize the Organization once and for all, we need to start with honest self-criticism aimed at eliminating inefficiencies, lessening bureaucracy and improving existing systems.\nIn saying that, we also realize that the way to achieve this objective is surely not by suffocating it financially to the point of undermining not only its functioning but also its very existence. Hence it is the duty of all Member States particularly the large industrialized countries, to reconsider their position as contributions to the United Nations budget and to make the necessary efforts to keep the Organization going and functioning. \nIn summary, my country reaffirms its commitment to the United Nations. Uruguay is today living in peace, free from conflicts with other States. It maintains relations of friendship and co-operation with States of all political and economic systems in the world> it has developed a strong democratic life that fully respects human rights and is governed by leaders elected through the free expression of the will of the people.\nThat is why we come before the Assembly today and express our views on foreign policy as the result of national consensus on the basis of which the country is participating at the regional and international levels in the search for the reaffirmation of the fundamental principles that gave birth to the Organization. In closing, while confirming my country's confidence in the results of this session, let us recall that the difficult challenges we are currently facing and will have to face in the future can only be overcome through decisive and clear international action without unrealistic rhetoric or expressions of one-sided intent.\nThis call for pragmatic and rational action includes strict observance by all Members of the Organization of the fundamental principles of the San Francisco Charter, because these principles are not merely rhetorical phrases but rather inescapable legal duties that all States must observe in order to ensure the credibility and efficiency of the United Nations in accomplishing its basic objectives.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff \nMr. President, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Panama, may I express great pleasure at the choice of Your Excellency to carry out the responsible task of presiding over the forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your Excellency\u2019s experience and capacity, as well as your thorough knowledge of world problems, and in particular your familiarity with the cause of Central American peace, will, without doubt, contribute to the achievement of satisfactory results in the Assembly's consideration of the complex and delicate issues with which it will be dealing.\nI wish to pay a special tribute also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his diplomacy, which has produced significant results in the case of some of the issues that concern us most. He is to be commended for his immense and positive activity in the cause of peace, particularly with regard to the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq, Those achievements seem to have brought closer the realization of the ideals espoused by the founders of the United Nations, enabling the Organisation to serve effectively as a system of collective security. \nFrom the Secretary-General's report, there are many lessons we can learn concerning the need, in the case of external debt, to recognize that debtors and creditors share responsibility, and concerning the relationship between the arms race and inequalities of economic development. In addition, there is the question of the net export of capital to which the Latin American nations have been subjected in the servicing of their debt. The imposition of terms that are quite our of keeping with their capability, or even with the most elementary criterion of equity, constitutes a graphic accusation against their creditors,\nA decade of zero growth in our continent, and even, in many areas, of decline in the production of wealth, constitutes an irrefutable and terrible denunciation of the imbalance that still persists in our world. What has really been happening is a greater concentration of wealth in a tiny minority of nations, while the difficulties placed on the majority of the less privileged nations, which are trying to break out of the trap of poverty and backwardness, have increased. If it is calculated that there may be 200 million Latin Americans living in poverty by the end of this century, surely that is more than enough reason to assert that the problem requires immediate action through the integration of Latin America, leaving aside traditional considerations.\nApart from the grave economic and social problems encountered everywhere, we are deeply disturbed by the international conflicts that keep the world in a state of instability and anxiety.\nEven so, let me observe that the recent understandings between the two great Powers on the reduction of certain types of nuclear weapons allows us to hope that the world is moving away from the danger of a holocaust and that immense resources may be released for the solution of the most serious economic and social problems. It is encouraging that the principal source of fear and disquiet for several decades among large segments of mankind now appears to be less threatening.\nHowever, these nuclear-arms limitation agreements coincide with the emergence of new concepts of security among the Powers that feel the need for greater emphasis on the use of conventional weapons as an instrument with which to subjugate weak and smaller peoples. This in turn means that renewed importance attaches to military installations located in strategic sites of regional or global importance.\nThus, while the world moves towards peace, a new danger hovers over many underdeveloped countries, and this is particularly true of Panama because the United States is now attaching greater importance to its military bases on Panamanian soil than it did before its agreements with the Soviet Union. That is why the United States does not wish to honour the commitments it entered into under the current Panama Canal Treaties and seeks to prolong its military presence in my country beyond the agreed terms. \nOur geographical position, our most important and valuable natural resource, is thus being turned into the greatest danger to our sovereignty and independence. What for us is a bridge between the seas for the strengthening of international trade and for our own development is for others becoming a strategic position with global implications. What we have offered for the benefit of the world, others want for control of the world.\nWe in Panama have no ambitions or aspirations to wield power. We aspire only to being allowed to develop, under normal conditions, our capacity and potential to bring about material and spiritual improvements for our people.\nAnother of the great dangers now hanging over small peoples is disinformation. Using the weapon of disinformation to subjugate a smaller people, a great Power has set in motion its enormous established capacity to influence and control systems of collection, generation, distribution and presentation of news and comment, and has established a network for the manipulation of public opinion the world over.\nThe defenceless state in which societies now find themselves, confronted with massive processes of distortion in the mass media, is one of the most terrible problems of our time, particularly for the underdeveloped peoples, which are very vulnerable to disinformation. If that vulnerability is exploited at the national level, or at the level of regional hegemony, and if the strategy includes cultivating, exporting and introducing methods of Nazi fascism, from the defeat of which this Organization was born, then the time has come to give thought to the need for broad-based action to halt such a diversion of mankind from the right path.\nDiscord has been introduced into Panamanian society in a studied and planned way by the manipulation of minds, which has been extended to the rest of the world through the substitution of invented reality for truth - an invented reality in keeping with the will and designs of the present American Government. It should be recalled that in the last two years disinformation has been functioning as a propaganda ministry whose purpose it is to introduce everywhere a monstrous image of Panama and its highest officials.\nIf I say here and now that the whole campaign against the Commander-in-Chief of the Panamanian Defence Forces, General Manuel Antonio Noriega, is nothing but a sinister tissue of lies and falsehoods organized and spread by agents of the present Government of the United States, and if I say that the Panamanian defence forces have struggled in an exemplary manner against narcotics trafficking throughout the whole time they have been under his authority, some of the distinguished statesmen and officials in this Hall will perhaps think I am not talking about the same man against whom such immense power has been unleashed.\nWhat, then, is the truth?\nOn 12 July 1988, in the Senate of the United States, Mr. John C. Lawn, Chief of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, declared that he had never seen any evidence at all linking General Noriega with drug trafficking. What the United States Government has done is to introduce into world public opinion an image of Panama and its leaders that is nothing more than the product of its own invention, a fiction manufactured by its agents and transmitted and disseminated through channels under its control and orchestrated to lend dignity and merit to United States objectives.\nThe peoples of the world, and particularly the people of the United States, have been feed deplorable lies about Panama and have been induced to yield to fear of Panama. In the implementation of this plan not only the norms and fundamental principles of the United Nations have been breached but also even the most elementary considerations of humanity. What is being inflicted on the Panamian nation today deserves the most careful attention and very serious thought by the Governments of States Members of this Organization, because a new mode of war of conquest; is now being set in motion against the Republic of Panama.\nSince the end of February of last year the present United States Government has committed against my country an astonishing series of violations of the basic norms of international law and the rules of peaceful coexistence. I wish to place on record categorically that my Government has more than sufficient reason to fear direct military aggression by the United States against the Republic of Panama. The Heads of State or Government of countries which have diplomatic or consular representatives accredited to my Government know quite well what I am talking about.\nWith the presidential succession of 26 February this year, when I took over as constitutional Head of State, all the masks were torn away, to leave exposed to the eyes of the whole world the objectives of the United States Government - that is, to overthrow the legitimate Government of Panama and impose a de facto regime headed by figures committed to the\u00b7 renegotiation of those clauses of the Panama Canal Treaties which guarantee the Panamanian people definitive consolidation of an independent, free, sovereign and neutral nation at noon on 31 December 1999.\nI strongly urge all representatives to focus most emphatically on this painful account of the grievous sufferings which my country and my people have endured, and which I shall now describe.\nPanama was a flourishing, tranquil, happy and simple country with a satisfactory growth index. Dialogue had been the normal way of resolving our internal and international differences, when suddenly we found that discord had  been insidiously injected into Panamanian society, with a strategy of subjugation aimed at my country under the pretext that the system of government was not democratic.\nWe have long understood that the only way to give the word \\\"democracy\\\" any teal meaning is by means of a high level of popular participation and a just distribution of wealth and opportunities, so that all sectors may have access to the political decision-making machinery and the benefits of growth.\nAware of the inherent weaknesses of institutions which are copied or imposed by force, we have worked constantly on the vital substance of democracy, striking at the essence of social injustice and the social and economic obstacles that confine the liberty and equality of individuals, because they are prejudicial to human dignity. Of course, this mode of thinking gave rise to opposing reactions among those who felt that it was a threat to the privileges which they had accumulated with a regime of supposed formal democracy, but which could not be sustained. There were also opposing reactions in sectors which felt that we were moving too slowly, because the solution of problems could not be delayed. Those reactions were viewed and accepted by us as a domestic issue. We find it utterly unacceptable that a foreign Power should use all the resources of disinformation and manipulation of peoples' minds in order to penetrate those sectors and force them to act against the interests of our nation.\nDemocracy is forged through the daily practice of a combined effort, by those who govern and those who are governed, designed to establish the true economic and social justice on which is based the development of a new mode of life, which each nation has the right to try for itself. No country may take upon itself the power to intervene in another in order to impose on it an institutional pattern contrary to its self-determination. Our sovereign rights were violated when the Government of the United States proceeded to freeze $54 million belonging to the National Bank of Panama belonging to the Panamanian people, thus unleashing a fierce campaign designed to create widespread distrust in the Panamanian banking system. This was action provided for in plans made long ago to destroy the banking centre of Panama, an objective which, independently of the destabilising campaigns, had been attempted some years before. So arbitrary was this action that it Included the denial of justice to the National Bank of Panama, which has been unable to bring its case before United States courts or even obtain any information on the fate of its funds.\nSimilarly, another thing that is completely inconceivable is the retention of payments which the United States Government undertook to make to our country under the Panama Canal Treaties, and of payments which should be made by United States individuals or corporations in the form of taxes or duties established in our fiscal legislation.\nIt is without precedent, moreover, that by virtue of the Executive Order of the United States President, of 8 April 1938, the State Department authorises individuals to dispose with absolute impunity and no legal controls of public and private Panamanian funds arbitrarily withheld and deposited in a bank of the United States Federal Reserve. That Executive Order, to provide a reason to invoke the war powers Act, makes the absurd claim that my Government\n\\\"constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, the foreign policy and the economy of the United States of America.\\\" \nA country such as Panama cannot be a threat to the United states from any point of view, and our legitimate exercise of our independence, sovereignty and self-determination cannot be a threat to any people in the world. But, when the United States resorts to arbitrary actions and capricious moves in its relations with another nation, that certainly has very grave consequences. World leadership in the political field imposes great responsibilities in both the execution and the formulation of policies.\nThe United States declared economic war on the Republic of Panama. In this war the effects of warfare are not quantified in terms of loss of life and material destruction, but rather through the grave political, social, economic and moral damage which has had such a severe impact on the entire Panamanian people. In 1988, the gross domestic product will drop by more than 20 per cent, which represents more than 32 billion. In a country of 2 million inhabitants, sudden impoverishment of this sort makes the whole job of strengthening democratic institutions very much more arduous and difficult.\nWhen we have seen the destruction of our economy, of the sources of our work, of our means of production and exploitation of our resources, and when supplies of food and medicine for our population have been seriously jeopardized, how can Panama fail to protest in the most energetic terms? How can it fail to protest when its financial negotiations are sabotaged, when public Panamanian funds, which have been withheld, are dealt with in a piratical manner without precedent in history, and in particular when every day may be the eve of a military attack from those United States bases located in our own territory?\nAllow me now to state the reasons why the Panamian people is increasingly afraid of direct military intervention. We are now experiencing a visible, tangible and permanent threat, as can be discerned from the facts I have given and shall now continue to give because the entire international community needs to know these things.\nThe 1977 Panama Canal Treaty authorizes United States military presence in my country only for the purposes of the defence and protection of the inter-ocean Canal. However, that presence has now been turned into a base for hegemony and influence, particularly since 1986 with the fundamental restructuring of the nature and purposes of that military presence.\nWith the establishment of the Southern Army, and the reorganization of the hierarchy of the chain of command in the Southern Command, and with the considerable build-up of troops and military hardware, the United States military bases became a part of a structure designed to have \u00b7the capacity to plan and carry out armed attacks against other countries. At the beginning of 1988, the total United States manpower present in Panama exceeded by several thousand the figures permitted by the Panama Canal Treaty.\nBetween 27 February and the first days of March of this year, commando units specialized in surprise attacks arrived in Panama together with an elite battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division, groups specializing in electronic warfare and more than 300 attack helicopters and troop helicopters ; in addition to special units for control and occupation of urban centres.\nLater, 1300 more soldiers arrived, and 800 marines, combat helicopters and offensive military equipment which has never been a part of the military facilities used by the United States for the defence of the Panama Canal.\nFighters planes have taken over the Panamian skies. They are carrying out, with significant frequency, threatening manoeuvres not only against installations of the Panamian defence forces but even against international commercial flights flying different flags.\nThere has been a steady, unbroken succession of movements of arriving troops, reinforcing and taking over from those already present, together with more armaments having overwhelming destructive power. In addition, every day an interminable succession of manoeuvres and war exercises is rehearsed continuously; its purpose can only be to display the power constantly available for attack.\nI wish now to refer again to the Secretary-General's report in order to reiterate the position the Panamian Republic has traditionally upheld at the United Nations and as a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in the light of the problems dealt with in this important paper presented to us by Mr. Perez de Cuellar. \nWe agree with the Secretary-General's concerns about Central America and, as Panama has done within the Contadora Group and the Contadora Support Group, we insist on the need for a halt to pressure and foreign interference so that the Central American Republics can press ahead on the path to the broad-based agreement adopted in the Esquipulas II Agreement.\nMr. Perez de Cuellar's report also touches on a problem of vital importance to my country and people when it refers to the manifestations of contempt for international law which have occurred lately. If States do not properly implement treaties they have entered into and are currently in force, that will mean the collapse of the entire superstructure of international law and of the foundation of the organized international community. The Secretary-General tells us this in words which are a warning laden with grave implications.\nSeeing the sufferings being endured by ray country as a result of the determination of the United States to disregard substantive commitments under the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, I wish to add some final considerations because contempt for international Treaties implicitly involves a very grave breakdown of the moral basis for coexistence among nations.\nWhen force replaces the mandates of international law, the door is opened to all sorts of abuses. The United States maintains a diplomatic Mission in my country but does not recognize my Government that Mission continues to engage in destabilizing activities, and we cannot have it removed from our soil because we are quite sure that that would be used as a pretext to use force against us. This is a new dimension of abuse of power. It is a day-to-day humiliation, an affront to the dignity of nations and their leaders. It is disrespect for the law of peoples. \nPanama is not the only vulnerable nation. Many other nations now run the same risk and are faced with the same threat, a threat we can avoid only by uniting more strongly, because the sole protection of weak countries lies in our common defence of the principles the United States is violating.\nIs not the power to decide upon the legitimacy of a Government and to give the funds of a sovereign State to individuals to use as they like a threat to everybody?\nOnly through the fullest and most resolute exercise of solidarity in union by all now and the taking of concrete steps towards prompt integration can it be guaranteed that Panama will be the last in a chain of similar cases. The political alliance constituted by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries is a powerful moral force in the international community. It is an unquestionable political force which is now obliged to extend its influence to the economic field in order to generate greater solidarity among the smaller, weaker countries. That is the best protection against situations such as that now inflicted on my country. Latin America bears an excessively onerous burden in terms of its problems of social, economic and cultural development, with immense numbers of people plunged into despair. In that context the introduction of discord into societies in the name of democracy, justice and freedom may give rise to results that will be quite contrary to those same ideals.\nOne hundred and sixty-seven years ago, one of the most distinguished of the founders of the United States, John Quincy Adams, uttered a prophetic warning against the danger of its government going beyond its frontiers seeking monsters to destroy, warning that the consequences would severely tarnish its libertarian ideals.\nThose who love freedom, in my country and indeed all over the world, are certainly dismayed and indignant that the United States Government now resorts to the invention of monsters in pursuit of its designs of continental domination. The fact that the United States Government is now using its economic and military might to asphyxiate Panama and trying to bring it to its knees is seen by the countries of Latin America with weak economies as a sinister precedent. That policy can turn into a grievous parasitic burden for continental development and for the normal deployment of United States capital.\nForeign investment would give rise to apprehension and well justified fear, particularly in the Latin American countries, which would find themselves abruptly obliged to identify such investment as potential Instruments of imperialist designs. The orders and prohibitions imposed by the current United States Government on the corporations of its nationals in Panama are really tantamount to stamping its foreign investments with the label of weapons of aggression.\nThere are many countries which, like Panama, require massive capital investment in their development process, countries which have reformed their policies, have modernized their methods, have invested efforts and valuable resources in the training of Qualified personnel. They have adapted their laws and signed agreements in order to help attract foreign capital for the strengthening of their economy.\nHowever, if those countries now see that Panama, with an economy so closely linked to United States investment, suddenly finds that the United States Government is exploiting the relative dependence which emanates from that bond, and if they see that it is then brandishing that fact as a weapon in order to strangle the Panamanian economy, bring its Government to its knees and subjugate its people, then, of necessity, they are bound to have grave misgivings. In the world economy a formula whereby more dollars are generated with less dignity can only give rise to fear.\nPanama has rigorously fulfilled its international function as a centre for inter-ocean communication for the benefit of mankind and will continue to fulfil its historic role with absolute self-denial whatever difficulties may come its way and notwithstanding all the obstacles deliberately placed on its path. For that reason we demand respect for our dignity as an independent nation. We demand full compliance with the terms of the treaties which govern the functioning and maintenance of the Canal, with a view both to achieving full control by the end of this century and to ensuring its strict neutrality. \nAs the main reason for the existence of the United Nations is the desire of all mankind for peace, I am obliged to invoke the full capacity for moral deterrence which its assembled Members represent as protection for a nation which is threatened and against which aggression has been committed.\nMy Government wants peace and will seek a dialogue and broad-based agreement for the solution of all its international disputes. I wish to place on record in this Assembly that Panama has proved itself able to withstand aggression and has upheld its dignity because of the sense of nationhood and the feeling of the sovereignty of the Panamian people, which has gradually deepened with each passing generation in my country. Our will not be stifled however unequal the terms of the struggle that lies ahead of us may be. The deliberate aggravation of differences and the stepping up of aggression against Panama can only result in driving our peoples further apart and doing serious damage to the peace and security of that part of the world. It can have no other result. On the other hand, stretching our hands to each other and reaching an understanding will have great mutual benefits for the community of nations as a whole.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMandated by a free and determined people through the most adequate mechanism to designate by whom they wish to be governed, namely, free and fair general elections, I stand here today to bring a message of hope, determination, endurance and achievement.\nThese past years have for us been marked by hope and frustration, illusions and dismay, the sense of participating in the dreams of young nations, yet also by a keen sense of isolation, bored by reality, the political leaders, together with the labour unions, the entrepreneurs, as well as the military leaders, have consistently sought a permanent solution to our fundamental problems. Pressure was applied from outside by withholding funds to which we were entitled by treaty provisions made in true faith after frank and open negotiations. At the same time, however, we were not without friends and sympathizers who backed us and wished us well, we are grateful for their understanding, their encouragement and their support.\nIn the end the people of Suriname have prevailed, for, although they are small in number, their hope, determination, endurance and commitment are infinite. Allow me, Sir, to join all those who have spoken before me in offering you, on behalf of my Government and on icy own behalf, sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-third session of our General Assembly. We are particularly satisfied to see you in the Chair, as your election is a well-deserved tribute to you and to our sister nation, Argentina, with which we maintain excellent relations. My Government is well aware of your outstanding diplomatic skills and vast experience, and is therefore confident that under your able guidance the Assembly will deal successfully with the natters that cone before it.\nI also avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor. Nr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, on the dedicated and efficient way in which he presided over the forty-second session of the General Assembly.\nAs this body was informed at its previous session, our people overwhelmingly approved a new draft Constitution for the Republic of Suriname in a national referendum held on 30 September last year, and in so doing paved the way for the holding of general elections. The draft Constitution was subsequently made law by a unanimous decision of our National Assembly.\nApart from the subjects generally included in a Constitution, our new supreme law is characterized by the inclusion of specific provisions enabling direct influence by the people on the policy-making and executive processes through regional and subregional representative organs of the State. This newly enacted basic legal instrument of our nation further more enshrines the guarantee of human rights, while it also embodies the principles of a multi-party system and recognition of the important place and role of free, private enterprise, and guarantees the independence and integrity of the judiciary.\nOn the basis of that Constitution, general, fair, secret and free elections were held on 25 November 1987, at the national, regional and subregional levels. As a result, in the wake of those elections, the first elected Executive President and Vice-President in the Republic of Suriname were inaugurated on 25 January this year, and a new Council of Ministers was installed on 26 January.\nAt this point I should like to seize the opportunity once again to express the appreciation and indebtedness of my Government and people to various Governments and international organizations for the moral support given to us in our efforts to restore democracy and for sending observer delegations to witness the referendum and general elections of last year, as well as special missions to attend the inaugural ceremonies to which 1 have just referred.\nAlthough the referendum and the elections have indeed laid the basis for the recovery of a democratic, constitutional State, we realize that we still have a long way to go in order to attain a stable and fully-fledged democracy. For Suriname to develop into a mature democracy, the newly-established democratic structures will have to be nurtured by means of national unity and political, social and economic stability. In this context, it should be mentioned that my Government has inherited a number of serious social and economic problems which could become a threat to our national unity and political stability if not urgently addressed.\nThus my Government has to deal with the problem of approximately 10,000 displaced citizens from the eastern part of Suriname, who fled the country for neighbouring French Guiana, seeking refuge from an internal armed conflict. My Government is soaking every effort through dialogue to end this insurgence, which has often resulted in violent acts of terrorism. It is faced, however, with the problem that the insurgents are aided and abetted by external forces whose chief aim is the continuation of violence through the provision, of arms, the recruitment and financing of mercenaries and so on. \nIt is obvious that it will be most difficult to bring about an end to the violence as long as such external support is continued. My Government has therefore appealed to the Governments of France and the Kingdom of the Netherlands to assist us in preventing arms deliveries and the recruitment of foreign mercenaries. As a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, we also call upon all peace-loving nations to support the Ad Hoc Committee in its endeavours to fulfil its mandate as soon as possible. Only international, concerted action against this evil practice can contribute to the eradication of the mercenaries. We are of the opinion that the international community in general and the developed countries in particular have a moral obligation not to delay the conclusion of such a convention.\nMeanwhile, the conflict has had a devastating effect on the already serious financial and economic crisis in our country. It has exacerbated the economic woes imposed on our country through such factors as the world recession, the withholding of financial development treaty resources and the absence of internal structural adaptation measures at the budgetary and monetary levels. It is hence self-evident that our economic and social development has been seriously affected\u00b7, this has become manifest in the decline of national production, the decrease in investments, the staggering rise of unemployment and inflation rates the deterioration of the balance of payments and, consequently, the near exhaustion of our foreign-exchange reserves. My Government is of the opinion that these challenges and difficulties should be faced unequivocally by a collective will to find just and proper solutions. To that end, the framework for a multi-year recovery programme has been developed.\nWe are aware, however, that in the interdependent world in which we live, no nation can develop in total isolation from others, and we are aware that no Government can fully realize its development policy objectives without external co-operation. My Government is therefore conducting negotiations with some friendly nations and international organizations, in a spirit of equality, co-operation and mutual respect for one another\u2019s sovereignty in order to obtain their valuable views, support and assistance for the solution of our social problems and the recovery, restructuring and sustained growth of our economy.\nWe strongly believe in and adhere to a policy of dialogue and consensus aimed at the peaceful solution of problems, both nationally and internationally, and we therefore apply that policy in our relations and negotiations with the relevant Governments, organizations, institutions and individuals. Our policy is aimed at guaranteeing a stable and prosperous society based on a just and equitable sharing of human, natural and technological resources. We remain convinced that, with the support and co-operation of friendly nations, organizations and institutions, we shall succeed in overcoming all obstacles on the road to a fully flourishing democratic, peaceful, stable and prosperous Suriname. Aware of the extent to which our living destiny as a nation is influenced by the state of affairs in international relations, we, as a member of the international community, recognize our responsibility to contribute our share to the achievement of the primary goal of the United Nations. The achievement of a world with greater security for all nations, a world in which all can freely develop their potentials f lies at the heart of our Organization.\nFormulated more than four decades ago, the principles enshrined in the Charter of the Organization have nevertheless remained valid for us as a guideline to the government of the State. My Government will, therefore, in our relations with other nations strictly abide by those principles as well as by those embodied in the charter of the Organization of American States, while, as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, we shall continue to place a high value on its lofty goals and principles. My Government recognises the importance of the contribution that can be made to the cause of peace by the promotion of greater understanding and appreciation among nations, in particular among States belonging to the same region. Regional integration and co-operation are considered by my Government to be more important for promoting that objective, as they are instrumental in promoting our economic and social development. Increased participation in the regional organizations of Latin American and the Caribbean will be our deliberate policy to that end. Consequently, we shall spare no effort further to develop and intensify our inter-American relations.\nEvents that have recently developed on the international scene have rekindled the hope of my Government and of many others throughout the world that the purpose of the United Nations is indeed still viable. The positive turning-point in two major regional conflicts which clouded the international atmosphere for more than seven years has been welcomed by the international community. The cease-fire in the Gulf war is a source of great satisfaction to my Government, as it has relieved the international community of a dangerous conflict that could easily have widened into one with far-reaching implications for world peace. The continuation of that war for more than seven years, notwithstanding the numerous appeals of the United Nations to bring it to an end, has indeed been a senseless waste of the human and material resources of both nations.\nAt this point we think it appropriate to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization and to those who co-operated with him for their painstaking efforts and perseverance in bringing the two States to the negotiating table. It is now incumbent on both of them to utilize to the maximum the possibilities provided by our Organization to settle their dispute peacefully.\nIt is gratifying for my Government to commend also the Secretary-General and his trusted assistants for their relentless efforts to free the territory of Afghanistan from the presence of foreign armed forces, thus removing from the international scene a major obstacle to the augmentation of international security. The restoration of, and respect shown by all countries for, the non-aligned status of Afghanistan will allow its people freely to settle their internal dispute in a manner they freely determine for themselves.\nThose developments augur well for the future of our Organization, and we are therefore confident that the United Nations will play an ever-increasing active and beneficial role in the peaceful solution of some grave regional conflicts that, unfortunately, still exist. In that context we should like to express our great satisfaction at the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, a well-deserved tribute. We should like to add our congratulations in that respect. \nWe are following with great interest another event on the international scene - namely, the armed conflict in South Africa, which has direct consequences for the long-standing question of Namibia. The United Nations has a considerable stake in the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, as it may be a determining factor in enabling our Organization to discharge its responsibility towards the Namibian people. We cannot allow the South African regime to use these talks as yet another of its widely known tactics to delay the independence of Namibia.\t.\nIn South Africa itself the policy of apartheid remains one of defiance of international opinion and ever-increasing repression of those who are fighting for their basic human rights. My Government unconditionally supports the struggle of the people of South Africa to eradicate the system of apartheid. Mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa remain the only option to enable the international community to exert credible pressure on the South African Government to abandon its criminal policies.\nMy Government cannot but voice its dismay at the development in another area of a seemingly endless conflict which has occupied the attention of the international community for many years. The disregard which has been displayed by Israel for the resolutions of the United Nations over these years remains the main cause of the continued tension in that region. Understandably frustrated by the lack of any progress to end the illegal presence of Israeli forces in the occupied Arab territories, the population cannot but show its contempt for such injustice through campaigns of civil disobedience and protest. \nThe repressive reaction of the Israeli authorities to the legitimate expression of outrage by the Palestinian people deserves the condemnation of our Organization. It should be emphasized once more that peace in the Middle East can be achieved only through a settlement which is based on the principle of justice for all nations of the region.\nThe improved relations between the two States which play a key role in maintaining international peace and security offer new hope for our world that the threat against life on our planet will be removed. We welcome the tendency of increased mutual trust between those nations, which has led to a noteworthy breakthrough in our effort to halt the arms race and clear the way for further progress to end the greatest danger to the survival of mankind. Notwithstanding this significant step in the right direction, the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament has proved that deep-rooted differences are still to be bridged and that it will take more than one effort to overcome the threat of a nuclear holocaust.\nSuriname believes that changing the arms policy into a policy aimed at social development would release significant human and financial resources that could be utilized to promote worldwide development, prosperity and peace.\nMy Government wishes to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the way in which he has responded to the appeal by the General Assembly in its resolution 42/204 of 11 December 1987 to formulate a special plan of co-operation for Central American The plan identifies short-term and medium-term priority areas of co-operation and also sets out mechanisms for implementation and follow-up.\nAccording to the Esquipulas agreement, peace and democracy in Central America cannot be achieved without a commitment to improve the social and economic well-being of the population of the countries involved. Since the roots of tension in Central America lie in social and economic problems, it is evident that the special plan of co-operation for Central America can be considered a welcome response to the question of alleviating the tension in that region.\nThe Government of Suriname considers drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking as a serious threat to mankind and will thus do everything possible, at both the national and the international level, to step up the fight against this evil scourge.\nThe world economic situation is still critical and a prolonged crisis is permeating all areas of economic and international relations. In this connection I should like to draw the attention of this body to the growing debt burden that has become the meet visible manifestation of that crisis. The external debt constitutes a challenge to our joint co-ordinated actions and our solidarity is being put to the test.\nWe feel that the strategy that has been followed so far is insufficient and of a short-term nature. Although the declaration of a moratorium by one or more countries is a possibility, the debt equity swap is a means, not a lasting solution. More them ever before the time is ripe for the developed and the developing countries to arrive at an equitable, lasting and mutually agreed solution on the basis of a developmental approach.\nIt is our considered opinion that an attitude of low profile and neglect in finding a mutual solution to the debt crisis is not only short-sighted but also dangerous, since this matter is already gravely disturbing the social and political stability of democratically elected Governments. Hence ray Government is in favour of a dialogue between creditors and debtors, based on the principles of co-responsibility and the right to development. The attitude recently demonstrated by the developed countries during the Toronto summit in relation to the rescheduling of the debts of the least developed third world countries is only a small step in the right direction. It is obvious that much more will have to be done.\nLet me turn to a more positive note. My Government welcomes the recant concrete proposals containing a new approach in the policy of reunifying the Korean peninsula. It is the earnest hope of my Government that the suspended dialogue will be resumed on the basis of the new proposals. My Government furthermore hopes that in the not too distant future we will be able to welcome a unified Korea as a full Member of our Organization.\nFinally, my Government is highly pleased to note that the United Nations is regaining its well deserved place in the international community as a unique forum for dialogue, understanding and co-operation. Let us hope that this positive development will continue, so that peace and prosperity for all may be achieved in this world of ours. Suriname will contribute to help realize this lofty goal.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to express to Mt. Dante Caputo my sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We are confident that his wisdom and experience will ensure constructive and fruitful deliberations on the very important, indeed vital, issues before the Assembly. I assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation to that end. \n\nMay I also express our deep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the deliberations of both the Assembly's forty-second session and its third special session devoted to disarmament. \n\nI should also like to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General,\nHr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his competent and excellent management of the\naffairs of the Secretariat of our Organization. We are particularly gratified at\nhis devotion to the cause of international peace and security, demonstrated in his\nrelentless efforts to ensure the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts in\ndifferent parts of the world. We congratulate him on the outstanding Success he\nhas scored in these efforts. That success testifies to the enhancement of the role\nof the United Nations.\n\n\nThe General Assembly is in session at a time when the world seems to have\nreached a critical juncture in history. Recently, we have witnessed a number of promising developments in different spheres of international relations which, if sustained, will have far-reaching positive consequences for the future of humankind. The general relaxation in relations between the Soviet Union and the United states, progress so far achieved in disarmament negotiations, the intensification of efforts in seeking peaceful solutions to regional conflicts, and greater awareness of the need for multilateral co-operation in solving the conflicts, political, security, economic and ecological ills afflicting our world are all manifestations of a general improvement in the international climate.\nIt is regrettable, however, that the atmosphere of international relations is still plagued with various unresolved problems and conflicts.  If not solved in the interests of regional and international peace and security, these problems could seriously jeopardize the progress achieved so far. The danger of war and, worse, of nuclear holocaust still looms large, while the upward spiral of the arms race continues unchecked. The tendency to resort to the threat or actual use of force, interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and various forms of political and economic coercion is strong in international relations. Old concepts, attitudes, policies and doctrines continue to govern the behaviour of States towards their neighbours and other countries of the world. This is a situation which is of grave concern to the international community.\n\nThe world community has welcomed with joy and relief the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. The destruction of an entire class of nuclear weapons is, indeed, a historic achievement and a turning point. Men and women in every corner of the world are awaiting with great hope the successful delusion of ongoing negotiations on a 50 per cent reduction of the strategic nuclear arsenals of the two great nuclear Powers. Their hope is that this will prove a happy prelude to the achieved of the long-cherished objective of general and complete disarmament.\nA comprehensive nuclear-test ban is obviously the most significant step towards building the confidence necessary for the further reduction and total elimination of nuclear weapons. Pending total elimination, a treaty on the Prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, coupled with acknowledgment of the universally accepted dictum that a nuclear war cannot be won, and a solemn pledge by all nuclear Powers not to be the first to resort to the use of such weapons, constitutes an essential first step towards assuring man that the macabre vision of total annihilation may indeed be avoided. The establishment of nuclear-free .ones and measures for enhancing nuclear non-proliferation will also serve this purpose.\nWhile nuclear disarmament is indeed of prime importance, considerable\nattention should also be paid to conventional disarmament. Newly emerging\ntechnologies capable of producing new generations of conventional weapons of mass\ndestruction have highlighted the need for the urgent adoption of measures towards\nthe limitation, reduction and total elimination of conventional weapons, in this\ncontext, a radical reduction in the strength of standing armies is also of prime importance.\nThe conclusion of a treaty banning the development, production, stockpiling and use of all types of chemical weapons, including binary weapons, is also of Paramount importance. We welcome the progress made in the Conference on\nDisarmament towards a chemical-weapons-ban treaty and the successful review of the Convention on biological weapons.\n\nThe global economic situation is of particular concern to all the developing countries, while the scientific and technological revolution has provided mankind with the know-how and tools to deal successfully with the problems of underdevelopment, such as hunger, poverty, disease and illiteracy,\nthe prospects the steady progress of the developing countries remain bleak. Inequitable conditions for Participation in international trade, coupled with the burden of\nforeign debt and debt servicing, are frustrating their efforts towards development and progress.\nThe sharp decline in commodity prices, the deterioration in the terms of\ntrade, high interest rates, the protectionist measures adopted by developed countries and the reverse flow of financial resources have deepened the economic crisis that threatens the future of the developing countries. The least developed countries in particular are in a very precarious economic situation. in view of this reality, the need for the establishment of a new international economic order on a Just and equitable basis acquires greater urgency. It is also important to recognize the relationship between disarmament and development. Only the additional human, technological and financial resources released through disarmament can successfully cope with the development needs of the world.\nWithout any doubt one significant manifestation of the general improvement of the international climate is the positive trend towards solving regional conflicts through political means. In the Geneva talks between Iran and Iraq, in Angola, Kampuchea, Nicaragua, Cyprus and Western Sahara dialogue and negotiations have raised high hopes for lasting peace and tranquility for the people of the various regions. These noble efforts deserve full support by the international community.\nIn the Middle East, the situation remains tense owing to the policy of aggression, military occupation and expansionism pursued by Israel. Complete and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Palestinian and other Arab lands, including the Golan Heights and Jerusalem, is the key to a lasting peace in the Middle East. It has been universally recognized that the question of Palestine constitutes the core of the Middle East problem, without full restoration of the undeniable rights of the Palestinian people, inc1uding their right to statehood, no just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem is conceivable.\n\n\nWe who1e-hearted1y welcome the cessation of hostilities and the commencement of the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. We wish both sides every success in the\nGeneva talks, under the auspices of the united Nations, in establishing lasting\npeace and normal relations between the two neighbouring Islamic countries.\n\nIn South Africa, the abhorrent polio, of apartheid continues unabated, depriving millions of human beings of their elementary human rights and freedoms. The Pretoria regime also poses a grave threat to International peace and security through constant acts of aggression against the front-line States, particularly Angola and Mozambique. The negotiations between the interlocutors aimed at resolving the problems of southern Africa by peaceful means are to be commended. The cessation of aggression against Angola and of interference in its internal affairs is the key to normalization of the situation in that country.\n\nWe support the immediate independence of Namibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization, SWAPO, the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people, through the full implementation of the united Nations plan for the independence of Namibia endorsed in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\n\nThe Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan also warmly welcomes the dialogue among the Kampucheans. It is our hope that this dialogue will soon result in peace and tranquility in Kampuchea and co-operation between the countries of Indo-China and members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nThe talks in Nicaragua have also raised high hopes of the restoration of peace\nand normal life in that country, if this is to be achieved, it is essential that outside interference in its internal affairs be ended.\n\nThe dialogue in Cyprus is also encouraging, we reaffirm our support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus.\nMy Government also supports the independence , woeful reunification and national unity of Korea through dialogue and reconciliation.\nWe welcome and support Security Council resolution 621 (1988), on preparations for holding a referendum in Western Sahara, under the supervision of the United Nations in co-operation with the Organization of African Unity.\n\nIt is our firm conviction that constant renewal of our faith in the purposes and principles of the United nations Charter is the only firm guarantee of an improved international climate. The role of the United Nations in safeguarding international peace and security and proofing global operation is indeed vital. The Organization has played a unique and outstanding role in codifying the norms of international conduct, with the aim of making the world an orderly place\nin which to live. It has also demonstrated its vast potential for the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts, we believe that it is time for the United Nations to play a central, primary role in the field of disarmament as well.\nThe Republic of Afghanistan, as a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement. It is firmly committed to the purposes and principles of the Movement. The Movement's recent ministerial Conference at Nicosia demonstrated once again the validity and relevance of the principles of non-alignment in the contemporary world and their positive impact on positive trends in international relations. The Republic of Afghanistan will continue to play a positive and constructive role in the Movement.\n\n\nThe signing of the Geneva Agreements on the situation relating to Afghanistan has been welcomed by the international community as a historic achievement. Statements made so far in the general debate at the forty-third session of the General Assembly have clearly indicated that international support, for which we are grateful, we are particularly grateful to the Secretary-General. Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and his Personal Representative, Mr. Diego Cordovez, for their all-round efforts in the Geneva process. Based on the principle of the United Nations Charter, particularly those of non-interference and non-intervention, the Agreements map out a comprehensive political settled which is in the interest not only of the people of Afghanistan but also of the peoples of the entire region and the cause of international peace and security.\n\nThe Republic of Afghanistan signed the Geneva Agreements in good faith and with a firm resolve to implement all its provisions in letter and in spirit.\n\nTrue to our good intentions, the Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have strictly abided by the provisions of the agreements. The return of Soviet troops from Afghanistan commenced on 15 May 1988. and 50 per cent of the troops had been withdrawn by 15 August, as provided for in the Agreements. The republic of Afghanistan has given every assistance to the united Nations Good offices Mission for Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP) in performance of its duties.\n\nMuch to our regret, however, four and a half months after the entry into force of the Agreements the hope of the people of Afghanistan - indeed, the hope of the entire international community - for the restoration of peace in our country has not yet been fulfilled. War and bloodshed have not subsided. People are being killed, public and private property destroyed and acts of terror perpetrated by armed extremist edition. Kabul and many of other cities have come under a\nconstant barrage of rockets with a range of from 20 to 36 kilometers, 136 such\nrockets were fired on the City Of Kabul in the course of a single day. These blind\nrocket attacks have claimed 760 innocent victims, including women and children, while 346 houses and 45 public buildings have been destroyed. Only two days ago 25 rockets were fired on Kabul. One of them hit a bus station in front of the Ministry of Education, claiming the lives of 35 persons and injuring 163.\n\nWhy does this situation continue after the signing of the agreements?  From where are all these lethal weapons pouring into Afghanistan? The sole reason for this situation is the non-implementation of the Geneva Agreements and their open violation by the other main signatory.\n\nIn contravention of the explicit provisions of the instrument on mutual\nrelations, particularly those relating to non-interference and non-intervention, centers on its territory for training, arming and equipping extremist groups have not been dismantled. The earmarking of modern weapons, including Stinger missiles, long-range artillery and mortars and ground-to-ground rockets for the extremist opposition groups and their transfer to Afghanistan are continuing. A guarantor of the instrument on non-interference and non-intervention is continuing to send\nweapons and equipment to armed extremist groups. The events at Spin Boldak demonstrated that Pakistani militia even participated in the attack carried out by\nthe extremists. At the present time similar situations exist in the provinces of\nKandahar and the Kunars.\nAt the same time I should like to point out clearly that the Government of Afghanistan is directing all its efforts to the implementation of the Geneva Agreements and the settled of the internal situation t, rough dialogue and the establishment of a broad-based Government, with the participation of the seven commanders inside Afghanistan and other influential personalities within and outside the country, with this in view,  Afghanistan is firmly in favour of improving its relations with all its neighbours and strongly opposed to any action that could heighten tension in its relations with them. Afghanistan has never\n\nresorted to small- or large-scale border violations either on land or from the air, and has nothing to do with the internal incidents occurring in neighbouring countries.  We firmly believe that such actions not only are contrary to the Geneva Agreements but will delay and complicate the solution of existing problems.\n\nOn the other hand, the Government of the Republic of Afghanistan has so far brought to the attention of the government of Pakistan 547 cases of open violations, by means of 87 notes presented to UNGOMAP. However, the other side has created serious obstacles to UNGOMAP'ss investigation of these violations. On the pretext of the existence of tribal conflicts and a lack of security,\nprevented from visiting areas which are used for the transfer of weapons to Afghanistan and where large depots of such weapons are located. Contrary to clear provisions of the Geneva Agreements. UWGOMAP has not been granted freedom of movement in the territory of Pakistan. On the contrary, UHGCMAP has to request prior permission from the Pakistan authorities before it can visit areas where violations are taking place, while the Agreements provide that inspections should he completed within 48 hours, it takes two to three weeks to get permission for UNGOMAP visits. Obviously, that is time enough to transfer weapons depots to other\nareas or to transform a military training centre into a school.\n\n\nThis being the case, can it still be claimed that violations have in fact been investigated in accordance with the provisions of the Agreements? In such circumstances no one can really talk about investigations, because the fact is that Violations are taking place and the Agreements are not being implemented.\n\nFurthermore, in spite of our continued requests, meetings between the two sides to\nreview violations have yet to take place, although the Agreements provide that such\nmeetings should take place within 48 hours.\nWe recently proposed a meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the two\nmain signatories and the two guarantors to review the process of the implementation\nof the Agreements. Regrettably, however, Pakistan and the United states have not responded positively to this practical request.\n\nAgreements, mixed commissions for facilitate the return of Afghan refugees should have been established a long time ago. However, four and a half months after the entry into force of Agreements, the other side has shown no readiness to implement this important provision. If the\nAfghan refugees are such a heavy burden, then why have such commissions not been\nestablished on the basis of the provisions of the third instruct of the Geneva\nAgreements, as is the wish of the Republic of Afghanistan and of the Afghan\nrefugees? On the contrary, conditions and prerequisites being created with\nrespect to their return.\n\nAs to the Government of Afghanistan, it has taken all the necessary steps to receive the refugees. A ministry has been established for this purpose, which has so far welcomed 152,000 returnees. To assure the refugees, and with due respect to the traditions of our people, border areas have been proclaimed non-military zones. An agreement has been concluded with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and its office has been opened in Afghanistan. A similar agreement has been concluded with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nIn this connection, we sincerely appreciate the initiative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to launch an appeal for international relief assistance to the people of Afghanistan. We warmly welcome the designation of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, an internationally renowned personality with rich experience in international humanitarian efforts, as the co-ordinator of such assistance. I should also like to express our gratitude to all those countries which have shown readiness to assist in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\n\nAlthough in the present circumstances internal efforts for peace and\ntranquility inside Afghanistan are adversely affected by continued interference\nfrom outside, the policy of national reconciliation has opened its way in the minds\nand hearts of the Afghan people, inside and outside the country. After an interval\nof 15 years, an elected parliament, in which different parties are represented, is\nfunctioning in the country, A new coalition Government, including 18 non-party\nmembers out of a total of 31 meters, has received a vote of confidence from the parliament.\nIn this connection, let me reiterate that we deeply believe in negotiations and reconciliation and it is our conviction that, through dialogue, agreement on the mechanism for the formation of a broad-based coalition government could be achieved. The fact is that if the Geneva agreements are implemented and interference from outside is thereby stopped, the Government and people of\nAfghanistan, through the continuation of the national dialogue establish peace and national accord in their country. Tired of years of fratricidal war. the people of Afghanistan, both inside and outside the country, will join hands in a coalition government to reconstruct their land, which has suffered through 10 long years of war and destruction.\nThe Government of the Republic of Afghanistan is making every effort to ensure that, on the one hand, the situation relating to Afghanistan is through\nstrict implementation of the Geneva Agreements and. on the other, that on the basis of the establishment of a genuine coalition inside. Afghanistan, as a non-aligned and neutral country, will pursue a policy with regard to the improvement of\nregional and international relations that will correspond to the balance of interest of all the other countries of the world, including the Soviet Onion, the United states, Pakistan, India, China, Iran, the Islamic countries and members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. At the same time, we hope that the new leadership in Pakistan, taking into consideration the existing realities, will adopt a constructive position towards the elimination of the existing tense situation, and will play its role\nimproving the relations between the two countries and the situation in the region through the strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements. These agreements constitute a firm basis for this purpose, which is in the interest of all the peoples of the region and the cause of international peace and security.\nIt is profoundly clear that it was in the light of increasing interference from abroad that the Government of Afghanistan had called for Soviet assistance, to enable the people of Afghanistan to repulse the threat from outside. At present the withdrawal of Soviet troops is in place in accordance with the time-frame envisaged in the Geneva, Agreements, but, at the same time, interference has not ceased. If this situation is not corrected in time, South West Asia will continue\nto remain a region of conflict, tension and a threat to international peace security, m such cases, Afghanistan and the Soviet Union reserve the right to adopt coordinated measures as called for by the situation. \n\nIn the light of the signing of the Geneva Agreements and the continued implementation of the policy of national reconciliation, we do not see any need for the discussion of item 30 on the agenda of this Assembly. It is our conviction, however, that any such discussion should focus on the need for the strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements. We are ready to work towards a consensus resolution, taking into consideration the concerns of all the sides. Nicosia proved that, given the political will and the existence of a genuine resolve to make a constructive contribution to the restoration of peace, stability and security in our region, it should not prove difficult to reach such a consensus.\nRecently, our world has arrived at the threshold of a new era of understanding, of mutual efforts for peacefully resolving conflicts and for promoting peace and disarmament. It is the great hope of the world community that this trend will not prove ephemeral but acquire a permanent character. We are ready to co-operate towards this noble end. We are particularly willing to co-operate in turning our own part of the world into a region of peace, stability, co-operation, understanding and good-neighbourliness in the interest of all our Peoples and of the cause of international peace and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first to offer to the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, on behalf of the delegation of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, our cordial congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\nThere can be no doubt that Mr. Caputo\u2019s sound diplomatic judgement and long experience in international affairs will be exceedingly helpful to us. We regard them as a strong pledge of a successful outcome of our work.\nLet me take this opportunity also to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, for the dedication and competence with which he conducted the work of the last session of the General Assembly.\nIt should be emphasized that the last session of the General Assembly, and in particular the third special session devoted to disarmament, opened up welcome prospects for a strengthening of multilateralism.\nThis state of affairs is, without any doubt, due to a heightened awareness of the dangers that threaten our planet. But in particular we must acknowledge that we are indebted, above all, to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, to preserve peace in the world. Let me offer to him our most emphatic appreciation and profound support.\nAs I have just emphasized, each of us will have noticed that confrontation is gradually yielding to a better understanding, which thus gives us hope for the gradual elimination of the tension and conflict which had characterized international relations. We must work hard to encourage and consolidate these gains so as to meet the challenge of our age and respond to the calls for peace and justice which resound throughout the world.\nWe welcome particularly the fact that after eight years of war, Iran and Iraq have agreed to a cease-fire and are meeting at the negotiating table under the auspices of the Secretary-General. We encourage them to press ahead with their dialogue and to show patience and tolerance so that they may arrive, in the near future, at a felicitous outcome in keeping with our hopes.\nThe situation in Afghanistan has developed in a positive manner, as was shown by the Geneva Accords completed last April.\nIn our opinion, this is a decisive element in the quest for a peaceful settlement, which we earnestly hope for and which we trust will enable the brotherly people of Afghanistan freely to enjoy its sovereignty.\nIt is crucially important in this regard that the process of the withdrawal of foreign troops should continue in order to eliminate any interference in the internal affairs of that country.\nAs we refer to this problem we have in mind the thousands of Afghan refugees who have had to seek refuge in neighbouring countries, particularly in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, whose late and much lamented President, Zia Al Haa, paid with his life for his commitment to peace. We pay a tribute here to his courage and beg Allah, the all-powerful, to grant blessing and eternal peace to his soul. In the same vein, the problem o\u00a3 Namibia is also moving towards a solution. We emphatically support the diplomatic activities being carried out in that part of the world to find a peaceful solution of the problem. It is our firm belief that settlement of the Namibian question must necessarily Involve the implementation of Security Council 435 (1978).\nNotwithstanding such tangible progress, we still deplore the persistence in southern Africa of the odious system of apartheid, giving rise to an explosive situation that threatens the political stability of the countries of the region. My country condemns without reservation the inhuman system of apartheid and calls for its abolition, as this is the only way to restore civil peace in South Africa and political stability in that part of the continent.\nWe are gratified to note that we are moving towards a just and lasting solution of the problem of Western Sahara. In this regard, we welcome the fact that the peace plan proposed jointly by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity has been accepted by the parties to the conflict. We encourage them to persevere in their efforts to achieve a lasting solution of the problem.\nAs regards Kampuchea, it is most distressing to us that that country continues to be subject to military occupation, in spite of the General Assembly resolutions calling for the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops. It is our belief that the people of Kampuchea is entitled to a free choice of the system of government it deems most suitable, without any external constraints. Thus we have been following with great interest and encouraging the process of dialogue that was recently started among a)I the parties concerned.\nWhile in some parts of the world there is hope for the restoration of peace, the Middle East region, on the other hand, does not enjoy the same relaxation of tension. The deterioration of the situation in the occupied Arab territories serves to emphasize the gravity of the danger to international peace and security. We cannot remain indifferent to the atrocious acts of terrorism perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian Arab population, which have taken the form of barbarous crimes, the despoliation of their property and the expulsion of Palestinian Arabs from their territory. It is the duty of the international community to use every means available to it to put an end to such actions.\nMy country continues to believe that there can be no lasting peace in the Middle East without the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, particularly Security Council resolutions 252 (1968) and 338 (1973), duly taking into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, in particular its right to self-determination. My delegation supports the idea of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned, obviously including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people.\nAnother problem of equal importance is deserving of our consideration, that is, the situation prevailing in the Korean peninsula. We are pleased that the parties to the conflict have taken a constructive stand, with a view to finding a solution of the problem through dialogue and mutual agreement. We encourage them to press ahead along that path and we assure them of our support in their quest for a peaceful settlement. We believe that the admission of both Koreas to this Organisation would do mud to promote a rapid solution of the problem.\nMy country, like others of the same region, continues to be concerned by the military build-up in the Indian Ocean. For that reason we support the convening of a conference with the object of making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace is demilitarised, and denuclearised, in accordance with the Declaration contained in General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI). \n\nBefore concluding these political remarks, let me refer again to a problem of the highest concern to the international community as a whole in the sense that it emanates from an injustice and a breach of the territorial integrity of my country, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, I refer, of course, to the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte. The problem is on the agenda of the Assembly for this session, because no solution has yet been found to it. Therefore we shall have an opportunity to come back to it in greater detail. However let me now point out to the Assembly that the Comorian people remain concerned by the persistence of this problem notwithstanding the open-mindedness it has always manifested and its willingness to adopt the path of dialogue and mutual agreement, in accordance with the principles of the Charter and the United Nations resolutions on the subject.\nWithout wishing to anticipate the debate that is shortly to take place, let me take this opportunity to reaffirm once more from this rostrum that the Comorian Government and people, strengthened by the justness of their cause, will spare no effort to restore the territorial integrity of their country. The international community, for its part, faithful to the sacred principles of the Charter, is in duty bound to support them until their just cause has triumphed.\nWhile we can welcome the new hope prevailing in international political relations, it is nevertheless deplorable that the economic situation is more disturbing than ever. Our session is taking place at a time when the economic crisis is having an increasing impact and is greatly detrimental to the majority of the developing countries, particularly the weakest among them, commonly known as the \\\"least developed countries\\\". My country, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, which is one of those countries, is stricken particularly hard by the damaging effects of that crisis. These include dislocation of the international economic system characterized by a decline in the amount of capital available on favourable terms, which gives rise to inordinate growth of the debt burden in relation to the repayment capacities of the developing countries, and also an abrupt lowering of in commodity prices.\nMy country, being an island with a small area and quite lacking in mineral resources, is confronted with major obstacles in implementing the development process in which it engaged after acquiring its independence, under the enlightened guidance of Mr, Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane, President of the Republic. The obstacles to which I have just referred include in particular lack of sales of the products that account for 90 per cent of our export earnings and lower prices for those products. They also include the three-fold increase in the volume of our debt service in less than three years; the intransigence of our creditors on the clearly unfavourable terms of their loans the reduction in absolute values of our export earnings; the failure of certain of our partners to meet commitments entered into at the Round Table of Donors, held in Moroni, our capital, in July 1984.\nNotwithstanding these numerous constraints, my Government continues to work hard to sustain growth and improve the living conditions of its people. Accordingly, it has embarked upon a programme of restructuring, particularly in the productive sectors. This has been accompanied, inter alia, by a series of measures designed to restore the health of public finances and of the para-public sector.\nIn particular, this has made it possible to better rationalize the functioning of the State and to sustain growth by favouring private initiative and highly productive activities.\nThe policy of economic recovery thus begun has given rise to some noteworthy performances until 1983.\nAs a result of the multiplier effect of the programme our country had, during that period, attained an appreciable economic growth rate and tangible improvement in teal per capita income.\nHowever, the worsening of the international environment of my country, characterized by the sharp drop in our commodity prices and the rapid expansion of debt service payments caused by the exorbitant rise in interest rates and the exchange rates of the principal currencies used on the credit market, has, since then, wiped out our own domestic efforts. But we are not disheartened.\nThe Comorian Government remains firmly committed to the spirit of enterprise and is determined to press on with its fight against under-development. None the less, without increased and sustained assistance from the international community, my country will be unable to meet its objectives. Therefore this year again I urgently appeal for good will on the part of all to demonstrate practical solidarity with my country by providing valuable support as called for in the relevant resolutions of the Organization.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm the unswerving commitment of the Comorian Government and people to the United Nations system and the ideals of peace and justice it embodies. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nAllow me to start by congratulating Mr, Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. This attests to his proved diplomatic skills and tact as a statesman and to the important role that his country  Argentina, continues to play in promoting international understanding, peace and co-operation. With his wisdom and experience, I have no doubt that he will guide our deliberations with distinction.\nLast year we elected Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic to preside over the meetings of the Assembly. We discharged his onerous duties with outstanding competence and dedication. I should like, therefore, to take this opportunity to thank him for his contribution to the work of our Organization.\nI wish also to express Zambia's appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, for the leadership he has provided to the United Nations and for his patience and tenacity in bringing peace to areas of tension.\nUntil recently, the United Nations, and indeed the entire multilateral system, have been subjected to severe strains and challenges because of the continuing threat of nuclear war, regional conflicts and the most difficult economic crisis facing the developing countries.\nHowever,  as we move closer to the beginning of the 1990s, hope and promise are beginning to emerge in the sphere of international political relations. The most important indication of changed perspectives and policies is the improvement in the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States signified by the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - in a concrete and significant step towards disarmament.\nThe hope that we all now share is that the United States and the Soviet Union will build on this foundation and cut back on the remaining nuclear stockpiles, on chemical and biological arsenals and on conventional arms, with a view to their eventual elimination in pursuance of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.\nThe convening of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament here in New York earlier this year represented yet another multilateral effort to advance the cause of disarmament. The failure of that session was a source of great disappointment to many of us because it was a blow against multilateralism as well. We had hoped that progress at that conference would give further encouragement to the Soviet Union and the United States to undertake further disarmament efforts. We should, however, not relent in our efforts to bring about general and complete disarmament under effective international control. It is our considered view, therefore, that another attempt should be made in the not-too-distant future to hold a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to address the urgent issues facing mankind today.\nAnother area where there has been co-operation between the Soviet Union and the United States is the Treaty negotiated by the United Nations aimed at ending the conflict in Afghanistan. It is a matter of regret, however, that although the Treaty was intended to bring peace to that long-suffering country, the reality is that the provisions of that Agreement are not being fully observed. Zambia urges all those involved to give teal and practical meaning to the Treaty so that peace may quickly return to Afghanistan. Zambia also wishes to compliment the Soviet Union for observing its side of the Agreement.\t.\nFor a long time, we have been greatly distressed by the war between Iran and Iraq. The heavy loss of life and property, the danger that the war might spread beyond the borders of the two combatants and the presence of foreign fleets in the Gulf have all underlined the gravity of the situation. We are delighted that both Iran and Iraq have now accepted Security Council resolution 598 (1987) which provides for ending the war. Zambia commends both countries for their courage and statesmanship in adopting diplomacy as a substitute for war. It is a historical fact that conflicts end at the negotiating table. For this reason we are encouraged by the recent report that the two parties met in direct talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General at United Nations Headquarters. We urge them to move rapidly towards the implementation of the remainder of resolution 598 (1987).\nIn urging Iran and Iraq to move towards the cease-fire, the United Nations has played a singular role demonstrating since again that the world body and its Charter remain important instruments of peace.\nThe United Nations has also been active in Western Sahara. The fact that the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and Morocco have accepted in principle the Secretary-General's proposal that a referendum be held to determine the future of the territory is an important step towards resolving this problem. However, a number of important issues remain to be resolved. Only when these are resolved can there be a free and fair referendum in the territory. Furthermore, in carrying out this process, it is important to ensure that the credibility and image of the United Nations remain untarnished.\nThe Middle East remains an area of tension. The central issue has always been whether the Palestinian people will be free, like any other people, to attain and exercise their inalienable rights, their self-determination and their right to national independence. But there are, in addition, the questions of occupied Arab lands and the status of Jerusalem, in our view, these issues require to be addressed if peace and security for all are to return to the Middle East.\nRecently the Palestinian people stepped up their resistance to Israeli rule and occupation. Instead of resolving the underlying problems, Israel has responded with an iron hand, resulting in great loss of Palestinian life. It is our belief that a just and comprehensive peace in the region can only come out of an international conference on peace in the Middle East in conformity with paragraph 6 of the Geneva Declaration, General Assembly resolutions 38/58 C of 1983, 42/66 D of 1987, and other relevant resolutions.\nThe Palestinian people and the people of Israel both desire peace and security. That is why it is important that both peoples be represented at the proposed conference by their genuine leaders. The Palestine Liberation Organization (\u0420LO) represents the Palestinian people and must therefore attend as a full member. The security of Israel lies in negotiating peace with the genuine leaders of the Palestinian people.\nLast month I joined my colleagues of the non-aligned countries at out conference on the island of Cyprus. We saw for ourselves the reality of the division of the island into two separate communities. My delegation to that conference was heartened by the Secretary-General's efforts which culminated in the Geneva meeting last August between the President of Cyprus, Mr. George Vassiliou, and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot Community, Mr. Rauf Denktash.\nZambia hopes that the negotiations under way will result in the reconciliation of the two sides, the withdrawal of foreign troops and settlers, and the voluntary return of refugees to their homes. May I be permitted to make a few remarks about Kampuchea and the Korean peninsula? Zambia welcomes the recent statement by Viet Nam about the withdrawal of its troops from Kampuchea. We also support the results of the Jakarta informal meeting by the various factions of Kampuchea, We believe that the road to peace lies in the withdrawal of foreign troops from that country and in a political settlement by the various factions.\nTension continues in the Korean peninsula. The issue is the peaceful reunification of that land through dialogue and consultation between the North and South. Zambia welcomes the recent moves aimed at reducing tension and increasing trade between the two sides. These must be seen as initial steps towards the political reunification of Korea.\nCentral America is another troubled region that requires serious attention. Peace will never return to that region until foreign interference and destabilization cease.-. Nicaragua, in particular, is one country that has been and continues to be a victim of externally sponsored acts of destabilisation.\nZambia welcomes' and supports the Peace Agreement signed by the five Presidents of the area in Guatemala in August last year and calls upon the rest of the international community to endorse those efforts whose aim is to bring peace to Central America. At the same time, we urge the Governments of the region to continue their efforts by complying with the terms and conditions provided for in the Agreement. We also appeal to the United States to cease its support to the contras and efforts to undermine the economy of Nicaragua. This will enable the process of dialogue between the Government of Nicaragua and the contras to move forward and make progress. The situation in southern Africa continues to be grave. The South African apartheid regime, though still entrenched, is shaken by the general opposition to apartheid by the international community and by the courage and determination of the black population in the fight against the evil system.\nState terrorism against the black population remains the cornerstone of apartheid, with the South African army playing the leading role in the campaign of repression and violence. The number of organizations and individuals banned keeps growing as the opposition to apartheid increases.\nEvidence available indicates that the economic and financial sanctions already in place are working. South African leaders have themselves admitted this, thereby disproving those who have said that sanctions do not work. There is, however, evidence to show that a small number of countries in the Far East, Europe and Latin America, is taking advantage of the situated created by the sanctions. We appeal to them to cease aiding South Africa and to join the rest of the international community in opposing apartheid. In this respect we commend those countries which are faithfully observing the existing sections against South Africa. We appeal to the rest of the international community to apply more sanctions and to tighten the existing ones. In this regard we commend those countries and institutions which have taken and are taking measures to further isolate South Africa economically.\nThere is also evidence to show that arms in various forms are still flowing to racist South Africa in contravention of the arms embargo against that country. South Africa must be denied the means to wage war against its own people and its neighbours. We appeal to the Western countries involved to strictly observe the mandatory United Nations arms embargo against South Africa enshrined in United Nations Security Council resolution 418 (1977) and in subsequent resolutions. We appeal to the United Nations Security Council finally to give real meaning to its resolution 421 (1977) and make the Committee established under that resolution more effective. As a further means of isolating the apartheid regime, we also strongly urge the strict observance and enforcement by the international community of the United Nations oil embargo against South Africa. The time has come for the United Nations Security Council to institute a mandatory oil embargo against South Africa. Moreover, in order to intensify dissemination of information against apartheid, the United Nations should expand its anti-apartheid programmes to combat racist South Africa's censorship measures and disinformation campaign.\nThe additional pressure on South Africa we are calling for is intended to persuade the regime to hold talks with the genuine leaders of the black population so that together they can chart a new future for their country and their people. It is our firm belief that the best way of moving forward is for the genuine leaders of the oppressed majority and their white counterparts to be present at the negotiations. That is why we have called for the release from prison of Nelson Mandela and his colleagues and the unbanning of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azanla (PAC).\nTen years after the adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978), the situation in Namibia remains unchanged. South Africa continues its illegal and armed occupation of that territory despite the efforts of the international community to end such occupation and the gallant efforts of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAFO), the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people. We continue to reject \\\"linkage\\\" as irrelevant to the issue of Namibia's independence.\nAs in South Africa, the apartheid regime employs terrorism as the cornerstone of its policy in Namibia. The regime also uses the territory of Namibia for the purpose of carrying out aggression against the neighbouring independent African States, especially Angola and Mozambique. We call on the international community to Intensify its pressure on the Pretoria regime until Namibia is free. We also call on those concerned to cease exploitation of the natural resources of Namibia.\nSouth Africa's aggression against the neighbouring independent States continues unabated. Angola and Mozambique have suffered the most from this aggression, which has been perpetrated in collaboration with local bandit groups. The rest of our countries in the region have also suffered direct aggression by South Africa.\nThe economic cost of apartheid to us has been extremely heavy. An estimate of physical damage in Angola between 1975 and 1985 totals $US 17 billion. Mozambique has estimated its losses between 1980 and 1985 at 3US 5.5 billion. If damage in the rest of the region were added, the total estimated cost would be between $US 25 billion and $US 30 billion. Against this background the front-line States and other neighbouring independent African States need urgent assistance, including military assistance, to enable them to withstand the effects of South Africa's destabilization and aggression.\nLast August, in Oslo, we tried to address the humanitarian dimension of destabilization. At the International Conference on the Plight of Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons convened by the Organization of African Unity and supported by the United Nations we discussed how the international community can best assist the more than 1.3 million refugees, 5 million displaced persons and the countries of refuge. The immediate requirements are basic: food, medicines, water, sanitation, shelter and clothing. Parallel with the provision of these necessities, is the need to resettle all these people and to rehabilitate the economic and social infrastructure, mainly in Mozambique and Angola. \nOne aspect of destabilization that continues to concern us is the ongoing supply of arms to the UNITA bandits. We appeal to the United States to end this support so that the Angolan people themselves can commence the process of restoring peace to their country. Let me refer briefly to the ongoing negotiations involving Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States. While we welcome these developments, we remain cautious about South Africa's credibility in negotiations involving self-determination and the peaceful settlement of disputes. South Africa's record is replete with failed commitments to international agreements. The Nkomati and the Lusaka Agreements come readily to mind. With regard to the recent diplomatic offensive by South Africa, it is our conviction that this is merely a ploy designed to buy time for apartheid and to enhance South Africa's tarnished image in order to pre-empt further sanctions.\nAt the outset I referred to the crisis facing the third world economy. Let me now turn to that issue and speak specifically about the economic crisis facing Africa.\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking place against the background of a continuing economic crisis in Africa despite the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. This crisis has revealed itself in poor economic performance and falling standards of living among the people of Africa. The political and social consequences of the crisis are alarming.\nA combination of domestic, external and natural factors accounts for this situation. The domestic factors are essentially structural and include the following: low saving ratios, narrow export base, shortage of key skills and rapid growth of population. Under the ongoing reform programmes in many African countries, these problems are being addressed, often at a very high social and political cost. However, it is in the external sector that Africa's problems are greatest. The fundamental issue is the unequal economic relations between the rich North and the poor South and the persistent refusal by the former to establish a new international economic order based on the principles of equity and mutual interest. The fact that the South has no role whatsoever in fixing the prices of its exports and imports is the central problem.\nThe inevitable outcome of these relations is that invariably the prices of our conditions are almost permanently depressed while those of industrial goods are always on the rise. No wonder our terms of trade are always against us. This, in turn, affects our capacity to import the raw materials and spare parts we need. Nor has this trade imbalance been made up by sufficient capital flows to Africa. During the early 1980s, deficits in our current account were financed by net capital flows. These flows have since declined and what we now have is net outflow of resources mainly to the multilateral financial institutions.\nThe debt problem has contributed very significantly to the economic difficulties of Africa. The debt burden, as measured by such indicators as the ratio of debt-service payments to export receipts, has readied alarming proportions. In an increasing number of African countries, such ratios are well in excess of 100 per cent. In such countries, the resolution of the debt problem is a necessary condition for the resumption of growth. That is why Zambia expresses its thanks and appreciation .to those countries that have agreed to forgive part or the whole of the outstanding debt by African countries.\nA number of other proposals have been made on ways and means of assisting Africa to overcome its economic difficulties and especially the debt problem. While these proposals are welcome, it is necessary to observe that they have often been made without any input from Africa itself. As a result, many proposals have not taken into account the political and social conditions prevailing in our respective countries. These conditions affect our capacity to implement the proposed solutions.\nIt is against this background that Africa has proposed a meeting with the creditors on the issue of the external debt so that measures to resolve the problem take into full account the realities of the situation.\nAnother external factor that has affected some of our economies is political and economic destabilization such as that carried out by South Africa against the neighbouring independent African States. As I have shown, the cost of destabilization is very high indeed.\nIn addition to these domestic and external factors, Africa has suffered from natural catastrophes. The most important of these ace floods, drought, desertification, and more recently, locusts. All these impact our economies negatively. In these circumstances, Africa's plea has been that its reform programme be supported by greater inflows of real resources, from Africa's own exports, from increased bilateral and multilateral assistance and from debt relief. In this way, the international community will be responding adequately to Africa's current economic crisis.\nFinally, with the lowering of tension between the East and the West, the world has an opportunity to create a safer and better future for all through genuine disarmament and co-operation in resolving all other global, regional and indeed the economic crises facing the third world. As has been demonstrated in recent years, the multilateralism that the United Nations represents remains the key to world peace and progress. Therefore, it is my country's fervent hope that all Member States will renew their commitment and continue to render full and unconditional political and financial support to our Organization for the common benefit of mankind as a whole. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThis General Assembly is meeting at a very auspicious time indeed. While last year we were talking about some improvement in international relations, we have to note that the movement begun, in particular by the United States and the USSR, is now opening up new prospects for peace in many conflicts and hotbeds of tension throughout the world.\nActions by the United Nations and, above all, by the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, have been exemplary. The tireless work of our Secretary-General and of the distinguished colleagues surrounding him have given our Organization new prestige. Since the founding of the United Nations we have seldom found so many reasons to celebrate the events that have occurred in the course of the year.\nIn disarmament the agreement on medium-range nuclear missiles is, for the first time, leading us towards the destruction of an entire category of weapons and in its wake the negotiations between the two super-Powers are continuing with a view to reducing strategic weapons by 50 per cent.\nThere are now new prospects for a whole series of conflicts that are too often described as regional: in Afghanistan, between Iraq and Iran, in southern Africa, in Cyprus, in the Western Sahara and in Cambodia.\nIn other zones of conflict or tension, the time is now one of detente or of rapprochement of parties which only yesterday were pitted one against the other. This is what is happening in the Horn of Africa, in the Maghreb and in Korea.\nIn general terms these achievements and this progress have been the concrete manifestation of a substantial improvement in international relations. Every day we see new signs of a greater community of interests and of a growing convergence of views.\nBut let us beware of euphoria.\nLet us make sure first of all that the agreements signed are respected and implemented in good faith. An agreement in principle, even a signature, does not always lead us to peace.\nFor example, in Central America the Esquipulas II agreement, although signed, has not yet put an end to tension in the region.\nIn the Middle East and in South Africa the situation has worsened. Other armed and bloody conflicts - and, alas, too little is said of them - ate also continuing. There is still a long and difficult road to travel as regards disarmament. Terrorism continues to wreak havoc and threatens the lives of innocent civilians. Unemployment, failure to respect minorities, the emergence of new inequalities, intolerance in the most varied forms, violations of human rights all daily feed tension, frustration and violence.\nThe world economic and social situation also remains a disturbing one. Ecological challenges are increasingly disturbing also.\nAs Europeans, we follow with particular interest developments now under way within the Soviet Union and in other countries in Eastern Europe. The changes that have been announced should lead to a thorough reform in those States through democratization of political bodies based on true transparency in public affairs and decentralization of the economic structures.\nThe new Soviet foreign policy is characterized by a less dogmatic, more realistic and more pragmatic assessment of international events.\nThere is no doubt that this development in the Soviet Union has contributed to a substantial improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.\nA perception of limits, even for super-Powers, in the field of military power and in the field of commitments to weapons abroad has promoted this change. The constraints of internal economic development and growing interdependence in a multipolar world no longer allows one State to dictate its will to another. And so it turns out that a solution to problems can more reliably be found through peaceful means, through dialogue, negotiation and co-operation.\nWho could fail to hail the rapprochement between the two super-Powers confirmed by the Washington and Moscow summit meetings?\nThis logic has been applied also in Europe, where a new phase of d\u00e9tente and co-operation has begun. Recognition of the European Community by various countries in Eastern Europe has now been achieved. Following the agreement signed at Luxembourg between our Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), negotiations are now under way with the countries of Eastern Europe with a view to the conclusion of agreements that can strengthen economic co-operation.\nAt the follow-up Conference in Vienna, the 35 signatories of the Helsinki Final Act are about to agree on new orientations which deal, in particular, with respect for human rights and human contacts among all European citizens. I trust that its work will finish soon and that this will be followed by the opening of negotiations on conventional stability in Europe. The goal sought is twofold; first, to establish, through asymmetrical reductions, a stable, secure and verifiable balance of conventional forces in Europe at a lower level; and, secondly, to find new measures that can also help to consolidate trust and security in the wake of the Stockholm agreement.\nOn the question of Afghanistan, the Government of Luxembourg supports respect for the Geneva Agreements by all the parties. We expect, inter alia, that the Soviet Union will soon conclude the complete withdrawal of its forces in accordance with the scheduled timetable. Unfortunately, however, we must note that fighting continues in that country, which prolongs the suffering of the Afghan people and delays the return of some 5 million refugees.\nIt is only the establishment in Kabul of a truly independent and representative Government within the framework of a genuine process of self-determination - in other words, with the participation of all Afghans, including the resistance forces - that can make true peace possible, along with the reconstruction of the country, which has been devastated by eight years of occupation. My Government is willing to participate in the efforts based on international solidarity in support of the Afghan people. \nThe world public welcomed with relief and tremendous satisfaction the halting of the murderous war between Iran and Iraq. That conflict lasted eight years, causing the death of more than 1 million young soldiers and civilians, the mutilation of hundreds of thousands of others and the destruction of entire towns. What senseless and absurd sacrifices at the altar of the delusions of grandeur of States, religious fanaticism and unbridled nationalism! We unreservedly support the efforts of the Secretary-General in the negotiations under way to bring about a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement in accordance with resolution 598 (1987).\nThe systematic mining of the international waters of the Persian Gulf and the repeated acts of violence deliberately unleashed by the two belligerents against the ships of third countries sailing in the region elicited unanimous condemnation in my country. Similarly, we deplore the destruction of an Iranian air bus, with the death of 300 civilians. We trust that the situation in the Gulf is now returning to normal and that freedom of navigation can be ensured in accordance with international law.\nIn Cyprus, the representatives of the two communities of the island agreed a few days ago to resume negotiations in Nicosia under the auspices of the Secretary-General. I hope most sincerely that this will happen within the scheduled time-frame. An overall settlement of the conflict must lead to the withdrawal of the Turkish troops occupying part of the Republic of Cyprus and to reconciliation between the two communities, so that 14 years of division can be ended. \nIn the Western Sahara conflict, the conditions for the implementation of the peace plan accepted by the two parties seem to have been met in principle. The proclamation of a cease-fire and the organization of a referendum, under the auspices of this Organization, should enable the Sahraoui people to exercise their right to self-determination freely and without constraint.\nI also welcome the significant progress made by South Korea towards democratization. The youth of the entire world is now meeting in that country to participate in the Olympic Games. Is it not by virtue of that same principle of universality that we should now consider admitting the Republic of Korea to membership of the United Nations?\nOn the question of Cambodia, we have followed with interest and hope the various diplomatic initiatives that have been undertaken in the last few months. They demonstrate for the first time since the conflict erupted a growing political will on the part of all the parties concerned to arrive at a negotiated solution.\nAt the informal meeting in Jakarta, which for the first time brought together the different political forces in Cambodia, Viet Nam and the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), various peace proposals were put forward and discussed and a working procedure was agreed upon. As the General Assembly has clearly reaffirmed year after year, the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops is the central element of any settlement, which must enable the Cambodian people to decide freely on their own future. Any possibility of returning to the atrocities committed under the Pol Pot regime must be completely avoided. The United Nations and the international community could well find themselves entrusted with a decisive responsibility for the implementation of such a settlement.\nWill our Organization soon be able to welcome Namibia as the 160th Member, which would be the successful crowning of the actions taken by the United Nations almost since the beginning to end an illegal occupation and complete the historic task of decolonization? The question would seem to be justified in view of the results achieved so far during the negotiations that have been going on for some years now between South Africa, Cuba and Angola, thanks to the mediation of Mr. Chester Crocker, the United States Deputy Secretary for African Affairs. Those countries have reached agreement on a set of principles for a political settlement of the conflict.\nWe hope that the negotiations will provide without further delay a precise time-frame for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. Hostilities have already ceased. South African troops have left Angola. The parties to the conflict have agreed to propose to the Secretary-General the date of 1 November next for the implementation of resolution 435 (1978), which was adopted 10 years ago by the Security Council. That resolution provides for the withdrawal of South Africa's illegal administration from Namibia, the transfer of power to the Namibian people and preparations for the accession to independence of Namibia through free elections under the supervision and monitoring of the United Nations.\nThe situation in South Africa is still a matter of serious concern. No progress towards the abolition of the intolerable system of apartheid has been achieved; quite the contrary. Instead of entering into a national dialogue, the South African Government has prolonged and renewed the state of emergency and the accompanying legislation. It has made the system of repression even harsher and increased censorship.\nNelson Mandela has just had his seventieth birthday in prison. A symbol for millions of oppressed people inside and outside South Africa, Mandela represents the unquenchable hope for a united, democratic South Africa free of racial discrimination. I repeat once again the appeal made by my Government, as by many others, for his release and for the release of other political prisoners and of the many children and adolescents who have been unjustly imprisoned. We feel directly concerned and involved in the fate of the condemned Sharpeville Six. The Government of South Africa has recognized the merits of a negotiated settlement in the case of Namibia. I venture to hope that it will reach the conclusion that the time has come to find a negotiated solution that will eliminate apartheid once and for all. In the meantime, my Government will remain faithful to the decisions taken by the European Community, under the presidency of Luxembourg, whether it be a question of sanctions or of positive measures of support for the victims of apartheid and for the front-line States. Luxembourg will also continue its action at the national level, particularly in the financial sphere, in support of the organizations struggling peacefully against apartheid.\nI turn now to Central America. The tremendous hopes raised a year ago by the Esquipulas II agreement have been dashed. The negotiations have become dangerously bogged down. While military activities seem to have dropped off, the process of national reconciliation has not led to results in any of the countries concerned. Injustices in the social and economic structures - the fundamental cause of the upheavals in the region - have not been remedied so far. I appeal to the Governments concerned to relaunch the peace process and courageously shoulder the obligations arising from the Esquipulas II agreement. Peace in the region results from the establishment in each of these countries of true democratic pluralism, respect for human rights and the promotion of social justice. It is incumbent on us, in turn, to respect the principles of international law, and in particular the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of any of the countries.\nIn the Middle East, the uprising by the Palestinians in the occupied territories has demonstrated, by its spontaneous and lasting nature, the extent of the frustration and disappointment of those who, despite their precarious living conditions, refuse to accept the humiliating situation of a people deprived of its legitimate rights. My country has always defended Israel's right to exist as a State, and we shall continue to do so. We therefore regret all the more that Israel has in the past few months had recourse to measures of repression that have often been brutal. Far from solving the problem, such measures have only increased the Palestinians' distrust and their determination to refuse to accept occupation.\nThrough his tireless, constant contacts, the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Shultz, has tried to achieve a renewal of the dialogue and the beginning of a peace process on the basis of a consistent and comprehensive plan.\nEvents in the past few months have demonstrated that the status quo is unacceptable. They have emphasized the urgent need for a negotiated solution. A growing majority of Member States already accept the idea of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations. Such a conference could serve as a framework for direct negotiations between the parties concerned. It would also be called upon to define the transitional measures and the security guarantees required. It is for us - each and every one of us - to encourage this process of negotiation and to ask the Secretary-General to continue his consultations.\nAny comprehensive, just and lasting settlement must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 {1973) on recognition of the State of Israel within secure and recognized borders, and on recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to self-determination.\nThe decision by the King of Jordan to break the legal and administrative ties between his country and the West Bank is an act of great significance. It should lead the Palestinians to shoulder new responsibilities, and it opens new prospects. \nForty years ago, on 10 December 1948, the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That was indeed an event of historic significance. Despite some progress made since then, we have to say that throughout the world violations of human rights continue at an alarming rate. Torture is still a quasi-institutionalised practice in many States. Racial discrimination and xenophobia persist and reappear with new faces - including in Europe. New forms of violence threaten individual security and safety. A large part of mankind that lives in intolerable conditions is still deprived of the most elementary rights. \nLet us take advantage of the opportunities offered by the present atmosphere to give a new dimension to international action in this area, in co-operation with the non-governmental organizations. Less selective criticism of violations of human rights, a merciless struggle against torture and all forms of racism, new attention to the protection of the rights of minorities, of women and children: those would seem to me to be the areas for priority action. \nI feel also that the establishment of an office of a high commissioner for human rights - something which has long been advocated - could considerably strengthen our means of action and the Organization's authority.\nThe third special session devoted to disarmament, held last June, ended without a consensus. I hope that the Assembly will be able to consolidate and finalize the rapprochements that were nevertheless achieved at that session on a number of important questions. I shall confine myself to recalling that, in my Government's opinion, a solution to the problem of the trading in arms should have priority. Since tine Second World War, such trading has provided weapons for 150 regional conflicts and wars, killed about 20 million human beings and consumed vast sums.\nThe shocking use of chemical weapons was noted on several occasions during the war between Iraq and Iran, and has been noted more recently against the Kurdish minority in the northern part of Iraq. My Government strongly condemns the use of such terrifying weapons, which must be banned once and for all. In that regard, President Reagan proposed from this very rostrum the convening of an international conference to consider this important problem. My Government supports that proposal. The international community is indeed called upon urgently to define measures and effective sanctions to prevent any future use of such weapons.\nThe peace and security of peoples do not depend only on doing away with conflicts and threats of a military nature. The economic, social and ecological balance of the world determines equally, if not more, the stability and well-being of mankind.\nThe various ways in which the environment is being degraded have reached alarming proportions. There is a risk that the ecosystems will undergo irreversible changes. Acid rain is attacking and destroying our forests. Tropical forests are being destroyed at a disturbing rate. The area that is deforested each year is equal to that of a country as large as Austria. Only about one tenth of that area has been reforested. Significant climatic changes have resulted from that. Soil erosion is taking on tragic proportions. There is a risk that it will increase natural disasters, as happened recently in Bangladesh. It disrupts the water flow and reduces agricultural output-\nThe misuse of pesticides is a major cause of the pollution of the soil and the agricultural imbalance. The rapid consumption of fossil fuels is changing the composition of the atmosphere and affecting the climate. It may be one of the causes of the warming of the planet.\nIn Africa desertification is progressing swiftly. It is now recognized as a major obstacle to development. A solution is also urgently required to the problem of the disposal, processing and export of toxic industrial waste. One thing is quite clear-: environmental problems cannot be handled by States individually. The problems are often global, requiring collective solutions.\nThe Chernobyl disaster showed that nuclear pollution goes beyond national borders, that nuclear power plants do not offer a complete answer to energy problems and that their safety is not the concern only of the producing countries.\nThe climate, the atmosphere and the seas are the property of all mankind.\nThe rapid population growth in the countries of the south is aggravating social tensions and harming the environment. In 1987 the world's population reached 5 billion, double what it was in 1950. By the end of the century it could be more than 6 billion. Therefore, family planning programmes are necessary, however unpleasant that may be to those who defend the right to life, who too often forget the wretched existence of millions of children who are abandoned and have no future.\nFaced with all those problems of concern to mankind as a whole, the United Nations, the only truly universal forum, must shoulder a new responsibility in the global village in which we all live together.\nIn 1987 the international community signed a protocol in Montreal, a protocol that my country has since ratified, designed to protect the ozone layer. So far that way of dealing with problems has been the exception. It must become the rule.\nThere must be growing awareness at the national and international levels, when considering the report of the Brundtland Commission last year, our Assembly recognized that present needs must be met without jeopardizing the satisfaction of the needs of future generations, and that the planet's resources and ecosystems must be managed prudently, that areas that have already been degraded or destroyed must be restored, and that dangers must be anticipated and prevented. The state of the world's economy is still a matter of grave concern, even if there is a slight difference from the early 1980s. The whole decade has been marked globally by slower growth. Admittedly, remarkable progress has been made in Asia - particularly in China and the newly industrialized countries - but stagnation and even serious reverses have occurred in Africa and Latin America. The gap between the richest and the poorest countries has become wider.\nThe debt problem is still at the heart of the difficulties of the developing countries. Servicing the debt paralyses their economies by absorbing an excessive portion of export earnings. Those earnings in turn ate affected by the drastic reduction in the price of many raw materials. Finally, international capital flows to those countries have lessened since 1982. The solutions proposed by the recent Toronto summit, particularly for the least well-off countries, must now be implemented urgently.\nPolicies for restructuring and adjustment often entail tremendous sacrifices. In many countries food crises, the exodus from the countryside and uncontrolled urbanization are getting worse. Poverty, malnutrition and sickness are increasing instead of decreasing.\nIn Africa, as elsewhere, it is fundamentally important that economic growth begin again. National Governments must courageously shoulder the primary responsibility for their own development and follow policies of essential restructuring and adaptation. \nAs the participants in the Khartoum Conference emphasized, economic and social strategies must give equal attention to the human factors of development; they must strengthen education and make it more widely available, promote health, increase employment, encourage greater participation by citizens and seek a more just distribution of income, so as to ensure a better quality of environment and life. I would add that a stricter and more open management of public affairs would help to combat corruption and increase people's trust. Increasing growth rates must go hand in hand with an improvement in the living conditions of the majority, not a worsening of those conditions. I trust that all the international institutions will give their support to such policies with a human face.\nIt is also essential that the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay Bound, aimed at further liberalizing trade in goods and services, arrive at initial results that give a new impetus to world trade.\nSpecial attention should be given to agriculture and the specific conditions in which it is developing in both the North and the South. We cannot overlook the fact that the price of agricultural products largely determines the export earnings of many developing countries. Greater stability in such prices would help to promote food security in each country and improve the world balance of agricultural output.\nWe must arm ourselves against the uncertainty which is a characteristic of the world economic climate, with a view to strengthening the confidence of those who make economic decisions and promoting the necessary productive investments. In this context, special importance attaches to the regional economic organizations that are springing up, of which the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a good example.\nThe European Economic Community, of which my country was a founding member, has more than 30 years' experience of this valuable integration. Military conflict between the 12 member countries is no longer conceivable, although for centuries they were regularly caught up in terrible confrontations.\nToday the Community is working to complete the creation of its great domestic market by 1992. Significant progress has already been made. That market of 320 million citizens and consumers offers new prospects of growth and employment within it. That will open up possibilities of increased exports to its trading partners.\nWe are only a few years from the end of the twentieth century, which has been rent by so many upheavals. As we near the end of the century we have new prospects in an atmosphere of detente, realism and co-operation. Our Organization is at the centre of this development. Often treated with indifference, sometimes even with contempt, it is now in an era full of promise. For the first time in its history the United Nations is recognized by all as a special and effective instrument for the resolution of conflicts.\nMy Government which has always attached great importance to the United Nations, views this progress with great satisfaction. We extend to our Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, our gratitude for his work in support of peace, at the head of our Organization.\nLuxembourg's devotion to peace, non-violence and respect for human rights will be evidenced tomorrow by the unveiling at the Delegates Entrance of a work of art that is powerfully symbolic.\nUnited Nations peace-keeping forces, which have been honoured today, are to be found throughout the world, today in the Middle East in Lebanon and Cyprus, in Afghanistan, in Iran and Iraq, and tomorrow perhaps in Namibia, Western Sahara and elsewhere. This tremendous task in the service of the peace that is in the interests of every Member State has major financial implications. Accordingly, the Government of Luxembourg will support any proposal to guarantee the financing of the peace-keeping forces. It is intolerable that the smooth functioning of our Organization should be hampered by inadequate resources at a time when, incidentally, major reforms and real savings have been achieved to enhance its effectiveness.\nThe recent achievements of the United Nations are due to one decisive factor: entente and the great Powers' will to co-operate. Thus we find ourselves in the conditions that existed when the Organization was founded. It was that consensus that inspired the drafting of the Charter. It must lead now to the reinforcement of the primacy of law and its universal application. Let us act together to make this development irreversible. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nFirst, I should like to congratulate you, Mr. Dante Caputo, upon your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly, Your elevation to that high office is a reflection not only of your proved diplomatic skills, but also of the esteem in which your country, an important member of the Non-Aligned Movement, is held internationally. We are confident that under your able guidance our endeavours will meet with success. Mr. Peter Florin had a remarkably busy watch. Apart from the forty-second regular session, he was called upon to preside over several resumed and special sessions of the Assembly. He more than justified the confidence that the international community had reposed in him. We are grateful to him.\nThe Secretary-General is, of course, the very personification of the internationalist ethic itself. Throughout these turbulent and anxious years that have marked his second term, only Mr. Perez de Cuellar's steady and resolute determination has restored the Organization to its present high esteem, even among some of its detractors. Although the fortunes of the United Nations have not quite turned around, we have nevertheless passed the point where the Secretary-General feared he would preside over the dissolution of the United Nations. Instead, he now presides over peace talks, from the Gulf war to Afghanistan, Cyprus and Western Sahara, ail under the auspices of, or in terms defined by, the United Nations. It is a remarkable achievement, a culmination of that patient and careful diplomatic choreography that has characterized Mr. Perez de Cuellar's tenure as Secretary-General, We of the non-aligned countries derive great satisfaction from the achievements of one of the outstanding diplomats of Peru\u00b7 a key member of our Movement.\nThe outbreak of peace in places of seemingly intractable conflict and a resurgence in the fortunes of the United Nations are the central features on the international stage today. In the Gulf war, perhaps the most painful and destructive war since 1945, the guns have fallen silent. The former belligerents now sit together in Geneva, talking peace. The basis of that peace continues to be Security Council resolution 598 (1987), in whose evolution and balanced formulation the caucus of the non-aligned countries in the Security Council played no small role. This cessation of hostilities not only puts an end to the anguish of the peoples of Iran and Iraq and affords those countries an opportunity for reconstruction and development, but also eliminates a dangerous threat to international peace and security. We therefore urge the two non-aligned countries, also Member States of the United Nations, to co-operate with the Secretary-General in the effort to find a durable solution to the conflict.\nPursuant to the Geneva accords on Afghanistan, negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations by the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr, Diego Cordovez - then Under-Secretary for Political Affairs and now the Foreign Minister of Ecuador, another key non-aligned country in Latin America - thousands of foreign troops have already left Afghanistan, That not only paves the way for the Afghan people to decide their future free from outside interference but, again, removes a threat to international peace and security. We urge all parties to respect the letter and spirit of those accords to ensure that nothing is done which can cause them to unravel. \nIn southern Africa also, we have seen the tripartite agreement which involves Angola, Cuba and the Pretoria regime and which provides for the withdrawal of South African troops from Angola and possible implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia. We welcome the declaration of a cease-fire and the end of South Africa's illegal occupation of the sovereign territory of Angola. It is our earnest hope that South Africa will live up to the letter and spirit of the tripartite agreement and will proceed to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nElsewhere in Africa, thanks to the United Nations a breakthrough also appears imminent in the 13-year war over Western Sahara. In particular, we note the proposal by the Secretary-General last month whereby a cease-fire would be declared, followed by a referendum of the citizens of Western Sahara, including those living in refugee camps. It is also satisfying to note that Morocco and POLISARIO, the two parties to the conflict, are soon to engage in direct talks as called for by the Organization of African Unity. We hope it will now be possible to resolve, once and for all, the central question of self-determination for the Sahrawi people.\nOn Kampuchea too there are signs of movement. Viet Nam has promised to pull out its troops from Kampuchea and the parties involved have held the Jakarta informal meeting and are in constant contact on the nature of the post-settlement order in South-East Asia. We in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries shall continue to prod the parties concerned to quicken their search for an honourable solution to the problem.\nOn the vexed question of divided Cyprus, we have recently witnessed some promising stirrings, thanks to the efforts of the Secretary-General. We hope that here too progress can be made. \nThe recent relaxation in tension on the international scene has not altered the essence of the problems we face in our region of Africa. The Non-Aligned Movement has always maintained that apartheid is the root cause of conflict and that peace and security cannot be obtained in southern Africa until that system is eradicated. The destabilization of the economies of the front-line States continues unabated. Millions of displaced persons, innocent men, women and children, tragic refugees of the evil system of apartheid, are constantly on the run in search of food and security. Only a month ago I had the privilege of attending in Oslo, Norway, the International Conference on the Plight of Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons in Southern Africa. That was the first conference of its kind devoted entirely to the problem of refugees in southern Africa. The Conference established that the number of persons uprooted from their homes by the apartheid regime's acts of destabilization had reached the tragic figure of 5.4 million. Thousands of old men and women, the sick and little children, the weakest in our societies, who cannot make it to safety, perish as victims of the harsh elements or the bayonets of Pretoria's financed bandits. \nIn South Africa itself, the majority population continue to be victimized by the apartheid police for no crime other than the colour of their skin. Thousands are incarcerated in apartheid gaols. The world must take note and do something. Apartheid cannot be wooed into oblivion; it can only be forcibly taken out by the roots. The only means of doing that, short of war, is the imposition by the entire international community of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter. The arguments of those who oppose sanctions sound increasingly hollow and self-serving. Sanctions may cost some blacks and some whites jobs, but there is no doubt that they do weaken apartheid. The non-application of sanctions leaves apartheid intact. Apartheid kills. Sanctions can have a powerful psychological effect on the white minority in South Africa. For no man is an island, nor is a nation for that matter, not even a nation of unreconstructed racists.\nThe Middle East is another long-running sore where movement towards peace has been elusive. As Israel has continued to occupy captured Arab and Palestinian lands, the citizens of those occupied territories have met Israeli armour with their bare hands, sustaining many casualties. The uprising of the past nine months in the occupied territories is not a simple matter of bravery. No one wants to die. It is a matter of desperation. The Palestinian people, like all human beings, want to exercise their right to self-determination. Israel must withdraw from the occupied territories and let go of the Palestinian nation. It is our view that only the holding of the international peace conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, to address all aspects of the Middle East problem can bring peace and security for all in the region.\nIn Central America, the Arias plan has provided a concrete and viable framework for peace. Negotiations continue, even if intermittently, in countries with an insurgency problem. We note in particular that the Government of Nicaragua has continued to extend its hand to the opposition, asking them to continue negotiations. The cease-fire that was called for by the plan has repeatedly been extended and is still holding. It would be irresponsible to call for, or cause, the abandonment of that cease-fire. Countries should not resort to the politics of intimidation or diplomacy of violence in the region. It is essential, for the sake of the people and Governments of Central America and also for international peace and security, that the Arias plan be given a chance to succeed.\nForeign troops remain on the Korean peninsula, prolonging the unjustified division of that land and resulting in increased tensions, therefore we demand the removal of all foreign troops and call for talks on reunifying the peninsula.\nIn an age of apocalyptic destructive power, co-operation to reduce the means of war has become a categorical imperative. The international community has set itself clearly defined priorities in disarmament as contained in the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, held in 1978. At the top of the list is the need to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war. Non-aligned States have already stated that the use of nuclear weapons, besides being a violation of the Charter of the United Nations, would also be a crime against humanity. To this end they have urged all nuclear-weapon States, pending the achievement of nuclear disarmament, to sign a binding instrument forswearing the use of nuclear weapons. It would also be desirable, in the interim, for the nuclear-weapon States to make a solemn declaration that they will not be the first to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Conference on Disarmament must seek ways of fulfilling its mandate with regard to the item on the prevention of nuclear war with which it has been charged by the General Assembly.\nClearly, for as long as the nuclear arms race persists and nuclear arms remain in the arsenals of States, the risk of nuclear war remains with us. For this reason urgent measures must be taken to effect the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and proceed to nuclear disarmament. We welcomed the Treaty on the elimination of medium- and short-range missiles concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States late last year. The conclusion of that Treaty, while of great symbolic importance as representing the first significant step of disarmament in our time, should not obscure the fact that it accounted for a mere 4 per cent of nuclear warheads and that the remaining 96 per cent, constantly being modernized and made more accurate, lethal and usable, is still with us. The occasion should be one not for mere self-congratulation, but for renewed efforts to eliminate the remaining, far greater arsenals of nuclear weapons. To this end, we urge the United States and the Soviet Union to move quickly towards the goal of a 50 per cent reduction in strategic offensive arsenals which they have set themselves.\nWhile the bilateral negotiations on disarmament are important, success in that forum should not be used to curb the role of the United Nations in that field. The United Nations, as the sole universal forum, has a central role to play in all issues that affect the generality of mankind. To that extent, we profoundly regret that the momentum generated by bilateral negotiations last year was not translated into concrete achievements during the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. The non-aligned countries have always believed that bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament should mutually reinforce and complement, not hinder or preclude, each other. This is particularly so of such disarmament topics of vital importance to all States as a comprehensive test-ban treaty, the prevention of an arras race in outer space, nuclear disarmament, chemical weapons, conventional weapons and the elaboration of a comprehensive programme of disarmament. \nMy country is particularly perturbed by the continued nuclear collaboration between South Africa on the one hand and certain Western States and Israel on the other. As we have all along warned, Pretoria has now publicly admitted that it has the capability to produce nuclear weapons. We therefore hope that those responsible for transferring the know-how to the apartheid regime will now desist from any further collaboration with it in this and related spheres. The nuclearization of South Africa not only poses a direct danger to our part of the continent, hut also hinders the implementation of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa, and is a threat to international peace and security as well. The Security Council has a responsibility, under paragraph 63 (c) of the Final Document of the first special session on disarmament, to ensure that the implementation of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa is not hindered. That body should move at once to institute measures that curb South Africa's continued nuclearization. Furthermore, we believe that South Africa's offer to the three Non-Proliferation Treaty nuclear-weapon States to enter into negotiations on the possibility of its adhering to the Treaty is only a ruse to delay its suspension from the International Atomic Energy Agency. For that reason, we do not see the need for any negotiations and urge the Agency's General Conference to suspend South Africa immediately.\nWhile still on the issue of Africa and nuclear weapons, I wish once again in this Hall to protest indignantly at the callousness shown by the industrialized nations in dumping their nuclear and toxic wastes in Africa. Africa already has enough problems of its own without becoming the garbage-bin of the wealthy northern nations. It is not fair that the poorest nations should be the ones to suffer the worst effects of \\\"progress\\\" in which they do not share. \nThe Indian Ocean is another region of vital concern to the littoral and hinterland States of the area. Seventeen years after the Assembly's adoption of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean is still mired in fruitless squabbles about procedures and methodology. Meanwhile, great-Power militarization of the Ocean is proceeding apace, and the envisaged Colombo Conference is repeatedly postponed. Since those who have spoken against the Conference used to cite the focal points of tension around the region as the reason why the Conference could not go ahead, the solutions in Afghanistan and the Gulf should now pave the way to Colombia. It is our fervent wish that the Conference should not be postponed again beyond the present target date of 1990.\nThe acute crisis affecting the international economy has not shown any signs of abating during the past year. Growth has continued to be either sluggish, non-existent or even negative in most developing countries. Commodity prices remain well below acceptable levels. External indebtedness continues to exact a heavy toll on the economies of the developing countries. High interest rates have drastically increased the burden of debt service. In addition, resource flows continue to go from the poor of the South to the rich of the North.\nThe reality of interdependence makes those problems the concern of every country. A solution requires the adoption of a comprehensive set of measures that addresses all aspects of the problem and is geared towards the resumption and acceleration of growth in the developing and debtor countries. The official development assistance (ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product in financial-resource flows from developed to developing countries, which was agreed in. the International Development Strategy, must be reached soon, as must the ODA target of 0.15 per cent of gross national product for the least developed countries, as agreed in the Substantial New Programme \nIn 1986 the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. Great hopes had been attached to that Programme, but up to now we have not yet seen any African economic recovery, despite the enormous sacrifices the countries of the region have made during the past two years.\nOnly a year ago we were reminded by the World Commission on Environment and Development that poverty was one of the major causes of environmental degradation today. People may be forced to cut down the rain forest by economic necessity in the tropics, but the effects will be felt equally in New York, in London and in Tokyo. There was much talk of the greenhouse effect this year. The Commission on the environment told us that a plausible way of reversing that trend may be to raise the standards of living in the third world.\nUnilateral solutions are impossible. What is needed is global dialogue. We of the Non-Aligned Movement have consistently argued for the multilateral approach. We have called for the resumption of the North-South dialogue. We have called for the convening of an international conference on money and finance with universal participation aimed at meeting the development and financing requirements of the international economy, particularly with regard to the economies of the developing countries. We have also stated that international negotiations on the debt problem, involving creditor and debtor nations, multilateral financial institutions and international private banks, were a necessary step in the search for a lasting resolution of the current debt problem.\nFor our part, we in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries stand ready to contribute in any way possible towards the real launching of dialogue. Earlier this year, the Non-Aligned Committee on Economic Co-operation met at Harare to assess the state of North-South dialogue and to formulate proposals for its revitalization. I commend the important document espousing those proposals for your close study and serious consideration.\nHowever, the Non-Aligned Movement forms only part of the family of nations. A comprehensive resolution of the current crisis in the international economy needs the participation of all members. It is our hope that the climate of dialogue that has been made by possible by the new thaw in super-Power relations will spill over into the economic sphere. It was therefore with a sense of hope that we noted the gentle breezes blowing from the Group of Seven summit meeting at Toronto. The proposals from Toronto, though limited, envisaging the cancellation of the official debt of the least developed countries of sub-Saharan Africa, reflected a sensitivity that we hope will become part of the approach of the industrialised countries to the entire question of the developing world-debt crisis.\nLater this year the mid-term review of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations will be carried out at a high-level meeting to be held at Montreal. That meeting provides a unique opportunity for both the developed and the developing countries to assess the development in the current Uruguay Round and to renew their commitment to the search for lasting solutions to the malaise affecting the present international trading system. In these negotiations it is imperative that approaches that seek to negate the spirit of international co-operation or the mutuality of interests between the developed and the developing countries be avoided at all costs. Attempts to derogate or deviate from long-standing principles and the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for self-interest should be resisted.\nGreat strides have already been made in recent years in the conceptual appreciation of the threat those economic problems pose for international peace and security. The time has come to move these concepts to the realm of policy. We of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries stand ready to participate constructively in that process. We trust that others are ready to join with us.\nI wish to return to the subject of the United Nations and the concept of multilateralism. The 1980s will go down in the history of this century as the decade of a retreat from multilateralism. Many of us would like to believe that this phenomenon of the 1980s has not peaked and is on the wane. But, sadly, the reality is less reassuring. The United Nations is still mired in a financial crisis deliberately engineered. The Secretary-General has been reduced to a virtual street beggar passing the hat to keep the Organization from closing its doors. This is most unseemly. Coming at the very time when the United Nations role in defusing threats to international peace and security has been on the rise, it is doubly intolerable,\nI appeal to all Member States to rally behind the Secretary-General by fully honouring the legal obligations they solemnly undertook under the Charter.\nOn that note let me conclude by reaffirming the commitment of the Non-Aligned Movement to the lofty ideals of this body. As you carry out your difficult duties, I wish to assume you of the continued support of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, I have great pleasure in offering sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. We ate very confident that in the discharge of his duties, his illustrious career and his fine statesmanship will contribute significantly to the progress and success of the work of this session.\nPermit me to express my appreciation to the outgoing President,\nMr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, for the manner in which he performed the task entrusted to him during the forty-second session. During his presidency he demonstrated great faith in the Organization and contributed significantly to the successful conclusions of that session and of the several resumed sessions. Once again, I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his untiring efforts and his stalwart performance during the recent turbulent years of our Organization's history. His devoted efforts to the pursuit of peace and security and his firm defence of the principles of the Charter are characteristics of his commitment to the preservation of the goals and ideals of the United Nations,\nThe award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is tangible recognition of the effectiveness of the United Nations system. My delegation wishes to pay a tribute to all those at present serving and those who have served for their achievement and their contribution to the United Nations peace-keeping operations and, by extension, to world peace and security.\nThis session takes place against the background of improved relations between the super-Powers and some decrease in the level of global tension. The recently concluded Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, the cease-fire in the Gulf war, and the progress towards the peaceful solution of conflicts in Western Sahara, Kampuchea, Namibia and Cyprus have all attested to this fact. A great deal of the credit for these achievements undoubtedly belongs to this Organization. In spite of the retreat from multilateralism on the part of some, the Organization has not wavered in its commitment to seek solutions within the global framework. The Secretary-General must be complimented on his indomitable will and the sincerity of purpose displayed in the execution of his mandate.\nIn his address at the commemorative session of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, the Right Honourable James Fitz-Allen Mitchell, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, reminded this body that the purpose and principles of this Organization remained as valid then as they were in 1945. The Charter, he said, had withstood the test of time, and, whatever the shortcomings in its implementation or the limitations of the United Nations institutions, they did not derive from the Charter. We called for a rededication to the principles so ably set forth by the founding fathers of the Organization. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains committed to this position.\nIt is my firm belief that we ate at the threshold of a new era, an era in which the differences that have divided us for so long are less significant than the difficulties we have to face together. Man's greatest hope today is to live in a secure world with a protected common environment. The INF Treaty between President \u00a1Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev is a historic achievement in the process of disarmament. That is why Saint Vincent applauds this agreement.\nDisarmament and arms control are matters of global concern. Our Prime Minister, in his address to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, supported the view that savings from disarmament should be channelled into development, and proposed that funds thus saved should, as a matter of priority, be devoted to reforestation in Africa. While we welcome what has been achieved so far, we realize that international peace and security is the common concern of all mankind, so that the United Nations has an indispensable role to play in this regard. We cannot rest on our laurels) the hope for a nuclear-free world is our ultimate goal.\nIn other areas of conflict progress is desperately needed. Independence for Namibia comes readily to mind. In this direction, we have always supported Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We remain cautiously hopeful, however, for a positive outcome of the talks between the Governments concerned to bring an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia. It is our fervent hope that, come 1989, this time around, Namibia will be a fully-fledged Member of this Organization.\nOn the question of South Africa can anything more be said, except of course, to reiterate that the diabolic system of apartheid continues to be paramount among the human rights concerns of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The movement in favour of human dignity is now irreversible. There can be no doubt that fundamental change will come to South Africa. The only questions are, when and how and at what cost in human life.\nThe problems of the Middle East have preoccupied this Assembly since the creation of the United Nations. Peaceful solutions have proved elusive and in their absence violence and extremism have increased. But that is an argument for redoubled effort, not for despair. There is today growing support for a properly structured international conference based ort Israel's right to exist and recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.\nAs we reflect on the problems which beset the troubled regions of the globe, and our own region, Latin America and the Caribbean come readily to mind. We continue to support the efforts of the Contadora Group. We also believe that there is much merit in the Esquipulas agreement and all other regional efforts aimed at bringing peace to that afflicted region. We believe that socio-economic deprivation is the root cause of the conflict, and any effort aimed at finding a solution must take cognisance of this factor.\nWe are heartened by the welcome news coming out of Seoul to the effect that the Government of South Korea is willing to end the situation of confrontation between it and its brother to the north so that the way can be paved for the establishment of relations between the two countries based on a spirit of co-operation. We hope that this welcome gesture can be built upon so that the process of accession by both countries to membership of the United Nations can be expedited.\nMy delegation applauds the Government and people of the Republic of Korea on the successful completion of the Seoul Olympics, which were conducted in an atmosphere of friendly rivalry and peace. We trust that the co-operative spirit generated throughout the games will contribute to the relaxation of tension in that region.\nThe view is held in some quarters that the economic recovery in the powerful economic centres of the world could provide the stimulus for renewed economic growth in the rest of the world. But the evidence to the contrary is there for all to see. The accompanying view that the remedies for the economic ills of the South lie in individual national efforts cannot be substantiated. Third-world development efforts have nothing to do with the unfavourable terms of trade, the capricious nature of the markets for the primary products of the South, the high interest rates levied by banks and the fluctuations in the parity between the major currencies. All of these are variables which have an adverse impact on our fragile economies and over which we have absolutely no control. Add to this our vulnerability to natural disasters and one gets a true picture of economies in danger.\nWhile we are thankful to those that assist in alleviating the difficulties faced by these economies we ate mindful that the assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product is not met by all those that are eligible.\nMy Government realized quite early that Vincentians had to make painful sacrifices, and embarked on a programme of structural adjustment aimed at avoiding cost over-run on its recurrent budget so that there could be funds available from local revenue to be utilized in the capital budget sector. This had to be done because the Vincentians are proud people who do not wish to rely solely on the generosity of others.\nIt is a fact of life that the problems faced by poor and developing countries are the more harsh and intractable the smaller the country. These problems have been frequently reiterated and roust by now be familiar to everyone. Allow me to repeat by way of reminder, however, that they are a mixture of the problems emanating from smallness in general and island characteristics in particular.\nThese characteristics can be identified as non-viable internal markets, diseconomies of scale, a narrow range of resources, and lack of opportunity to take advantage of external economies by way of linkage with the service networks of neighbouring States and thereby reduce the relative costs of infrastructure. There is the further disadvantage that many of these States, like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, ate archipelagic - a phenomenon which poses enormous problems, accompanied by their consequential economic and social costs. In view of their small overall size and the relatively small size of their commercial debt, these States do not constitute a priority group for private commercial banks. The simultaneous ineligibility for commercial and concessionary financial flews poses the real possibility of these countries' losing whatever advances they have made towards improving their standard of living and raising their economies from the category of the poorest. In order to save them from the economic retrogression to which they may be doomed, it is important that adequate resources be made available to them on appropriate terms.\nWe are living through an era of rapid change. Generally speaking, the peoples of the industrialized countries have experienced a rapid improvement in their living conditions. For the developing countries that is not so. While the 1980s may be a remarkable decade, marked by real progress in respect of international peace and security, the decade can be considered as one of lost opportunities for the third world. Very little has been done to prevent the gap between the rich and the poor countries from widening. As we approach the twenty-first century we are faced with the major challenge of overcoming the global development crisis. We must fight the battle against poverty together.\nPoverty undermines security, compromises equality and denies hope and opportunity. Alleviating poverty must be given a new priority on national and international agendas. We must work to achieve social justice for the poorest of our world and initiate economic growth where there has been stagnation, revitalization where there has been despair, hope where there has been hopelessness. There must be a spirit of sharing, of giving where there have been surpluses.\nThe future will depend on how successful we are in harnessing our common attitudes with our limited resources to combat the common challenges. Stability, prosperity and social and economic justice are coming to different parts of the world at different speeds. We must implement corrective measures so as not to create an irreversible imbalance. The challenge is economic and political as well as ethical. We can safeguard the future only by working together. We cannot\n\nsafeguard it at each other's expense.\nThe critical economic situation for the developing world is characterized by unsustainable external debt. It is obvious that the heavily indebted low-income countries will never be able to repay their debts. We must fully recognize the nature of the problem and create the solutions to deal with it. The lending policies of our institutions should not be cast in stone so that they run the risk of bringing about political destabilization which might ultimately lead to increased human suffering and degradation. \nThe dangers which are likely to be caused through short-sightedness or deliberate environmental practices are many and varied. The issues of toxic wastes, deforestation, desertification, acid rain, the widening gap in the ozone layer, the climatic changes and the greenhouse effect are some of the environmental hazards which must be addressed by the international community before irreversible damage is done to the environment. These issues mast be placed on the priority list of the United Nations and swift and workable solutions must be found if mankind is to survive. They must not be relegated to the back burner, as time is not on our side. The world must be preserved for succeeding generations.\nAs an archipelagic State and a link in the Caribbean chain, with its unprotected borders on the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines must be conscious of its vulnerability as a potential transhipment point for drug traffickers. We are also conscious of the ever-increasing use of illicit drugs the world over, especially among the young. My Government, in  co-operation with our neighbours, our friends and the international community, will never relent in its efforts to eradicate the illicit trafficking in narcotics and to end the tragedy of drug abuse.\nThe next decade will be crucial. The United Nations role will be to harness the irreversible forces of change to ensure a more peaceful, more prosperous and more humane world. Vital and difficult decisions will have to be taken. We have the capacity to destroy life on this planet, but we also have the capacity to make this world a better place for all future generations. We look in the future for a more humane world in which the rich nations will be more generous\u00b7, where the strong nations are just, the weak nations are regarded as equals, the poor nations are treated as crown jewels and human dignity is enshrined in the image of our Divine Creator, because together we must preserve this earth for all our children's children.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly has elected Mr. Dante Caputo to preside over its work as President. Accordingly, on behalf of my delegation, I should like to extend to him, in these happy circumstances, our most sincere and warmest congratulations.\nZaire, which co-operated very closely with Mr. Peter Florin, President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly and also of the third special session devoted to disarmament, would like, as outgoing Chairman of the First Committee, to express our great esteem for him and our appreciation for the outstanding success achieved throughout his term of office, which has just recently ended. To the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar - a tireless pilgrim in the service of international peace and security - my delegation extends all its gratitude for having found time, despite his many international obligations, to make an official visit to Zaire from 16 to 18 February 1988, in order to become personally acquainted with the facts about my country and its people. The people of Zaire as a whole were able to appreciate the significance of this official visit, which followed logically on those made earlier by the late Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld and the late U Than t during the crucial period of our history.\nThus today Zaire is able, more than any other country, to appreciate the cost of the peace, so dearly won thanks to the determination of the United Nations to strengthen our independence and ensure our unity.\nThe many successes that have been achieved so brilliantly by our Secretary-General in the peaceful settlement of some international conflicts of the present time demonstrate the effectiveness and the relevance of his action and also enable us fully to appreciate his great talents as a superb diplomatic and a skilled negotiator. The Nobel Peace Prize awarded today to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is indeed moving and eloquent proof of the contribution our international Organization is making to the cause of international peace and security.\nMay I say how happy the delegation of my country, Zaire, is to find itself once again here at this international gathering, the greatest forum of all times, which we all regard as the conscience of the world. We, the representatives of peoples, Governments, States and various communities, are given another opportunity to think aloud, together, about the situation of the human race.\nA feature of the present international situation is the resolve of the majority of States to settle their disputes by peaceful means, as provided for in Article 33 of the United Nations Charter. Thus, the Organization is continuing to play its primary role in the maintenance of international peace and security. It now has increased importance as the universally recognized body seeking, through negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation or any other peaceful means, solutions to the conflicts pitting Member States one against the other. The relaxation of tension in, inter alia, Afghanistan, Democratic Kampuchea, the Persian Gulf and Western Sahara, thanks to action taken by the United Nations - symbolized by its Secretary-General - and with the valuable support of the two super-Powers, whose interests seem to be converging, is a tangible example of that.\nThese far-reaching changes that are progressively taking place hold the promise that relations of trust will develop between East and West, and we hope that this will help to strengthen North-South relations as well.\nRecently the international community has been witnessing a more or less positive development in regard to conflicts in the world. Indeed, the efforts made by the Security Council that led to the adoption of resolution 598 (1987) enabled the Secretary-General to continue his consultations and negotiations with the Foreign Ministers of Iraq and Iran, following the Iranian Government's acceptance of that resolution, and those consultations finally led to the cease-fire in the war that had lasted since 1979 between Iraq and Iran - two brother countries and, moreover, members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The dimensions that the so-called oil war in the Persian Gulf were assuming had become a matter of increasing concern to the international community, with so many human lives being lost on both sides, so many ships being sunk and so many aircraft being shot down. My country, Zaire, sincerely hopes that the commitments entered into by the two parties will be scrupulously respected so that peace and security may be restored to that sensitive region of the world. \nThe international community is glad to see that the Afghan people is now about to exercise fully its sovereignty and control over all its national territory, pursuant to the Geneva agreements of 14 April 1988, which entered into force on 15 May 1988 and which are based on the total withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. That is fully in keeping with the aspirations of that people, whose country is also a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\nMy delegation believes that this example being set by the Soviet troops should be followed by the Vietnamese troops in Democratic Kampuchea so that the people of that country may be able to regain its dignity, freedom and unity.\nThe talks which were held at Bogor from 25 to 28 July 1988 between the Foreign Ministers of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Viet Nam and the representatives of the four political factions in Kampuchea led to the establishment of a working group of high officials of all those countries, which the mandate of studying in depth all aspects of a political solution to the Kampuchean problem.\nIt can be hoped that the wind favourable to dialogue that is blowing through Asia will reach the two Koreas. In that connection, my delegation feels that the admission of those countries to membership of the United Nations could only strengthen the role they are already playing on the international scene.\nWhile the spirit of harmonization and concertation prevails in the Far East, the same cannot, alas, be said of the Middle East, where there is still fierce antagonism and hostility which constantly fans hatred. Despite the efforts made by some States directly involved in the conflict, and despite the efforts of the United Nations, no progress seems to have been made on the road to a comprehensive, peaceful settlement of that issue. So far as my country, Zaire, is concerned, the State of Israel exists and is a Member of the United Nations, just as the Palestinian people is a living reality that should also have a State and become a Member of our universal Organization.\nThat is why my country appeals urgently to all the parties involved not to listen to the sirens of discord but, rather, to adopt a more conciliatory attitude that would be more favourable to dialogue. For it is by recognizing everyone's inalienable right to existence within a nation that all the Member States of our Organization can demonstrate their devotion to the purposes and principles of the Charter.\nThe United Nations has adopted many resolutions calling on the white minority regime to put an end to the political system of apartheid in South Africa, which has been almost unanimously regarded as a crime against humanity. The Republic of Zaire, linked by geography, history and culture to southern Africa, is following with particular interest the developments in that part of the continent. The quadripartite negotiations currently under way between those mainly concerned should be encouraged by the international community, because the process augurs well for the independence of Namibia and because the resulting withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and Namibia would set that region on the right road, so that an atmosphere of peace and trust could develop between the protagonists.\nMy delegation also takes a positive view of developments in Western Sahara and Chad, where the consultations that have now begun between the parties offer the prospect of a lasting, peaceful solution.\nIt is also encouraging that in Central America substantial progress has been made in the peace process since the signing of the Esquipulas II and Sapoa agreements.\nTurning to the economic situation, I should like to begin by presenting some food for thought from a recent publication called \\\"Pour l'Afrique\\\", which says among other things:\n\\\"The subsoil of Africa has a very high mineral content. We already know that it contains 97 per cent of the world's reserves of platinum, 64 per cent of manganese, 25 per cent of uranium. Copper in Zambia and Zaire, lead in Namibia, cobalt in Zaire and Zambia, nickel in Botswana and Zimbabwe, phosphates in Morocco, Senegal and Togo, gold, silver and diamonds throughout southern Africa ... Iron is perhaps the most promising\u00b7, while world reserves are being exhausted, there are enormous deposits in Gabon, Senegal, Guinea and Mauritania. For a world industry that is hungry for raw materials, Africa is the continent of the future.\\\" \n\nCompleting the picture, the author adds:\n\\\"Commodity prices today in real terms represent only 20 per cent of what they were in I960. In 1985 international trade in manufactured goods increased by 6 per cent while trade in agricultural and mineral products dropped by 2.5 per cent. Increased competition, protectionism, monetary disorder, the high cost of energy ... Africa has been hit by them all.\\\"\nIn a nutshell, that is the gloomy, negative and sharply contrasted picture of the international economic situation, particularly as regards relations between the industrialized countries of the northern hemisphere and the developing countries of the southern part of our planet.\nIn this connection, it should be emphasized that the depth of the crisis disrupting the world economy requires concerted action rather than timid sectoral, superficial and inconsistent patching up. Against that background, re-launching a true and sincere dialogue between North and South with a view to establishing a new international economic order, in the interests of all peoples, would be very timely, for such a dialogue could bring about the dawning of a new economic order based on justice and collective responsibility towards mankind. It could provide solutions to the major economic problems of today, one of which, clearly, is the external debt of the developing countries. That burden, now amounting to several billion dollars, jeopardizes all prospects of developing our countries and undermines all possibility of growth.\nOur countries' export earnings are diverted to the payment of external debts, instead of being used to finance development; our countries have become net exporters of capital and reservoirs of financial resources for countries that are already developed. Therefore, an agreed approach based on the principle of shared responsibility between debtors and creditors is necessary, for the imperatives of economic development and growth must be given precedence and be among the top priorities.\nWe should highlight the dichotomy between the speedy enrichment of some and the equally speedy pauperization of others, although they ate linked by relations of interdependence. My delegation believes that it is worth expressing the hope that the world will finally become aware of the situation and provide the necessary remedy before it is too late. My country, Zaire, attaches great importance to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose fortieth anniversary the United Nations will celebrate on 10 December this year. We are also happy to note that today, 29 September 1988, is the tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), containing the plan for Namibia's independence, and is also the date chosen by the two super-Powers at their recent Moscow summit to draw up a schedule for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola.\nIn accordance with resolution 41/129, which encourages all Member States to take appropriate steps for the establishment of national institutions for the protection and promotion of human rights, a Department of the Rights and Freedoms of Citizens was set up in Zaire in 1986. Its mandate includes in particular gathering and considering the complaints and grievances of any citizen whose rights and freedoms have been unjustly violated by the public authorities, by any decision of the courts or in any other way, when all other legally authorized remedies have been exhausted or found ineffective, and when the injustice has been declared to be flagrant. Apart from Africa's physical and moral suffering, some parts of the continent also suffer from drought, desertification and the invasion of locusts, while the resulting famine strikes millions of human beings.\nThe difficult issue of toxic and radioactive waste is a matter of major concern to third-world countries, and particularly to Africa, at the present time. It was therefore with good reason that on 4 October 1973 Marshal Mobuto Sese Seko, President of the Republic of Zaire, said from this very rostrum? \\\"In Zaire we are flattered when we are considered as the champions of the protection of nature. But what is the use of this national effort if our efforts are cancelled out by people thousands of kilometres away from us?\\\" (A/PV.2140, p. 76) The true import of those words can indeed be felt today. \nFrom 31 May to 26 June 1988 the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament was held here in New York. At that time the international community hoped that the new atmosphere of understanding that had developed between the two major nuclear Powers would extend to other Member States following the signing in Washington on 8 December 1987 and the ratification in Moscow on 1 June 1988, of the Treaty on the Elimination of Medium-Range and Shorter-Range Nuclear Missiles. The General Assembly at that time hoped that that joint action by the nuclear Powers would have a positive impact on other nuclear Powers. However disappointing the resolutions of the third special session devoted to disarmament may be, this cannot in any way weaken the resolve of the international community to follow the new path that has been traced out by the super-Powers with a view to general and complete disarmament under effective international control. A British philosopher said: \n\\\"Those who do not act together cannot act fruitfully. Those who do not act in trust cannot act together. Those who are not bound by shared views, shared feelings and shared interests cannot act in trust.\\\"\nSince the international community has shared interests it must act in trust so as to act fruitfully to ensure the survival of the human race.\nAs an African thinker said:\n\\\"It is at this price, and this price only, that we can avoid despairing of ourselves, for in this way we will have acted as men - men of peace, men of dialogue, men of magnanimity, men of a generation that has not lived for nothing and that, after exploring the Moon, having passed by the planets Mars and Saturn, touched on Venus, admired Orion, has come back to Earth, its head ' held high, to take charge of its own fate - the fate of mankind.\\\" \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a happy and memorable coincidence that at this forty-third session two Latin American citizens hold posts of honour: one is President of the General Assembly and the other is Secretary-General. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Argentina, Mr. Dante Caputo, and the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, are distinguished representatives of our people, heirs to the best ideological and republican traditions which created the Latin American nationality.\nWhen we joined the international community, after the historic changes generated by the French Revolution - now nearing its bicentennial - there was in our continent a feeling of identity, unity, mutual interest in solidarity, and brotherhood in the face of the sufferings of the war of emancipation and of outside threats.\nToday, after many difficult years of being divided by foreign interests, of inflamed prejudices among ourselves, of painful interruptions to our expression of the democratic will as peoples, Latin America, almost in its entirety, is able to present itself to the world once again, as it is doing at this Assembly, with a feeling of solidarity and a community of ideals. I have no fear that I may be mistaken, or arrogating the right of another, when I affirm that we, the nations of America, are undergoing a period of far-reaching changes which we cannot, nor shall, this time leave to the vagaries of circumstance.\n\\\"Security\\\" is usually defined in terms of custody, preservation and promotion of a country's basic interests. For Venezuela, together with what is inherent in our national being, its security also means democracy, by virtue of the provisions and mandate established by its Constitution. It means the freedom of its citizens to dissent, under the rule of law, to be able to prosper and satisfy their material and spiritual needs with autonomy and independence. Nevertheless, in a contemporary world such as ours, our security and the security of our countries are threatened from outside. So it is high time to make this charge, and there is no more appropriate forum in which to do so than this, at this rostrum open to all the peoples of the world.\nToday, the legitimacy of our fundamental tights as nations and peoples, as communities and individuals, is being challenged. There is no other way to explain the lack of definitive solutions to problems such as the problem of external debt, which drains our countries' economies and deprives them of the tight to a stable future.\nThe external debt problem acts as a stranglehold today on the economic and social development of the vast majority of the peoples of the world. It is essential to overcome it if we ace to achieve more just and humane social development. We must begin to tackle it recognizing that we shall find a lasting solution only when we face up to its true causes and admit the failure of the strategies so far followed in our attempt to manage it. \nAmong the basic causes of the external debt crisis are the serious errors made by banks and lenders when they set aside the very principles on which private credit activities operate and try ineffectually to supplant the development financing institutions and take over the functions assigned to them.\nSecondly, immediately following this, there occurred another very important change: the Governments and monetary authorities of some of the countries in which the creditor banks operated, to defend their currencies and fight inflation, took the political decision to raise interest rates to levels far above the average inflation rates, without taking into account the devastating effect that this step would have on the debtor countries.\nThe result has been that some loans that were contracted at interest rates at a level in balance with inflation rates have to be serviced at an almost impossible level of interest, because there is no economic activity that can generate enough wealth to cover that imbalance, which is the result of a political decision taken by the Governments of developed countries.\nThe logic of international financial capitalism is unethical and immoral. An economic system cannot function indefinitely on the basis of such a mechanism. Nor can it be claimed that it is reasonable for the expectations of our peoples to be subordinated to the covetousness of the most crass mercantilism. And it is far less reasonable that nations which profess to be our allies and friends should seek not only to justify but to impose such logic, using the most blatant euphemisms.\nWe have seen, in the schemes so far presented, one refinancing negotiation following another, with adjustment policies in the debtor countries and protective policies for the financial systems in the creditor countries; interventions by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the regional development banks; one international conference following another, with specific plans from developed countries - all with no practical result. The fact is that for both the countries that have paid and those that have not, the situation is untenable.\nDebt can never be repaid by means of more debts. The traditional scheme is bankrupt and the old timetable appears to us now to be a harmful and grotesque ritual.\nWhere do we expect this road to lead us? Let us remember that there are limits which cannot be crossed with impunity, and the limits include that concept of security and that right to development and social justice which we shall never tire of claiming to be inalienable. The dramatic, compelling fact of the matter is that social problems are becoming more acute and that there are no more adjustments to be made; the net flow of capital from debtor to creditor countries continues; countries service their commitments and, with very few exceptions - and so far Venezuela has been one of them - debts rise, interest is paid on interest, and the dilemma of the debt is further compounded.\nThe policy of gaining time, hoping for a financial miracle that will make it possible for the debt to be serviced under current terms, has had its day. We have to grasp this fact and act accordingly, and very quickly. Let us recall the crisis of the 1930s when more than half the countries which were then in the League of Nations filed for moratoriums on their debt; and let us also remember all the consequences, with the world-wide effects that sprang from not having acted in time. It is therefore our duty to try agreed solutions that will lead to international agreements under which the debtors will obtain conditions that are reasonable in relation to the size of their debts; and real schedules and interest rates will be established that will enable them to pay and at the same time develop their economies.\nThere is no other solution. Let us not delude ourselves. If we are not able to devise a multilateral mechanism to meet these objectives, we shall become passive witnesses to an economic and social disaster that will embrace all countries, whether developed or not.\nIt is not possible to remain wealthy for long if that wealth is based on the ruin of others; far less so in today's interdependent world.\nThe economist and university professor Carlos Diaz Alejandro once said:\n\\\"To blame the victims is a tempting way to shirk responsibilities, especially when the victims themselves are far from virtuous.\\\" We have repeatedly maintained that debt is a joint responsibility and that, accordingly, seeking solutions to overcome its traumatic effects must necessarily also be a joint decision, one that is rational and equitable, agreed to by creditors and debtors.\nWe, the developing countries, are the victims: of that there can be no doubt. It is likewise true that we are not virtuous. We are not virtuous victims. Yet, in this case, the sins are not the sins only of just some but the sins of one and all. We cannot therefore accept that our people should bear the punishment. They most certainly are not to blame.\nNor is this a unilateral plea for our peoples. We are certain that the perils of the future will not spare those who now have the power to take the major decisions. This is the message that \u00ce wish to place on record here before this forum on behalf of the people of Venezuela, a message which is, or should be, the sum and conscience of mankind.\nA few days ago, meeting at the Regional Conference on Poverty, Latin American representatives observed that 61 million Latin Americans lived in a state of poverty which did not even allow them to satisfy their basic need for food. Faced with this reality, which could easily be observed even more dramatically in other developing regions, it is fitting to ask oneself: What right can be invoked, what obligations can be adduced, that transcend fundamental human rights? It can, of course, be argued that it is up to each Government to deal with the problems of the society it represents and that its responsibilities cannot be transferred to others. True, yes, but only when those responsibilities are theirs alone.\nNo one can claim that it is so. The existing interrelationship between the development of our economies and the international economy is a fact of life which, instead of leading us on to progress, seems to lead us to backwardness. Is this, or is it not, a collective responsibility?\t \nA very recent diagnosis of the Latin American economic situation produced by the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) , indicates that since the region has had to make thorough adjustments which give priority to the balances in external accounts, the end result is that we may be in a position to overcome the stagnation in growth and recover greater price stability; but in order to so, it is vital to put an end to, and reverse, the transfer of resources to which our economies have been subjected. In our view, this situation can be achieved only if the debt problem is approached and managed in a radically different way.\nVenezuela - and I am saying this on its behalf with full moral and political authority - considers that the efforts made have been more than enough.\nWe cannot envisage staying where we are as the scenario for our society in the future. We have reached the point at which development and foreign debt have become the antithesis of each other in a contradiction which we cannot evade indefinitely.\nVenezuela has made praiseworthy efforts to restore to its economy a stable and predictable frame of reference. The internal reorganization and adjustment which it has carried our have been beneficial in so far as they have been able to stimulate the strength and reserves of our society. To be able to bring this to fruition now, we must avoid the risk of inflation, reactivate investment processes, improve productivity, and raise the standard of living of our people, all of which depend on the level of resources we can invest in our own progress and on whether or not we are able to guarantee stability and predictability, which every economic activity and social advance require. \nLike the majority in our region, we stand a chance of coming out of this crisis successfully. It is accordingly imperative that we should not allow ourselves to slump in inertia and that we should take advantage of this transition. In order to do this, we need full understanding on the part of the international community and of the developed countries in particular, of what is at stake. It is impossible to imagine that their exercises in co-ordinating their economic policies are in themselves efforts which we could consider to be consonant with the circumstances facing the rest of the world; nor to imagine that our problems will be solved in this way.\nWe welcome the apparently greater clear-sightedness of the discussion at the Toronto meeting regarding the realities facing the developing world, but since there has been no constructive dialogue or short-term operational measures, we believe that we are entitled to reserve for ourselves the right to explore the possibilities that may prove to be needed.\nIn Latin America a group of countries have been thinking along these lines. The Acapulco Commitment to Peace, Development and Democracy, which we eight Latin American Presidents signed last year, is the expression of our shared concerns and our common purposes. We have set ourselves the necessary goals in the three fields covered by our commitment, and we intend to further and enlarge them. We shall soon be meeting again in fraternal Uruguay to refine our perceptions and take note of the degree of acceptance and understanding which our assessments have received.\nVenezuela is prepared to make its contribution to ensure that Latin America will not be relegated from the world which, it seems, is being forged at the current time.\nThe relaxation of tensions and the beginnings of solutions to grave international conflicts in various parts of the world are not fortuitous, just as the tensions and confrontations which provoked them were not.\nThe great Powers have entered into a process of dialogue and disarmament. We congratulate them and trust that this will be sustained. Countries in confrontation, zones in conflict, ate beginning to feel the results of those agreements, and at last recourse is being made to the multilateral institutions which were created to promote peace. In this context, allow me to congratulate the Secretary-General for his efforts and convey our sincere wishes that they may be supported and sustained by all in this Organization.\nFrom this process, which we trust will be successful, there will emerge once again the possibility of channelling more resources to development. It is inconceivable that material backwardness and human misery should continue to exist; and there is no possible justification for their increasing in a world whose global wealth is unprecedented. Will the international community ever be able to channel its resources in a constructive direction? When we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, we all had in mind the tragic economic, social and political conflicts from which the Organization was born. To date, however, we have for the most part been incapable of overcoming the lack of understanding which prevails as to how to bring prosperity within the reach of all.\nThe economic conflict still remains unchanged and is growing steadily worse. Imbalances in the world economy will lead us to disaster if the main countries involved do not assume their responsibilities with a full sense of obligation towards the international community. \nPerhaps the time has also come for the Secretary-General to take in hand the quest for a dialogue that will ensure that the international community takes a definite course of action to meet this unsatisfied need, a course of action in which external debt would occupy a prominent place. We certainly cannot go on having these kinds of parallel monologues in which the developed and the developing worlds have become entrenched. Perhaps we should renounce our traditional procedures and, through the Secretary-General's activity, bring the item before the highest political bodies and attempt to revive the philosophy and practice of co-operation to ensure development through joint agreement.\nEconomic problems are not unrelated to a host of others which we could begin to tackle in the same context. It has been said that Latin America is being absorbed by the underground drug economy. Radical measures have been required to deal with the crop areas, and, with increasing emphasis, relations between countries are to be made conditional on the eradication of this activity.\nVenezuela, which has earned an authoritative position in the anti-drug struggle, is determined to act on all fronts, as we demonstrated in 1984 when we placed before the General Assembly the idea of adopting a convention against the traffic and consumption of illicit drugs - a convention that was subsequently approved unanimously. But we notice that no-one has taken the trouble to point out the existence of and to act against an economic situation that is nourished by and profits systematically from the drug economy, which fosters the creation of economic power centres and consolidates them and, in practice, serves as its financial agent.\nIt would certainly be relevant for the United Nations to reveal the linkage between some members of the international financial world and the underground drug economy. We might likewise explore the traffic in toxic wastes, which has now taken on special dimensions in that attempts are under way to transport to earth-based reservoirs - for the most part in the territories of developing countries - the garbage of a wasteful consumer society imposed on us as a model j transferring, hand in hand with that, habits of corruption to facilitate the continuance of this illicit, repugnant business.\nAs members will have been able to appreciate, my message to the General Assembly endeavours to take up again, on an ethical basis, some of the challenges we face. We should never lose sight of this, because civilization and its progress are inconceivable if they are not linked with the most intimate aspirations of our Individual and collective being. In this constant pursuit of the most elementary rights of States and men, we have all relied on the United Nations - as the appropriate forum not only for conveying our concerns but, what is more important, for channelling resources and establishing competent bodies and mechanisms.\nUnited Nations efforts have made progress possible in matters to which we are particularly attached. I should like to mention some items which perhaps the distortion of priorities has downgraded to routine questions but which are still fully valid from our point of view. As is well known, Venezuela recognizes and promotes the interdependence of all human rights; political, economic, social and cultural. There are situations which constitute a permanent threat to those principles. Venezuela confirms it rejection of racial discrimination in South Africa - of which the classic example is Mandela's martyrdom - and affirms its solidarity with the people of Namibia, while urging that the talks and negotiations now under way should bring about the independence of that country.\nFor all those reasons, and because of the outstanding role the United Nations has played in bringing about peaceful solutions to international disputes, I reaffirm our solidarity with the Organization, express renewed faith in its principles and offer our best efforts in the service of the cause of peace and the coexistence of peoples.\nAlong those lines, I should like to emphasize the achievements of the United Nations in its endeavours to put an end to conflicts in regions that are particularly dear to us - such as the peace agreement in Afghanistan and the end of hostilities between Iraq and Iran, countries with which we maintain cordial and constructive relations.\nIt has been made evident that it is only the resolute will of the States involved that is capable of ending conditions favouring the attainment of specific objectives. For that reason, noting that in other regions there are definite prospects for peace, we urge the five Central American countries signatories of the Procedure for the Establishment of a Firm and Lasting Peace in Central America to devote themselves to complying with their commitments, regardless of the interference of elements alien to the area. The political dialogue between them should be restored genuinely and promptly, with a large dose of determination and with each party doing its share to put an end to a conflict that is being needlessly prolonged. We trust that reason will prevail, that peace and friendly coexistence in freedom and democracy will be the symbols of that cherished region.\nWe know that all United Nations organs are prepared to continue performing the tasks entrusted to them and to face in a constructive way any situation that threatens the well-being of mankind. Nevertheless, it is fitting to recall the serious financial difficulties which the United Nations has undergone - difficulties that require our utmost attention. It is clearly understood that it is the duty of all its Member States to contribute to supporting it on a permanent basis. \nMy final words today, as the representative of a country that is democratic in spirit and in action, ace to wish the United Nations success in its primary purpose of ensuring peace and security for the world. Venezuela will always stand by the United Nations, devised and created for the sake and the benefit of universal mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first of all to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and to assure him of the co-operation of the Hungarian delegation in his responsible activity for the success of our deliberations.\nI believe that this session has good chances of success. The atmosphere and work of the forty-second session were favourably influenced by the positive change in East-West relations and the increasing momentum of the Soviet-American dialogue. The past year has seen this favourable process strengthened and enriched with new elements. Another Soviet-United States summit was held, and the dialogue has been extended to lower levels as well, with concrete results embodied in the accords reached. Those accords were concrete reflections of the efforts undertaken to curb the arms race and to eliminate hotbeds of tension, and they may give stimulus to further steps in this direction, both in the relationship between the two great Powers and on a wider scale. The dynamic development of Soviet-American and East-West relations has become a determinant factor of strengthening international security.\nOther favourable events of international politics, among them a large number of high-level meetings and initiatives by different groups of countries to strengthen international co-operation and to achieve a peaceful settlement of international problems, have also made their effects felt during the past year. \nThere has been an intensification of efforts to resolve regional problems, including the elimination of hotbeds of crisis that have destabilizing effects and thus impede international \u0153-operation. Tangible and pioneering accords have been reached and encouraging negotiations are under way. No doubt world politics are still characterized by a great number of grave and pressing problems, but on the whole we have witnessed and acted to achieve a psychological breakthrough during the past year. Practice has proved that even the most complicated issues of world politics can be solved and that  given the political will of States, concrete results can be achieved which have a favourable influence on the international atmosphere and on the development of the international situation while giving impetus to the quest for solution of other problems. In this context, too, we attach decisive importance to the Soviet-United States agreement on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range nuclear missiles and to the Geneva accords on the settlement of the situation relating to Afghanistan. \nThe intensification of diplomatic activities to eliminate various hotbeds of crisis and the initial encouraging results allow us to hope that these favourable developments will be a prelude to the longer-term process rather than a momentary phenomenon. The United Nations has given practical proof that its involvement in similar efforts can be successful, while contributing to an improvement of its international image, and that its continuing active participation can promote the renewal of the world Organization.\nIn this activity a leading role has been played by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, to whom I wish to express my deep appreciation for his untiring efforts.\nMy Government is convinced that these favourable changes have resulted from the widening and the practical prevalence of the awareness that the mutual dependence or interdependence of States and peoples is a fact, a reality of our age. Consequently, it considers the strengthening of mutually advantageous international co-operation and of confidence among States and the peaceful settlement of emerging conflicts to be the only possible path of international coexistence. The Hungarian Government shapes the course of its foreign policy and participates in international relations in accordance with this spirit. It rejects the use of force or the threat of force; it regards security as a complex notion with closely interrelated military, political, economic, human rights and humanitarian aspects; and it maintains that no single State can establish its own security solely by military-technical means or to the detriment of other States and that security can only be built by political means, taking account of the interests of all States and by joint action resulting from dialogue.\nA pioneering role in advocating, disseminating and asserting this approach is played by the Soviet Union which has found partners in the leadership of the United States and other countries as well. At the same time, it is an equally noteworthy fact that the entire community of nations has also played a role in preparing and enhancing these changes: great Powers, medium-size and small countries, members of alliance systems, neutral and non-aligned nations alike, Hungary, as one of the small European countries, long ago recognized those opportunities which are at hand for a small country, and has been continuously and actively using them.\nThe favourable processes of world politics, the gaining ground of the ideas of international understanding and co-operation and the emergence of an atmosphere of confidence among States are fully in line with Hungary's national interests and foreign policy. Government is therefore making great efforts towards the development of international co-operation. It is trying to make use of all possibilities, bilateral as well as multilateral, to expound its sincere endeavours and to strengthen confidence among States. It identifies itself fully with the new concept of international security and co-operation, and is convinced that this new approach is bound to prevail in world politics before long.\nThis approach is represented by the foreign policy statements and practical steps of Hungary at the Vienna follow-up meeting on European security and co-operation, among others. We deem it highly important for the Vienna follow-up meeting to conclude its work as early as possible by the adoption of a substantive and balanced concluding document and, while giving a new impulse to European co-operation, making a favourable contribution to the creation of a common European home and improving the international situation as a whole. Present-day Europe is bound to the other continents by many ties. Given the specific conditions of Europe, a special model of co-operation is now evolving. An indispensable and useful framework and instrument for the realization of a common European home is the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) with a past of 13 years, which embraces the major components of an all-European home, that is, a programme for the reduction of the risk of military confrontation and the building of political, economic and humanitarian co-operation.\nFor this reason, the successful conclusion of the Vienna follow-up meeting by the adoption of a substantive concluding document would mean a genuine step forward in comparison with the obligations undertaken in the Final Act of Helsinki and the Concluding Document of Madrid. Its most important result would be the integration of conventional disarmament into the process of European security and co-operation. After the conclusion of the follow-up meeting it would then be . possible to start negotiations between the member States of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on questions of conventional disarmament. These negotiations would be far-reaching in terms of scope, goals and potential effect alike. Parallel to them, the talks on confidence-building, started in Stockholm, could be continued with the participation of all the 35 States.\nThe concluding document: of the follow-up meeting should place greater emphasis on questions of economic co-operation in Europe. It is gratifying to note that progress can be expected on questions of industrial, environmental and scientific-technical co-operation, but it is no less important to make headway in the human rights and humanitarian fields.\nIn our view, a real demand of our time is to set up a mechanism for consultations on human rights and humanitarian issues, one that would keep under review the status of implementation of the recommendations as formulated concerning the human dimension, envisaging compliance with agreements, respect for international expectations, a clearer definition of obligations already undertaken and creating guarantees for their fulfilment. The expert meetings, forums and other conferences, the convening of which can be expected to be mandated by the Vienna follow-up meeting, will serve a useful purpose in promoting substantive and balanced progress in the CSCE process and contributing to international security.\nIn promoting the favourable international political developments of the past period, a significant part has been played by the recognition that the establishment of international security is a task of enormous complexity affecting all spheres of life. Each concrete aspect of security is closely related to and bears upon all the others. The initiative concerning comprehensive international security, which is included in the agenda of the General Assembly, is based on this recognition. We earnestly hope that the appeal to Member States for the continuation of the dialogue, the joint elaboration of the elements of comprehensive security, and the determination of concrete practical measures deriving therefrom will meet the understanding and support of Member States. We all share the goal of ensuring that the gap often in evidence between the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the realities of the present-day international situation will be bridged as soon as possible.\nA basic aspect of security, directly affecting the security of life itself, is that of disarmament or arms build-up. The first genuine disarmament accord between the Soviet Union and the United States on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles is of historic significance, even though it affects a small part of the total stockpiles of weapons. The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - has opened a new chapter of disarmament history by introducing a system of verification with a formerly inconceivable set of strict and widely regulated conditions for control of compliance. So far the experience of compliance has given proof in practice as well that the quest for security through disarmament is indeed possible. \nThe representatives of the Soviet Union and the United States are working on an agreement on a 50-per-cent cut in strategic offensive weapons. We remain convinced that, if the parties continue to summon the necessary political will and remain ready for compromise, the political and technical obstacles to a treaty can be removed and another disarmament accord will be signed in the not-too-distant future, paving the way for building a world free from nuclear weapons.\nAn outstanding event of multilateral disarmament diplomacy last summer was the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. Unfortunately the psychological breakthrough I mentioned did not take place in the field of multilateral disarmament. It remains a pressing task to ensure that multilateral disarmament strengthen its viability and produce results in the form of concrete accords similar to those in bilateral disarmament. Although the participants in the special session on disarmament could not draw up a final document based on consensus, the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic, along with many other countries, does not consider the session to have been a failure.\nIn the view of my Government, the significance of the special session lies mainly in the fact that the need for a multilateral approach to disarmament issues has been reconfirmed by the international community. Furthermore, the participating States agreed that in future the United Nations should be assigned a greater role in dealing with questions of disarmament. It is of particular importance that the outstanding role to be played by the United Nations in controlling the fulfilment of disarmament accords received wide attention during the special session. We believe that such a substantive role could, in the long run, be fulfilled by an international verification agency to be set up under the auspices of the United Nations In this connection we attach great importance also to the efforts of the Delhi Six in this direction. \nDuring the special session a great number of concrete and important proposals were made which may serve as topics of future debate and negotiation at disarmament bodies or provide a basis for measures to be adopted by consensus. If we want to move forward in the field of multilateral disarmament those proposals should be considered on their merits at our present session as well.\nThe increased interest in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament was likewise felt during the special session. The renewed emphasis on that irreplaceable forum of disarmament was reflected in the high-level visits this year and in the major policy statements made on those occasions.\nAmong the agenda items of the Conference on Disarmament, special mention may be made of the intensification of work in the Ad Hoc Committee on the elaboration of a convention prohibiting chemical weapons. At the same time we deplore the fact that the Conference was unable to come any closer to finalizing a convention on the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons.\nStarting substantive work on the complete prohibition of nuclear-test explosions remains a priority task for the Conference on Disarmament to accomplish in furtherance of nuclear disarmament. The setting up of an appropriate machinery brooks no further delay. We think that, in order to overcome the present stalemate, it would require States members of the Conference on Disarmament to accept the need for multilateral talks on this issue and to adhere to the principles of progressivity.\nIn recent years the Conference on Disarmament has discussed the situation with regard to the prevention of the arms race in outer space and has identified the related problems. The present task is to elaborate concrete measures aimed at preventing, even if by stages, the extension of the arms race to outer space. In order to secure progress it would also be advisable to agree on partial aspects of practical relevance which by their importance affect the obtaining of the ultimate goal. One such aspect is the establishment of a mechanism for international verification.\nIt is similarly desirable to speed up work on the prohibition of radiological weapons. Closely related to it is the complete prohibition of attacks against nuclear facilities which should continue to be treated as a matter of urgency.\nAlso, in our days there is a growing international recognition that limitation and reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments at both global and regional levels ate major factors in affecting nuclear disarmament as well. The emphasis on conventional disarmament is logically consequential on the fact that the accumulation of conventional armaments is assuming increasingly threatening dimensions and that a significant part of the destructive capacity of such armaments is growing closer and closer to that of weapons of mass destruction and that conventional disarmament is marking time in comparison to the growing momentum of nuclear disarmament. The first promising efforts exerted in Europe to promote conventional disarmament will, we hope, be followed in other regions of the world as well.\nAfter the consultations of the 23, held parallel to the Vienna follow-up meeting, work is practically on the verge of being concluded on the mandate for the disarmament talks covering the area from the Urals to the Atlantic. My Government deems it important that the negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments get under way as soon as possible after the conclusion of the Vienna follow-up meeting. The measures likely to be adopted will affect the forward-based forces of the two great Powers as well as the forces of the small and medium-sized countries in the region and will call for the \u00a1Increased activity and involvement of the latter States too. Hungary is interested in an arrangement under which the forces in its territory will also be affected by the first stage of reductions. We expect the talks to result in a notable improvement in Europe's feeling of security in the foreseeable future and to create, by eliminating elements of threat causing concern to the patties, a stable situation characterized by a balance of mutual offensive incapability of the opposing forces. \nElimination of the regional hotbeds of crisis which pose a threat to international peace and security is an important element in establishing international security. \nCollective efforts and, in particular, the emerging understanding of the parties directly concerned have, in several regional issues included in the agenda of the General Assembly, placed increased emphasis on the effective involvement of the united Nations in the practical solution of such problems as well as in the creation of frameworks and technical conditions for settlement. The extent to which the world Organization will be able to perform its mission in maintaining peace and in securing cease-fires and their supervision will perhaps be a touchstone of the United Nations capacity for renewal.\nThe Geneva Accords relating to Afghanistan can be regarded as a highly significant precedent. The progress in the withdrawal of Soviet troops is clear evidence of the good will of the Soviet Union. We hope that the agreement will be fully observed by all the parties and that the advance of the process of national reconciliation will bring peace to Afghanistan. We deem it necessary that the present session of the General Assembly consider this problem in this spirit, under this approach.\nThe efforts of the United Nations or, more specifically, the Security Council and of the Secretary-General personally, have played an important part in achieving, after so many abortive attempts, a cease-fire in the Iraqi-Iranian war of nearly 10 years, which has claimed an enormous toll in human lives and material losses. Encouraging work is being done with the involvement of the United Nations to bring about peace. \nIn the prevailing situation, particular importance is attached to the self-restraint of the parties concerned and their willingness to co-operate in the implementation of the relevant resolution of the Security Council. Our modest contribution to achieving lasting peace is the participation of 15 Hungarians in the contingent of the United Nations Observer Group to monitor the cease-fire. My Government is hopeful that the cease-fire will soon be followed by the conclusion of peace, putting an end to the hostilities and devastation.\nOf course, United Nations efforts alone will be insufficient to secure success, because the political will and determination of the Governments of the countries involved are equally indispensable for the liquidation of a hotbed of crisis. The recent past has seen a promising sign of this in the search for a settlement of the question of Cyprus.\nAfter many years the possibility seems to be opening up of progress in the settlement of the situation in the southern part of Africa. We support the efforts to bring about a negotiated solution, and hope that the ongoing talks will soon lead to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), the granting of independence to Namibia, and international guarantees of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Angola.\nThe positive turn in the quest for the peaceful solution of regional conflicts strengthens our conviction that intensification of United Nations activities would increase the chances of a just settlement of the Middle East crisis too. It is increasingly recognized that the road to a solution of the conflict satisfactory to all the parties concerned leads through an international conference, to be held under the auspices of the United Nations. The events taking place in the occupied territories similarly underline the pressing need for an early settlement of the crisis.\nThe entire international atmosphere would be favourably influenced by the early settlement of the conflict in Central America, which is a serious factor of destabilization, with the participation of all the countries concerned and on the basis of respect for the generally accepted norms of international law.\nMy Government is in agreement with and follows with confidence the efforts being made to solve the question of Kampuchea by peaceful means within national frameworks. It is highly appreciative of the moderation and sense of reality displayed by the countries and the political forces working for a settlement of this problem.\nHungary welcomes the proposals aimed at reducing and eliminating tensions in the Korean peninsula in an effort to find ways and means of creating the necessary conditions for solving the problem of Korea, keeping in view the strengthening of peace and security in the Asian region and having regard to the interests of the Korean people.\nThe subjects of the world economy and international economic relations occupy an increasingly important place in the activities of the United Nations. We find this only natural since international co-operation and the external environment of economic development have become of vital importance to all Member States. However, the economic, financial, trade, scientific-technical and environmental activities of the United Nations and its specialized agencies still fail to reflect fully the actual conditions and priorities determined by the realities of the present-day world, although the 1970s and the 1980s have seen radical changes in the world economy.\nOn the threshold of the last decade of this century, Governments should seek to ensure that the United Nations and its specialized agencies are not simply passive followers of world economic developments, but act to meet economic challenges, thereby contributing, on the basis of the common will worked out by consensus and by reconciling national and regional interests, to the creation of conditions that will ensure to the fullest c :tent possible the sustainable growth of national economies and the steady expansion of international economic relations.\nWe have no doubt that this process will not be free from conflict. Efforts should therefore be concentrated on enhancing the role of the United Nations and its organs in forecasting developments and balances in the world economy, as well as their ability to manage economic, trade, financial, environmental and other conflicts and to promote their solution., We are convinced that harmonization of interests and development of conflict management abilities can create the conditions for international organizations to exert the roost fruitful influence both on the development of national economies and on different areas of regional and global co-operation.\nMy Government proceeds from the assumption that national, regional and global objectives can be harmonized on the basis of openness and mutual respect for interests. However, the common will, or a common policy arrived at in international organizations, cannot be truly effective unless account of it is taken of international realities and economic laws. The efforts to bring about regional integration constitute one such law at the present stage of development of the world economy. The regional integration organizations play an increasing role in the world economy and will act for a long time to come as a stimulus to economic growth. At the same time, certain trends of isolationism may also prevail at the stage of growing economic co-operation within integrated regions. We think that such trends, even though serving the interests of participants in such integration in the short run, work to impede the sustainable development of the entire world economy in the long run. Therefore we welcome the elevation of relations between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CHEA) and the European Economic Community (EEC) to an official level, together with the bilateral agreement already concluded between Hungary and the \u0415EC and other future bilateral agreements between BBC and CMEA member States. This development fits well into the European process of co-operation and confidence-building and serves to promote its fuller development.\nWork is to start soon on the elaboration of the programme for development and co-operation for the last decade of this century. We believe that in formulating this programme for the fourth development decade Governments should start from present-day realities in order to set the base for the future. I can assure members that my Government will take an active and constructive part in this highly important work.\nInternational efforts to protect and ensure respect for human rights should serve the same purposes as the solution of world economic and financial problems through mutual compromise and joint action \u00b7 namely, to promote the welfare of the society and the individual, to create conditions of life worthy even of the next century, and to bring about the full enjoyment of human freedoms. A corner-stone of the Hungarian Government's foreign policy is the encouragement and strengthening of international co-operation in the human rights and humanitarian fields, with the fullest possible use of the channels provided by the United Nations for that purpose.\nRespect for and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the development of international co-operation with this end in view are important factors in increasing confidence among States. There is growing recognition that the enjoyment of human rights and the maintenance of international security are directly and closely interrelated. On the one hand, this linkage is manifest in that grave and systemic violations of human rights and disregard of internationally recognised norms have, as international experience shows, an adverse effect on inter-State relations and the international political atmosphere, and may jeopardize international security. On the other hand, the decades since the adoption of the universal Declaration of Human Rights have provided a not insignificant lesson that promotion of the exercise of human rights is possible only under conditions of detente and peaceful coexistence. I recall that one of the first victims of the cold-war era was precisely the cause of human rights.\nFrom this it follows that the proposition that the question of human rights is exclusively the interned affair of States has become a thing of the past, once and for all. By drawing up an international catalogue of human rights and establishing international organs and mechanisms to monitor and supervise compliance by States with their obligations in the human rights and humanitarian fields, the United Nations has given a new dimension to multilateral co-operation and focused the attention of the international community and international public opinion on the question of human rights. In this regard, as yet another sign of the Hungarian Government's readiness to co-operate, coupled with the openness of our policy, the Hungarian People's Republic earlier last month declared its recognition of the competence of the Human Rights Committee under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and at the same time acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Covenant.\nBy that action we wished to confirm that we were ready and willing to participate - as an equal partner - in the domain of human rights, too, while supporting joint international efforts to implement related norms and control compliance with them in a common, international activity.\nThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic and public opinion in Hungary follow with particular attention the enjoyment by nationalities of their rights, and are sensitive to violations of the individual and collective rights of minorities. This is natural for the added reason that Hungarians living in the neighbouring countries constitute the largest national minorities in Europe. We advocate at every forum, as elementary demands, the preservation of diverse cultural traditions and the folklore of national minorities', protection of historic relics\u00b7, and full enjoyment of the right to cultivate and use the mother tongue, including education in the mother tongue in schools at all levels. We are convinced that forced assimilation of national minorities, their cultural oppression and destruction of conditions for their independent intellectual and physical existence are unacceptable to the international community of our times.\nTherefore, we deem it important that in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights we should embark upon the road of codifying those rights which were not covered by the Declaration. In our view these are: the right of peoples to self-determination and the preservation of national culture and the effective protection of the individual and collective rights of national minorities. It is a basic requirement of our age to eliminate discrimination of any kind, including discrimination against nations and national minorities. In our belief such an international, legally binding regulation of norms would contribute to the deepening of human contacts, thereby making those contacts more substantial.\nWe highly appreciate the efforts, which we think cannot be replaced by anything else, made under the auspices of the United Nations to put an end to mass, grave violations of human rights. Humiliating practices and policies of discrimination on grounds of race, nationality, religion or any other basis, violation of the tight to life, liberty and security of the person, torture and other cruel and inhuman punishment and treatment, physical coercion, forced resettlement, limitations on, or denial of, the fundamental economic, social and cultural rights of people are all phenomena whose elimination calls for effective and resolute action by the international community and the United Nations as its institution. Solving the problems of our age and extending international co-operation in keying with the interests of all States and peoples presuppose intensification of multilateral diplomacy. Forums for the multilateral accommodation of interests and the search for and adoption of arrangements acceptable to all parties concerned are achieved by Regional and multilateral organizations and conferences.\nThe improvement of the international situation during the past year and the more favourable conditions prevailing at present will certainly increase the role o\u00a3 the United Nations in, and its concrete possibilities of, performing the tasks laid down in the Charter. \nIt is of importance to international co-operation and the settlement of outstanding pressing problems that the world Organization - and primarily we, representatives of Member States - make the most of the favourable conditions to renew the work of the United Nations, enhance its prestige and effectiveness, increase its capacity for practical action and ensure the smooth operation of the world Organization in accordance with the requirements of our time.\nThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic wishes to contribute to those efforts by pursuing a foreign policy fully in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and by the active and constructive participation of its delegation in the work of the forty-third session.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\nMr. President, I should like to begin by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. The Government of Iceland wishes you every success in carrying out the duties of your important and prestigious office.\nThe signing of the United Nations Charter was viewed by many as the first great victory of peace in the modern world. A system of international security was foreseen whereby peace would be ensured through collective action, and regional enforcement would be rendered largely superfluous. Sadly, the dream has never been realized. Instead, the onset of the cold war stimulated the growth of military alliances and a system of security through the mutual terror of nuclear armaments.\nI will not say whether the Charter itself was basically at fault in being overly optimistic. That may be so, but I am certain, nevertheless, that the quest for \\\"one world\\\", enshrined in the Charter, has never been wholly abandoned. Moreover, one should not underestimate the significant strides mankind has recently made towards removing some of the hurdles that have stood in the way of strict observance of the United Nations Charter.\nHistory, of course, will be the final judge. Host of us believe that we now stand at a crossroads in East-West relations. I certainly do not wish to underestimate the role of Western unity and steadfastness in bringing us to the present juncture. There is no denying, however, that credit is due to the East as well, where refreshing winds of change have resulted in a more dynamic and forthcoming approach to foreign policy. Improvements have been particularly notable in arras control and on regional issues. In arms control, we have for the first time started moving beyond mere limitations on nuclear armaments to meaningful reductions. The Treaty for the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear weapons, welcomed by my country as a milestone achievement, has inspired confidence across the whole range of arms control issues and given fresh impetus to talks aimed at cutting strategic nuclear arsenals as well as chemical and conventional weapons. No less significant is the movement we have witnessed towards the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts, many of which have been a thorn in the side of the international body politic for a good many years.\nTaken as a whole, these developments have created hopes that the United Nations - no longer hobbled by cold war rivalry - might begin to achieve the results hoped for at the time of its founding.\nThere can be no denying that the progress we have made is due in large measure to the improved atmosphere in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. It would be a mistake, however, to view the United Nations simply as an accessory to super-Power diplomacy. For one thing, to do so is to overlook the tremendous work done by the United Nations specialized agencies towards alleviating the causes of human conflict. By seeking to eliminate such causes, be they poverty, disease, ignorance or discrimination, the United Nations has not only rendered valuable service to peace in different areas of the world, but has also prevented regional conflicts from spilling over into cold war battlegrounds.\nMoreover, one is entitled to ask where we would stand had it not been for the crucial mediating role of the United Nations in many regional conflicts. This in many ways, has been the United Nations finest hour, as has been duly recorded by the well-deserved award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Organisation's peace-keeping forces this year. In a relatively short time the Organization has negotiated the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. Thanks to the United Nations, an end to the war in Western Sahara may now be in sight and progress has been made towards a settlement in Cyprus. If all goes well. United Nations efforts in Angola and Namibia - whose rightful claim to independence can no longer be ignored - may bear fruit in the not-too-distant future.\nFor a nation like Iceland, which has no armed forces of its own, glad tidings like these are particularly welcome. But let us not forget that safeguarding the progress made will require continued dedication and good will on the part of all. Much will certainly depend on the work taking place at the Vienna follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, not least in the humanitarian dimension. By honouring their commitment to fundamental human rights, including the right of men and women to participate fully in all spheres of social and economic life, Governments not only raise the level of well-being among their subjects, but also render service to people. In the current end-game in Vienna, Iceland will work for a substantive outcome, based on a balanced approach to the whole range of Issues covered in the Helsinki Final Act.\nI find it a curious paradox that at a time of heightened expectations the United Nations should find itself in the throes of a major financial crisis. Iceland applauds plans by the Soviet Union and lately by the United States to pay up arrears, and appeals to other members which have not already done so, to do the same. This is particularly urgent, as it appears that increased United Nations peace-keeping activities will make greater demands on its resources. Emphasis must also continue to be placed on the process of reform and renewal within the Organization itself.\nAs we look ahead there are numerous major challenges that confront us.\nRecent progress in bilateral arms control notwithstanding, the cost of the arms race is increasing and so are the precision and destructive power of nuclear weapons. Clearly, therefore, nuclear arms control must remain a top priority. As we pursue major reductions in strategic nuclear weaponry, care must be taken that any possible shift of military confrontation to new categories of weapons or regions be firmly resisted. In the view of the Icelandic Government, it is of the utmost importance that a treaty to cut land-based long-range missiles should lead to less military activity at sea. For this reason, Icelanders have welcomed the super-Powers' agreement in principle at the Washington summit meeting to search for ways of limiting long-range, nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles.\nAs is well known, my country does not allow nuclear weapons on its territory and presumes that visiting naval vessels will respect its sovereignty in this regard. One need hardly belabour the point that accidents involving nuclear arms at sea could have disastrous consequences for a nation like Iceland which bases its livelihood on the living resources of the sea.\nAs we move towards significant reductions in nuclear arsenals, the need to correct the current imbalance in the field of conventional forces and equipment in Europe has acquired new urgency. Having participated, along with its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in negotiations with the Warsaw Pact on a mandate for new conventional stability talks, Iceland hopes for the early adoption of a mandate to ensure that these important talks can get under way this year as envisaged.\nThis year's third special session on disarmament may have been disappointment in that it failed to reach a consensus on a final document. My country was nevertheless encouraged that a number of positive steps were taken. I draw attention in particular to the concrete discussions on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Nordic memorandum on that question, as well as to the discussions on verification issues and chemical weapons. The early conclusion of a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons must remain among our foremost objectives. Iceland is encouraged that negotiations on this issue within the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva have readied a final stage. I also welcome the opportunity here to declare ray country's full support for the proposal of President Reagan in this forum two weeks ago to convene an international conference to bolster the Geneva Protocol of 1925 outlawing the use of chemical weapons.\nAs we chart the course of the multilateral disarmament agenda for the decade ahead, we must build on the paper which nearly became the final document of the third special session and on the commitments we all undertook in the Final Document of the first special session in 1978.\nI spoke earlier of the progress we have made on regional issues. Regrettably, there have also been exceptions. The thaw in relations between East and West he I failed to advance noticeably the peace process in the Middle East. Any peaceful solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict will depend on mutual restraint and a spirit of compromise. At a minimum, while Israel must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to determine their own future, the Arab world must cease to question the undisputed right of the State of Israel too exist. The tragic events in the occupied Israeli territories over the last year have rightly caused concern among the world community and reawakened interest in an international conference, under United Nations auspices, to discuss a comprehensive peace settlement. \nTurning to Central America, recent peace efforts have also fallen short of expectations. Iceland, like the rest of the Nordic countries, is firmly of the view that the countries in a given region should themselves be in charge of the building of peace and democracy there.\nAs to the situation in South-East Asia, I should like only to reiterate the continuing relevance of last year's General Assembly resolution on Kampuchea, of which ray country was a co-sponsor, and which will be resubmitted in a slightly amended form this year.\nIf I have dwelt too long on the political and military issues, it is only because I fear that armed conflicts may yet turn our budding optimism into pessimism and despair. At the same time, any listing of the tasks that lie ahead would remain quite incomplete if it failed to mention the challenges facing us in the related areas of environment and development.\nAs was rightly observed in last year's report of the Brundtland Commission, we face a vast and expanding dimension of responsibility in the sphere of ecology. Problems that are transnational in character, be they pollution, the \\\"greenhouse\\\" effect or the deterioration of the ozone layer, must be tackled with a global strategy, if they are not seriously to impair the quality of life on this planet.\nNeglect of the environment is in turn directly related to the gloomy economic situation of many of the developing countries. In Africa, deforestation and desertification are worsening the plight of a number of States in which per capita income levels are even lower today than they were at the beginning of the decade. An enhanced development effort is urgently called for to alleviate poverty and hunger in this hemisphere. But the problem of development, as everyone knows, is not confined to the decaying environment. I want to mention in particular the crushing debt burden of the developing world, which not only stifles necessary economic growth but also places a dangerous strain on the feeble democratic foundations of a number of States. While no one should minimize the manifold and complex aspects of this problem, it is economically unsound and morally indefensible that the industrialized nations should siphon off from the developing world billions of dollars in debt repayments and interests. According to estimates of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), such net transfers from poor countries to rich currently amount to between $US 30 billion and SUS 40 billion per year.\nTo remedy this state of affairs in the long term, increased assistance and debt relief will only be sufficient provided they are linked to a comprehensive plan for structural change in North-South relations. Let us also be mindful that no economic system can be expected to be fully satisfactory or truly effective if it lades the genuine and full participation of all people, men and women alike. In this connection, let me subscribe to the view expressed by Iceland's Minister of Social Affairs at the Nordic Council's Equal Bights Conference in Oslo last August, calling for the establishment of a special United Nations equal rights organization.\nThe link between human rights and development is often close. Iceland feels strongly that the world community must keep up its pressure on the racist regime in Pretoria, whose policies of apartheid and destabilization are among the root causes of the human tragedy taking place in southern Africa.\nIn a year when we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we should reaffirm our obligation to doing away with human rights abuses, wherever they take place and regardless of colour or political creed. \nI referred at the outset to the Charter's sanguine vision of universal peace Sid security. The realization of that vision may still be far off in the future. Yet, with peace and freedom on the march around the globe as they have rarely been before over the last 40 years, confidence is reviving in the efficiency of this world Organization.\nBut while some of the critics of the United Nations may have been disarmed, there is need to warn against unrealistic expectations. For one thing, merely to safeguard what has been accomplished will require redoubled effort. In this sense, it would be true to say that we must run simply to stay in place.\nIn conclusion, may I express the hope that this year's Assembly will result in the strengthening of our commitments to the purposes of the Charter. In this endeavour, I can pledge the full and loyal support of my country.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nFirst of all I should like to congratulate you, Sir, a good friend of ours and an outstanding diplomat and politician of Argentina, on your election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly\nMy appreciation goes also to Mr. Peter Florin, the Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, for his successful guidance of the forty-second session.\nThe deep changes on the world scene in the past year provide in themselves a different, much better atmosphere for the work of this session of the General Assembly. Yet they impose on it an additional obligation as well: to assess the real scope of these changes and outline the further mission - the peace mission - of the Organization. The Nobel Peace Prize that has just been awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping operations represents a significant recognition of the achievements of the Organization.\nThe Secretary-General's report was couched in guarded optimism. That is understandable and realistic in the present-day world. I wish to express to Mr. Perez de Cuellar my gratitude for and recognition of the successes that the world Organization has achieved in the past year.\nThe fact is that the forty-third session is beginning its work in auspicious circumstances. The process of negotiations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America continues. It has a positive impact on almost all aspects of international relations. Improvement in their relations could bring about progress in the quest for solutions to almost all the crises in the world, since there is evident interdependence between the accommodation of the super-Powers and overall developments in international relations.\nFor the first time it may appear that the dangerous spiral of the arms race has ceased.\nThese processes are a consequence not only of direct relations between the super-Powers, but also of the awareness of the international community that dialogue is inevitable. What is the role and contribution of the policy of non-alignment and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in fostering such awareness? Since its inception the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has striven to overcome bloc divisions and all other divisions in the world. For almost 30 years it has called upon the great Powers to stop confrontation, proceed to negotiations and establish co-operation. \nI think that we can say that the ongoing positive processes affirm the principles of the policy of non-alignment. The Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Countries, held at the beginning of this month in Nicosia, demonstrated the Movement's determination to continue to exert an active influence on the development of international relations. What of importance in the perception of the present-day world, in Yugoslavia's view, came out of Nicosia?\nFirst, in welcoming the rapprochement between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the non-aligned countries continue at the same time to draw attention to the serious problems standing in the way of this process, and will, for these reasons, and in a desire further to promote and deepen the climate of detente, do their best to ensure that the present atmosphere may be maintained. The efforts that ate being made, and the results achieved, should be translated into a lasting and comprehensive process benefiting all countries and peoples. \nSecondly, super-Power bilateralism is a reality of our time. However, it does not, of itself, ensure the settlement of world problems. Co-operation between the super-Powers is an absolute prerequisite; yet genuine and lasting solutions can be achieved only with the participation of all interested parties.\nThe non-aligned countries are prepared to contribute actively and constructively to the efforts aimed at resolving regional and global problems. That was stated very eloquently the day before yesterday by our Chairman, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe; Mr. Robert Mugabe. \nThe successful initiatives taken recently by the United Nations have confirmed its irreplaceable role. The past year has testified to the fact that progress in dealing with world crises is achievable through direct, or at least indirect, United Nations involvement. It is of course a two-way process. The easing of tension makes the great Powers more willing to rely on United Nations mechanisms. This leaves room for the world Organization to take freer and more creative action and for its Member States to put forward initiatives. We should like to believe that the time is behind us when it was necessary to fight attempts to marginalize the United Nations, and that the task ahead is to focus our efforts on its even greater and more decisive participation in the solution of world problems.\nAlthough they constitute the majority in the United Nations, the non-aligned countries have neither an interest in advocating majority rule, nor the need to do so. They realize that this is not a viable way to resolve problems.\nThe process of the adjustment of the United Nations to present needs and the rationalization of its activities should be accelerated. At this point, solving the current financial problems of the United Nations and financing its future important undertakings for peace is the matter of the greatest urgency.\nThe world Organization is facing a number of challenges; to continue and speed up the resolution of existing hotbeds of crisis and, perhaps even more important, to initiate steps in that direction in the areas where they are still lacking.\nIt is also necessary to follow up and strengthen the process of disarmament as well as to start to deal with international economic problems.\nAfter eight years of bloodshed the peoples of Iran and Iraq can look to the future with more confidence. Negotiations have replaced war. \nWe hope that a just solution to the conflict will be reached through the consistent and integral implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). That is in the interest of those two countries, as well as of peace and security in the region and beyond.\nAfter so many years of illegal occupation by South Africa, Namibia is today closer to becoming an independent and sovereign State, as envisaged by the United Nations plan.\nWe welcome the process of negotiations between Angola, Cuba and South Africa. Ending the conflict in southern Africa and Namibia's accession to independence will greatly contribute to security and co-operation in that region. We believe that the end of the abhorrent system of apartheid - against which resolute international action, including comprehensive sanctions, continues to be required - will then not be far off. Compliance with the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan, and their integral implementation, are of the utmost importance if peace, independence, non-aligned status and free development ate to be assured to that country and its people. The constructive engagement of the various elements in the region raises the hope that the people of Kampuchea, one of the founding members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, will at long last enjoy their right to peace, independence and sovereignty of decision on their own destiny.\nWe also believe that continuance of the mission of good offices of the Secretary-General and the resumption of the talks between the two Cypriot communities will bring about progress in resolving the problem of Cyprus.\nSimilarly, we hope that, through the involvement of our Organization and the countries of the region, the problem of Western Sahara will be solved in the near future in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).\nHowever, the improved atmosphere in the world has as yet had no effect on some of the existing crises. Implementation of the peace plan of the five Central American countries has encountered serious difficulties and obstacles. We must continue to support the efforts to bring about a just solution of the situation in Central America, as well as Nicaragua's right to safeguard its sovereignty and integrity.\nIt is high time for the international community to make it possible for the Palestinian people to enjoy their right to self-determination and statehood. Together with a large number of other countries, Yugoslavia supports the early convening of an international conference, under United Nations auspices and with the participation of all parties directly concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (\u0420LO), the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. This is the realistic way to bring about a comprehensive solution to the Middle East crisis and to ensure that all countries of the region may live in peace and security on their own territory. \nThe broadest section of the international community demands that a new momentum be added to the process of disarmament that has begun. This was particularly highlighted at the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament, at which, with stronger political will and greater efforts, we could have achieved more. We hope, however, that the numerous proposals put forward at that session, including those presented by Yugoslavia, will be taken into account at the current session. Peace and security cannot be anybody's monopoly, much less an exclusive right. The destiny of mankind is the concern and responsibility of all of us alike.\nIf our aim is the complete elimination of nuclear arms, the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test ban is one of the most urgent tasks. Nuclear disarmament is, of course, of priority importance. Yet other weapons should not be overlooked. We consider that work on chemical-weapons convention should be completed with the utmost urgency.\nThe continuous sophistication, stockpiling and use of conventional weapons explain tellingly why we demand the launching also of conventional arms negotiations at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels.\nI believe that the time is ripe for broad-based and well considered action by all countries to promote improved international economic relations and co-operation. The international community must not miss the historic opportunity offered by the trend of relaxation and negotiation. Top priority should be accorded to the interrelated problems of debt, trade, finance, technology and development. It is important to note that the debt problem of the developing countries is increasingly perceived as a most serious global problem. There is agreement in principle that solutions should be sought through an agreed, development-oriented strategy. Effective reduction of the level of indebtedness of the developing countries would remove one of the major obstacles not only to their development but also to expansion of the world economy as a whole. We assess positively the decisions of the Toronto summit concerning the debt of the least developed countries. We hope that those decisions will prompt further action encompassing broader aspects of debt problems. \nThe vicious circle in which the developing countries are locked with regard to international trade has to be broken. The demand that debts should be duly repaid cannot be met if restrictions are imposed on exports, which provide the sole source of funds for debt servicing. We remain committed to the open multilateral trading system, but we are increasingly convinced of the urgent need to eliminate the dangerous anomalies that have accumulated with respect to it. A prerequisite for the successful continuance and completion of the ongoing Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations is the cessation and rollback of protectionism and consideration of new areas, such as services and trade-related investment measures and other measures in the context of development requirements.\nThe increasing attention being devoted to environmental problems is entirely legitimate. There can be no progress without industrial and technological development, but it can be ensured only if the necessary timely protective measures are taken. The very survival of the human race on a planet worthy of human beings is in question. The continuing active involvement of the international community in the promotion and protection of human rights is a prerequisite for any real democratization of international relations and for safeguarding world peace  These noble goals are no less threatened by the phenomenon of terrorism.\nWhatever is undertaken in the world Organization should serve man in building peacefully, and in freedom, the present and a better future. To that end the Nicosia declaration states that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should pursue a policy of respect for, and promotion the attainment of, the rights of individuals and peoples.\nIn addition to the work of this Organization, multilateralism is being promoted through a number of in our opinion very useful forms of regional co-operation. Through such co-operation the participating countries authentically and directly express their preoccupations and aspirations. The very first meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries was held in Belgrade last February. It strengthened our belief that the Balkan countries will make a significant contribution to the processes of improving international relations. \nAt the Vienna follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, Yugoslavia, along with other non-aligned and neutral countries of Europe, has been endeavouring to bring about a successful outcome of that meeting.\nThe historical and political experience of this generation shows that neither the noble and enduring principles upon which this Organization is built nor the legitimate aspirations of the international community can be realized without the wide-ranging democratization of international relations.\nUnlike the times when freedom, independence and peace were high ideals but an almost unattainable goal, genuine conditions are gradually being created now for the establishment of a new international order that previous generations, particularly those who lived through the horrors of the two world wars, could only have dreamed of.\nThe increasing interdependence is an objective basis for the reintegration of the world, which is transforming itself from bipolar into multipolar so that it may one day become genuinely pluralistic. A single and secure world is conceivable only with the full participation of all. For that reason we are rededicating ourselves with even greater enthusiasm to the fulfilment of the tasks facing the United Nations, tasks which are paving the way for a better and more just world order, in which all the participants will be able fully to pursue their national as well as the common interests.\nThe dangerous injection of ideology into international relations and the imposition of \u201ceternal truths\\\" seem to be gradually fading away. This facilitates the endeavours to lay, step by step, the foundations of a more secure and stable future. Such a world could not be based on the balance and domination of power and on the exclusion of the \u00a1majority of countries from the process of economic and technological development. In our opinion, it should be based on the full affirmation and implementation of some principles and processes which are being strengthened at the present time. They are: independence within increasing interdependence; multipolarity instead of bipolarity of the world; pluralism of socio-political systems, their co-existence and co-operation based on a footing of equality; human rights as universal values; peaceful settlement of all conflicts and disputes; universal participation in economic-technological development in the interest of mankind.\nAll this means in actual fact the democratization of international relations, that is, the participation of all countries in dealing with and in resolving international issues.\nThe necessary and, in our view, inevitable process of the world's future integration can be based on those foundations. This implies the gradual elimination of all the barriers that still divide the world today. Only in a world integrated in that way can a solid two-track relationship exist between the development of the world as a whole and the development of its component parts and individuals - countries and people.\nWith full respect for the principles of freedom, independence and equality, we should aspire towards a world in which not a single pact will be left out of the prosperous development. We still need the belief out of which our Organization was born, so that, through the joint efforts of all, our visions may become a reality. Viewed from today's perspective, this may appear to be an ideal the realization of which seems uncertain and, in any case, to belong to the distant future. Nevertheless, we believe that we must strive for that future. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the European Community and its member States I should like first to express my most sincere congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\nI should also like to express the Community's profound appreciation to the outgoing President for the way in which he conducted the deliberations of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.\nThe 12 member States of the European Community wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for his tenacious and constant efforts to find solutions to the problems facing the international community. We are delighted to see that in a number of cases his efforts have led to positive results.\nThe forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations opens in a climate marked by positive and encouraging developments. East-West relations have undergone a favourable evolution, highlighted by the summit meetings between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union. An important and significant agreement on arms limitation and control which involves the destruction of nuclear weapons has been concluded. The Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States of America on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - which brings about for the first time the destruction of a whole category of weapons, is a milestone in the history of East-West relations and has opened the way for further progress in other areas of arms control and disarmament. It as an initiative fully supported by the Twelve. Considerable progress has been made towards the peaceful solution of some of the major conflicts affecting the world community. Soviet troops are in the process of withdrawing from Afghanistan; there is a case-fire in the Gulf; the conflicts in Cambodia and Angola look less unstable than they did a year ago. The Twelve, which have actively contributed towards bringing about this climate, cannot but rejoice.\nHowever, there are still serious problems to which no solution has been found and new challenges are looming on the horizon which will require persistent efforts on the part of all members of the international community. It is therefore essential that we pursue our efforts, convinced that it is in a growing spirit of realism, co-operation and dialogue that the problems that preoccupy us may find suitable solutions. The United Nations is and must remain the advocate of this spirit.\nIt is with great satisfaction that the Twelve have welcomed the Organization's growing role as well as its accomplishments in recent months. It is an encouraging sign of the strengthening of respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter, which constitute the best basis for ensuring world peace, as well as for promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and economic, cultural and social progress, especially this year when we ate celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We ate therefore determined to support every effort in order to enhance the authority of the United Nations and render its existing mechanisms and activities more effective.\nI must lay emphasis here on a problem of particular concern to us, that of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Need I recall the priority which the Twelve give to them and the importance they attach to the promotion of and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in all countries? In this field, the Twelve's activities are guided by the principles which were set out in their Declaration of 21 July 1986, principles which were initially enshrined in tie Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants. We expect all Members of the United Nations to live up to the obligations they have freely assumed. We welcome any efforts aimed at strengthening the existing mechanisms established to ensure that nations' words are matched by deeds.\nThis year in which we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let us all recommit ourselves to its principles and their implementation for a better, humane world.\nThe recent political events have enhanced the role of the United Nations in the process of settling international conflicts. It is, however, ironic that our Organization and, not least, its peace-keeping operations face a most serious financial crisis at a time when confidence in its usefulness is growing. The Twelve have made efforts to fulfil their financial obligations to the United Nations and ate determined to do so in the future. We strongly urge all Member States to show their support for the Organisation by fulfilling their financial obligations in full and on time, according to the Charter. We hope that our commitment to a strong and effective United Nations will be shared by all Member States. \nWe live in an increasingly interdependent world in which very few problems can be solved by any one country alone. The very existence of the European Community reflects acknowledgement of this fact. A year ago my colleague the Foreign Minister of Denmark, which held the presidency of the European Community, stated that with the entry into force of the Single European Act the Community had entered into a new phase of close collaboration. I can add today that, in fact, the Community has embarked upon a stage of its development that is characterized by new momentum for integration combined with renewed confidence in our common future. We have made headway towards the objective of advancing European unity and contributed together to making concrete progress towards a European union. We have increased our efforts jointly to formulate and implement a European foreign policy, thus striving to promote peace and stability in Europe and the world. The Community is not, however, an inward-looking organization. It is inspired by an open spirit of co-operation and active participation in solving the political, economic and social problems affecting the international community.\nThe Twelve have long supported and actively contributed to the process of improvement in East-West relations and are determined to continue to work in this direction in a realistic and constructive manner. They welcome not only the developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe which have led to the opening of the political systems and economies of those countries but also the developments in the way those countries approach certain international issues. The changes contribute to consolidating and intensifying East-West relations. It is only between open societies which get to know one another and communicate without barriers that real trust can be created, this being the only reliable basis for lasting security.\nIn this context, efforts regarding arms control and disarmament are of great importance. Since our last session of the General Assembly we have witnessed very positive developments in this field, above all the signature and ratification of the INF Agreement, which the Twelve fully supported. Many of the Treaty's provisions set an important precedent for future agreements on arms control, in particular asymmetrical reductions and intrusive verification procedures.\nThe Twelve fully support efforts to bring about a 50-per-cent reduction in the strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as an agreement on space issues which would be a significant contribution to world-wide stability in this field.\nWe also strongly support the efforts made within the United Nations to tackle the problems of nuclear and conventional disarmament, verification, confidence-building measures and military transparency in the military field. The Twelve strongly advocate the early establishment of a global and effectively verifiable ban on chemical weapons and reaffirm their commitment to the total elimination of those weapons. Joint efforts at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva can bring closer the resolution of pending problems, including the complex but fundamental verification issues, in a way acceptable to all. Those of the Twelve who are participants in the Conference will continue vigorously to pursue this goal at the negotiations.\nThe adoption of Security Council resolutions 612 (1988) and 620 (1988) was a notable further milestone. The Twelve consequently reiterate their support for action which could be undertaken to establish impartially the facts relating to alleged use of chemical weapons against the Kurdish population.\nThe Twelve regret that the third special session devoted to disarmament was not brought to a close without an agreed concluding document. However, important constructive work was done during the session and it is hoped that the First Committee will profit from this experience.\nIt is not surprising that in the framework of arms control and disarmament the Twelve attach particular importance to problems concerning security in Europe, where serious imbalances persist, in particular in the conventional field. Therefore, the need for conventional arms control - the key issue of European security - is especially urgent in this area also. The Twelve have long advocated the establishment of a stable and secure balance of conventional forces at lower levels within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process, the elimination of disparities prejudicial to security, stringent verification and the elimination of the capability for launching surprise attacks and for initiating large-scale offensive action in the whole of Europe. We have noted with interest that certain ideas put forward recently by the Warsaw Pact countries reflecting in part, our concerns. We also favour an agreement on a new set of enhanced confidence- and security-building measures aimed at promoting mote openness and transparency in the military field. The Twelve accordingly consider that the negotiations on conventional stability and new confidence- and security-building measures should begin as soon as possible in a constructive spirit after the satisfactory conclusion of the current CSCE follow-up meeting at Vienna.\nProgress in the field of conventional arms control in Europe thus depends on the conclusion of the Vienna CSCE meeting, with a substantial result in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The CSCE process shows the way to overcome the barriers of distrust which divide the continent. Military security agreements alone cannot bear the full weight of East-West relations.\nThe Twelve note with satisfaction the progress being made in the resolution of the issues before the Vienna follow-up meeting. We hope that the present sixth round of negotiations will bring that meeting to a prompt and successful end. In this respect the Twelve recall their recent appeal to the other participating States of the CSCE to settle the remaining issues, particularly those relating to the human rights and human contacts provisions of the Helsinki Final Act. The Community's aim remains an agreement on a balanced and substantial concluding document, permitting progress in all baskets and in particular in the fields of human rights and fundamental freedoms, co-operation and security.\nAs far as human rights and fundamental freedoms are concerned, the Twelve insist on a better implementation of all commitments entered into by the States participating in the CSCE process.\nWe believe that progress in the human dimension of the CSCE will make a substantial contribution to the creation of a real climate of confidence in Europe and in particular will give East-West relations the stability and continuity which they must have. The Twelve are determined to continue to strive for a dynamic development of East-West relations.\nA successful and balanced outcome of the Vienna meeting would secure the opening of negotiations on conventional stability in Europe, aiming at the establishment of a stable and secure balance of conventional forces in Europe at a lower level, on a further set of confidence- and security-building measures, and the convening of a conference on the human dimension.\nTurning now to the question of Cyprus, a member of the European family, I cannot disregard the fact that the tragic division of the island remains unchanged. The Twelve attach great importance to a just and viable solution of this problem. To this effect we reaffirm our strong support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus, in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions. We stand fully by our previous statements and reject any action which purports to establish an independent State within Cyprus.\nWe also express our satisfaction with the successful efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to bring about a resumption of the intercommunal dialogue in the search for a settlement in Cyprus, based on the above principles, and we call upon the parties concerned to co-operate fully towards the achievement of that objective.\nThe improvement in the international climate should render the task of finding just solutions to the regional crises, which continue to affect our age, more promising. The Twelve firmly believe that an important element for the implementation of arrangements or agreements to settle these conflicts will be the present and future United Nations peace-keeping operations. Some of the peace settlements we fervently hope to see materialize in a not too distant future will require peace-keeping and observer forces. Member States of the European Community have contributed Blue Helmets in the past and some of us are doing so right now. In view of the considerable peace-keeping tasks which may lie ahead, the Twelve will continue to attach great importance to the matter and are giving active consideration to its various aspects. They also wish to assure the Secretary-General that he can count on their full support.\nWe emphasize our view that the costs related to peace-keeping operations based on decisions of the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, are to be regarded as mandatory expenses, unless it is decided otherwise by the Security Council, to be borne by all Members of the United Nations, having been carefully examined in the appropriate way. We should be prepared to pay the price of peace.\nThe Twelve call upon all States Members of this Organization, and especially the two super-Powers, to render their full support to these operations. It is only with this support that the encouraging developments we have recently witnessed will lead to positive results. The European Community and its member States have important ties with the countries and peoples of the Middle East, and they cannot be passive about or indifferent to the serious problems affecting a region which is so close to them. Today the conflicts in that region continue. The Arab-Israeli conflict remains an issue of deep concern to all of us. The status quo in the occupied territories is not sustainable. The situation in those territories remains tense. We have repeatedly deplored the Israeli repressive measures, which make a peaceful settlement harder to find. We urgently renew our call on Israel, pending its withdrawal, to fulfil scrupulously its obligations as an occupying Power in accordance with the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949.\nThe Twelve's views on the key elements which must make up a solution to that conflict are well known. In accordance with the Venice Declaration and other, subsequent declarations, two principles are fundamental: the right of all States in the area, including Israel, to exist within secure, recognized and guaranteed borders and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, with all that that implies. These principles continue to be the basis of the policy of the Twelve. For the implementation of this policy, we have on several occasions reaffirmed our support for the International Peace Conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, as the suitable framework for the indispensable negotiations between the parties directly concerned.\nAfter so much suffering, so much tragic loss of human life, the time has come to break the vicious circle of repression and hatred. There can be no real security, nor any real peace, for any of the peoples in the region without a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement. All parties concerned should recognize each other's rights. We therefore address from this rostrum an urgent appeal to all the parties concerned to make the necessary efforts to achieve that aim. At this particular moment it seems especially important for all parties concerned to show political responsibility in order to permit the peace process to move forward. For our part, we remain ready to play our role fully in that effort.\nIn Lebanon also, after 13 years of war and suffering, it is vital that a political solution be found. The proper functioning and strengthening of Lebanon's constitutional bodies is a pre-condition for such a solution. We regret that the mandate of President Geroayel expired without a new President being elected. We strongly appeal to all parties to favour the election, in all freedom and without external pressures, of a President capable of carrying out the task of national reconciliation and safeguarding unity, independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty in Lebanon. We emphasize our support for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and appeal to all parties to ensure that that Force is allowed to fulfil its mandate without hindrance.\nThe Twelve have been following with great satisfaction recent developments in the Iran-Iraq conflict. We have welcomed the announcement of a cease-fire and the decision of the Governments of Iraq and Iran to accept that cease-fire, to be followed by direct talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General, The Twelve remain determined to support the efforts of the Secretary-General, and they call upon both parties to co-operate intensively with him in order to achieve a comprehensive, just, honourable and durable settlement of the conflict, in full compliance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987), so that peace and security may be restored to the region.\nIn this connection, the Twelve pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts and dedication. The success of his endeavours enhances the prestige of the United Nations and paves the way for the Organization to play an increasing role in the maintenance of international peace and security.\nThe Twelve note with satisfaction the improvement in relations among the countries of the Maghreb. That development creates new prospects for co-operation between the two shores of the Mediterranean Sea and for regional stability. We also welcome the positive reactions by the parties concerned to the peace plan on Western Sahara which has been put forward by the Secretary-General and endorsed by the Security Council and which is aimed at the holding of a referendum on self-determination under the auspices of the United Nations. We believe that all parties will demonstrate their willingness to restore a just and lasting peace to the region.\nIn southern Africa there have been some encouraging signs of progress after years of South African aggression and destabilizing acts against neighbouring States,\nThe Twelve have, both individually and collectively, declared their support for the efforts currently under way aimed at securing peace for Angola and independence for Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), They have also welcomed, as recently as 26 August in their statement on the occasion of Namibia Day, the encouraging agreements reached in the quadripartite talks for the implementation of that resolution. The Twelve are looking forward to the rapid and successful conclusion of the ongoing negotiations, leading to Namibia's independence. They express the hope that the dialogue that has been initiated will ease the existing tensions and pave the way for peace, security, stability and social, and economic development, based on respect for human rights in the entire region. In this connection, they welcome the prospect of a bilateral agreement between Angola and Cuba which will include a timetable acceptable to all patties for the phased and total withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.\nThe Twelve reiterate their strong support for the efforts of the front-line States and other countries of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) to achieve security and economic stability. Furthermore, the Twelve reaffirm their willingness to contribute to the implementation of the Oslo Declaration and Plan on the Plight of Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons in Southern Africa. \nYet the abhorrent system of apartheid remains entrenched in South Africa. This year has again been marked by serious and disturbing developments, like the adoption in February of new restrictive measures against a number of organizations peacefully opposing apartheid and several of their leaders, the arrests of church and trade-union leaders, the detention without charge of men, women and even young children and the maltreatment and torture inflicted on a number of detainees, the uncertain fate of the Sharpeville Six, and the bill threatening to deprive peaceful anti-apartheid organizations of external funding. All those developments point to the fact that Pretoria is still unwilling to commit itself to real and significant change, and we fear that that will worsen even further the relations between the Twelve and South Africa. \nThe Twelve once more stress that apartheid must he totally abolished by peaceful means and the vicious circle of repression and violence that it provokes must be replaced by a constructive national dialogue. Only negotiations involving the genuine representatives of the black community and all other components of the South African population can bring about a future of peace and prosperity in a free, democratic and United South Africa with no racial discrimination.\nIn our view, there can be no dialogue as long as the state of emergency j still in force and the African National Congress, the Pan-Africanist Congress and other political parties are banned and while Nelson Mandela, now seriously ill, and other political prisoners are not released.\nIn pursuit of their stated objectives, the Twelve follow a policy of persuasion and pressure. Apart from declarations and pressing demands to the South African Government, the European Community and its member States have adopted a number of restrictive measures as well as positive programmes of assistance to the victims of apartheid.\nAs regards the Horn of Africa, the Twelve have noted with satisfaction that normal relations have been established between Ethiopia and Somalia, which represents a step towards achieving lasting peace in the region. However, the serious tensions in both Ethiopia and Somalia, which have caused loss of life and an exodus of civilian population as well as economic and material damage, continue to be a cause of great concern.. The conflict in northern Ethiopia still endangers the distribution of food to millions of people threatened by famine and starvation. The Twelve appeal to all concerned to make serious efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflicts in the region. The Twelve express their deep concern about the dramatic events in Burundi and the resulting flood of refugees at the Rwanda's border. They hope that the situation will soon be normalized and that a satisfactory and lasting solution will be worked out in order to prevent further outbursts of violence in Burundi.\nNearly 14 months ago the international community warmly welcomed the historic decision by the five Presidents in Central America to sign the Esquipulas II Agreement in order to bring about stable and lasting peace in their region, a process to which the European Community and its member States have given their unremitting support.\nWe have on several occasions appealed to all the parties directly or indirectly involved to give effect to the agreement in letter and spirit by fully implementing all the commitments they have assumed and to contribute towards the region's efforts for peace, democracy, economic development and social justice.\nToday we wish to express our concern that the momentum of the peace process should be maintained. Although progress has been achieved in some fields, the Twelve note that the principal conditions for a stable and lasting peace in Central America have not yet been met.\nOur view concerning the solution of the region's problems is based on the principle that responsibility for peace and democracy rests with each country individually and with all of them collectively. The arrangements provided for in the Esquipulas II Agreement represent an indivisible entity and should be implemented as a whole.\nI must stress once again that there will be no authentic democratic process without pluralism, involving respect for human rights and promotion of social justice. There will be no peace and democracy unless the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and the right of all nations to choose their economic, political and social models freely and without external interference of any kind are respected.\nWe urge the Central American countries to make every effort to give new impetus to the peace process. For their part, the European Community and its member States wish to reaffirm, once again, that they are committed to contributing, to the best of their ability, to the process set up in Esquipulas, including the creation and the functioning of the Central American Parliament, and to the economic and social development of the region. We call on other countries to do likewise.\nWe have followed with particular interest the efforts initiated last November in Acapulco by the Heads of State of eight Latin America, countries to establish a permanent mechanism for consultation and concerted political action. We welcome this initiative, which has opened up new paths for regional concentration and we intend to pursue our dialogue with these countries aimed at promoting peace, development, democracy and stability in Latin America.\nThe Twelve are encouraged by the progress made in the process of democratization throughout Latin America. We appeal to the Governments of those few countries that have not yet seen the re-establishment of full pluralistic democracy to engage in a process of genuine democratization that will enable their peoples to express themselves freely and to build a future worthy of them.\nThe Twelve welcomed the signing of the Geneva agreements on Afghanistan, which constitute an important step towards the settlement of the crisis. They now call on all parties involved to spare no effort in pursuing the peace process. An overall political settlement of the Afghan problem involves the withdrawal of all Soviet troops in accordance with the agreed timetable, the unimpeded return of refugees in safety and honour, the establishment of a fully representative government through a genuine act of self-determination, and the re-establishment of a genuinely independent and non-aligned Afghanistan. It is essential that the resistance be fully involved in this process. Also in this forum I wish to reiterate the readiness of the European Community and its member states to contribute, when the time comes, to the resettlement of refugees and displaced persons as well as to the reconstruction of the country in accordance with the priorities laid down by the United Nations Co-ordinator for Humanitarian and Economic Assistance to Afghanistan.\nConcerning the Question of East Timor, the Twelve reiterate their support for the contacts between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. They express the hope that it will soon be possible to achieve progress, thus paving the way to a just, comprehensive and internationally accepted settlement of the Question, with full respect for the \u00b7\ninterests of the people of East Timor.\nA return to peace and stability in South-East Asia is still contingent upon a solution being found to the problem of Cambodia. This conflict is the result of a foreign military occupation in violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations and international law and must be brought to an end. In this connection, the Jakarta informal meeting was an encouraging step towards a political solution of the conflict resulting in an independent, democratic, neutral and non-aligned Cambodia. We express our firm support for the constructive efforts made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations for the promotion of a political solution to the Cambodian problem that would ease tension in the region and enable the Cambodian people freely to decide their own future. \nWe stress the essential role that Prince Norodom Sihanouk can play in a new Cambodia that must be free from any prospect of return to the universally condemned policies and practices of the recent past. The Twelve renew their appeal to Viet Nam to withdraw all its troops from Cambodia. We call upon all concerned to pursue their efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive solution in accordance with repeated United Nations resolutions. There is no doubt that the full withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops and the re-establishment of a genuine peace in Cambodia would open the way to international co-operation for the reconstruction of the region.\nFurthermore, the dramatic increase in the number of boat people from Viet Nam is a source of serious concern for the Twelve. In co-operation with the countries in the region and with international organizations, we have been trying to alleviate the suffering of these people and to help them. We believe that Viet Nam must assume urgently its responsibilities according to international law and internationally accepted practice.\nThe Twelve express their deep concern at the renewed violence and loss of life in Burma. They are firmly convinced that the Burmese people's clear desire to enjoy the benefits of peace, prosperity, the full protection of human rights and a multi-party democracy should be met. As we recently declared, we are ready to assist, to the best of our ability, a fully representative democratic Government in Burma to secure the social and economic recovery of the country.\nAs to the division of the Korean Peninsula and the continuing tension there, we welcome efforts to resume the suspended direct dialogue between North and South as the only way to reach a solution by peaceful means. As in the past, we express again our hope that, on the basis of the principle of universality, the people of Korea may soon gain full membership of this Organization. It is encouraging to note the progress made towards democratic reforms in the Republic of Korea. \nTurning now to the Olympic Games in Seoul, we express our appreciation that they are taking place in an atmosphere consistent with the classical ideal that gave birth to them.\nThe Twelve have repeatedly and firmly condemned terrorism in all its forms. We reaffirm the principles adopted by the Council of Europe in 1986 - in particular, the principle that there should be no concessions under duress to terrorists or their sponsors. We have never left any doubt about collective determination to fight terrorism by all means.\nUnfortunately, terrorism has continued to take innocent lives and to bring bloodshed to our countries. We are determined to continue our efforts and to strengthen international co-operation to fight this scourge of our age, for terrorist attacks can never be justified and do not serve whatever political cause the perpetrators claim to be assisting. In this context, we support the initiatives undertaken in multilateral organizations, both to strengthen international protection of civil aviation and to enhance maritime security. We reiterate our appeal to all the countries which have not yet signed the international conventions on this matter to examine the possibility of acceding to these important instruments.\nThe Twelve, considering that drug abuse and trafficking have become a terrible scourge for the whole of mankind, make an appeal for wider and strengthened international co-operation in this field. In this spirit, they call for a successful outcome of the plenipotentiary conference in November-December in Vienna, with a view to the adoption of the United Nations convention, against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs. Moreover, specific initiatives are needed in the area of supply reduction, demand reduction and the rehabilitation of drug addicts. It is, therefore, extremely important that the role of the United Nations and its institution\u00b7 in this field, especially the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control, be strengthened and increased.\nRecent weeks have seen a succession of natural disasters that have taken a heavy toll and caused much suffering. The European Community and its member States wish to express their sympathy and support for the Governments and peoples of all the affected countries, and their willingness to continue to provide, to the best of their ability, humanitarian assistance as well as, where appropriate, longer-term support for economic recovery.\nAllow me now to turn to another very important issue. Two years ago all States Members of the United Nations undertook the difficult but essential task of improving the Organization and making it more efficient and effective in dealing with the complex problems of contemporary reality. At this point I would like to reiterate the full support of the Twelve for the Secretary-General, who has demonstrated his determination to follow up seriously the reform process initiated by General Assembly resolution 41/213.\nThe Twelve believe that the Secretary-General, in implementing the part of the reform that was entrusted to him, has performed his duties with flexibility and political judgement. The matter is now at the hands of Member States, which must show the same kind of political perspicacity and determination. In this respect we cannot fail to note with regret that the Special Commission undertaking the in-depth study of the United Nations intergovernmental structure and functions in the economic and social fields has not been able, so far, to achieve concrete results. Concerted action during the summer session of the Economic and Social Council led to a consensus resolution concerning the rationalization of the work of the Council. However, no considerable progress was made on other issues. Our commitment to reforms remains strong, and we consider the reform of the Economic and Social Council to be another significant part of this exercise. We expect that other Member States will not lack the political will to engage in fruitful consultations with a view to reaching a substantive reform that would undoubtedly enhance the ability of our Organization to deal effectively with the current economic and social problems.\nThe improvement in the political climate coincides with encouraging developments in the general economic situation. The European Community, through the achievement, by 1992, of an economic space without internal frontiers, is determined to make its full contribution to enhancing world-wide economic growth for the benefit of all. The upturn in economic activity in the industrialized countries in 1987 was greater than expected. Moreover, it is encouraging to note that the stock market crisis in October 1987 did not unduly upset the growing climate of confidence in the economies of the industrialized countries. For this year the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts a further increase in the growth rate to almost 4 per cent. Whether this growth performance is sustained will depend, inter alia, on how the international community deals with problems such as renewed inflationary pressures  rising interest rates and continued large external imbalances. Moreover, the level of unemployment in many industrialized countries is high and the state of the international financial markets remains unsettled \nTo turn to more specific matters, the economic situation of the European Community in 1988 has been characterized, so far, as in 1987, by a growth performance of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent. Average inflation is scarcely a quarter of what it was in 1980, despite certain deviations. However, vigilance is needed to prevent its re-acceleration. There has been an increase in productive investment in industry and services. Trade, both within the Community and with the rest of the world, forms the corner-stone of internal recovery. On the other hand, unemployment, which affects 11 per cent of the active population, is a grave economic and social problem for the Community of 12 and afflicts 16 million Europeans, particularly young people and women.\nThe developing countries, for their part, are expected to show an average growth rate of some 4 per cent, but that figure conceals considerable differences between the various regional groupings. While economic growth remains strong in certain Asian countries, many other developing States, for example in sub-Saharan Africa, continue to experience low economic growth and falling standards of living. Above all there is the problem of the external debt of many developing countries, a problem which concerns the whole international community. The burden of debt servicing is compromising prospects for growth and political stability, particularly in African and South American countries, and in the case of some countries it is a constant threat to the international financial system. Economic maladjustments, aggravated by adverse external developments, have affected the growth performance of these countries negatively and undermined confidence in their economic prospects.\nAs a result there continues to be cause for concern. It is essential, therefore, to strengthen international co-operation and increase individual and collective efforts in a number of areas. The European Community and its member States are fully aware of their weight in the world economy and their responsibilities with regard to future economic growth and development and the international trading system. They have taken, and will continue to take, specific actions to achieve balanced, non-inflationary growth and a strong, liberal, multilateral trading system. No effort is spared to assist developing countries in dealing with such obstacles to rapid, sustainable growth as debt problems, excessive economic dependence on raw materials, trade protectionism and structural bottlenecks, and in protecting their environment.\nThe European Community and its member States believe that the evolving debt management strategy, which is based on a co-operative approach by all the parties concerned, remains the only viable response to the developing countries' debt problems. They continue actively to support attempts in all competent forums to find suitable growth-oriented solutions to the debt problems. Major initiatives have been taken since the last session of the General Assembly to strengthen and update the implementation of the debt strategy. In particular, the financial resources of the IMF, notably through the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, the World Bank and the African Development Fund have been extended significantly. Following the conclusions of the recent Toronto economic summit, the poorest indebted developing countries should continue to benefit on a case-by-case basis from debt-service relief through the Paris Club.\nThe Twelve are participating actively in the co-financing of internationally approved programmes. Moreover, the Community has also taken action on its own part. In December 1987 the Council of Ministers adopted a Community programme to fund certain highly indebted low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Under that programme, 500 million ECUs were made available, of which 300 million ECUs were additional to existing commitments under the Lom\u00e9 Convention. This facility was -rapidly put into effect. It is intended that these resources be fully disbursed by 99\u03c5. This initiative is tied in with the relevant measures being taken by the World Bank to help the indebted countries in Africa, measures with which most of the member States are also closely associated.\nThe Community believes in the effective and efficient functioning of the economic and social sectors in the United Nations system. We stress our readiness explore with other parties any initiatives aimed at improving their operation.\nThe Community has always shown a special interest in the problems of h-Saharan Africa. I think that the mid-term review of the United Nations programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 at the present session will give us the chance to evaluate together the results achieved and the progress made in this sector. But more needs to be done. Additional financial resources are needed to give that continent a chance to develop - a view that is supported in the report on financing African development. It is a fact that the majority of developing countries derive a large proportion of their revenue from the export of raw materials and first-stage processed products. They have therefore been adversely affected by the generally low level of commodity prices during the last few years. However, there are new signs of an increase in the prices for some commodities. There is a clear need to seek ways and means of bringing about a diversification of commodity-based economies and an approach to trade in commodities that takes into account market conditions. In this context, the Community and its member States operate a system of stabilization of export earnings. \nThe Community and its member States are ready to play a constructive role in the proceedings of the Governing Council of the Common Fund for Commodities and expect other countries to do their part to enable the Fund, when it is brought into operation, to function with maximum efficiency consistent with the altered economic environment of the late 1980s.\nFor all countries as a whole, another important development, one that calls for even greater attention than it commands today, is the depletion of natural resources, along with the degradation of the environment, to the detriment of future generations. It is becoming increasingly clear that progress depends not only on growth rates but also on the duality of such growth. The concept of sustainable development must - as was done by the participants of the Toronto economic summit - become endorsed by all countries. The Community is prepared to contribute to international environmental co-operation as mentioned at Toronto. We urge that similar resolve be demonstrated in all regions and organizations. We wholly support the action set in motion within the United Nations to promote sustainable development.\nWith a view to the further improvement and expansion of international economic relations, the Community supports the development of a more open, viable and durable multilateral system of trade within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) through the negotiations under the Uruguay Round.\nIt is imperative that in order to preserve a favourable negotiating climate, participants in the Uruguay Round should implement the commitments to standstill and rollback undertaken at Punta del Este.\nWe are convinced that greater liberalization of international trade, which is envisaged in the new Round, will bring major benefits for all the countries taking an active part in the negotiations, and in particular the developing countries, which the Community is certainly not going to ask to take on obligations that are incompatible with their level of development. Indeed, the Community has accepted, in accordance with the commitments in the Punta del Este Declaration, that special attention should be given to the fullest liberalization of trade in tropical products which are of particular interest to developing countries, and has submitted concrete proposals in Geneva.\nIt is not, moreover, a matter of chance that despite its sensitive nature and the problems encountered in international trade, for which all countries bear some responsibility, the agricultural sector in general, which is of particular interest to the developing countries, has been included among the items under negotiation.\nHaving recognized this need, the Community has, for its part, since 1984, taken far-sighted measures with the aim of fundamentally restructuring its agriculture. In February 1988, we agreed upon a series of measures for a range of products which provide for automatic reductions of guaranteed support prices where production thresholds are exceeded, ensure that producers will bear a proportion of the costs of disposing of increased outputs, and facilitate the withdrawal of land from production. Clearly, these adaptations are helpful in the context of ongoing negotiations within the framework of the GATT Uruguay Round. As we indicated in our proposals, both short and long-term actions are needed to reduce support. All producing countries should contribute to this end with a view to the restoration of balance in the international markets.\nIn December, at the ministerial meeting in Montreal, there will be a review of the results of two years of negotiations in all sectors. The Community is looking forward to the meeting in the hope of a fresh political impetus that will help to further advance all aspects of the negotiations. On the basis of the progress that is seen to have been achieved, guidelines will be established for the next phase, so that the entire effort will be in line with the principle of globality, that is, balanced results for all participants at the end of the negotiations.\nThe Assembly will also be well aware of the close relations between the Community and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group (ACP) which, within the framework of the Third Lom\u00e9 Convention, are in many respects a model of relations between industrialized and developing countries.\nAlready, with a view to the renewal of this Convention, those concerned are giving intensive consideration to the problem involved in an effort to further improve and promote co-operation. In this context, it is in the first place important to safeguard what has already been achieved in the earlier Convention, and in particular the priority given to agricultural development and security of supplies. At the same time it is necessary to adapt, in agreement with our ACP partners, the next convention in order to be able to respond more effectively to the current situation in those countries. The Community is intent on widening the range of its support for ACP-partner countries pursuing structural adjustment and confronted with grave macro-economic difficulties.\nThe European Community has constantly supported the normalization, improvement and development of East-West relations at all levels and in all sectors.\nOn 25 June the European Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), signed a joint declaration establishing official relations between them. Such relations are being established between the European Community and most of the member States of COMECON. These are very important steps and will, it is hoped, lead to the further development of East-West relations in general and economic relations in particular. These relations with our European neighbours should pave the way for the rapid development of intra-European co-operation and its extension to all sectors of common interest which are of mutual advantage. \nIn this context, I should like to emphasize the importance of the European Community-Hungary Trade and Co-operation Agreement, which was signed yesterday. Agreements are also currently being negotiated with other COMECON member States and contacts are being maintained in order to define future relations with the remaining countries of the group. This is a clear indication of our desire to make substantive progress, where economic and political conditions allow, as opposed to the past when links between the Community and its Eastern European neighbours were either limited or non-existent.\nThe European Community has, moreover, wide-ranging bilateral agreements with individual Mediterranean countries. The purpose of these agreements is to guarantee continued favourable access of those countries' exports to the Community market, provide financial assistance to agricultural and industrial development, and promote large-scale co-operation.\nThe European Community has also developed, during the last few years, constructive relations with a number of Asian and Latin American countries. The wide-ranging co-operation agreement with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in particular registers very active progress.\nSince the Community is itself the reflection of a strategy of regional integration, it is only natural that it encourages and supports similar efforts of other countries in a way compatible with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). For that reason, it has also signed co-operation agreements with the Andean Pact and the Central American countries. Finally, the Community recently signed a co-operation Agreement with the Gulf Co-operation Council, which provides for the broadening and diversification of economic relations between the contracting parties and, in a second stage, should lead to the liberalization of bilateral trade.\nThe completion of the internal market of the Community by the end of 1992 means, on the one hand, that goods, services, capital and people will move freely within the European Community. This holds true for imported goods as well as for goods produced in the Community. Therefore, as far as goods are concerned, 1992 will mean better access for exports from third countries. All the European Community legislation regarding the removal of internal barriers will be consistent with GATT. The Community will seek to preserve the balance of advantages accorded, while respecting the unity and the identity of the internal market. As far as services are concerned, the Community will make sure that internal progress towards free circulation shall be translated into more free trade at the international level through progress in the Uruguay Round.\nOn the other hand, the completion of the Common Market, through the combination of economies of scale and increased competition, will improve the structural adjustment capacity of the community, increase its growth performance and thereby improve prospects for world economic growth and international trade. More specifically, we believe that through this challenge and the efforts made through the structural, regional and social funds there will be a further one-point increase in the rate of growth of the Twelve, which will in turn bring about a further increase of 1.2 per cent in third-country exports to the single market of 32u million consumers. In short, the creation of a single European market will help to achieve greater economic liberalization internationally. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first to express my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of this forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. Given the wealth of your experience and knowledge, I am confident that this will be a most successful session of the General Assembly. I assure you that the Japanese delegation stands ready to offer any assistance you may require in the performance of your important duties.\nAt the same time I should like to express my admiration for the achievements of the forty-second session of the General Assembly under the able leadership of its President, Mr. Peter Florin.\nThe United Nations has been particularly active and successful recently in efforts to resolve a number of international problems in various parts of the world. The world stands in appreciation of, and holds great expectations for, the United Nations as it strives to fulfil its most important task of maintaining international peace. Indeed, this demonstrates a restoration of its prestige which my Government finds most encouraging. The renewal of the authority of the United Nations was kindled by a general improvement in international relations, but at the same time it is thanks to the outstanding abilities and tireless efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and other United Nations personnel that the United Nations is being revitalized. I should like to take this opportunity to express my delegation's sincere gratitude and admiration to the Secretary-General and his staff.\nI should like to begin my remarks today by outlining the basic thinking of my Government on some of the important developments that are affecting global peace and human prosperity.\nThe first of these is the way East-West relations, and especially illations between the United States and the Soviet Union, have developed over the past year. The two States have concluded the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and their leaders have exchanged visits. It is hoped that this dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union will stabilize East-West relations and that that will accelerate a global trend towards the resolution of differences through negotiations. This is a significant development and deserves a high tribute.\nIt was against that background that the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan were reached last April, that a cease-fire was achieved in the Iran-Iraq conflict and that renewed efforts are under way for the resolution of problems relating to Angola and Namibia, the Western Sahara, Kampuchea and other areas around the globe. Signs of change are also becoming discernible in the quest for peace in the Middle East. While we realize that these developments are still in their early stages and that it will require considerable effort fully to resolve the various regional conflicts, we find it most encouraging that a start has in fact been made in that direction.\nIn this context we very much hope that the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, based upon its \\\"new thinking\\\", will be manifested in more concrete actions that will contribute to peace and stability in Asia and the Pacific, including the resolution of the Northern Territories problem and a scaling back of the Soviet military presence in the Far East. Welcoming the Soviet desire for improved relations with Japan, as expressed by General Secretary Gorbachev in his recent Krasnoyarsk speech, we hope that political dialogue between our two countries will be further promoted, starting with the regular foreign ministers' consultations to be held at the end of this year.\nThe second notable development is a growing recognition of the importance of economic development. Political stability is indispensable to economic development, just as raising the standard of living is vital to political stability and economic development is a prerequisite for raising the standard of living. In order to achieve all of those objectives, a climate of international peace conducive to economic development is essential. The present era - 43 years after the end of the Second World War - is characterized by a general recognition of that axiom.\nThere are still a number of destabilizing factors in the world economy, such as substantial imbalances in international payments, persistent pressures of protectionism and debt problems hampering developing countries. On the other hand it is encouraging, for instance, that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has initiated the Uruguay Round of trade talks, aimed at strengthening the multilateral free-trade system, that Japan and the other industrialized countries have clearly started to rectify their trade imbalances and create new jobs, and that the newly industrialized economies are achieving economic development at remarkable rates. These facts demonstrate that so long as favourable domestic political conditions prevail and appropriate economic policies are pursued in a peaceful international environment developing economies can become newly industrialized economies and the latter can become industrialized countries.\nThe third development concerns population and environmental problems, issues that pose a profound threat to lasting peace and prosperity for all mankind. In July of last year the world population reached five billion. It is reported that on 10 August of this year the population of Asia alone exceeded three billion. Of course, war inflicts tremendous suffering. The population problem spawns different kinds of suffering - those associated with, for example, food shortages, energy problems and environmental deterioration. Moreover, mankind is now faced with a number of grave threats, including the destruction of tropical forests. desertification, the depletion of the ozone layer and even climatic changes. We cannot remain silent in the face of these global threats. I believe it is most important that further efforts be made to resolve these problems, reconciling the need for economic development with the global imperative of environmental preservation.\nAs we approach the twenty-first century it is incumbent upon us to promote further the favourable trends I mentioned earlier and, taking a global perspective, to work together to resolve our many problems. In so doing it is most important that the nations of the world once again make human contacts the starting-point of their efforts and that they increase such meetings of hearts and minds across national boundaries. When people of different cultural heritages engage in a broad-based international exchange, not only do both sides develop greater understanding and tolerance for each other's culture but also peoples everywhere become better able to make assessments in the global context. It is in this way that the foundation for a truly open international community may be laid.\nFrom this vantage point Japan recognizes that it is increasingly important that it contribute actively to world peace and prosperity and has launched a new policy of active co-operation for the solution of major global issues. The Government of Prime Minister Takeshita has made the building of a \\\"Japan contributing to the world\\\" its top policy priority and has recently begun to implement it through the international co-operation initiative, which consists of three pillars: strengthening co-operation to achieve peace, expanding Japan's official development assistance and promoting international cultural exchange. Those policies, as members may recall, were elucidated by Prime Minister Takeshita in his address on 1 June to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\nI would like next to touch upon the role the United Nations should play and the way in which Japan, with this international perspective and on the basis of the new policies that I have just mentioned, will co-operate in that role. The most important problem before us is that of how to secure world peace. I would like to say a few words about my Government's views on regional problems and conflicts which have had a major impact on this question in recent years.\nLooking first at Afghanistan, we very much hope that the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan will be completed by 15 February 1989, in keeping with the Geneva Accords. I also believe that it is important that the Afghan refugees resulting from that conflict be able to return voluntarily to their native country as soon as possible. Thus, it is imperative that a broad-based Government representing the will of all the people be established in Afghanistan. The Afghan people recognize that they themselves must solve their country's problems, and my Government strongly appeals to them to join together in even greater unity and co-operation to rebuild their country.\nJapan heartily welcomes the cease-fire recently achieved in the Iran-Iraq conflict and strongly hopes that Security Council resolution 598 (1987) will be fully implemented as soon as possible, with the withdrawal of forces, the release of prisoners of war and the comprehensive, just and honourable settlement of all outstanding issues. Japan intends to continue to co-operate fully in the Secretary-General's efforts. At the same time, it will contribute as much as possible to the resolution of that conflict.\nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, Japan maintains the position that peace must be achieved on the basis of the following principles: Israel's withdrawal from all territories occupied since the 1967 war; recognition of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, including the right to establish an independent Palestinian State; and recognition of Israel's right to exist. There are new developments emerging in this area, and expectations are higher than ever before for the attainment of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace. Thus, steadfast efforts by all the parties concerned are now more than ever necessary, and Japan intends to do what it can to support those efforts towards peace. Foreign Minister Uno recently visited the four countries directly concerned - Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Israel - and explained these points to their leaders, as well as to prominent members of the Palestinian community in the occupied territories.\nThe racial discrimination in South Africa is intolerable and must be completely eliminated as soon as possible. But the Government of South Africa is not abolishing its policies of apartheid; on the contrary, it is resorting more and more to repression by force. In concert with the rest of the international community, Japan will continue to maintain its various restrictive measures against South Africa, as well as its active support for the black population there and for the countries in southern Africa.\nOn the issues of Angola and Namibia, Japan is encouraged that discussions among the countries concerned are now under way and hopes that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will be implemented and a new Namibian State established as soon as possible.\nAs for the question of Western Sahara, my Government sincerely hopes that progress will be made in the dialogue among the parties concerned, in accordance with the Secretary-General's proposal, and that a solution will be found before long.\nRegarding the situation in Central America, it is most regrettable that the negotiations on a genuine cease-fire in Nicaragua have encountered difficulties, but Japan continues to hope that true peace will be achieved through the steadfast efforts of all concerned.\nTurning now to the question of Kampuchea, Foreign Minister Uno attended the post-ministerial conference of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) with the dialogue partners this July, where he suggested that any real settlement must include a complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces, the establishment of a truly independent, neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea and international guarantees regarding the eventual political settlement. At the same time, he reaffirmed Japan's continued support for the efforts of Prince Sihanouk and the ASEAN countries to that end. We hope that the peace process will be further advanced through discussions among the parties concerned.\nThe Government of Japan believes that the problems on the Korean peninsula should be peacefully resolved, primarily through direct dialogue between the south and the north. Japan thus welcomes and supports the flexible and constructive posture demonstrated by the Republic of Korea in President Roh Tae Woo's special declaration on 7 July. Just prior to the start of the Seoul Olympics, Japan lifted the sanctions it had imposed against North Korea last January as an expression of its firm opposition to terrorist activity. This decision was made from a broad perspective with a view to contributing to a more relaxed climate. Japan hopes that the Seoul Olympics, now under way, will be concluded in an atmosphere appropriate to a festival of peace and that they will contribute to the relaxation of tensions in the area. My Government is pleased that arrangements have been made to enable the representatives of both the Republic of Korea and North Korea to address this session of the General Assembly. Moreover, if the south and the north would consider joining the United Nations as a transitional step towards the unification of the peninsula, Japan would welcome and support membership for both as a means of easing tensions and furthering the universality of the Organization.\nThe active and noteworthy efforts of the United Nations towards the resolution of those regional conflicts clearly demonstrate the important role that the Organization has to play in maintaining peace.\nLooking ahead, I believe it is important that the United Nations, while promoting further moves towards peace and stepping up its peace-keeping efforts, also take measures to prevent the occurrence of disputes. Thus, I very much hope that this session of the General Assembly will adopt the declaration on the prevention of conflicts proposed by Japan and five other countries with the aim of strengthening the ability of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Secretary-General to prevent conflicts before they occur, to remove threats and to settle conflicts at an early stage. It is important that all Member States co-operate so that the purposes of the declaration may be achieved in a dynamic and effective manner.\nAt the same time my Government would like to stress the need for the Security Council better to fulfil its functions as defined in the Charter. It is crucial that all members of the Security Council take a global perspective and, setting aside prejudices and preconceptions, co-operate as one in discharging the Council's duties and supporting the initiatives of the Secretary-General. Its permanent members, in the light of their special privileges, have an especially important responsibility in that regard. Only then will parties to a conflict heed the counsel of the United Nations; only then will the way be opened to a peaceful settlement. As a non-permanent member, Japan is working assiduously to find solutions to the various issues before the Security Council, and even after its term expires Japan will continue to work with equal diligence to enable the Security Council to realize fully its lofty purpose.\nJapan will extend its fullest support to the resolution of regional conflicts in various parts of the world and to United Nations efforts to that end. This is consistent with Japan's policy as a nation of peace to spare no effort in the cause of international peace and stability.\nSpecifically, Japan will first of all continue its efforts to provide, to the extent possible, financial support to peace-keeping operations undertaken within the international framework, above all in the framework of the United Nations.\nSecondly, Japan will strengthen its co-operation not only in terms of financial support but by supplying personnel in fields it deems appropriate. Recently, civilian personnel from Japan have been participating in the United Nations observer teams in Afghanistan and in Iran and Iraq. We are also studying the possibility of co-operating in such fields as election monitoring, transportation, telecommunications and medical care.\nThirdly, Japan plans to step up the various types of its assistance to persons who have become refugees as a result of conflicts. I am pleased on this occasion to pledge an initial contribution for assistance to Afghan refugees equivalent to $60 million to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme and other United Nations agencies. In making that contribution, Japan is also responding to the appeal issued in June by the Secretary-General. Recognizing that, as noted in the Secretary-General's appeal, Afghan refugee operations are extremely costly, Japan will consider a further contribution through, for instance, the United Nations Afghanistan Emergency Fund. In addition it is studying the possibility of providing personnel in medical and other fields to help Afghan refugees return home.\nFourthly, Japan intends to do everything it can to help the countries that have been involved in armed conflicts in various parts of the world to recover from the devastation of war, achieve economic recovery and reconstruction, restore stability and improve the living standards of their peoples once the conflicts are over.\nAnother task as we approach the twenty-first century, one that is inseparable from the quest for peace, is that of disarmament.\nIf arms control and disarmament are to contribute to true peace and stability worldwide, it is imperative that all countries work together so that their legitimate security requirements can be met at the lowest possible level of armament. Only when the bilateral arms control and disarmament efforts between the United States and the Soviet Union are synergistically combined with the multilateral efforts of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and other forums will global arms control and disarmament be possible.\nThere is no disputing the imperative of nuclear disarmament. A comprehensive nuclear-test ban should be seen as an important part of that imperative, and efforts should be made to find realistic ways to achieve it. At the recent special session devoted to disarmament. Prime Minister Takeshita announced plans to convene an international conference in Japan on the establishment of an international nuclear-test verification network, and discussions are now under way with a view to holding the conference as early as next spring. \nLooking ahead to the fourth review conference of the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to be held in 1990, I should like on this occasion to stress once again the need to expand and strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime, an urgent task facing us at this time.\nAs reported by the Secretary-General, most recently on 19 August, there have been instances where chemical weapons were used. These are weapons against humanity. They should never under any circumstances be used. In his address before this Assembly on Monday, President Reagan proposed that a conference of the parties to the Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of chemical weapons be convened in order to strengthen the Protocol's effectiveness. My Government welcomes this initiative. At the same time, Japan will work even more vigorously for the earliest possible conclusion of the negotiations now under way in the Conference on Disarmament on a treaty on a total ban on chemical weapons.\nOne of the greatest challenges facing mankind as we approach the twenty-first century is the achievement of economic growth in developing countries. If that goal is to be realized, it is essential that developing and industrialized countries alike co-operate in recognition that the world economy is in fact a single entity. In order to expand systematically its official development assistance, Japan intends within a five-year target period to raise its share of total official development assistance disbursements made by the countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to a level commensurate with the size of its economy in relation to the economies of other countries of the Committee. Japan is therefore working to raise the level of its official development assistance to more than 350 billion over the next five-year period beginning in 1988, which is double the official development assistance it disbursed during the previous half decade. It is further trying steadily to increase the ratio of its official development assistance to its gross national product, and further to expand its grant assistance to least developed countries.\nAt the same time, Japan continues to enhance its assistance to those developing countries which are burdened with heavy external indebtedness and other problems. This is demonstrated, for example, by the fact that more than 70 per cent of the projects under a targeted $20-billion resource-recycling plan announced in 1987 to promote the flow of resources to developing countries have already been implemented. On the issue of debt relief, Japan has decided to broaden the scope and application of traditional measures by extending to least developed countries grant assistance equivalent to the amount repaid on total loan aid of $5.5 billion which was committed to those countries between fiscal year 1978 and 1987.\nThe countries of sub-Saharan Africa have long been afflicted with economic stagnation, and their plight continues to deserve special consideration. Japan has vigorously supported these African nations through a series of measures such as: the extension of approximately $500 million in non-project, untied grant assistance for the three-year period starting from fiscal year 1987; the financial recycling plan and debt-relief measures just described; and co-operation through relevant international agencies.\nOn the other hand, the smooth transfer of capital and technology from industrialized countries is crucial to the development of developing countries. I believe it is important that developing countries make further efforts to create the conditions necessary to attract private-sector investment while trying to avoid the environmental and other problems that have accompanied economic growth in industrialized countries. \nDetermined as a matter of basic policy to contribute to a better world, Japan intends to continue to co-operate with efforts to resolve the problems facing developing countries. The United Nations has made steady progress over the years, for example in extending co-operation to developing countries and in such fields as human rights and humanitarian assistance. Regrettably, however, it must be admitted that the debates on many issues have not always been productive, and that inefficiencies have developed as a result of the excessive expansion and increased complexity of the Organization.  \nThere has also been a tendency to politicise unduly problems that should more rightly be considered as technical problems belonging to economic, social, cultural or other fields. As the United Nations regains its dynamism, I should like to make one comment that may accelerate this welcome momentum. In 1985, Japan proposed the establishment of a group of high-level intergovernmental experts to promote administrative and financial reform in an effort to strengthen the functioning of the United Nations. It did so not merely to restructure the Secretariat and reduce the number of United Nations posts, but also to conduct a review of the United Nations and its operations, so as to maximize the benefits accruing from its activities. The reforms recommended by the Group in its report, which gained wide support among Member States desiring revitalization of the United Nations are being implemented. Let us take these efforts even further in order to create a United Nations that functions more effectively.\nAt the same time, I should like to emphasize the need for further improvements in the organization and functioning of the United Nations in the economic and social fields so that it can truly respond to the needs of the international community. Japan will contribute to the best of its ability towards this end. There is one important point that needs to be made in this connection. The fact is that the United Nations faces a chronic financial crisis. In view of this serious situation in Match of this year Japan made a special contribution of $20 million to support United Nations activities, particularly peacemaking and peace-keeping operations in connection with the situation in Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq conflict. Today, when financial demands in the field of United Nations peace-keeping operations are sharply increasing, this financial deficit poses a major obstacle to the revitalisation of the United Nations.\nClearly, the cause of this deficit is the non-payment by Member states of .their obligatory contributions. Among 159 Member States, it is estimated that nearly 70 of them will be at least partially in arrears in the payment of their dues at the end of this year. This will amount to approximately $450 million. It is thus essential that we move urgently to redress this situation, taking into account the serious implications of the problem. In this connection, Japan welcomes the positive attitude which the United States and other countries have recently demonstrated regarding the payment of their outstanding dues, and strongly hopes that they will pay in full as soon as possible.\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, the world placed its hopes for peace and prosperity in the United Nations, which has subsequently achieved considerable success in many areas. However, it must be admitted that in some ways the Organization has been unable to live up to the high expectations held of it. Today, almost half a century since the United Nations was founded, its structure must be improved so that it will respond appropriately to the changing needs and realities of the international community. An organization without the capacity to evolve can only wither. With little more than 11 years left until the year 2000, Japan, with a vision of the United Nations as it should be, hopes to work together with other Member States, as well as with non-governmental organizations involved in United Nations affairs, to consider this issue seriously and take concrete actions towards realizing our goal.\nAs the only truly universal international organization, the United Nations will have an increasingly important role to play as it continues, now and in the future, to shoulder for mankind the burdens of maintaining world peace and prosperity and of fostering a rich cultural life. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the world has ever greater expectations of United Nations activities for the protection of human rights. It is thus essential that all Member States support the United Nations and do their best to enhance its activities. Japan is determined to continue to make every effort in accordance with its International Co-operation Initiative, which I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks today, vigorously to support the United Nations as a dedicated Member on which the Organization and the other Member States can truly depend.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe forty-third session of the General Assembly gives the Republic of Rwanda the happy opportunity to join with other nations as a faithful participant in this annual meeting of international diplomacy, to evaluate, in an open, constructive and sincere dialogue, the problems facing the world as they pertain to the mission assigned to this great family of the United Nations.\nThe annual session of the General Assembly follows the time-honoured tradition in the life of the world community established by the 51 founding Members of the United Nations when they paved the way for us to maintain international peace and security for the common development of all mankind through international co-operation.\nThe Republic of Rwanda finds in this Assembly the ideal institutional framework in which to proclaim regularly and solemnly its unshakeable faith in the noble objectives of the United Nations Charter - the reign of peace, concord, freedom and progress for all peoples the world over. From this lofty rostrum, Rwanda joins with the nations that have preceded it in paying a solemn tribute to the United Nations, whose commitment to the maintenance and development of peace has been successful despite the many obstacles it has encountered.\nThat commitment, whose ultimate objective is improvement of the lot of humankind on the basis of multiple interdependence, complementarity and peaceful coexistence among nations, has met with economic and political obstacles in international relations.\nIn economic terms, international relations have revealed a grim picture of the continuing crisis in raw materials, part of the recession in the world economy, whereby the third world and especially Africa face increasingly alarming situations that compromise the execution of development projects and thus harm peoples languishing in ever-growing poverty.\nLow commodity prices, reflecting the trade depreciation in raw materials, have harmed the economies of the developing countries, and are an aspect of this essentially structural crisis inasmuch as they result from the machinery currently governing international economic relations, which are characterized by, among other things, instability in financial markets and the over-indebtedness of the third world. \nThe gap which continues to widen between developing countries and developed countries justifies the calls for the establishment of a new, mote just, international economic order meeting the aspirations of the peoples of the third world who wish to take up the many challenges of underdevelopment.\nBecause of the crisis which continues to undermine the world economy, three quartets of mankind finds itself faced with three major obstacles preventing the acceleration of developments the external vulnerability of marginal economies, the continuing trend towards imbalance in foreign trade and the chronic shortfall in savings to meet increasing investment needs.\nAmong the challenges before the international community, the ravages caused by the seemingly organized anarchy in world markets, the fluctuations in raw material prices in favour of consumers and the consequent and continuing deterioration of the terms of trade, and protectionism by the industrialized countries in the face of disarray as a result of third world over-indebtedness - all tell the flaws in the current international economic system. \nThe heavy external-debt burden and the growing dependency of the third world on the industrialized world are of special significance in Africa, for they threaten peoples who are victims of the vicious circle of dire poverty because of a lack of structural reform in the world economy.\nRwanda deplores this international economic situation, marked as it is, by worsening stagnation year by year to the detriment of the peoples of the third world, which are victims of decreasing economic growth, deficits and food shortages, constituting a tragedy for the African continent, which is haunted by the spectre of constant hunger owing, in particular, to unpredictable climatic changes. In order to limit the scope and the seriousness of the problems arising from structural imbalances in international economic relations - a disorder which is compounded by the various natural disasters that add to the third world's misfortunes - the industrialized countries should adopt new strategies to hasten the dawning of a new international economic order by reducing the gap which is growing between them and the developing countries.\nThanks to the prestigious framework that is the United Nations and its specialized agencies, the world community has continued to record the grievances of the developing countries as they decry the injustice and other ills of the international economic system and plead for its restructuring so that international relations might be guided by the principles of equity, solidarity, complementarity and open and active co-operation for the harmonious progress of all mankind.\nIn this connection we must observe that the many appeals of the developing countries have not been sufficiently heeded by our partners in the industrialized countries, as is shown by the latter's lack of deep commitment to the goals fixed for recovery in the economic growth of the third world.\nHence, the goals set in the International Development Strategy for the three United Nations Development Decades, the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries, the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development, the Plan of Action for the Promotion and Implementation of Technical Co-operation between Developing Countries and the Fund for Land-locked Countries have not been reached. \nIt is to be hoped that the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 will not meet the same fate owing to lack of financial contributions commensurate with the commitments entered into by the developed countries and the international community during the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa.\nThe Rwanda's Republic firmly believes that global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development remain the appropriate framework for promoting a new international economic order.\nIn this context, one must look to the adoption of a new international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and on the holding in Paris in 1990 of the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and hope that there will be renewed impetus in international co-operation for development.\nA number of third world States have been disappointed by the latitude of the rich countries in regard to the imbalances in international economic relations, especially in production, investment and trade - a continuing situation which is undermining the efforts at s el f-development of the poor countries with limited resources.\nAmong these disadvantaged countries, those which, like Rwanda, ate on the list of less developed countries - deserve special attention and even more active support, in order to help them reduce their specific constraints and development problems. While praising the international community\u2019s gesture in recognizing the need for making special assistance efforts for their benefit, Rwanda's optimism is tempered in the face of the meagre results of the Substantial Programme of Action adopted during the Conference held in Paris in September 1981 under United Nations auspices.\nThe African continent is still where problems of underdevelopment arise in anguishing terms and where the economic prospects for most of the countries classified by the United Nations as least developed are still grim, especially for those which, like Rwanda, are faced with various structural handicaps exacerbated by a number of situational factors.\nHence it can easily be seen that, when speaking of economic and financial issues, the problem of external debt is of the greatest importance in Africa, where it is a serious threat to Africa's own efforts at self-development.\nWhereas creditors believe that the debt problem should be solved on a case-by-case basis on a bilateral framework, the African countries take the view that the solution should be found through shared responsibility within the framework of an international conference, as endorsed by the third special summit of the Organization of African Unity, held in Addis Ababa in November-December 1987, on Africa's external debt.\nThe Rwanda's Republic regrets that the idea of convening an international conference on Africa's external debt, as well as the idea of holding a world conference on monetary and financial problems, have not yet enjoyed consensus between the developed industrialized countries and the developing countries especially within the United Nations, where there is nevertheless wide consensus on the principle of promoting international economic co-operation on the external debt.\nOn the basis of the pragmatism that characterized the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Geneva in July 1987, we hope that the realism which also characterized that session will breathe new life into the North-South dialogue, from the standpoint of the commitments made to improve the situation of the poorest countries, whose external debt is, sadly, a bottle-neck in the development process. \nAmong the problems that continue to concern the international community is, most assuredly, the problem of protectionism in world trade, which is doing well in spite of the economic crisis, having increased by 4 per cent in volume in the past year. Nevertheless, we regret to note that the major multilateral negotiations that began more than a year ago in Geneva, at the initiative of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), have taken place in an atmosphere of confrontation. On the one hand the resurgence of economic nationalism in some of the rich countries has exacerbated the rivalries among the major industrialized countries, while on the other hand developing countries are still struggling for improved access to the market of the industrialized countries.\nThe third world expects from these new international trade negotiations, first, the elimination of all the protectionist measures that block their exports, especially of manufactured and semi-finished goods. The developing countries then hope to send their agricultural exports and their food products to the many markets that are still closed to them. The primary objective of these negotiations is to draw up rules for more equitable world trade for the year 2000, in response to the concerns of Africa and many industrialized countries, which fully appreciate the interdependence of the economies of the North and of the South.\nOutside the framework of the North-South dialogue, the Republic of Rwanda attaches great importance to the ideals of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), we are in favour of promoting and strengthening horizontal co-operation between developing countries as a formula that will help to solve problems of underdevelopment.\nThe South-South dialogue is clearly reflected in the Lagos Plan of Action and Final Act, adopted in April 1980 by the OAU, with a view to promoting the gradual socio-economic integration of the continent and ensuring its food self-sufficiency and collective self-reliance. In the same context, Rwanda continues to develop relations of friendship and co-operation with other countries in the third world, both bilaterally and multilaterally. Formulas for vertical and horizontal co-operation are all the more necessary because, over the years, the number of African countries faced with the tragic effects of the raw materials crisis, over-indebtedness and climatic disasters has been increasing. Far from giving in to pessimism, Rwanda remains convinced that the efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting effective solidarity in the international community with make it possible to limit the damage caused by the world economic crisis by offering the third-world countries the necessary means to emerge from the rut of underdevelopment.\nThe Republic of Rwanda firmly believes that world co-operation regarding agro-food strategy is necessary to foster appropriate programmes of action likely to enable countries faced with climatic changes and agricultural production deficits gradually to achieve food self-sufficiency.\nStrengthened by this conviction, which at the same time is an expression of hope, I express again from this rostrum, on behalf of the people and Government of Rwanda participating in the national revolutionary movement for development the most earnest and sincere thanks to all our partners, friendly countries and international bodies that have been supporting our country and continue to assist it in its tireless development efforts.\nThe international community, in addition to the socio-economic challenges that I have just described, is still faced at the political level with crises and areas of tension that encourage a climate of insecurity in the world. Following the violation of the principle of the equality of rights of peoples and of their right to self-determination, the world community is suffering from the escalation of violence in various regions of the world where the principle of respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of States has sometimes been infringed. The Government of Rwanda notes with bitterness that these tensions and conflicts, which threaten international peace and security stem from divergent interests or the determination of oppressed peoples to break the chains of colonialism, neo-colonialism and every other form of disregard of the right to freedom and independence.\nIn the light of the ills in some parts of the world where the cycle of violence seems to have established itself, Rwanda believes that the fate of these peoples cannot be a matter of indifference to countries that proclaim their dedication to the ideals of our Organization, whose sublime universal mission is to foster, through international peace, security and co-operation, the full development of the dignity of the human person.\nIt is in this context that the Government of Rwanda follows very closely the initiatives aimed at promoting a policy of detente in southern Africa, putting an end to the Iran-Iraq conflict, seeking an appropriate, just and equitable solution to the question of Western Sahara, and fostering the gradual, smooth withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea, not to mention other efforts to put an end to the violence that seriously compromises the development of certain suffering societies in the third world.\nAside from these prospects of peace, Rwanda also welcomes the initiatives relating to disarmament for the benefit of development, as evidenced, in particular, by the conclusion of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development and the results of the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament.\nReason would seem to be triumphing in southern Africa, where the intransigent arrogance of the proponents of the policy of apartheid continues to disgust those nations which, cherishing peace, justice and freedom, remain convinced that the Namibian people must press their right to self-determination until final victory and that the South African people must struggle to achieve true democracy - a starting point for the development of the front-line countries, which are victims of the destabilizing acts of aggression of the Pretoria regime.\nWithout either underestimating or overestimating the negotiations begun five months ago in London, which have since given rise to another series of talks, the Republic of Rwanda is following with some relief developments in these quadripartite meetings aimed at finding a way out of the conflicts in southern Africa. The history of international relations in our time will record that the countries taking part in these talks have for the first time achieved a new breakthrough towards a return to peace in this suffering region of the African continent.\nThe racist, minority South African regime, which has been flying in the face of international morality and ethics, should speed up its reconciliation with the international community by letting the Namibian people gain independence, by destroying its odious system of apartheid, and by allowing those front-line States that are prey to its policy of aggression and destabilization to live in peace. \nWe express the hope that the quadripartite meetings already referred to will not turn out to be just a sham dialogue likely to compromise implementation of the United Nations process set forth in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) for Namibia's accession to independence.\nIn expressing this hope we also express our fear that any backsliding might halt the dialogue that has just begun, making it possible for South Africa to use dilatory manoeuvres to perpetuate its minority regime, anachronistic racism and illegal occupation of Namibia, which is waging a liberation struggle under the banner of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) .\nComing to another African issue, the question of the Western Sahara cannot leave proponents of peace indifferent, with the Saharan people striving to win recognition of its right to self-determination, a universal right enshrined in international ethics.\nIn the context of the new Maghreb dynamic, the Republic of Rwanda puts its hope in direct dialogue between the protagonists in this conflict and in the organization of a referendum in accordance with the spirit of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).\nAs regards the eastern Horn of Africa, the delegation of the Republic of Rwanda salutes the initiatives of peace and detente that have recently heartened international public opinion, after the fraternal dialogue which fostered a resumption of diplomatic relations and an exchange of prisoners between Ethiopia and Somalia. That dialogue should give rise to a strategy that might unleash the dynamics of lasting peace and stability based on the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity, the inviolability of borders inherited from the colonial period, and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nWhile we deplore those drawbacks that have weighed heavily on the climate of security in the world and denounce the enemies of development in Africa, we must observe that that continent is not the only place where there has been conflict and tension.\nTo be sure, the efforts for peace and development have been held back by overt or covert conflicts that have broken out or continued in other parts of the world. So it is that in the Middle East the martyrdom of the Palestinian people, which is at the heart of the Israeli-Arab conflict, and the Iran-Iraq conflict have been sowing destruction and massive killings of frightening proportions, replacing the rule of law with the concept \\\"might makes right\\\".\nIn solidarity with the Palestinian people, Rwanda remains convinced that a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem requires recognition of and respect for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and free exercise of its rights under the aegis of its sole legitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), as well as the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied by force since 1967.\nWe deplore that on the eve of the twenty-first century the Iran-Iraq conflict has taken on the attributes of a war of extermination despite United Nations mediation efforts and efforts made by the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which have spared no effort to convince the two warring parties that they should take the path of open negotiation to put an end to the massive killings which recall the tragic statistics of the last world conflict. \nThe delegation of Rwanda expresses the hope that Iran and Iraq will now avail themselves of the opportunity offered by the winds of detente now blowing in international relations, and respond favourably to the constant appeals of the international community, urging them to return to concord and development in their region, so sorely tried by hatred, devastating strife and so many other horrors.\nIn South-East Asia, Rwanda observes with sorrow that a climate of peace and security is still being prevented by the trials of the Cambodian people following after the incursions of foreign forces into a political crisis that has become a bloody ideological struggle of which many have fallen victims and that has caused so many to become refugees.\nWe should here express our appreciation for and encourage the atmosphere of detente surrounding the various talks that have begun between the parties concerned since the end of 1987. May this glimmer of hope enable the Cambodian people to find a solution to the tragedy imposed upon it.\nOur Organization acknowledges that divided countries have the right to seek the ways and means to regain their unity through constructive dialogue free from outside interference and pressure. It is in this spirit that the Republic of Rwanda salutes and supports efforts to promote the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation.\nIn this context, still referring to the basic principles of the Charter of our Organization, Rwanda continues to hail and encourage initiatives to promote the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to meet the legitimate and profound desire of the German people to regain its national unity.\nFurthermore, the Republic of Rwanda encourages the continuation of direct negotiations, under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General, on the question of Cyprus, a solution to which should be found through implementation of principles enshrining respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.\nHumankind, which still remembers the massive killings of the last two world wars, the many victims of regional conflicts, the division of the world into spheres of influence, and the unbridled contest in the most destructive weaponry's throughout the twentieth century, seems to be asking our Organization to help make the twenty-first century one of disarmament and development, so as to exorcise the spectre of apocalypse.\nIn applying the principles that govern our great United Nations family, principles in keeping with the wishes and aspirations of the international community it is high time that the savings achieved through the disarmament programmes of industrialized countries were recycled for development projects in the third world, especially for the poorest nations which make up the group of least developed countries.\nThe delegation of Rwanda wishes to avail itself of the opportunity provided by the current World Cultural Development Decade to express its desire that a new pacifist ethic will guide international relations and that man's creative genius will not devour human, technical and scientific material and financial resources for the production of ever more sophisticated weaponry, in a vicious circle of competition but will, rather, he devoted to solving the tragic problems of underdevelopment. \nMost surely such a change in thinking would be reflected in some industrial change, in turn involving a cultural revolution of mankind, whose future would no longer be darkened by the excesses of the military-industrial complex, but rather reassured by the significant and positive factor of a recycling of capital from disarmament to the economic recovery of the third world, especially in the current situation of constant world economic crisis.\nAfter describing the concerns which the Republic of Rwanda shares with all countries devoted to peace, freedom, equality, justice and progress, concerns which pertain to the world economic crisis in general and to the economic crisis of the third world in particular, where many political tensions are developing, I should like, as other speakers before me at this rostrum have done, to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, on behalf of the delegation of Rwanda, its most earnest and sincere congratulations both to him personally and to the officers who have been elected along with him to guide the work of the current session of the General Assembly.\nMay I also pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, who presided with such competence and dignity over the work of the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\nIn conveying to Mr. Caputo our most earnest and warm congratulations, I should like also to emphasize our conviction that his sound and prestigious experience, together with his outstanding Qualities, will help to ensure the success of the work of the Assembly under his guidance.\nIn the same vein, the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, is also deserving of the warmest congratulations, which I should like to convey to him on behalf of the Rwandan Government, since we greatly appreciate the outstanding qualities he has constantly shown in carrying out his noble and difficult tasks so that our Organization may always work for peace, solidarity and complementarity among nations.\nThe Republic of Rwanda would like most particularly to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his patient and persevering efforts, which are increasingly hearing fruit in a climate of d\u00e9tente and constructive negotiations designed to put an end to conflicts in all parts of the globe.\nPermit me also to mention, as a guarantee of the success of the work of this session of the General Assembly, the determination of each and every Member State to work for the principles of peace, security, freedom, justice and progress, with a view to a new world order offering the third world, the opportunity of escape from the vicious circle of underdevelopment, while benefiting from a definite reduction in the hotbeds of tension to which it is often exposed.\nIn this spirit, the Republic of Rwanda would like here to reiterate most solemnly from this prestigious rostrum its commitment, deriving from its membership in our Organization, to the principles which are the best guide for a planet seeking peace, security, co-operation and prosperity for the well-being of all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI wish first to offer you, Sir, the most sincere congratulations of Belgium on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I view your election as an international tribute to you personally and, through you, to your country, Argentina, which has resolutely chosen democracy and is in the process of consolidating it. I have the utmost confidence in your ability and your experience, which will enable you, with the constructive collaboration of all delegations, to direct our work to a successful conclusion. My delegation will contribute fully to that end.\nI take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, Mr. Florin, for guiding with exemplary efficiency the work of the forty-second session of the General Assembly, which was particularly intensive.\nThis year more than ever I wish to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General, to his tireless dedication and to his personal commitment to the common ideal of the constant search for world peace based on human dignity. On numerous occasions, and most recently during our last meeting in Brussels, I have been able to see for myself how deserving of our respect and, above all, our total support in his action.\nI associate myself fully with the conclusions of his annual report, a document as complete as it is remarkable, in which he invites Governments to adapt themselves better to a changing international situation, thus allowing us to use our Organization with more determination and to better effect. I endorse this concept all the more heartily in that his ideas have served as the guiding principles for the views I have expressed from this rostrum in recent years. I am convinced that better defined international solidarity would make possible the broadening of the sphere of multilateral activities of the United Nations at a time when the universal and interdependent nature of many of the problems and challenges facing the international community is becoming increasingly evident.\nMy Greek colleague, Mr. Papoulias, speaking as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, yesterday presented the views of the 12 member States on the whole range of international Questions. His speech testified to the will of the European countries to speak with a single voice on the international scene. \nAs far as Belgium is concerned, it is convinced that increased recourse to the multilateral settlement of problems will contribute to strengthening the authority, prestige and irreplaceable role of the United Nations.\nAs a founding Member of the Organization and a signatory of the San Francisco Charter, my country cannot fail to welcome the recent tangible signs that the Organization is again prepared to live up to its vocation. Indeed, conflicts that threaten the security of entire continents are now on the way to being resolved by peaceful means, whether through direct intervention by the United Nations or through efforts being made under its auspices.\nThis renewed vitality can only be sustained with the active individual and collective co-operation of all Members and, primarily, that of the countries with the greatest influence in international affairs. It is not enough to proclaim loudly and clearly the value of the principles of the Charter. The important thing is that it be faithfully and fully implemented by all, without exception. As certain recent breakthroughs have shown, only the political will of Members - and, in particular, that of the super-Powers - will make it possible for the United Nations to act effectively where such action is needed. The converse is also true. Any strengthening of the United Nations is beneficial to each member of the international community. Such interaction is therefore beneficial to all, but it can be set in motion only through the demonstration of goodwill by all.\nStrengthening the Organization's capacity for action means enabling it to achieve such essential objectives as the consolidation of international peace and security, economic and social development and the promotion of human rights, and meeting the real challenges of time - helping to resolve the crisis created by the indebtedness of the developing countries, assisting the most disadvantaged peoples and fighting all forms of poverty, illiteracy, hunger, oppression and intolerance, as well as all violations of fundamental human rights.\nIn his 1983 report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General stated that the tendency towards the erosion of multilateralism and internationalism had to be halted and reversed, and he took that opportunity to examine various approaches that might make the Organization more effective as a political institution. He concluded that the first step towards strengthening the United Nations should consist in the sincere renewal of the commitments of all Governments to the principles of the Charter.\nThe fortieth anniversary of the United Nations provided an opportunity for all of us to renew our pledge of faith in the Organization. It also provided an occasion to engage in a sincere examination of conscience and to embark upon a process of United Nations reform to make it more effective and more responsive to the hopes all the peoples of the world have placed in it. Those efforts are now beginning to bear fruit.\nPositive developments have also been brought about through the willingness of the Security Council to act unanimously through consensus in a certain number of conflicts. The personal efforts of the Secretary-General thus took on broader scope. To that we should add the valuable contribution the peace-keeping operations have made and will make in the future. All of this increases the real impact of the United Nations, in particular on public opinion, whose support is indispensable, and especially on young people, in whom our hopes for a better future are placed. \nI would also note that at the very moment when the effective intervention of the United Nations is becoming so evident our Organization is, paradoxically, suffering from a financial crisis that could well prevent it from meeting its most essential responsibilities. I therefore welcome the intention of the United States to find a solution to its contribution problem, and I trust that all Member States will fully live up to their financial commitments. It is essential that the reforms adopted two years ago by the General Assembly he promptly implemented so that the Organization can act under the best possible conditions and be in a position to justify the trust vested in it.\nThe international atmosphere to which I have referred has been profoundly affected by the improvement in East-West relations. Belgium welcomes this trend, to which it has actively contributed. For their part, the European Twelve are playing a growing role in the positive evolution of East-West relations. In this connection I would mention the start that has been made on achieving closer relations between the European members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), on the one hand, and the European Community, on the other. Belgium hopes that that progress will continue, with beneficial consequences for the economic and social well-being of mankind.\nThe signing of the Soviet-American Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles has been hailed, and rightly so, as an event of prime importance. It is a disarmament agreement in the true sense of the term, one that eliminates - and this is the first time it has been done - an entire category of nuclear weapons, accompanied by on-site verification measures that provide adequate guarantees of compliance to both parties.\nWe do not want it to end there. In a context in which no aspect of East-West relations is being neglected and in which improvements are being sought in all spheres, disarmament efforts are being intensively pursued in various fields. \nBelgium keenly hopes that the agreement on the 50 per cent reduction in the nuclear arsenals of the Soviet Union and the United States will soon be implemented.\nBelgium values the continuation of bilateral negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on nuclear testing. The progressive and pragmatic approach that has been adopted, as propounded by Belgium, opens up real opportunities for achieving the desired results. We support actions that bring us closer to the objective of a comprehensive and verifiable ban on all nuclear testing, on the bilateral level and also on the international level at the Conference on Disarmament.\nFor several years chemical disarmament has been the object of intensive multilateral effort at the Conference on Disarmament. We remain confident of the possibility of reaching an agreement in the foreseeable future, notwithstanding the difficulties - which we do not underestimate - that lie ahead. Fortunately, the participants in those negotiations continue to manifest a desire to complete those negotiations successfully. To be successful, the agreement will have to have universal application. In this connection I should like to share my country's deep concern over the repeated violations of the 1925 Geneva Protocol that have occurred in recent years, and in the last few weeks. Those are dangerous precedents and we would very much hope that the indignation and keen emotion such odious acts have aroused will prevent their repetition. Belgium is also deeply concerned at the erosion of respect for a ban to which it attaches great value. We cannot forget that, historically, Belgium was the first victim of chemical weapons.\t.\nRefusal to consider that barbaric weapon a legitimate means for gaining military advantage is clearly the sine qua non of any success in attaining complete chemical disarmament, which is now being pursued at the Conference on Disarmament.\nLike many other States, Belgium unequivocally condemned the use of chemical weapons when such use was confirmed by the fact-finding missions of the Secretary-General. Prompted by humanitarian considerations, my country has expressed its concern about the most recent allegations of the use of such weapons. We regret that the experts designated by the United Nations Secretary-General were unable to investigate that matter thoroughly. \nIn that connection, I think it essential that the international community have a clear idea of potential risks inherent in recent events and that each State consider ways to prepare for them and to forestall dangerous developments before it is too late. To be sure, this involves respect for the law, but it also involves political will. We must redouble our efforts to achieve a consistent and effectively verifiable treaty totally banning chemical weapons and the production, stockpiling and use of those weapons, yet at the same time we must not relax our vigilance concerning respect for existing laws. I think President Reagan's initiative may be viewed in that perspective.\nBelgium hopes that negotiations on conventional forces in Europe will begin soon. Their goal must be to reach the greatest possible stability at the lowest possible level of forces.\nEspecially in Europe, the disarmament effort is part of a wider process covering all aspects of the diplomatic and human relations among the various parties on a continent that has experienced and continues to experience profound divisions which we are striving gradually to reduce. That approach began with the Helsinki Final Act and is continuing in the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe now under way at Vienna.\nBelgium expects that Conference to yield significant progress in human rights, where important commitments have been made in the past. We have seen encouraging signs of greater attention being given to these problems and of a greater willingness to make progress in this area. We hope that all participants will contribute more fully to this process. Belgium also expects that the Conference will set a timetable for the future in order to sustain the vitality of the process of improving East-West relations. \nIn that context of detente, the tragedy of Afghanistan, which has caused such human suffering and material damage, appears to be on the way to a solution, with the help of the United Nations. Having contributed to the negotiation of the Geneva Accords, the United Nations is participating in their implementation. For its part, Belgium will closely follow the development of the situation, in particular the continued withdrawal of occupation forces and the Afghan people's exercise of self-determination. On that basis it will determine its position in the General Assembly debate on this issue.\nThe persistent personal efforts of the Secretary-General have led to acceptance by Iran and by Iraq of full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which had been unanimously adopted by the Council with a view to ending a long and bloody war between those two countries. Belgium particularly welcomes the cease-fire that began on 20 August and the beginning of peace negotiations under United Nations auspices. I hope that an honourable, lasting settlement will soon restore peace in the Gulf region.\nOther regional conflicts continue to plague Asia and the Middle East. They are a source of constant concern, and we express our hope that a peaceful settlement can be reached as quickly as possible.\nIn Asia, this would involve true independence for a democratic, neutral and non-aligned Cambodia. Belgium is especially aware of this issue since it is Vice-Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea.\nStill with respect to Asia, Belgium reaffirms its support for simultaneous admission to the United Nations of the two Koreas and hopes that direct negotiations between the two parties will lead to their reunification. \nIn the Middle East, we hope that international d\u00e9tente will help end the Israeli-Arab conflict and settle the Palestinian question. I personally tried to reconcile the points of view of the various parties concerned when I served as President of the Council of the European Community during the first half of 1987. Since then, the uprising of the Palestinian population in the occupied territories has shown that the status quo is not viable and that only a negotiated solution to the conflict can bring about a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement. This situation is, sadly, a perfect illustration of what I said a moment ago: that only political will on the part of the parties directly concerned and on the part of the great Powers can enable the United Nations to play the role we all say it should play. Unfortunately, that is not yet the case in the Israeli-Arab conflict, although there are certain signs that the beginnings of wisdom could lead to the trail blazed in other regions.\nWith respect to the situation in Central America, it is important that the hopes raised by the Esquipulas II agreement will not fade, and that new impetus will be given to the peace process in the region. The area's problems show how democratization, peace and economic development go hand in hand and how they influence each other.\nCyprus and Western Sahara, where the Secretary-General's role has also been established, are two other issues of interest. With regard to Cyprus, we noted with satisfaction the Geneva meeting between representatives of the island's two communities, under United Nations auspices. In the case of Western Sahara, Belgium welcomes the parties' acceptance of the Secretary-General's proposals concerning a referendum.\nTurning to sub-Saharan Africa, I wish first of all to recall what my colleague from Greece said when he stressed the Twelve's rejection of apartheid and when he spoke of the pressure being brought to bear upon the South African Government. We are following with keen interest the efforts to bring peace to Angola and grant independence to Namibia. The fact that the parties concerned have agreed to hold talks is another positive element that should be emphasised and encouraged. For the first time in years there is finally hope for a peaceful settlement and wisdom is prevailing among those who only recently seemed adamant.\nIndeed, we are encouraged by the progress of negotiations among South Africa, Angola and Cuba, with the mediation of the United States and the accord of the Soviet Union. The various agreements the parties have reached thus far and the prospect of finalizing the agreement on the withdrawal of foreign troops enable us to hope that 1988 will be a decisive, if belated, turning-point in the process of Namibia's accession to independence. Clearly, Belgium, as a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, takes a prime interest in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), by which 10 years ago the Security Council adopted a plan for the independence of Namibia on the basis of -general elections under United Nations supervision.\nThis progress, however, does not make me forget that the resolution of Angola's internal problems too is vital to ensuring stability and peaceful coexistence in the region.\nAfrica holds a special place in the heart of Belgians. Our affinity results from history and from the relations of co-operation maintained in the past and in the present by many of my countrymen throughout that vast continent.\nBelgium believes that Africa cannot be an arena for rivalries and conflicting interests imported from outside. Its policy is to advocate and respect non-interference in the affairs of African States and to support the emergence of an African Africa, totally free and stable; an Africa able to find its own answers to its own problems and whose States will enjoy sufficient domestic and continental stability to be able to prevent, and peacefully settle, their conflicts and concentrate fully on reaching their economic and social development goals. I particularly hope that this will apply to Burundi, that friend of Belgium that recently has had to cope with such turmoil. The expectations resulting from the efforts of the Burundi Government should not be lost in vain antagonisms. Belgium, for its part, hopes to propose more thorough attempts at broad-based consultations among the principal countries co-operating with Burundi, in order to determine the conditions in which they can help it resolve the fundamental problems that give rise to such tensions and tragedies.\nToday, we are all aware of the critical problems facing Africa with cumulative and dramatic effect; demographic growth outpaces the growth of food production, and the decline in commodity prices damages export earnings and brings a heavy burden of debt. These fundamental problems bring others, often tragic from the human point of view; widespread malnutrition, high infant mortality, rural exodus, deforestation, desertification. We cannot remain indifferent to the distress of millions of Africans suffering their plight with dignity and courage.\nSpeaking at the special session of the General Assembly on the economic situation in Africa in May 1986, I pointed out that it was not just emergency measures that were needed, but that we had to tackle the very roots of this problem. We have now defined a set of priority measures to promote the rehabilitation and development of Africa.\nNow that the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly has completed its mid-term review and appraisal of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development, it is the proper time for decisive action.\nBelgium is prepared to make its contribution to the recovery of the African countries in a coherent way and in co-operation with the other bilateral and multilateral donors. As time is pressing, such action must be taken without delay. \nIn this regard, Belgium expresses satisfaction over the new momentum created by the decisions of the Toronto Summit for the search for a solution to the problem of the excessive external debt experienced by the least developed countries, among which there are so many sub-Saharan African nations. Together with the industrialized countries, in the competent forums the Belgian Government is examining technical measures in this regard, for it is our conviction that a stable and permanent framework for security and prosperity cannot be guaranteed as long as this problem lacks an adequate solution.\nAt the same time, however, Belgium maintains the strong conviction that the indebted countries need to pursue the closest possible co-operation with the international financial institutions, whose essential role in the process of the elaboration of economic adjustment strategies cannot be questioned.\nIn \u0430 few months we will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the solemn adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThat very influential instrument has more than symbolic value. Today it constitutes the basis of a complex and impressive set of rules designed to sustain the rights of the human person all over the world.\nThis celebration gives us the opportunity for reflection and evaluation. Six years ago, in this very Assembly, I appealed for the establishment of a system to ' monitor human rights based on both universal and regional mechanisms, associating the cultural diversities and differences between peoples.\nI would note that in 1982, on the eve of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration, on the initiative of my country, the General Assembly adopted a resolution urging Member States to engage in closer regional co-operation. Simultaneously, an exchange of information was set up between existing regional systems and our Organization in order to evaluate their mutual experience. \nI am pleased to note that since then regional mechanisms for the protection of human rights have been set up and are doing their job well, while others, with the same impetus, are fully expanding both with regard to the establishment of norms and the monitoring of compliance with those norms.\nIn view of those results, the Belgian delegation will continue to do its utmost to encourage this trend.\nIn one way or another, all the major problems of today derive from disregard for human dignity. That is why it is necessary to find ways to resolve them through a multilateral approach.\nIn conclusion, let me revert to my opening theme by calling for greater political will from each of us to enable the United Nations even better to fulfil the expectations we have always had of it.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI wish to congratulate you warmly, Sir, on behalf of the people and Government of Ghana and on my own behalf on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I have every confidence that the vastness of your experience and the accomplished diplomatic skills that you bring to that high office will contribute significantly to the General Assembly's work at this session.\nMay I also pay a well-deserved tribute to your immediate predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, for his superb handling of the last session.\nThe common experience of developing countries since the General Assembly met a year ago has undoubtedly been the difficulty in dealing with the range of very grave economic problems that continue to affect them. The economic crisis, which is about a decade old in the developing world, is still with us. The gap between the haves and the have-nots continues to widen. For the vast majority of mankind the vision of a world of greater social justice and a better standard of living remains illusory. In sub-Saharan Africa in particular, the economic crisis has assumed alarming proportions. Despite the adoption of structural reform policies by most African countries, the subcontinent continues to suffer from the combined effects of, among other things, the sharp fall in the prices of commodities, the dramatic fluctuations in currency exchange rates and crippling debt obligations.\nIn the last five years the critical economic situation in Africa has occupied a position of high priority on the international economic agenda, culminating in 1986 in the adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. That Programme outlined the policy measures which should be pursued at various levels in order to halt Africa's economic decline and put the continent back on the path of economic growth. Halfway through the term of the Programme, however, Africa's economic performance has shown no significant improvement.\nSince the adoption of the Programme the majority of African countries, in fulfilment of their commitments, have been engaged in resolutely implementing credible structural adjustment and economic reform programmes. Many more African countries may follow. But what incentives do those still weighing the question have in the face of the inadequate support that the pioneers have received? It should be possible to assure countries such as mine which are struggling with the task of implementing structural adjustment programmes that their efforts will not be in vain and that adequate and timely support will be forthcoming.\nThe mid-term review and appraisal exercise undertaken a few days ago by the Ad H\u043e\u0441 Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly has afforded us a welcome opportunity to examine critically the implementation of the mutual commitments assumed by the African countries and the international community. The shortcomings and constraints have been identified and the General Assembly should decide during this session on the measures, policies and initiatives for overcoming them.\nIt is therefore pertinent to emphasize three separate but interrelated questions, because, in my delegation's view, they are fundamental and must be addressed squarely. I am referring here to the low commodity prices, the serious debt-servicing problems and the inadequate flow of development finance.\nAfrica would very much wish to be in a position to provide the bulk of the resources needed to finance its development through the returns on its own efforts. I it how can it realize this aspiration when prices of primary commodities of interest to Africa remain depressed? In the various structural adjustment programmes, rehabilitation of agricultural infrastructure and incentives to farmers have absorbed a large part of the investment, and it is discouraging that, when these efforts succeed in raising output, the returns are not enough even to cover the cost of investment. At present, Africa loses billions of dollars every year on account of 1\u0448 commodity prices. Development and investment have suffered thereby and our debt-servicing capacity has been seriously undermined. In a marketplace where one group of operators is continually selling its wares cheaply and buying those of others dearly, protection needs to be given to the weak and vulnerable operators until such time as they are in a position to deal at arm\u2019s length with the strong ones. This has been done even in the so-called free market economies. The present situation of the African countries in the commodities trade call for this approach and we note that it is part of the purpose of the Common Fund for Commodities to give such protection to producers of commodities. Apart from the economic provisions foe stabilizing commodity prices, provision is also made to enable producing countries to diversify their production. The Common Fund Agreement has at last met all the requirements for entry into force and presents us with a unique opportunity to eschew lip-service and ideological rigidity in favour of pragmatic and sincere efforts to remove one of the severe constraints on Africa's economic development. We call earnestly on all those countries which have not yet ratified the Agreement to do so.\nThe second fundamental question is the external indebtedness of African countries and the serious debt-servicing problems faced by most of them. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) , in a recent survey, concludes that the external debt position of sub-Saharan Africa has worsened considerably. It is an indication that the strategy for solving the problem has not worked, because frequent rescheduling has only postponed current obligations and added to the debt obligations of some African countries. We are pleased that some of these debts have been converted into grants. We also greatly appreciate the initiatives pertaining to the debt of the poorer countries undertaken by the recent Toronto summit. But, as we have constantly argued, it is only through a strategy that leads to significant reductions in debt stock as well as rescheduling of any residual debt over longer periods that the severe hardship imposed by debt-servicing burdens will be brought to an end.\nA way will have to be found to deal with the debt owed to the international financial institutions, which, as a matter of policy, do not like to reschedule. As of now, five African countries have been declared ineligible for the use of IMF resources because of their arrears to the Fund. This is a serious development and if debt relief does not come in time many other African countries may find themselves in a similar situation. A number of proposals have been made in an attempt to find an acceptable solution to this problem. The Advisory Group on Financial Flows to Africa established by the Secretary-General has suggested refinancing of sub-Saharan countries' obligations. These proposals deserve serious attention in view of the prospect of mounting indebtedness disrupting relations between African countries and the Fund. \nThe third fundamental question relates to the inadequate flow of development finance to the African countries. Although the international community has made a commitment to relieve the resource constraints of African countries, resource flows to Africa have in recent years suffered a decrease. More importantly, official development assistance, which constitutes a significant component of financial flows to Africa, showed a decline in real terms in 1987 - a fact over which the Secretary-General was moved to express disappointment in his address to the Economic and Social Council during its second session in Geneva this year.\nIt is a matter of grave concern that at a time when many African countries are making determined efforts to implement structural adjustment programmes their efforts should be undercut by crippling financial constraints. The upshot has been the adoption of adjustment programmes in which demand management has been emphasized, even though it is generally accepted that adjustment with growth is the best route to economic recovery and development. Expenditure reduction measures, such as cost recovery and retrenchment of labour, have created serious strains in African societies, threatening the sustainability of the economic reform programmes.\nMy delegation recognizes, of course, that the international community, including the international financial institutions, has adopted some measures and taken certain initiatives in support of Africa's efforts. Those measures and initiatives have been belated and inadequate. Together they do not constitute a coherent and integrated programme that could seriously tackle the monumental development challenge facing Africa. As we take stock of our performance, let us boldly address the fundamental questions that have for so long bedevilled the economic development of Africa; and let us resolve to translate our commitments into concrete action. \nThe General Assembly is convened this year against a background of some financial uncertainty, even though there are some prospects for better times ahead. It would be unfortunate for the United Nations to be financially handicapped at a time when it finds itself actively engaged in urgent peace-keeping efforts in the Gulf and Afghanistan, with prospects for similar services in other areas of conflict. The administrative measures agreed upon in 1987 have either been implemented or are on course. We hope therefore that the withholding of funds by Member States will become a thing of the past. Financial obligations under the Charter are no different from other treaty obligations and they should be discharged without pre-conditions.\nAs far as the political scene is concerned, Ghana welcomes the current wave of peace sweeping the globe. Conflicts which but a few months ago seemed intractable are now being resolved at the negotiating table. The happy turn of events in the Iran-Iraq conflict comes as a relief to the entire world. The eight years of conflict, entailing unspeakable loss of human lives, cannot be justified. The cessation of hostilities is thus welcome. Ghana applauds the Secretary-General for the prompt steps he has taken to initiate the implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We urge Iran and Iraq to extend maximum co-operation to the Secretary-General at this critical period of returning the war-weary region to peace and normalcy. Both parties must however realize that lasting peace can be built only on foundations of equity and justice.\nGhana equally welcomes the prospects for peace in Angola and Namibia. The denial of peace to the people of Angola since that country achieved independence 13 years ago cannot be justified on any grounds. The Angolan experience is a classic example of the consequences of unwarranted external interference in the internal affairs of a State Member of the United Nations. Similarly, the unsettled question of Namibian independence has seriously threatened the credibility of our Organization. Now that South Africa appears to appreciate the futility of policies of colonization, destabilisation and aggression, Ghana would like to believe that there will be no turning back.\nBearing in mind South Africa's vacillations and prevarications in the past, we must naturally remain sceptical. We recall that the present moves are similar to those of four years ago, when the Lusaka agreement was to have led to a cease-fire, a South African disengagement and the establishment of a joint monitoring commission. By the end of that year, however, not only had the Lusaka agreement collapsed but also South African troops had mounted a large-scale invasion of Angola. We also recall the insincerity of the Botha regime in relation to the implementation of the Nkomati Accord.\nIt is important that the international community should not adopt a complacent attitude towards the southern African situation. The truth of the matter is that the apartheid regime has not only intensified repression of its people but also introduced Draconian laws to stifle the expression of dissent. The banning since last November of all political activities by organizations committed to non-violence and the arrest of peaceful marchers, including clergymen, show that the apartheid regime is not interested in any meaningful reform. South Africa shows every indication of maintaining the apartheid system, and that means the likelihood of more aggression against the front-line States. The international community must take such measures as are necessary to eradicate the apartheid system, to deny the South Africans the capability of aggression and to strengthen the front-line States to withstand South African aggression. \nIt is within the power of South Africa to live in peace with its neighbours and to become a respectable member of the international community by taking appropriate steps to eradicate totally its apartheid system. Among the steps that need to be taken, the Botha regime should release Nelson Mandela and all political prisoners forthwith and initiate talks with the black leadership with a view to sharing power democratically with all South Africans, irrespective of race, colour or creed, Ghana believes that until that is done a further tightening of sanctions is necessary to ensure the total isolation and collapse of the South African regime.\nAnother outstanding regional conflict in Africa which also cries out for a solution is the one over the Western Sahara. We urge all parties to co-operate with the Organization of African Unity and the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the settlement of the conflict and an unimpeded realization of the self-determination of the Sahraouian people.\nHopes for peace have also been raised in Afghanistan and Kampuchea, and we are grateful to all those who continue to seek peace in those countries. Ghana welcomes the Geneva accords and the commencement of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. We are especially appreciative of the bold decision of the Soviet Union to withdraw from that country. We urge all parties concerned to co-operate for the successful implementation of the measures being promoted within the context of the United Nations Good Offices Mission for Afghanistan and Pakistan to help the Afghan refugees to return and to participate in the reconstruction of their country.\nThe recent exploratory talks in Indonesia between the parties to the Kampuchean conflict also constitute a welcome development.\\\" We believe that by building upon that foundation the parties to the conflict could narrow their differences and perhaps reach agreement. The people of Kampuchea yearn for peace and their wish must be fulfilled with the active support of the international community, but in the final analysis peace is possible only if the parties to the conflict summon the political courage to resolve their differences.\nHopes of peace in the Middle East continue to fade with each passing day.\nThat is largely due to the imperviousness of the Israeli Government to the wind of change that is sweeping the world. The intractable problem of the occupied Palestinian lands has taken a turn for the worse. The uprising which started in December 1987 is still raging with the Palestinian death toll mounting every single day. The real tragedy is that Israel continues to regard the uprising as simply a matter of law and order and has therefore resorted to an \\\"iron-fist\\\" policy to deal with the situation instead of recognizing that the uprising is a legitimate outburst of accumulated Palestinian grievances. We urge the Israeli authorities to face issues and to place a higher premium on human life, good-neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence with their neighbours and the rest of the international community.\nIt is the view of Ghana that the General Assembly should renew its call for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East. All parties concerned should be allowed to participate in the conference without any pre-conditions. The situation in Central America also continues to be a matter of concern. The hopes that we cherished last year for the subregion have been dashed by the breakdown in the implementation of the Central American peace accord thanks to the intransigence of the contras. Every effort must be made to revive the peace process without undue external pressure or interference. External pressures motivated by ideological considerations in our view underline the peace process. The General Assembly should appeal once again to all parties concerned to strive to achieve a political settlement and to abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter.\nAnother area in which political tension threatens to be permanent is Korea. The continued division of that country and the disagreements between the north and south do not advance the interests of Koreans. Ghana is glad to note the resumption of contacts and talks between the two parts of the country and hopes that even though no concrete advantage has as yet accrued, the dialogue will be maintained and intensified with a view to attaining the reunification of the country. The Korean people should be left free to determine their future without external pressure or influence.\nThe ever-escalating arms race remains a major threat to the survival of mankind. There can be no moral justification for current levels of expenditure on arms while the vast majority of mankind lacks basic necessities. It was against this background that we had hoped that the fifteenth special session of the United Nations, the third special session devoted to disarmament, held last spring, would provide an opportunity to adopt a programme of action that could give further momentum to the disarmament process. Regrettably, that special session failed, in spite of the propitious international climate provided by the signing of the Treaty between the United States of America and the USSR on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (the INF Treaty).\nThe special session did however provide the opportunity for various new proposals to be advocated, particularly those presented by the 120 non-governmental organizations which participated in it. These proposals should be examined for possible adoption. The Ghana delegation would be willing to work with any delegation that might wish to study and formulate those proposals into resolutions for the consideration of the General Assembly.\nAlthough we continue to attach the greatest urgency to nuclear disarmament we also believe conventional disarmament deserves no less attention. The extravagant purchases of weapons in recent years clearly show that the international community should not relinquish its efforts to sensitise public opinion about the urgency of disarmament in all its aspects. But that must go hand in hand with a similar effort for social, economic and political justice for all nations. Let us hope that the co-operation that is developing between the super-Powers will aim at justice for all nations and peoples, particularly those nations and peoples that have been the victims of arbitrary power and insensitivity for centuries. The small nations will have no choice but to fight against any attempt to impose on them a vision of the world that ignores their essential pr\u0435-occupations.\nIn conclusion, my delegation renews its appeal to all Member States to put their minds and resources together in support of the principles and objectives of the Organization. The United Nations may not be perfect but it still is, and will continue for a long time to be, an indispensable instrument of peaceful coexistence.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, it is my great pleasure to extend to you the congratulations of my government on your election to your high office. It is a recognition not only of your personal qualities but of the important role you have played in the re-emergence of democratic traditions in your country, and of the esteem that Argentina enjoys in the world community today.\nWe must also record our thanks to Mr. Peter Florin for the impeccable manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.\nSamoa has constantly sounded notes of hope and optimism lit our statements since we joined the United Nations 12 years ago - notes of hope that were often drowned out by the more despondent tones of doubt and the dire predictions of the doomsayers. However, we were not disheartened, and our faith and belief in the United Nations as the great hope of, particularly, the small nations, has never dimmed. \nIt is, therefore with a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction that we feel able today to say with confidence that our optimism was not unjustified. After some years of international introspection and critical self-examination, we have arrived at a time when a certain amount of congratulation is in order, and when it can be said that the international community is becoming aware of the importance of the United Nations once again. There are, indeed, successes for all to see.\nThese successes, which we must acknowledge, mark in most cases the fruition of long and often frustrating efforts on the part of all concerned, and owe much to the dedication, patience and persistence of the Secretary-General and our international civil servants. Through the difficult times, morale has been maintained, the quest for international peace has continued, and progress has been achieved.\nIt is, then, most timely and fitting that the Nobel Peace Prise should have been awarded this year to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, which are indeed a symbol to the world of the United Nations and its aims. We congratulate the Secretary-General, his staff, the troop-contributing countries, and, of course, the troops themselves. Their heroic stoicism and quiet sacrifice have too long gone unsung.\nLet us then applaud the progress made in so many areas of the world where the problems had seemed insoluble. It is remarkable that across the world, from one far-flung trouble spot to another, settlements are slowly beginning to emerge, and world tensions are lessening. There is little doubt that major factors in this change are the lessening of tension between the great Powers and a new willingness on their part to work through the United Nations, thus enabling it more successfully to do the work envisaged by the framers of its Charter. We acknowledge and applaud this most encouraging development in international relations. We hope to see it grow and expand. If it does, then much credit will be due the leaders of those great nations for their enlightened statesmanship and the realisation that much of the world's well-being depends on them and the actions of their countries.\nWe turn, then, with hope in our hearts to a brief consideration of developments in the troubled regions of the world.\nThe Iran-Iraq cease-fire is an excellent example of the co-operation of the great Powers with one another and with the other members of the Security Council. Under the leadership of the Secretary-General, the Security Council has persisted with patience and diplomacy in pursuit of a settlement. How a cease-fire has been achieved, a result which seemed impossible a year ago. United Nations peace-keeping forces are in place and the expansion of the peace-keeping function to posts both there and in Afghanistan testifies to the important role those forces are able to perform world-wide if given the requisite goodwill. Now, for Iran and Iraq, the focus must b, on the full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), and on the healing of the wounds they have inflicted on one another.\nIn Afghanistan, the Geneva Accords were achieved, once again, as the result of steady and persistent effort under the auspices of the United Nations, with the Secretary-General and his personal envoy, Mr. Diego Cordoves, playing vital roles. The Soviet Union has withdrawn 50 per cent of its forces, as promised. While this is encouraging, it must complete its troop withdrawal as scheduled to enable the process of self-determination to take place within Afghanistan. While problems remain, the progress towards the restoration of peace to that shattered land continues. It must remain on track, for it is only when the fighting ceases, the refugees are enabled to return home and dialogue begins among the various groups in Afghanistan that the people of Afghanistan will be able finally to begin to put their lives together again and choose at last the form of government under which they wish to live.\nWe welcome the progress made in the negotiations on the problems in south-western Africa and are much encouraged by the improved prospects for the independence of Namibia. It is very good news that an advance team can now go to Namibia to prepare for the United Nations military and civilian presence in the Territory. At last, perhaps, the United Nations can play its appropriate role in Namibia, and the United Nations Transition Assistance Group can expedite the Territory's peaceful transition to independence.\nAlso showing promise, assisted by the good offices of both the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), is the situation in Western Sahara. There, as the Secretary-General says in his annual report on the work of the Organisation,\n\\\"an appropriate climate has been established for a just and durable solution of the problem.\\\" CA/43/1. p. 3>\nOnce again, we understand, the United Nations will be significantly involved both in a military and in a civilian capacity, and a referendum supervised by the United Nations will give the people of Western Sahara the opportunity to make a genuine choice about their future.\nWhen we consider the problems of Cyprus, we see that once again perseverance has paid off; the leaders of the two sides have agreed to meet for talks without any pre-conditions, and those meetings are under way. They will try to achieve a negotiated settlement of the problem by 1 June 1989. The Secretary-General's good offices have been instrumental in this process and have justified the faith the Security Council placed in him when it entrusted his mandate to him. \nIn our own region, development\u00b7 in Now Caledonia in recent months give us reason to be greatly encouraged about peace and good-neighbourliness in the South Pacific. Initiatives embarked on by France, resulting in the Matignon and Oudinot accords have brought about dramatic change in New Caledonia. Where there was serious likelihood of a real tragedy, there is now optimism and a genuine spirit of realistic accommodation and reconciliation. The South Pacific Forum applauds the efforts and commitment of the administering country, France, as well as the courage and leadership that have been in evidence within the major groups in Mew Caledonia itself in making possible the progress so far achieved.\nWestern Samoa strongly supports the process now in train to produce a genuine and meaningful act of self-determination for a reconciled New Caledonia in a manner that will accommodate the legitimate interests of all its people, including its indigenous population. \nThat is true of the Kampuchean situation, for instance, which is showing promising signs but where there are some difficulties yet to be resolved. The members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASSAM) have shown diplomacy and leadership in the region on this issue. They have recently successfully brought the parties concerned together at the Jakarta Informal Meeting, convened by Indonesia. We trust that this has prepared the way for the convening of an international conference, preferably under the auspices of the Secretary-General. The Vietnamese must be held to their commitment to withdraw all their forces by 1990 and the country must then be readied for an act of self-determination. For this, national reconciliation is necessary and it should take place under the leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, with the quadripartite arrangement, representing all the parties concerned, in place. There must also be effective arrangements to ensure that there is no return to the universally condemned policies and practices of a recent past. During these processes there should be a role for United Nations peace-keeping and supervision.\nThere are some encouraging initiatives on the Korean peninsula. President Roh has recently proposed a meeting of the Presidents of the North and the South and, indeed, a direct dialogue is essential to any peaceful path to a solution. Once again, we feel that the United Nations environment is often the best for reconciliation and, in the interests of the universality which we strongly support, we would hope that North and South Korea will be represented in our Organisation in the near future. \nThe Republic of Korea must be congratulated on the manner in which it served as host to the Olympic Games, so successfully concluded a fortnight ago - evidence indeed of South Korea's competence in the international arena.\nThere is a definite role for the United Nations to play in regard to the Middle East. Here the problems remain intractable, with tensions recently aggravated by the uprisings on the Nest Bank, fuelled by years of frustration, and the manner in which they have been handled. The violence of these developments has made it clear that vigorous efforts must be made to find a solution for this increasingly volatile situation. An international conference under the auspices of the United Nations, with all concerned parties participating, would seem to us the best approach. It is imperative that Israel recognise the right of the. Palestinians to self-determination and their right to establish a State of their own. Conversely, the Palestinians must recognise Israel's right to exist within internationally recognised and secure boundaries. Both sides must renounce violence and must resort, for a change, to dialogue.\nAnother area which shows little promise of peace at the moment is Lebanon.\nThat tragic country is still devastated and divided, and the situation gives little cause for optimism. Once again we call on others to cease taking advantage of Lebanon's crisis and refrain from interference in its affairs. Also, the troops of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in place there must be allowed to carry out their duties without harassment and the threat of death.\nIn Central America the progress towards peace seems, sadly, to have stalled. There were promising signs - with blueprints for peace painstakingly laid out in the regional peace plan, Esquipulas II, adopted by the five Presidents of the Central American countries. That plan is based on the Arias plan formulated by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica. For his efforts President Arias received the Nobel Peace Prise, and we had hoped that that would stimulate the peace process in  the region. We look to see a rekindling of enthusiasm and a revival of the dialogue so that eventually the aspirations of the peoples of Central America to live in democratic and peaceful conditions may be achieved.\nIn South Africa there can be no possibility of a solution until the South African Government is made to realise that it must abandon apartheid in any of its evil forms or manifestations. That Government must realise that there is no way that apartheid can be reformed: its total abolition is the only answer. The situation is constantly deteriorating, with increasingly repressive actions keeping the tensions at boiling point. The South African Government must release Nelson Mandela, now 70 years old and in poor health, and the other political prisoners; it must lift the bans front the prohibited organisations which oppose apartheid and thereby create conditions conducive to dialogue. Dialogue and the eschewing of violence and repression are the only case preliminary paths to the creation of an atmosphere where a solution can be sought.\nIn spite of international condemnation the South African regime remains determined to maintain, with whatever means at its disposal, its abhorrent total disregard for basic human rights. This intransigence, in Western Samoa's view, justifies the intensification and expansion of economic sanctions against South Africa.\nWhile South Africa certainly stands out as the most blatant instance of the denial of human rights we have to contend with, we should not allow it to divert our attention from other abuses of human rights around the globe. The Organisation must ensure that the suffering and inhumanity that go hand in hand with abuses of human rights are addressed, and eliminated wherever they occur.\nHuman rights is one of the areas where we hope to see the United Nations role grow and expand, for we feel there is much potential for a United Nations in which the world has more confidence to operate more actively in this field. On 10 December we shall celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Sights. But there is little to celebrate when we consider the actual practices around the world. While human rights instruments have been proliferating, so have inhuman practices. \nThis grim irony is further exemplified  by the recent re-emergence of chemicals as weapons for one people's use against another. This practice mocks the very dignity of mankind and must be banned for ever. We are pleased to note President Reagan's proposal made here for the convening of a conference of the parties to the 1925 Geneva Protocol and that this proposal was also supported by Mr. Shevardnadse. Of course it is imperative also that the drafting of a convention banning chemical weapons be continued and completed as soon as possible.\nOne of the brightest hopes we have this year is the likelihood of the dawning of a whole new era in disarmament. Despite the lack of concrete results from the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, we are much encouraged that the relaxing of tensions between the super-Powers has led to their agreement to dismantle an entire class of nuclear weapons under the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty. We trust that this breakthrough will herald a new attitude to disarmament. Much progress has already been made towards the conclusion of a START Treaty which would cut the super-Powers' strategic nuclear arsenals by 50 per cent. Both countries have accepted verification procedures that would have been anathema to them in the past. The two countries have gone so far as to exchange visits of military personnel at Chief-of-Staff level. This new-found flexibility and reasonableness must not only pave the way for future reductions of their own still awesome arsenals but will, it is hoped, encourage other nuclear-weapon States to begin the process of nuclear disarmament. Similarly it is hoped that those States that do not have nuclear weapons but might aspire to them will see the futility of acquiring such unusable and ultimately useless tools of war. We hope there will be a renewal of confidence in the Hon-Proliferation Treaty, a Treaty that deserves the support of all nations dedicated to a nuclear-weapon-free world. This is of crucial importance, especially to the small and vulnerable States of the world. \nThis year is the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Treaty; and it has served as an effective barrier to the acquisition of nuclear weapons by more States. In its 20 years of existence, no new nuclear-weapon State has emerged and more than 130 States have become parties to the Treaty and committed themselves not to acquire nuclear weapons. 2t must be strengthened and adhered to.\nThere is still an urgent need for the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty prohibiting all nuclear tests by all States in all environments for all time. As we learn daily how ignorant we have been about the destruction we have already wrought on this Earth, we are alarmed and realise with more certainty than ever before that all nuclear testing must cease. It must cease, not only because the further development of nuclear weapons is undesirable but also because of the damage to the Earth testing is causing, much of which may as yet have gone undetected by scientists. After all, scientists themselves have admitted how often they have been wrong in the past and how much there is still to learn about our environment.\nWe in the South Pacific have wondered and worried for years now about the effects of the French nuclear testing in our region. Once again we ask that it be stopped. We do not believe in the whole premise on which such testing is based; so why should we be subjected to its effects? We do not believe that nuclear weapons should exist and we believe that those in existence should be destroyed. We believe that the preservation of our God-given environment in as pristine a condition as possible is of paramount importance not only to our region but to the world as a whole.\nRecent events have made us realise that we are all ecologically connected; events occurring in one part of the world can have ecological consequences on the far side of the world. Plastic bags thrown into one ocean choke sea creatures in another ocean; fumes from industrial pollution in one country cause acid rain to kill forests in another country thousands of miles away; deforestation the world over can not only cause erosion and floods miles from where it occurs, but is occurring on such a large scale that it threatens to change the climate of the entire world for ever.\nIt is certainly Ironic that just as we saw developments that give us reason to believe that we may be able to avoid the nuclear holocaust we have all feared for years we begin to realise that we may have irrevocably sown the seeds of destruction for this Earth in many other ways and that it may be too late to reverse much of the damage already done.\nScientists tell us that the thinning of the ozone layer and resultant greenhouse effect are the cumulative results of our pollutants. What is truly terrifying is that some scientists think that the damage we see today is the consequence of what we did 30 years ago when pollutants were fewer and less potent, and that it is our children who will feel the much greater damage resulting from our activities today.\nHow tragic for our children, or their children, to inherit an Earth enshrouded in a deadly pall of pollutants; awash with waters full of poison; fouled with animals dead or dying; stripped of timber; with soils exhausted, devoid of nutrients desertified or dangerously laced with toxins; and with valleys, rivers and lakes piled full of garbage. For it may come to this if we do not soon realise that the catastrophes we are experiencing are sighs from an ailing and weary Mother Earth moaning that she is just \\\"not able to take it any more\\\".\nWe sympathise with those nations - Bangladesh Jamaica Mexico the Dominican Republic and the Sudan - which have suffered the most recent tragedies; but it is at our peril that we ignore these warnings and all the other signs we have received. The World Commission on Environment and Development chaired by Prime Minister Brundtland put it to us squarely and we must act. Both rich and poor nations, both North and South are guilty. Development in the future must be in harmony with the environment.\nNo are pleased to welcome Prime Minister Mulroney's announcement here that Canada will establish a centre to promote the concept of environmentally sustainable development internationally and also Canada's support of a feasibility study on a World Conservation Bank to work with the World Bank, for environmental concerns MUST be an integral part of any development efforts. We strongly support the calls for a high-level United Nations conference on environmental matters, and the sooner the better. \nWhile I said both North and South are guilty of environmental rape and pillage, the reasons are usually different in the two regions. In the developed countries misuse of the environment most often to provide comfort and convenience, and sometimes purely for sport or greed. Greed and expansion were certainly motives in recent attempts to export toxic wastes from North to South. While the countries of the South are certainly not free from base motivations, very often their populations are merely trying to survive.\nThus  we must urgently confront the inequities of the world's economic situation. The least developed feel these inequities most keenly, but all developing countries suffer from slow or negative growth, commodity price declines and adverse terms of trade, to name but a few problems. It is to be hoped that the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade and other international initiatives will address more effectively the economic plight of the poorer nations of the world.\nWe began this address with a reaffirmation of our confidence in and commitment to the United Nations and its work. For there is no doubt that loyalty to the United Nations on the part of all its Members is the key to the Organisation's ability to carry its urgent work forward. Further progress in the reform and revitalisation of the United Nations depends on Member support, both moral and financial. Now is the time to encourage the progress begun. We are pleased that both the United States and the USSR now intend to pay their past dues and meet their financial responsibilities to the United Nations. We urge all Members to meet their obligations as well.\nThe spirit of multilateralism certainly seems to have been reborn and must be nurtured, for it must finally be apparent to all nations that the time for rhetoric and propaganda is past and the time for co-operation is at hand. The Secretary-General in his report last year said that it was as if \\\"the sails of the small boat in which all the people of the earth are gathered had caught again on a light but favourable wind\\\" (A/42/1, p. 2) - indicating that there was hope, though it might be faint. This year he is able to report that \\\"With careful and patient navigation, the vessel has come within eight of large sections of the shore\\\". (A/43/1, p. 2) \nThat is \u03b1 much more hopeful future. Indeed, we agree, and while there are still sane reefs to negotiate, a safe arrival seems much more likely, for with the present international climate the sailing weather is good, or, as we say in Samoa: \\\"A favourable wind is felt on the body. Let the boat be guided by an experienced and competent helmsman.\\\"\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe Byelorussian delegation congratulates the Foreign Minister of Argentina Mr. Dante Caputo, on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and wishes him success in his work. We also wish to pay a tribute to the President of the last session, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, and the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the work done in the past 12 months.\nToday's international situation, the global processes under way in the world and their qualitatively new nature, prompt us to consider what the course of action should be today and in the years to come for this universal, world forum, whose primary objective is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. In view of the scope and character of contemporary international problems, it is necessary to consider to what extent the older, traditional methods are applicable in resolving those problems. Clearly, the strain of day-to-day affairs should not force the General Assembly to lose sight of this serious problem, the Assembly being, which in a sense, the collective mind of international politics. Movement without a clear-cut perspective is, at best, like the Brownian movement - chaotic, leading nowhere, and at worst leading directly to complications or even catastrophe, not only in military terms but also in the social, economic, ecological and other spheres.\nTo set the correct course, a navigator must know where his ship is and how and where to steer it. Looking back at the distance covered, and at the role the United Nations has played in the world, we realize the complexity of the Organization's development, which has gone through various stages; it has had its ups and downs and has overcome numerous crises. Yet we are confident that those were the difficulties of growth, rather than a decline, as claimed by those who do not believe in the potential and effectiveness of the United Nations. On the whole, those were the formative years of the United Nations, a period for promulgating its purposes and principles. Today, despite existing problems, the United Nations seems to be reaching the age of maturity, a process fuelled both by the internal logic of its development and, more important, by the urgent challenges of the day.\nThe world has become far too complex, multipolar and interdependent for nations to be in a position individually or in small groups to achieve the goals set by our time. Today, policies of restricted alliances can no longer ensure real security. What is needed is a global alliance and joint, concerted efforts. To achieve that, we require global multilateralism, which alone has the potential to measure up to the goal of a really secure world, a world secure for all, not just for some. The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization states that \\\"Multilateralism has proved itself far more capable of inspiring confidence and achieving results than any of its alternatives\\\". (A/43/1, p. 2)\nIn our view, multilateralism is more than a system of international organizations. It is an approach, a concept, a method. In the final analysis, it is a regime of international politics whose pillars are universal priorities and joint endeavours. The current paradigm of international relations inherited from the past and based on the primacy of the narrowly interpreted interests of a given State has come to the end of its usefulness, just as in the past the theory of the sun rotating around the Earth was shown to be inadequate by Newtonian physics. This is clearly demonstrated by numerous threats to the existence of mankind, ranging from the nuclear threat to the ecological menace and acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which mankind cannot overcome through isolated efforts.\nA new paradigm of international politics is needed; in fact, such a paradigm exists. It is \u0433 policy stemming from the priority of universal interests, the comprehensive nature of security, the primacy of international law and, consequently, an agreed multilateral approach. Taking a multilateral approach is not idealism. On the contrary, it is pragmatism, since it increases many times over the capacity of nations to cope with major international problems and, first and foremost, to ensure security.\nThis is amply proved by recent positive changes with respect to disarmament, the solution of a number of conflict situations and the establishment of co-operation between States. All these changes were made possible by the use of procedures and methods of multilateral diplomacy, including efforts made by and through the United Nations.\nHistory and experience unfortunately show that the parties to a conflict often arrive at a reasonable solution only when all other options have been exhausted and their forces depleted. But is it always necessary to let problems reach such extremes and drain the parties' forces before a mutually beneficial solution is reached? Multilateralism can help avoid that.\nIndividually, nations are prone to giving short-term responses to long-term problems. Here too multilateralism has advantages. It provides for a more reasonable, balanced and prudent strategy. International political must be given an important new dimensions insight into the future. While traditional foreign policies are more often geared to reacting to specific emerging situations, multilateralism has the advantage of permitting greater foresight and preparation, which can make it possible to prevent the unfavourable development of a given situation.\nFinally, multilateralism is far more in keeping with the principles of equality, and it restrains extremists from improper actions. It substitutes mutual influence and the primacy of common interests for unilateral domineering. In the final analysis, this is beneficial for all sides. That has been extensively demonstrated in the general debate that is to close today.\nAn individual human being is too weak and his voice, as the poet put it, is \\\"thinner than the buzzing of a mosquito\\\". Had he not learned to pool his efforts with those of others, he would have remained an unprotected, frightened creature in the immense wilderness of nature or might even have disappeared as a species unable to meet the challenges of the elements. But joint creative efforts have made him master of the planet. Today we have to learn anew to pool our efforts and overcome disunity, this time at the level of peoples and States. This might not be easy, but it is necessary.\nThe international community has experience here, and it is positive experience. In this context, I would refer to existing agreements and conventions on curbing the arms race, as well as international co-operation in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), relief aid in cases of natural disaster, certain development programmes and recent very important examples concerning procedures for a political settlement of situations around Afghanistan and Kampuchea, the Iran-Iraq war, and certain aspects of the situation in southern Africa, Cyprus and Western Sahara.\nIt has been correctly emphasized during the general debate that the policy of national reconciliation and the achievement of the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan have become a model for the political settlement of other crisis situations. Those agreements were reached through the mediation and with the assistance of the United Nations. It is our common duty to ensure that all contracting parties without exception comply with the balance of commitments contained in the Accords.\nThe peoples of the world have enormous potential good will for peace and co-operation. A major task of the United Nations is to encourage its realization in appropriate forms. It is obvious that in order to ensure the success of multilateral endeavours all nations should give up policies of force, diktat and interference in the internal affairs of other countries and peoples, and should abandon obsolete stereotypes of thinking based on suspicion, enmity and the pursuit of domination.\nThe sphere in which multilateralism is applicable is boundless. The multilateral approach is needed above all to respond to the most urgent global challenges in the military, political, economic, social, humanitarian and ecological areas.\nWhat is the effective way to resolve the problem of preventing war, ending the arms race and making a resolute move towards disarmament, first and foremost nuclear disarmament? The fact is that efforts to that end have been made regularly for several decades now. But over the same period the seriousness of the problem has tended to increase rather than decrease. Therefore, being realists, we have to adroit that the challenge cannot be met by traditional, established, conservative ways of thinking and by military and strategic approaches. Indeed, can the international community, facing the exotic and extremely destructive types of weapons of the late twentieth century, afford to follow the nineteenth century way of thinking? Does it have the right to do so? Can the community of States continue to live with the fact that the development of technology is outpacing the development of political and strategic thought? No, it cannot.\nWhat is needed is a new, realistic approach based on an understanding of the special realities of the human predicament resulting from the emergence and accumulation of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet-United States Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is the first and, for that reason, all the more significant sprout of that understanding. However, one sprout does not make a good harvest. In order to ensure security and make the process of disarmament irrevocable, it is necessary to move seriously and radically to further goals - namely, a 50 per cent reduction in the strategic offensive weapons of the Soviet Union and the United States, while strictly complying with the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Systems, as signed in 1972, and not withdrawing from it for a specified period of time; a comprehensive nuclear-weapon-test ban; the elimination of chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on a global scale the prevention of the development of new and ever-more-destructive weapons and, in the long run, complete and general nuclear disarmament} a radical reduction of conventional weapons} and the use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes. \nIt is clear that palliative measures will at best produce palliative security. That is not enough for the peoples of the world. However, the development of more far-reaching measures in this area is blocked by the continued commitment of some nuclear States to a speculative paradox which holds that life is guaranteed by nuclear-death stockpiles. Life on this blue planet of the solar system may well be the price we shall have to pay for taking so much time to test that paradox. Experimenting on mankind in that way is inadmissible - all the more because the experiment is being conducted against the will of mankind. As one apt expression has It, one day we will have total and complete nuclear disarmament - with or without people - resulting from the use of nuclear arms in a war. Let us work together to ensure that total and complete nuclear disarmament will be the result of the peaceful dismantling of nuclear arms for the sake of guaranteeing the security of mankind.\nThe Soviet Union has already stated its readiness to renounce the status of nuclear Power in the interest of the whole of mankind. The abandonment of old stereotypes could provide other nuclear Powers with an opportunity to take that worthy position.\nThe new thinking also suggests a fundamental way to ensure security in the field of conventional weapons and armed forces \u03b9 to eliminate imbalances and asymmetries and to achieve equal, radically reduced levels and a strictly defensive structure for the armed forces. The question of what a defensive structure and a purely defensive nature of military doctrines are can and should be addressed at a multilateral level - for instance, involving to that end the Security Council and its Military Staff Committee the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic actively supports that approach. There is also a vast potential in the idea of establishing a multilateral military-risk-reduction centre, as proposed by the Secretary-General, as well as in the Soviet Union's initiative for setting up a European centre for reducing the risk of war and preventing surprise attack. \nOne has mixed feelings about the evolution of events over the past 12 months in the area of approaches to disarmament. On the one hand, there have been uncontested achievements, including those in the multilateral area - the INF Treaty, the progress in the work to ban chemical weapons, the movement in the area of confidence-building, openness, verification, the relationship between disarmament and development - and, on the other hand, there is the failure to reach agreement on a final document of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament However, the spirit of that special session, the great wealth of new ideas, proposals and approaches that countries brought to the special session and have brought to the current session, their readiness to establish mutual understanding and to co-operate, are all encouraging signs. We are confident that quantity will inevitably result in new quality - the new quality of multilateralism, when the position of one State would no long block the realization of the will of all other countries.\nThe United Nations is capable of scoring serious successes also in the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. The United Nations Charter and resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly contain both the conceptual and the structural basis for a multilateral and constructive approach. That is another approach that offers vast possibilities. The recent achievements by the United Nations in this field are encouraging and should stimulate the international community to be creative and bold and to take active, concerted measures in the Middle East, Central America, southern Africa, the Korean peninsula and other conflict areas.\nAs is well known, the United Nations peace-keeping forces have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. However, are the potential and the capacity of the institution of military observers being used to a full extent? In our opinion United Nations observation posts could be set up in potentially explosive areas  military observers could be placed along borders where countries are trying to protect themselves from outside interference} special fact-finding missions could be sent out, on the decision of the Security Council, to investigate situations connected with mutual accusations, to study ways of settling such situations and to monitor the termination of any foreign military presence in foreign territories.\nJust as a really good doctor not only treats but also prevents disease, the United Nations operations could be used not only for settling conflicts but also for preventive purposes, in order to defuse emerging military confrontations. The future lies with preventive diplomacy. We should also discuss the question of United Nations naval operations, in the first place to ensure safe navigation in international waters, as well as the idea of setting up a United Nations military observer and armed forces reserve.\nComprehensive security requires a comprehensive approach. There is a growing awareness that if the peoples of some regions and even entire continents are left, deliberately or unwittingly, to be exploited and to lead a miserable existence, mankind runs the risk of setting off an explosion no less destructive than a military confrontation. Let us view the question of war and peace from another angle; In the wars of recent years, people have died and the resources of developing countries, so badly needed for their economic development and social progress, have been increasingly diverted. Therefore, to make the world a safer place, steps in the military and political spheres alone are not enough: what is also needed is a different - that is, a more just and mutually beneficial - economic order under which co-operation and assistance would serve mutual progress rather than the enslavement of some countries. It is necessary to help combat underdevelopment, manage the external-debt problem and promote the genuine stability of the world economy and co-operation. \nImplementing the basic principle or disarmament for development should become a major element of this approach. This can and should unite humanity and promote the emergence of universal consciousness. The United Nations must move to take action on these issues.\nThe concept of internationalism permeates the Charter. The significance of the values it sets forth - peace, security, justice, freedom, human rights, equality and co-operation - will grow as the world becomes more interdependent.\nEnsuring in practice the freedom of the peoples to choose their ways of development, putting an end to continued attempts to destabilize legitimate Governments and to impose a social and political system from outside means meaningfully consolidating the foundation of security in the world. Providing all with truly peaceful conditions of life and just conditions of economic development with jobs for the unemployed, bread for the hungry, shelter for the homeless, knowledge for the illiterate, rights for the deprived  satisfying the basic needs of hundreds of millions of people who still live below the level of human decency, pursuing everywhere the practical and full implementation of international human rights instruments, eliminating international terrorism and drug trafficking all mean enriching the content of security and creating realistic conditions for the world community to be able to focus fully on the lofty spiritual requirements of man and on reversing the dangerous and rapid depletion of the balance, purity and beauty of the environment.\nIncidentally, ecology is the most vivid example, on the one hand, of the unique role and possibilities of multilateralism and, on the other hand, of the impotence of purely egotistical and narrow national approaches. Let us learn in this area as well how to work jointly on problems that do not lend themselves to unilateral solutions. The symbiosis of States with different interests, of systems with different social and political structures and, finally, the symbiosis of man and nature presupposes, to be successful, compliance with certain principles and rules of behaviour. Acting on this premise we favour serious efforts to assure the real primacy of law in all areas of international relations under the motto, \\\"Security, confidence and co-operation through law\\\". Obviously such efforts must include both the necessary rule-making and the mechanism needed to ensure strict implementation of the rules adopted. It is important to seek a common understanding of them so that when agreeing on the rule we do not sow the seeds of future discord because of differences regarding its interpretation.\nUndoubtedly the development, testing and fine-tuning of a complex multilateral mechanism cannot be done overnight. It is a long-term objective, requiring effort, patience and understanding of the balance of interests. However, we must begin moving in the required direction now, focusing on those measures that are ripe and can produce realistic results.\nWe should try to consolidate in the United Nations a spirit of true multilateralism in the profound sense of the word. In particular it is appropriate to intensify the search for consensus decisions, and what counts here is not formal but effective consensus, what matters is consensus on the substance and not only in procedure. We need to think jointly about how to improve the procedures and the working methods of the General Assembly and its bodies, we need to consider the method of convening special sessions, rational and economic spending of available financial resources. The Security Council stands to gain greatly from the interaction of its permanent members and the elaboration of mutual commitments in the spirit of restraint and respect for the freedom of choice of the peoples, and the exclusion of great-Power involvement in regional conflicts. Its effectiveness would be enhanced by periodic meetings at the level of foreign ministers and by holding sessions in conflict areas away from Headquarters.\nIt would be very useful from every point of view if the permanent members of the Security Council and other States would accept the binding jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice on a mutually agreed basis.\nA greater role for the Secretary-General in the settlement of conflicts and their prevention would also be in the interest of all. The potential of that role has recently been convincingly demonstrated by Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar and his staff. The Secretary-General could take initiatives in the Security Council, suggest measures he considers appropriate and submit reports to the Council on questions deserving attention. Investing the Secretary-General with functions of monitoring compliance with United Nations decisions, in particular in the disarmament area, could become an important responsibility for the Secretary-General.\nThe Byelorussian SSR shares the position of the socialist community that has been expressed during the general debate on the range of issues under discussion in the General Assembly and today has especially addressed the problem of developing and strengthening a multilateral approach to solutions to international problems, the analysis of its advantages and some concrete proposals in this respect. In so doing, we are profoundly convinced that multilateralism, as a system for dealing with international issues, constitutes a basic instrument for constructing a truly comprehensive approach to the issues of international peace and security. What we need are joint efforts of all States in all areas. There can be no customers or contractors in such construction work; there can only be equal shareholders. The contribution of each is readiness for honest co-operation in the interest of the common cause. The dividend for each is solid security, freedom, equality and prosperity.\t\u00b7\nThroughout its history the Byelorussian SSR has pursued these noble goals. Seven decades of hard work and struggle - this landmark will be celebrated by the Republic and the Communist Party of Byelorussia on 1 January 1989 - and the fundamental restructuring of our society on a socialist basis have enabled the Byelorussian people not only to ensure continuous economic and social progress, but also to make an acknowledged contribution to efforts to reach those goals at the international level. At the present new stage of the development of international relations the Byelorussian SSR is ready for further fruitful co-operation in building a world free of war or weapons, a world of co-operation and prosperity. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt is a pleasure for me, at the beginning of my statement, to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. My country's delegation is confident that the deliberations of the Assembly at this session will be crowned with success and, owing to his consummate skills, know-how and sagacity, will achieve the desired results. I also take this opportunity to commend his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, who presided over the work of the previous session with distinction and skill. We have no doubt that Mr. Caputo will prove a worthy successor.\nA short time ago, the world lost one of its outstanding leaders. General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq, the late President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Although the loss of President Zia ul-Haq is a very great misfortune, we are confident that the new Pakistani leadership will play an important political role, in keeping with the high standing of the people of Pakistan at the regional and international levels.\nAt the present session, the Sultanate of Oman would like once again to reaffirm its faith and confidence in the noble principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and to assert its conviction that the organs and institutions of the Organization have a constructive role to play in devising solutions to the problems and crises afflicting mankind. That conviction stems from its belief that dialogue and understanding among nations achieved within the fold of the United Nations is the best way of overcoming such problems and crises.\nThe Nobel Peace Prize given to the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations this year is an expression of the world's recognition of the role of the United Nations in the context of peace and security. The award is a historic recognition of the role of the United Nations, and a sign of the international desire to emphasize the impetus towards world peace. We are truly overjoyed by this event, and congratulate everybody in the United Nations, but especially the officials who are working throughout the world to preserve peace and security.\nAmong the purposes of the Charter are the establishment and maintenance of a climate of confidence and mutual understanding within the international community, the creation of normal, just and equitable relations among Governments, nations and peoples on the basis of dialogue and non-recourse to war as a means of resolving conflicts, and compliance with the principles of mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of others. The United Nations has the capacity and the means to achieve the purposes and give effect to the principles set out in the Charter.\nAs members know, at the beginning of each of the last seven sessions of the General Assembly, in presenting ourselves here to participate in the work of the Assembly and to speak from this rostrum of the problems that beset international peace and security, we have begun our remarks by referring to the Iraq-Iran war as the regional problem that poses the greatest danger thereto. At the present session, from this rostrum, we extend our warmest congratulations to Iraq and Iran on the agreement they have reached for the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and to congratulate the international community on the success of its efforts to quell the flames of the longest and most dangerous regional conflict the world has witnessed since the Second World War. In this context, we can only express our overwhelming sense of relief and satisfaction at that outcome.\nWe see it as our duty, moreover, to extend particular congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, on the positive and constructive role he has played, his tireless patience and his endurance under the psychological and moral burden of this problem until he was able to bring it to the threshold of peace. A success rarely matched in the history of the United Nations will thus be put on record to the credit of the Secretary-General. The role of the United Nations has undergone a diminution that has aroused the concern of all nations and peoples for the future of peace and security. What has been achieved in the Perez de Cuellar era, however, has restored confidence in the United Nations and in its peace-keeping role in the maintenance of security and stability. It has also added a new dimension to the credibility of the United Nations as a guardian of peace that allows all nations great and small to come together under its auspices and engage in dialogue with a view to achieving through its good offices, stability, reassurance and peace, in accordance with the Charter.\nAccordingly, we call for greater self-sacrifice in maintaining the new momentum in United Nations endeavours, for action to reinforce those endeavours and for support for the role of the Secretary-General and co-operation with him in his efforts to solve other regional problems. He has our gratitude and our support for the efforts he is making to bring about a more tranquil and peaceful world.\nThe agreement reached on the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) in the Gulf region marks the beginning of a future brimming with hope, peace and prosperity. That would not have been possible without the courageous and judicious roles played by the leadership of both Iraq and Iran. The achievement brought about by resolution 598 (1987) will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the roost illuminating examples of the momentous acts that characterize great peoples and nations. We are hopeful that the agreement between Iraq and Iran will mark the conclusion of one era and the beginning of a long and all-embracing new era of peace and co-operation. \nThe key elements of Omani policy include the alleviation of tensions in the region, promotion of factors conducive to security and stability and encouragement of all parties to build mutual trust, with a view to ending disputes and achieving peace based on good-neighbourliness and mutual respect for the interests of the peoples of the region. The steps already taken by Iraq and Iran give us confidence that their readiness to take positive steps towards the implementation of resolution 598 (1987) will endure. We gratefully salute the two countries for the patience and diligence they have shown, and pin our hopes on the flexibility and co-operation that they are demonstrating in the ongoing talks, which will help in the achievement of peace and security in the near future. \nAmong the most important benefits of a lasting peace between those two countries are the reconstruction and development they will be able to achieve. The international community must therefore do everything in its power to support their efforts to rebuild and to restore an understanding that will have far-teaching effects in assuaging the bitterness left behind by the war between those two peoples. It must help them achieve the development and prosperity that will provide a firm foundation for a lasting peace.\nAs one of the two States bordering on the Strait of Hormuz, ray country has a special interest in the regulation of navigation in the Strait we continue as in the past to play our role in regulating shipping in that important international waterway in conformity with provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the rules laid down by the International Maritime Organization. The Sultanate of Oman reaffirms its determination to continue to perform that role in a way that will enable shipping in the Strait to catty on unhindered and in peace in accordance with the relevant international regulations.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and International Maritime Organization regulations accord equal rights to all coastal and land-locked States in the use of maritime straits, including the Strait of Hormuz, so long as that use is harmless and poses no threat to peace and security.\nFollowing the lessons relating to Gulf shipping that have been learnt from the Iraq-Iran war, and following the negative developments that accompanied that war, the United Nations should ensure that peace agreements in the Gulf include an appeal for respect for freedom of international navigation and for non-interference with shipping both in international and in regional waters, including in ports, harbours and maritime installations, in time of peace or in time of war, in accordance with international law and recognized norms and within a framework of collective action for international legitimacy. Such action would ensure that the treatment accorded to shipping in the Gulf during the war does not become an acceptable precedent in international law that could be applied in other regions.\nNo discussion of navigation in the Gulf would be complete without reference to the foreign presence in the area. With respect to the growing dispute concerning the foreign naval presence, we should like to stress the importance of international co-operation in a framework of peace with a view to \\\" king the Gulf region a zone free of international conflicts. We also stress how important it is that all States should refrain from using the Gulf in ways that would increase tension or be prejudicial to the interests of any State bordering on the Gulf.\nWe look forward to the day when we can speak here on the question of Palestine with a heart full of joy at the Palestinian people having achieved its aspirations: a day we hope is not far off. At this session, however, we are obliged to express our deep concern at Israel's continuing occupation of Arab and Palestinian territory and at its failure to respond positively to international peace offers that would enable the Palestinian people to exercise its rights and the Arab States to enjoy security and peace. Israel has rejected all international political initiatives aimed at achieving peaceful coexistence between it and its neighbours, and insists on perpetuating the state of belligerency in the region, just as it persists in its illegal occupation of Arab territories and its abasement of the Palestinian people by denying it the rights set out in the United Nations Charter and in hundreds of resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies, first and foremost the Security Council, which is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security.\nIt is time for Israel to wake up to the fact that, if it genuinely wants peace with its neighbours and coexistence with the Arab peoples, it must immediately abandon its present policy and cease its belligerent and oppressive methods. Peace depends primarily on coexistence with the Palestinian people? Israel must therefore become sensitive to the true nature of that people's peaceful uprising in the occupied Arab territories and respond to it by agreeing to the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East rather than by using force and oppression against the peaceable Palestinian people.\nNever in history has an occupying authority meted out such harassment as that faced by the Palestinian people in its peaceful legitimate struggle against Israeli occupation. Despite the international community's inability to play a role in keeping with the scale of the suffering of the Palestinian people and with the peaceful nature of its uprising, that people continues to hope fervently that it will be accorded justice and fairness by the international community, as represented by the United Nations, in the realization of its aspirations and of its legitimate right to the establishment of an independent State.\nThe measures announced on 31 July 1988 by His Majesty King Hussein bin-Talal of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan severing the legal and administrative ties between Jordan and the occupied West Bank will unquestionably advance the Arab approach to peace. Moreover, they will facilitate arrangements for convening the international peace conference on the Middle East, thereby highlighting Jordan's important positive role in achieving peace, a role indispensable to the Middle East peace process.\nThese positive developments have created historic new opportunities for achieving a just and permanent peace in the Middle East guaranteeing the rights of all parties concerned. If these opportunities are not seized now, similar ones may not arise in the future, and this issue could continue to threaten international peace and security. There are indications that solutions are at hand to certain regional issues that until recently clouded international peace and security; solutions that should provide the best of motives for placing the question of the Middle East atop the list of regional issues demanding speedy solution.\nThe Government of the Sultanate of Oman is satisfied at the developments regarding the issue of Afghanistan and particularly at the signing on 14 April 1988 of the Geneva Agreements. In that connection it endorses the agreement that was reached and commends the efforts made by the United Nations on that issue, undertaken by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and his representative, Mr. Diego Cordovez. We express our complete satisfaction with the steps taken with respect to the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, and with the latitude accorded the Afghan people to choose the system it desires without outside interference. The Sultanate of Oman further calls for the speedy solution of all issues relating to the implementation of the agreements, including the question of the composition of the future Government of Afghanistan. We urge the international community and all peace-loving States to make greater efforts to assist in the reconstruction of Afghanistan in order that it may overcome the devastating impact of the war that has afflicted it. \nThe Government of my country is hopeful that the international situation, which is brimming with optimism, will help in the solution of the worsening Kampuchean problem. In this connection, we should like to commend the sustained efforts being made by countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to solve the problem, and we also applaud in particular the efforts made by Indonesia on behalf of ASEAN. We regard the results achieved by the informal meeting of the Kampuchean parties held at Djakarta in July this year as particularly auspicious, and we hope that, God willing, the meeting will mark an opportune beginning for the resolution of the crisis. We wish success to all the efforts made to solve the Kampuchean problem, so that the Kampuchean people will be able to live in peace and choose for itself, of its own accord, whatever system it pleases.\nSince it became a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, my country, together with the other members of the Committee, has made modest efforts towards implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, adopted by the General Assembly in 1971 in its resolution 2832 (XXVI). Its implementation would preserve equilibrium in the region and insulate it from the effects of great-Power rivalry.\nDespite the fact that patience is all but exhausted by the deadlock that has stifled the work of the Committee in recent years, we are pleased to note that appreciable success was achieved in the Committee's preparatory work this year. We hope that this success, together with recent positive developments in the region, will provide a fitting impetus for the convening of the conference in question at Colombo in 1990, as a first step towards the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. \nWe feel a sense of gratification at the sustained endeavour by the States of Central America to implement the agreement on arrangements for the inauguration of a firmly established and permanent peace in the region, which was signed by the Heads of State of the region on 8 August 1987. This agreement promises a future of peace and prosperity, not only for the region of Central America but also for the entire Latin American and Caribbean region. We take this opportunity to express the support of the Sultanate of Oman for all efforts made to bring peace to Central America, particularly those: of the Contadora Group, which has continued to make exhaustive efforts to implement the letter and spirit of the August 1987 agreement.\nThe building of a world in which security, goodwill and harmony prevail requires that we eliminate those inhuman manifestations which the international community continues to endure, such as racial discrimination. The vile policy of racial discrimination pursued by the Government of South Africa against the black majority brings with it only increased destruction and bloodshed. While condemning that policy, we are hopeful that the international community will spare no effort to realize the aspirations of the oppressed peoples of South Africa for freedom and stability.\nIn that connection, the Sultanate of Oman welcomes the progress achieved thus far in the rounds of talks taking place, under the auspices of the United States of America, between Angola and Cuba on the one hand, and South Africa on the other. We hope that the results of these efforts will advance the interests of the peoples of South Africa and restore security and peace to that important region of the world.\nThe world is at present witnessing a unique gathering that exemplifies peace in its noblest sense the Olympic Games hosted by Seoul, the capital of South Korea. The Sultanate of Oman hopes that the spirit of peace represented by the Games will promote confidence and stability in the Korean peninsula. In this connection, my country would welcome any international move to admit either of the Korean States to membership of the United Nations, and we particularly welcome the sincere interest shown by the Republic of South Korea in addressing the General Assembly, especially since it announced, through the declaration made by its President on 7 July 1988, an end to the state of diplomatic enmity characterized by its rivalry and confrontation with the North. Such a move would strengthen the principle of universality which is the corner-stone of this Organization.\nIt is encouraging to see today that the process of dialogue and negotiation between the two great Powers has entered on a new course and has begun to develop. The positive results of that process have begun to show an appreciable impact in the easing of international tension, and they represent a sound basis for a more peaceful world and presage prospects for a dialogue of broad enough scope to include agreement on the solution of an increasing number of international issues. The entry into force of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles is an important historic event. The Treaty, as well as being the first of its kind, has highlighted an important fact: that regardless of how great the destructive military power of a State might be, it cannot be assured of peace and tranquillity, and that the only way to achieve security and stability is to engage in dialogue and to respect the interests of others on the basis of justice for all nations, great and small alike.\nThat Treaty, although important, affects only a small number of the nuclear weapons on the face of the planet. We have nevertheless taken one step towards the world envisaged by the Charter, despite the statistics available on military expenditures. It is enough to recall, by way of example, that the world spends $1.3 million each minute for military purposes while in some of the developing countries hundreds of children are dying of malnutrition and disease, to say nothing of the 570 million human beings who are suffering from hunger, the 1,500 million in need of health services, the 800 million who remain under the shadow of illiteracy, and the 300 million unemployed.\nThese and other relevant facts make it incumbent on us to take urgent steps to break the deadlock that beset the disarmament process at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. The disarmament issue is not the unique concern of one State or one group of States, but a universal issue that involves all peoples because none will survive a nuclear catastrophe. Since we believe that nuclear war will eradicate the human heritage and human progress on this planet, there is no alternative to collective action to prevent its occurrence. This will of course only come about if every State assumes its responsibility with zeal and sacrifice in preparing for a concerted effort of universal scope to formulate a full and comprehensive programme for disarmament.\nThe structural changes experienced by the world economy during the 1980s raise questions and cause concern in view of the sharp decline that has taken place. The changes that resulted from technological and scientific progress, as well as from the overall economic policies of the large industrialized countries, have had a negative impact on growth and development in the world in general and in the developing countries in particular. \nThe worsening situation of the world economy is due to the interaction of a number of factors, including the fall-off in the prices of those commodities on which the economies of the developing countries depend j instability in the exchange rates of the major currencies; the protectionist measures adopted by the industrially advanced countries; the debt burdens of the developing countries; the deterioration in the terms of trade to their detriment, and the reduction in financial flows to those countries. This has led to an aggravation of the economic problems from which the countries in question suffer, perhaps the best indication of which is the decline in their average per capita income. The uncontrolled persistence of such an abnormal situation will compound the suffering of even more of the inhabitants of third world countries. If such policies on the part of the wealthy countries are allowed to continue, it will mean that the developing countries will also continue to suffer from backwardness and poverty and that their economies will not have the opportunity to achieve increased rates of growth and recovery.\nAlthough the beginning of a new approach on the part of the industrialized countries towards alleviating the burden of third world indebtedness, extending repayment schedules and lowering interest rates was apparent at the recent Toronto summit meeting, that approach is not universal and we hope that it will not be an interim phenomenon. We call for more constructive co-operation from the industrially advanced countries in order to increase growth rates in the developing countries and alleviate their debt burdens, just as we call on those countries to show more flexibility and greater seriousness in negotiations on that matter.\nThe solution of many of the problems faced by the international community depends on improvement of the world economy as a whole and on ensuring equitable and fair growth for all countries. This naturally requires the countries concerned to be flexible enough to renew the North-South dialogue. We believe that the present session will provide an excellent opportunity to bolster the optimism that arose as a result of the resumption of the dialogue between producers and consumers. We have a duty to co-operate closely in order to create the conditions necessary to bring about a world economy that will be of benefit in a fair and balanced manner to industrialized and developing countries alike.\nThe United Nations has played a pioneer role in solving world problems and in promoting international peace and security. The Organization has demonstrated its ability and aptitude in devising solutions to many problems that had appeared to be insoluble, just as it has succeeded in breaking the deadlock in issues that had seemed to have reached an impasse.\nThe United Nations will remain the hope of mankind in its search for peace and security. In conformity with its policies directed towards the establishment of friendly and peaceful relations with surrounding countries and with the rest of the world, the Sultanate of Oman will continue to support all efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations as the major collective instrument capable of solving the intractable problems facing mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to associate ,myself with the greetings and congratulations extended to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to his high office. The Mongolian delegation wishes hi, great success in discharging his responsible duties.\nwe take this opportunity to express our gratitude to his predecessor, Comrade Peter Florin, for his skilful handling of the work of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly and that of its third special session devoted to disarmament.\nThe present session of the United Nations General Assembly is taking place at a propitious time in history , a time when the growing trend in world political is the recognition of the common destiny of peoples, the interdependence of countries and the need to resolve urgent current problems in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and on the basis of constructive co-operation and mutual respect for the legitimate interests of the parties concerned.\nThis is borne out by s generally positive development of from events in the world. The development in the political climate and the strengthening of mutual understanding and confidence between East and West are increasingly felt. As \u03b1 result, the threat of a nuclear wet is diminishing. The first steps towards genuine disarmament have been taken. There are promising signs of an end to regional conflicts on the basis of a national reconciliation policy and a realistic approach.\nThe role of the United Nations in resolving international problems is increasing considerably. The tangible results of the peace-making activities of the United Nations and the purposeful efforts of its Secretary-General are evident. The award of the Nobel Peace Prise to the United Nations peacekeeping forces is further evidence of the support which the world community is now listening to the Organisation.\nThe Soviet-American dialogue is assuming new aspects; it is becoming more dynamic and stable. The exceptional importance of this dialogue arises from the role played by the\u00b7 two Powers in world politics. It might be said that the Soviet-American interaction has generated many positive changes of global dimensions. In this context, the Moscow summit meeting deserves special commendation.\nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, as an independent and influential force in today's world, is playing a positive role in the solution of pressing international issues. This is evidenced by the outcome of the Havana and Nicosia meetings of foreign ministers of non-aligned countries.\nPublic demand is making an increasing contribution to the struggle for cassation of the arms race, the elimination of the threat of a nuclear war, and the strengthening of mutual understanding, trust and co-operation among peoples.\nWhile duly acknowledging the positive changes that are taking place in the world, we cannot overlook the fact that the situation still remains complex and in many respects contradictory. The\u00b7 changing plans for \u2018compensation\u2019 through the modernization of various types of weapons, both nuclear and conventional, are a sign of the reluctance to give up an obsolete concept of \\\"nuclear deterrence\\\". This means that the policy of acting \\\"from a position of strength\\\" still remains the main postulate of those who are preparing such plans.\nOne can hardly agree with those who claim that the policy of acting \\\"from a position of strength\\\" has brought about the present positive shifts in the world, when it is precisely that policy that at one time gave rise to an unbridled nuclear arms race, holding the world hostage to nuclear intimidation. It is not the policy of acting \\\"from a position of strength\\\" but the policy of reason, of realism and of a responsible attitude towards universal human values that is now needed to guide mankind onto the path towards a secure and non-violent future.\nThe inherent danger of continuing work \u0448 the \\\"Star Wars\u201d programme is that it could thwart the Soviet-American negotiations on deep cuts in strategic offensive armaments and of frustrating the efforts to prevent the militarisation of space. The development of weapons in space would not only signify a qualitatively new stage in the arms race, but would in itself pose a grave threat and contradict the logic of disarmament that has already been set in motion by the realisation of the INF Treaty. Space weapons would hang like the sword of Damocles over every country, regardless of its location, since such weapons would be an omnipresent threat. Outer space should serve peaceful purposes only. Specific guarantees are needed to ensure that life on Earth is not threatened from space. In our view, the realization of the proposal to set up an international organisation on the peaceful uses of outer space would greatly help to promote the attainment of this objective. \nUniversal security should be fully guaranteed on Earth as well. As we see it, the notion of security is made up of a number of interrelated factors - above all, military, political, economic humanitarian and ecological. In other words, the problem calls for a comprehensive approach to collective security, as envisaged by the Charter of file United Nations. This is the main thrust of the proposal by the socialist countries regarding the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security.\nDisarmament is one of the main roads to a secure world. The most difficult but the most essential step on that road was made by the conclusion of the Soviet-American INF Treaty and the commencement of its implementation. This should be followed by other more significant steps in reducing strategic arms, steps that should not be episodic but that would result in an irreversible and continuous process. In tills regard we look forward to the early attainment of an agreement on the 50 per cent reduction on strategic offensive armaments.\nIt is pertinent in this regard to emphasise the Importance of preventing a situation in which disarmament in one field would lead to an arms race in another. This question is important from both the political and the military technological point of view.\nThe most Important task has been and continues to be a complete ban on nuclear tests, the further strengthening of the non-proliferation regime of nuclear weapons and the establishment of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace in various parts of the world,\nThe need for a ban on chemical weapons is of particular urgency at the present time. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic actively supports the early completion of the work on the elaboration of an international convention on the complete prohibition and elimination of these weapons of mass destruction. We shall continue to support measures such as the strict observance of the  Geneva\u00b7 Protocol of 1925.\nOne of top priority tasks in the field of disarmament is the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces. In this respect the ongoing active search for ways of reducing the military confrontation in Europe is \u0430 matter of satisfaction. The constructive proposal of the States Members of the Warsaw Treaty Organisation to this effect serve, in our view, as a sound basis for the achievement of mutually acceptable agreements.\nThe government of the Mongolian Peopled Republic shares the view that the sale and supply of conventional weapons mist be placed under international control.\nAlthough the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament was unable to adopt a final document, it has nevertheless provided an impetus to the practical consideration of ways and means of attaining the goals of disarmament.\nThe political settlement of conflicts in the world constitutes one of the crucial prerequisites for the building of a solid foundation for universal peace and security.\nTangible progress has been made in resolving some of the conflicts. However, a long and difficult road still lies ahead.\nThe conclusion of the Geneva Agreements on the settlement of the problems relating to Afghanistan has become an extremely important issue. The implementation of these Agreements demonstrates how important it is for all the parties strictly to observe their obligations. My delegation supports the proposals to consider the implementation of the Geneva Agreements and the questions concerning the cessation of their violation. As in the past, the Mongolian People\u2019s Republic is in favour of turning South-East Asia into a zone of peace, stability and co-operation. We welcome the intensification of dialogue between the countries of Indo-China and the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASSAM) with a view to finding a political solution to the Kampuchean problem. We welcome the outcome of the informal meeting held in Jakarta between the representatives of four Kampuchean parties and the countries of South-East Asia. In our view, the proposals put forward at the meeting by the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic would serve as a good basis for the settlement of the problem of Kampuchea and for stabilization of the situation in the region.\nAnother positive event is the cessation of the Iran-Iraq war. My Government sincerely welcomes the beginning of talks between the two parties and expresses the hope that they will lead to a final settlement of this conflict.\nA hotbed of tension persists on the Korean peninsula. The Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports the withdrawal of foreign troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea and the conversion of the peninsula into a zone of peace. We support the proposals by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with a view to laying the foundation for the peaceful reunification of Korea. The obstacles that prevent Korea from occupying its rightful place in the United Nations as a full-fledged Member should be eliminated. As in the past, the Mongolian People's Republic supports the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and its non-aligned status. We welcome the present dialogue between the representatives of the two communities of Cyprus under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nThe situation in the Middle East has recently further deteriorated. Such a development emphatically underlines once more the urgent need for a comprehensive solution to the crisis. The road to such a solution lies through the convening of an international conference with the participation of the parties concerned7 including the Palestine Liberation Organization and the permanent members of the Security Council. The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination should be ensured. Israel must relinquish the occupied Arab territories.\nThe unresolved situation in Central America is a cause of grave concern. The open interference of the United States of America in the Internal affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua constitutes the main obstacle to the realisation of the Guatemala agreements and of the national reconciliation policy of the Sandinista Government, we express full support for, and solidarity with, the struggle of the Nicaraguan people for the realization of their inalienable right to follow the path they have decided. No one has a right to encroach upon the freedom of choice of any people.\t\nThe current efforts with regard to the granting of independence to Namibia kindle hopes for a speedy solution to this problem. My Government welcomes the quadripartite negotiations of Angola, Cuba, the United States of America and South Africa designed to remove the seat of tension in the south of Africa. \nWe resolutely condemn the apartheid policy of the South African racist regime and advocate the imposition on it of comprehensive and Mandatory sanctions, as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe general tendency towards improvement of the political climate did not fail to include the Asian commitment. At the same time, most of the above-mentioned regional conflicts exist there. Apart from that, the Asia-Pacific region is becoming the arena for the increasing military build-up of the United States of America and its allies. These and other factors testify to the complexity of the situation in the region.\nIt is therefore in the interests of the peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region actively to seek ways and means of combining the efforts of all the States situated here. As our leader, Comrade J. Batmunkh, has pointed out the Mongolian People\u2019s Republic consistently advocates the strengthening of confidence and the development of co-operation between the Asian States and endeavours, within its means, to contribute to the achievement of the overall Asian security objectives. This desire has led to the proposal made by Mongolia for the establishment of a mechanism ruling out the use of force in the relations between the States of the Asia-Pacific region. The implementation of this proposal would foster the consolidation of the universal principle of peaceful co-existence in the relations between the States of the region.\nThe recant proposals made by Comrade M.S. Gorbachev in Krasnoyarsk reflect the spirit of the new political thinking. They have further developed the Vladivostok initiatives and are specifically desisted to reduce the military confrontation in the Asia-Pacific region, to broaden good-neighbourly relations among the countries and to consolidate peace and stability in this part of the world. We welcome the further intensification and improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China as a factor the importance of which cannot be overestimated in strengthening confidence and co-operation, peace, and security in Asia and throughout the world.\nThe Mongolian People's Republic stands for the restructuring of international economic relations on a democratic and equitable basis and for the establishment of a new international economic security.\nThe seriousness of problems such as the underdevelopment and external indebtedness of the developing countries and the upsetting of the ecological balance as well as other issues calls for urgent actions designed to solve these problems. In this context the implementation of effective measures in the field of disarmament and the transfer for development purposes of the resources thereby released would be of great significance. The specific ways and means of resolving the problems afflicting world economic relations should be reflected in the United Nations international development strategy for the 19908.\nThe Mongolian People's Republic submits that international problems, including humanitarian Issues, should be resolved In a spirit of cooperation on the basis of full respect for the principles of the national sovereignty of States and non-interference in their Internal affairs.\nThough 40 years have elapsed mince the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we are still witnessing mass violations of these rights. The right of whole nations to self determination has not yet been realized. The conflict situations and the arms race impede the implementation of the right of peoples to peace and development. In this connection, the United Nations Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace remains topical. Consideration, at this session, of the implementation of the declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace will once again draw the attention of whole world community to this important question.\t\nPermit me, in conclusion, to express the hope that at the present session the General Assembly will make a specific contribution to the consolidation of positive changes and to the search for ways and means to eliminate negative phenomena from today's international life. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn addressing this international gathering, I hove the honour to convey to the Assembly a message of fraternity and best wishes for every success from Major Pierre Buyoya, Chairman of the Military Committee for National Redemption and President of the Republic of Burundi, on the occasion of this forty-third session.\nI am also pleased to express on behalf of my Government warn and heartfelt congratulations to Nr. Dante Caputo, foreign Minister of Argentina, and the other officers of the Assembly on their election to guide our work and the unanimous expression of confidence it represents.\nWe pay tribute to the President as not only an eminent, skilful diplomat, very familiar with the many difficult concerns of the international community, but a fervent defender of solidarity and co-operation between peoples in a spirit of dignity and sovereign equality. My delegation is determined to give him every assistance so that his noble task may be successfully accomplished. \nWe join previous speakers in expressing our deep gratitude to Mr. Peter Florin, who conducted the Assembly's varied work competently and effectively as President of the forty-second session, with a devotion that redounded to the honour of the United Nations and his country, the German Democratic Republic.\nWe also pay tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General, for his constant, tireless efforts in the service of the international community and for the outstanding successes he has scored - to his own credit and that of our Organization - during the past year. Before stating my country's position on some of the items before this Assembly, I wish briefly to describe the situation that has prevailed in Burundi since the establishment on 3 September 1987 of our Third Republic. I should like first of all to provide some information about the painful events that have ravaged two communes in the north of Burundi and that very nearly destroyed the stability of my country's social fabric.\nThe international community heard of the grin events that shook Burundi in extremely far-fetched versions in that segment of the press that delights in the sensational; in most cases these accounts were in line with the version of the perpetrators of these crimes. I wish therefore to ahead some light on the events so members may have as dear a picture as possible and so the international community nay finally learn of the guilty d is in for nation put before it.\nIt began in the province of Managara in Hgozi province, where the downtrodden populace rose up armed with spears and machetes to defend themselves against a non-existent enemy\u00b7, they refused to withdraw, claiming that they were in danger of being killed. For several months the provincial authorities had noted the spread of seditious writings and cassette recordings stirring up racial hatred. These were being constantly distributed by small groups of Burundian refugees who entered the country from abroad. This subversive literature made these peaceable peasants believe in an imminent massacre, and tried to make them take pre-emptive action to forestall the imaginary enemy.\nIt has now been established that these disturbed activists were seeking to sow confusion, evade governmental vigilance and cause a war with ethnic overtones in order to spread desolation throughout the entire country.\nWhen the authorities learned of the explosive situation and of these criminal plans, they tried first to understand the reasons behind them and then to calm the population by showing clearly that there was no civil war and that the country was calm. The people quickly realized that they had been manipulated. They re-opened roads they had cut off as a preventive measure, and returned to their homes in peace.\nAll this took place very peacefully. In its spirit of tolerance the Government did not attempt to punish the perpetrators of the disturbance. It was believed that the misfits would see reason because the twisted ideas they were spreading would be quickly discredited through dialogue and persuasion. Unfortunately, just as the Government had begun to congratulate itself on the return to normalcy, violence erupted on 14 August 1988 in the neighbouring commune of Ntega in the adjacent province of Kirundo.\nThis time, learning from their failure due to the peasants\u2019 refusal to believe lies, the organizers themselves took action and began the massacre. We know what happened then.\nHeavily drugged and armed with machetes, spears and clubs, they began a real blood-bath, killing men, women, children and old people alike. They put a radical stamp on their crimes by burning houses and crops and slaughtering livestock.\nInitially, the perpetrators of these horrors selectively attacked members of the Tutsi group and their property. They then executed those of their own ethnic group who refused to join in the massacre.\nNot satisfied with their crimes in the Ntego commune, the hordes of murderers extended the horror and killing to the neighbouring commune of Marangara. There too the r \u039b el a overcame the resistance organized spontaneously by the local people of all ethnic groups, and committed more of the same atrocities, destroying all human life in their path and setting fire to houses, coffee and banana plantations and forests. \nGiven this unprecedented violence and the large loss of life, the Government was compelled to send in the army to halt the massacres and protect the people. The armed forces restored order in three days and with the greatest discipline.\nI take this opportunity to deny accusations made in certain press circles concerning the role of the Burundi army and to reaffirm that as of 20 August 1988 the situation was under control in the two affected communes and peace reigned throughout the rest of Burundi.\nDespite the army's effectiveness in halting the killing, Burundi cannot but lament the large human and material losses. During this period 5,000 lives were lost and material damage is estimated at 320 million. Few of the wounded survived the massacre, while large numbers of people fled to Rwanda and neighbouring Burundian communes, leaving behind them poverty and desolation in a region that had once been the wealthiest and most active in the country.\nThose are the grim facts that have plunged Burundi into sorrow.\nFrom the outset, the Government has pursued a policy of openness with respect to these facts. It regularly kept informed representatives of countries and international bodies residing at Bujunbura\u0163 it invited a delegation from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), foreign diplomats and journalists to visit the troubled areas those who wanted to learn the facts in situ were authorized to do so. The Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was invited to carry out a fact-finding mission in Burundi, and a World Bank mission visited the country. Similarly, the Secretary-General of the United Nations may at any time send a fact-finding mission to Burundi if he thinks it necessary.\nTo deal with the Ncega and Marangars tragedy, there was a great spontaneous urge of national solidarity, which enabled the Government to provide first aid to the victims of the disaster. On behalf of the Government and people of Burundi I should like to take this opportunity to thank the friendly countries and organizations that have so generously given emergency assistance and to reiterate our request to the international community for humanitarian aid.\nApart from the material losses and loss of life, the events in Ntega and Marangara have once again threatened to destroy the solid social tissue that had always characterized our society. The existence of ethnic antagonism in Burundi is a recent phenomenon. It has been caused by social and political rivalries between the Hutu and Tutsi elite who divided power after independence in 1962.\nSubsequently, this antagonism increased further and periodically degenerated into bloody upheavals that were explained by international media often in a very peremptory way, thereby encouraging the demands of extremist groups and making calm dialogue almost impossible.\nWe should point out that of all those who have spoken about these recent events In Burundi not one has condemned the actions of the rebels who have massacred innocent people. Many reports, and even certain official declarations, support the notion that these murderous rebels are seeking power\u00b7, and that. If their demands are heeded, there will be no further violence in Burundi. However justified their demands, nothing can legitimise the deaths of innocent people. To succumb to blackmail, the blackmail of terrorists, would be to compromise for ever our search for peaceful solutions.\nWe note that awareness of ethnic origin, which is ages old in Burundi, is not a source of conflict that our oral pre'-colonial traditions were aware of. Under the political regime before colonization, the royal families that ruled used the two main tribes, the Hutus and the Tutsis, in guiding the affairs of state. The colonial regime, in its search for greater effectiveness of the indirect administration system, chose to deepen ethnic rifts by assigning to each tribe specific hierarchical roles. The system of modernizing the political regime eliminated the Hutus from the administration of the country.\nMr. Jean Paul Harroy, the former Governor-General of Rwanda-Burundi in his book \\\"Burundi\\\", stated\u00b7.\n\\\"We should not simplify judgments, speaking of the dominant Tutsis, the oppressor Tutsis and the dominated oppressed Hutus. In agricultural Burundi, which is a land-locked,, over-populated country, we saw two main groups facing each other, each made up of both Tutsis and Hutus, led by dynamic Baganwas. Further on, the author, speaking o\u00a3 the colonial administration, said\u00b7. \\\"The political programme that advocated strengthening the authority of Mwarai and the chiefs unfortunately eliminated many Hutu chiefs by eliminating the small fiefdoms,\\\"\nFrom 1957-1958, when the movement for independence was gathering strength in Africa and, in particular, in Burundi, the colonial agents did an about-face and sought an alliance with the Hutu elements in order to thwart national, the nationalism of the young cadres of whom the majority were Tutsis, They financed and created many parties, based for the most part on tribal ideology, whose objective was to oppose the Uprona party, which was alone calling for immediate independence. These living in Burundi at that time will recall the many tracts dropped from 'planes provided by colonial agents that, inter alia, carried such slogans as \\\"Bwengebuka na Bugor ihenda\\\" which means literally, the stupid and the clever people. The two adjectives were applied, respectively, to the Hutus and the Tutsis. The Tutsis were called \\\"Nilo-Hamitic\\\" and \\\"lords\\\", whereas the Hutus were called \\\"Bantu Negroes\\\" and \\\"serfs\\\" and a whole pseudo-scientific literature was developed on the basis of their respective height.\nThat ideology, assisted by the goal of replacing the colonial agents in power, finally won over extremist elements from the Burundi elite who readied the point where they believed that they belonged to another race and that they should accede to power by exterminating the other ethnic group.\nThat is the ideology being spread by the detractors of national unity - particularly the activists who have taken refuge abroad and who still refuse to return to the country to participate in its construction, despite the appeals, and guarantees of security and jobs offered them by the Third Republic.\nThe evidence is very clear that these same terrorists organized the Ntega and Marangaras events. At some time they infiltrated Burundi, particularly the border communes, to preach hatred and genocide by means of tracts, cassettes and secret meetings.\nThe motives of these misfits of Burundi society are clear. Their concern is to thwart the policy of national unity, social justice, democracy and progress being established by the authorities of the Third Republic under the guidance of His Excellency, Major Pierre Suyoya, Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation and President of the Republic. This policy, whose main points I now outline, was intended to deprive the terrorists once and for all of an audience within the country and to stop the flow of funds generously provided, ostensibly to serve a good cause, that of the \\\"oppressed majority\\\" freeing itself of the \\\"minority of oppressors\\\", or \\\"lords\\\". Anyone who is familiar with the real situation in Burundi can attest that our country is free of this social stratification.\nIn internal policies, the government of the Third Republic has, since 3 September 1987, been pursuing a policy of harmonization and dialogue on all problems facing cur country. In this context the question of national unity is being thoroughly debated in party Meetings and during visits that the authorities of the Third Republic, headed by the President, have regularly paid to the provinces, the communes and the hilly areas.\nMany national cadres have been appointed to responsible posts in the administration of the party without any distinction as to ethnic origin. In order to strengthen this national unity, the Military Committee for National Salvation has just established a commission which has been asked to make a thorough study of ways and means to strengthen national unity. It consists of people chosen for their patriotism and integrity, representing all sectors of national life in Burundi.\nPolitical prisoners were released upon the establishment of the Third Republic and the Church-State conflict has been satisfactorily resolved. Thus  freedom of religion has been restored, religious leaders expelled under the Second Republic have been allowed to return to Burundi and seminaries and property requisitioned have been restored to the Church.\nThe National Party for Unity and Progress which for a long time now has been the crucible of national unity, has been restructured to serve as an ideal framework for the practice of democracy in Burundi. General elections, with universal suffrage and secrecy, have been successfully organized to establish the basic organs of the party, and .this democratic process will apply at the highest levels of the party and the administration.\nIn foreign policy, the Government of the Third Republic, faithful to its principles of good-neighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  international co-operation, non-alignment and support for national liberation movements, has been conducting a policy of clear-sightedness, trust and ongoing dialogue. The authorities of the Third Republic were quick to normalize relationships with ail neighbouring countries, and enjoy relations of friendship and co-operation, free from suspicion and any other psychological barrier, with other countries and friendly organizations.\nWith regard to economic and social matters, the Third Republic has given priority to developing the rural sector, where 90 per cent of our people live. Accordingly, the sixth five-year plan for social and economic development gives priority to the Ministers of Agriculture and Rural Development. Efforts are under way to develop social infrastructures, such as schools, health centres and drinking water facilities.\nSince the advent of the Third Republic, the approach taken by our President and our Government has been consistent; first, to recognize the problems, then to put them forward for discussion, and finally to carry out the solutions proposed and encourage the commitment of everyone to their success. The problems of Burundi must elicit responses by Burundi. In officially opening the work of the national commission to study the question of national unity, the President of the Republic said: \\\"If there is one way that foreigners can help to resolve Burundi's problems it is by becoming thoroughly familiar with them\u00b7, by questioning the people and the facts, observing the phenomena and studying the history. That is the effort that is necessary from all who wish to judge the situation with respect for the truth.\\\"\nSpeaking of the recent tragedy, he went on to say; \\\"We are capable of fighting, we are capable of transforming our past weaknesses into assets in ensuring solidarity and fraternity, where before there were suspicion and hatred.\\\"\nWe welcome the wise advice of friends, but we deny anyone the right to settle Burundi's affairs except those mainly concerned - that is, the people of Burundi. We do not believe in the effectiveness of solutions imposed from outside, whatever the size of the group of countries and the organizations from which they emanate. It should be clear to all that advocate sanctions or pressure of any kind against the Government of Burundi that their initiatives go against the policy of national reconciliation advocated by our President, Major Pierre Bayoya, and his Government. Such sanctions, if applied, would hit the people of Burundi indiscriminately and seriously compromise peace not only in Burundi but in all the other Great Lakes countries.\nDespite this troubled short-term situation in my country, Burundi is very alive to and concerned by the many problems that threaten international peace and security. Fear of a nuclear catastrophe, the ravages caused by armed conflict throughout the world, colonial oppression, racial segregation and the deplorable world economic situation, are problems of vital concern that disrupt cur world.\nThe Republic of Burundi follows with keen attention all the efforts made by the international community to preserve peace and security among peoples. In particular, we welcome the increasing tendency of the two super-Powers to place the question of the prevention of a nuclear holocaust at the forefront of their concerns. We greatly appreciate their determination in the last few years to engage in constructive dialogue, which led recently to the ratification in Moscow of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty. This was a political result of vital importance, since it could contribute to giving a fresh impetus to the process of disarmament and co-operation in matters of international security.\nHowever, unless all the nations of the world, collectively and individually, are committed to the success of the great and noble task of disarmament in all its dimensions, we shall still tend to doubt the effectiveness and the value of initiatives taken to prevent the frenzied arms race, which could threaten mankind, whether through cynicism, mistake or tragic accident, according to chance.\nWe believe that the highly desirable multilateral process of disarmament offers a number of advantages. Generally speaking, it would certainly allow us to examine objectively the various aspects of the problem. At the same time, it would help us to change the views on disarmament of States that possess nuclear arsenals, as well as the position of this question on the scale of priorities of those States.\nIn this context, we welcomed the convening of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament last June. To its credit, that session, among other things, reaffirmed that international peace and security cannot depend on the relations between only two States, however powerful, but are the concern of all Member States of the United Nations.\nAt the regional level, we appreciate the combined efforts to put an end to armed conflicts that have afflicted many third world countries for many years. Burundi welcomed the signing in Geneva on 14 April 1988 of the Geneva Accords relating to Afghanistan. We pay a tribute to Hr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General for his patient and fruitful efforts in seeking a peaceful solution to the critical situation in that country. This was, of course, made possible thanks to the flexibility shown by the main parties to the conflict.\nWe express profound feelings of solidarity with all front-line States that have spared no effort, at the price of great sacrifices, to provide all necessary support for a people oppressed, exploited and dispossessed by the racist apartheid regime of South Africa. ,\nStill on the subject of southern Africa, we are particularly interested in the negotiations that have been started between Angola, the United States, Cuba and South Africa. These quadripartite negotiations between Angolans, Americans, Cubans and South Africans could lead to a process to establish peace in that part of Africa.\nFor Burundi, the independence of Namibia cannot be subordinated to any condition that runs counter to the aspirations of the peoples concerned for self-determination, as expressed by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the sole, authentic representative of the Namibian people. \nThat is why we once again call upon Pretoria's allies to recognize the imperative need to implement without further delay Security Council resolution 435 (1978), regarding Namibia's accession to independence. It is out of the same sympathy and solidarity with all genuine liberation movements that our delegation expresses the firm hope that the Sahraoui people will in the near future exercise its inalienable right to self-determination. \nBurundi also warmly welcomes the commitment undertaken by the Islamic Republic of Iran last July officially to accept Security Council resolution 598 (1987) which constitutes a peace plan for the two States that have for years been engaged in the Gulf war. We are happy to see the opening of direct negotiations between Iran and Iraq to put an end to the hostilities between those two fraternal peoples.\nWith regard to South-East Asia, we support all the parties\u2019, efforts now being made to bring about a normalization of the situation in Kampuchea in keeping with the profound aspirations of the people concerned. Furthermore, we welcome the common political determination manifested by the leaders of the north and south of Korea to reach peacefully negotiated solutions, which should inevitably lead to the reunification of the Korean nation.\nOn the subject of the Middle East, we are firmly convinced that the conflict in that region can come about only within the context established by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), so that the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to a homeland.\t.\nTurning to Latin America, we hope that the peoples of that region will finally come to the necessary agreement to establish stability and peace there, in keeping with the political will expressed by the Guatemala Agreement signed by the five Presidents of Central America in August 1987.\nMany previous speakers have emphasized the dangers of the present economic situation. Since the 1970s, third world countries have constantly been forced to have recourse to foreign loans to meet their increasing budget deficits. It is apparent that loans entered into in international markets and granted by various financial institutions hove placed the recipient countries in a situation of dependence, at first imperceptible and then very marked. \n\nThe most disturbing aspect of this dependence lies in long-term obligations that are very costly in terms of political economic control.\nWe are fully aware that proposals and initiatives have been put forward to overcome the serious debt problems that paralyse many third world countries. But they all seem very limited to us, including the structural adjustment programmes, the United Nations Programme of Action for Africa, North-South Co-operation and the regional economic integration policies.\nThat is why my delegation once again makes an urgent appeal to the United Nations to consider in depth the question of establishing a new international economic order.\t.\nWe sincerely hope that international economic transactions can be carried out in a way that can generate investment capital for the developing countries. That would enable them to train the needed competent manpower and to produce the technology and capital goods these countries need to deal with the extreme poverty of their peoples.\nAnother problem, that of the environment, has been added to the matters preoccupying the international community. I refer to the export of toxic waste to third-world areas in general and to sub-Saharan Africa in particular. Western corporations are proposing that countries of the region receive millions of tons of toxic waste for a pathetic amount of money.\nThe mortal danger to human and animal life and to vegetation involved in such speculations is very clear, as are the unfortunate long-term consequences for future generations in the countries concerned. We urgently draw this matter to the attention of all the specialized agencies of the United Nations, in particular the United Nations educational. Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Meteorological Organisation and the International Labour Organisation, which must continue to pi s y their noble . roles in sensitising world public opinion on environmental issues and finding, urgently and concertedly, verifiable measures with regard to the international regulation of the serious problem of exporting industrial waste. \nSuccess in meeting this challenge of course requires the unanimous commitment of all nations of the world collectively and individually to fight pollution, we hope that in the cases of other scourges also, such as war, terrorism, hunger, disease, poverty and ignorance, there will be a collective will to promote the building of a world of peace, justice and security.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe delegation of Viet Nam would like to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election as President of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that under his guidance our session will leave an imprint commensurate with the watershed significance of the present period.\nWe also take this opportunity to express our great appreciation of the major contribution of Mr. Peter Florin, President of the forty-second session, to the success of that session.\nThe delegation of Viet Nam wishes to join previous speakers in expressing high appreciation of the indefatigable efforts made over the past year by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, in the service of peace and security in many parts of the world.\nSince the forty-second session we have witnessed far-reaching developments in both the world and the regional situation which give rise to hopes for those who are striving for a world of peace, friendship and co-operation among nations.\nThe two summit meetings between the Soviet Union and the United States, the ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and the progress, albeit modest, made in the negotiations on a 50 per cent reduction, in strategic weapons constitute important breakthroughs which open up a real opportunity of achieving still greater results in the long struggle to free mankind from the nightmare of a nuclear war of annihilation. The strengthening and broadening of international co-operation at the global and regional levels - an objective necessity of our time - and especially the signing for the first time of an agreement establishing official relations between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the European Economic Community (EEC), gives a significant impetus to the process.\nThese encouraging events have contributed to the improvement of the international political atmosphere after ' years of tension and confrontation. They have not only enhanced more than ever before the possibility of safeguarding peace and averting the danger of a war of extermination but also ushered in a new era in international relations, an era of struggle and co-operation in peaceful coexistence among countries with different social and political systems. As a result, all the nations of the world are in a better position to meet together the challenges facing the whole of mankind, which today cannot be met by any one country alone, no matter how large or rich. I refer to such challenges as are posed by pollution of the environment, the demographic explosion, the world food problem and the problem of sources of raw materials.\nImportant though they may be, the positive developments in the world situation are but a beginning. Mankind is still faced with the danger of a frenzied arras race in outer space. It is still witnessing the wasteful channelling of huge natural resources to the arms race or to regional conflicts, while two thirds of mankind are living in poverty because of the heavy legacy of a long colonial past and the unfair international economic order. \nNever before has mankind had such a strong common will to accept and overcome these serious challenges. From years of fierce struggle and untold sacrifices and losses, the peoples of the world are new all the more aware of tine indivisibility of world peace and detente and, furthermore, of the close link between peace and detente, on the one hand, and independence and development, on the other. There can be no peace and detente in the world unless the independence, security and development of nations in every region are guaranteed. Conversely, the independence, security and development of nations are a decisive factor in the preservation of a solid and lasting peace on earth. In that context, the initiative for a comprehensive system of international peace and security designed to encourage international dialogue based on respect for the independence and sovereignty of nations is certain to win the approval and support of a broad segment of world public opinion.\nThe initial successes having been scored, the international community is new stepping up its efforts in the struggle for peace and development. The Ministerial Meeting on disarmament held in Havana by the non-aligned countries, the third General Assembly special session on disarmament and the world-wide movement in response to the \\\"Peace Wives\\\" campaign in 1988 have given powerful expression to the earnest aspirations of nations to live in peace, free from the use of force in international relations, and to enjoy the benefits of the relaxation of world tension and genuine security in every region, so that they can concentrate all their efforts on the long-terra development of their respective countries The broad movement towards the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones is spreading across Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America and Oceania; it reflects the peoples' determination to continue their struggle to reverse the costly and dangerous arms race in outer space and to secure a complete ban on nuclear tests and a prohibition of the testing and production of other weapons of mass destruction.  \n\nThe need to struggle for peace and disarmament cannot be dissociated from the nations\u2019 struggle for independence and development. The serious economic difficulties now facing the developing countries require common efforts by the international community to bridge the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries. External debt, the flow of capital resources from developing to developed countries, protectionism and unequal terms of trades these are serious problems requiring urgent and effective solutions that would contribute to the establishment of a just and equitable new international economic order. The expansion of bilateral and multilateral economic co-operation and, especially, the promotion of regional co-operation in order to tackle the major challenges more effectively, as well as the need for a readjustment of the economic development strategies of nations - which is required by the scientific and technological revolution - are the real imperatives of our times.\nThe new developments in regard to peaceful coexistence in the world and the persistent endeavours of nations in various regions to achieve peace, independence and development have revealed the real possibility that many regional problems can be solved peacefully through dialogue. Although, for various reasons, the results obtained vary in degree, peace talks have aroused high hopes about the search for a political settlement of regional conflicts. We are witnessing vivid and diverse manifestations of that trend in various parts of the world - from Afghanistan to southern Africa, from the Gulf region to the Korean peninsula, from Cyprus to Western Sahara.\nIn keeping with its unswerving position, Viet Nam extends its constant solidarity and strong support to the heroic peoples of Cuba, Nicaragua and Panama in their staunch struggle against the imperialist forces that stubbornly continue to engage in interventionist and hostile policies, and for the defence of their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We value highly the good will shown and the major efforts made by Afghanistan and the Soviet Union in implementing the Geneva agreements and strongly urge the other parties concerned to implement these agreements scrupulously in order to put an early end to the conflict and enable the Afghan people to live in peace and national harmony.\nLike the rest of the international community, Viet Nam supports the correct position adopted and the good will shown by Angola and Cuba in order to ensure progress in ongoing quadripartite negotiations towards a solution that would guarantee Angola's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity as well as Namibia's genuine independence. The South African authorities must implement strictly the agreements reached and put an end to their warlike policy, so that peace and security can soon be restored to that region.\nFor the sake of peace in the Middle East and the legitimate rights of the heroic Palestinian people, Viet Nam fully supports the convening of an international conference - with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization on an equal footing with the other parties concerned - for the purpose of finding a fair and realistic settlement.\nWe whole-heartedly welcome the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and hope that their bilateral talks will soon bring about lasting peace for the peoples of those two countries. As for the Korean peninsula, we hope that in the not-too-distant future the United Nations will be able to welcome in its midst a peaceful, reunified Korea, free from the presence of foreign troops.\nWith regard to regional questions, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has a consistent position of supporting the trend towards the peaceful settlement among the countries of each region of the disputes and conflicts in that region on the basis of respect for the independence and sovereignty of each country as the legitimate interests and equal security of all the parties concerned, and of supporting all processes designed to achieve national reconciliation without outside interference. That Vietnamese position is in conformity with the view of the Non-Aligned Movement, as expressed most recently in the Final Document of its Ministerial Meeting in Nicosia, Cyprus. \nSouth-East Asia has of late witnessed positive developments that are in keeping with universal trends and the earnest aspirations of the peoples of that region, particularly since Viet Nam, with the agreement of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, recently announced the withdrawal of 50,000 troops and the command of its volunteer forces from Kampuchea. For the first time in that part of the world, which has been a theatre of constant tension over the past 40 years, favourable factors have emerged for mutual understanding and trust and friendly co-operation among the countries of the region, which are so necessary for them to find together a fair and reasonable political solution to the Kampuchean question and to build South-East Asia into a zone of lasting peace and stability.\nOn the basis of the agreement readied in Ho Chi Minh City in July 1987 between Indonesia and Viet Nam, representing the two groups of countries in South-East Asia, the four parties of the two opposing sides in Kampuchea and the two groups of countries in South-East Asia have for the first time, after 10 years of intense confrontation, come to engage in dialogue at the Jakarta Informal Meeting in discussions on a political solution to the Kampuchean question, with the prospect of a peaceful and stable South-East Asia.\nThe Jakarta Informal Meeting took the Kampuchean question out of deadlock because that meeting did not follow the beaten track of the past 10 years, in which the will and interests of one side were imposed on the other. Its success constitutes a victory for regional co-operation, mutual understanding and respect for each other's interests, and first and foremost the legitimate interests of the Kampuchean people.\nIt was thus possible in Jakarta, for the first time, for a consensus to be reached among the parties directly concerned in the region on recognition of the two interlinked key issues of the Kampuchean problem, namely the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea and the prevention of the return to Kampuchea of the genocide Pol Pot regime. Besides this extremely important achievement of the Jakarta Informal Meeting, in Jakarta Prince Sihanouk and Chairman Hun Sen readied an agreement to resume their talks in Paris to discuss further the internal problems of Kampuchea in a spirit of national reconciliation.\nThe results of the Jakarta Informal Meeting and the agreement reached between Prince Sihanouk and Chairman Him Sen have not only broken the stalemate of the past 10 years but have also created a framework for a political settlement of the Kampuchean question in both its internal and its international aspects. They have thus opened up the prospect of solving the Kampuchean issue i\\\"1 the not too distant future.\t.\nThat is precisely why the consensus readied at the Jakarta Informal Meeting has been widely welcomed and supported by world public opinion from the East to the Hest, which regards it as movement in the correct direction, to be further encouraged and supported. The Non-Aligned Movement in particular, with its constructive initiatives, has extended valuable and timely support to the common endeavours of the South-East Asian countries to find an early solution to the Kampuchea  question, thus contributing to turning that region of confrontation and tension into a zone of lasting peace, stability, friendship and co-operation.\nIn this very forum, all the countries that are concerned about the Kampuchean question and peace and stability in South-East Asia, and sincerely desire to make a constructive contribution, have noted with satisfaction that, given the recent profound changes in South-East Asia, there now exists a real possibility of achieving a political settlement of the Kampuchean question.\nRegrettably, however, despite this cannon trend, some in this forum are still trying to swift against the tide. After 10 years, they have tried by any means available to distract world opinion in an attempt to cover up the appalling crimes committed between 1975 and 1984 by an utterly inhuman regime against an entire nation, and to blur the all too real danger of the scourge of renewed genocide in the land of Angkor.\nWith their one-sided arguments and their distortions of the realities in Kampuchea, they attempt to represent the genocidal clique as pitiful victims whom foreign troops have unjustly deprived of their freedom to commit genocide. Is it by way of compensation that this genocidal clique has been allowed to retain the right to represent the Kampuchean people at the United Nations? As for those who, together with their fellow Kampuchean, have made every effort over the past 10 years to resurrect from the ruins and the killing fields left behind by the Pol Pot regime a new Kampuchean State full of vitality and having a political, economic and social life, they are denied that legitimate right.\nSuch is the shocking reality, despite the existence since 1948 of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\nWorse yet, in the face of world opinion's strong condemnation of the genocidal Pol Pot clique, the latter's sponsors have taken up an odd line of reasoning, putting on an equal footing the danger of the genocidal Pol Pot clique and the existence of the Administration of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which enjoys the full support of the Kampuchean people and Has done its utmost to overcome the terrible legacy of the genocidal Pol Pot regime.\nThese same people also claim that they pursue no self-interest in their approach to the Kampuchean question. If that is so, why do they make a series of demands that are tantamount to imposing their will on the Kampuchean people, including on matters pertaining to Kampuchea 's purely internal problems? They demand that the future Administration of Kampuchea be like this, and its army like that. Is that the way to respect the Kampuchean people's right to self-determination? Or are these demands only aimed at serving their purpose of preserving and legalizing the genocidal Pol Pot forces as part of a solution of the Kampuchean question?\nI have been compelled to express the aforementioned views in order to reply to assertions that cannot remain unanswered. It is not my intention to engage in polemics in this forum. I only wish to engage in constructive exchanges of views here in an atmosphere of goodwill, with a view to contributing usefully to world peace as well as to peace and stability in our region.\nOnce again, Viet Nam reaffirms its full support foe and active contribution to all efforts to find an early political solution to the Kampuchean problem. We are of the view that a political settlement of the Kampuchean question should ensure the legitimate interests of the Kampuchean people first and foremost, their right to live free from the danger of another genocide, while duly taking into account the security interests of all parties concerned, including the People's Republic of China. \nLike many other regional problems, the Kampuchean question has two aspects: the internal and the international. Viet Nam wishes to secure a comprehensive settlement that would solve both aspects. If that is not yet possible we think that the international aspect of the Kampuchean question could be solved first, as has been clearly indicated by the Jakarta Informal Meeting. As for the internal aspect of the question, it should be left to the Kampucheans themselves to settle this without outside interference. All other countries should respect the Kampuchean people's right to self-determination and the agreements reached by the Kampuchean parties.\nFor its part, Viet Nam, in a spirit of regional co-operation and together with other South-East Asian countries, will do its best to make the forthcoming session of the Jakarta Informal Meeting a success. In keeping with the spirit of regional co-operation, Viet Nam will strictly carry out its announced withdrawal of 50,000 of its troops from Kampuchea in 1988. The remaining Vietnamese forces will be completely withdrawn in 1990, as has been stated earlier. If a political solution, either comprehensive or partial, is reached, the total withdrawal will be affected sooner. The timetable for the troop withdrawal will be closely linked with the timetable for the cessation of all forms of outside interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea, in the spirit of consensus reached at the Jakarta Informal Meeting.\nViet Nam's consistent wish is for a fair and reasonable settlement of the Kampuchean question. This, however, depends, not on the resolve of one side alone, but rather on the common goodwill of all the parties involved, and, in particular, on the determination of the countries of the region to continue to co-operate in the solution of the problem on the basis of the Jakarta consensus, especially at the meeting of the working group of the Jakarta Informal Meeting on 17 October. Desiring as we do an early, fair and reasonable political solution that guarantees the Kampuchean people a peaceful and happy life, with national reconciliation, in fulfilment of the common aspirations of all South-East Asian countries to peace and development, we fully support the seven-point proposal put forward at Jakarta by the People's Republic of Kampuchea. These points are the following. First, the aim is to build a peaceful, independent, democratic, sovereign, neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea.\nSecond, by December 1989, or at the latest by the first quarter of 1990, all the remaining Vietnamese volunteer forces will be completely withdrawn from Kampuchea, along with the simultaneous ending of all foreign aid and sanctuaries provided to the genocidal Pol Potists and opposing Khmer forces and cessation of the use of Khmers in refugee camps against the Kampuchean people and of all foreign interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea.\nThird, the internal problems of Kampuchea must be settled by the Kampuchean parties themselves on the basis of national reconciliation, the exclusion of the criminal leadership of Pol Pot's genocidal regime and the inadmissibility of the Khmer Rouge armed forces.\nFourth, the status quo in Kampuchea will be maintained until the completion of general elections to the National Assembly, which will then adopt a new constitution and form a coalition Government.\t.\nFifth, a national reconciliation council will be established made up of the four Kampuchean parties and headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. This council will be entrusted with the following duties; to implement all the agreements readied between the various Kampuchean parties; to organize general elections to the National Assembly. Sixth, an international control commission will be set up to supervise the implementation of all the agreements concluded.\nSeventh, a international conference will be convened, with the participation of Kampuchea, Laos, Viet Nam, the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Chairmen of the sixth, seventh and eighth summit Conferences of non-aligned countries, the Soviet Union, China, France, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other countries that have contributed to the process of peace in South-East Asia, as well as the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The purpose of this conference will be to guarantee the independence, sovereignty, neutrality and non-alignment of Kampuchea, as well as peace and stability in South-East Asia.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General's continued efforts aimed at promoting the implementation of the agreements reached at the Jakarta Informal Meeting and supporting the 5 November meeting between Chairman Hun Sen and Prince Norodon Sihanouk so that it may be a success.\nThe period between now and 1990 offers us the best possible opportunity to bring the Kampuchean question to a close and to turn a new page in the history of relations among South-East Asian countries. Viet Nam sincerely wishes to build up mutual trust and relations of co-operation with all countries in the region in accordance with the spirit of the seven-point proposal on the principles governing the relations among South-East Asian countries, put forward by the Lao People's Democratic Republic at the Jakarta Informal Meeting. Relations of mutual trust and co-operation among South-East Asian countries are an essential factor in the creation of a favourable atmosphere for the settlement of the Kampuchean question. In the long run, this will provide a sound basis on which to assure the security and development interests of each country in South-East Asia. Only through regional co-operation can regional problems be solved.\nThe world is moving away from confrontation towards dialogue and co-operation. The positive changes in the world situation in this direction in the last few years of the twentieth century have engendered hope for a world in which nations can live on an equal footing in peace and friendship without the threat of a nuclear war of extermination, in which regional conflicts can be solved not by the use of forces but through dialogue, and in which ideological differences do not hinder co-operation for the well-being of mankind. It is hoped that, with the emergence of these premises, this lofty aspiration will become a reality in the not-too-distant future for all the regions in the world, including South-East Asia. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like first to offer Mr. Dante Caputo my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. I should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin who so ably and effectively conducted the affairs of the forty-second session and also those of the special session devoted to disarmament. \nMy friend and colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, Mr. Karolos Papoulias, has already addressed the Assembly in the name of the Twelve member States of the European Community and Ireland of course associates itself fully with his remarks.\nAs we meet for the forty-third session of the General Assembly and as we survey the world scene, it is pleasing to be able to note that prospects look somewhat brighter than they did at this time last year - indeed, better than they have done for many years now. A series of regional crises which have been the subject of debate in this Assembly for all too many years appear to have been moved from the point of inertia. In the case of others, admittedly, the first step still has to be taken. So our optimism needs to be tempered. Nevertheless we can be encouraged by what has already been achieved.\nIt is even more pleasing for this delegation to note the essential role played by the United Nations in the progress that has so far been made. We have always regarded this Organization as the central forum for the resolution of international conflict. We have not been blind to its weaknesses, which have received much emphasis in recent years. But looking behind weaknesses, we have been convinced that the Organization has retained the ability to achieve the noble aims set out in the Charter.\nThe emphasis placed in more recent years on the flaws of the Organization was not entirely negative. It is not surprising if, after more than 40 years of existence, critical appraisal makes it apparent that some measures of reform are necessary. We therefore welcomed and supported the efforts of the Secretary-General to increase the efficiency of the United Nations and to improve its day-to-day functioning. We salute the progress that has been made towards this end and we can assure the Secretary-General of our support for his continuing endeavour. We believe that a great deal is at stake here.\nWhat is at stake is the continued existence of the Organization in the terms set out in the Charter. This established the Organization on the basis of the sovereign equality of all its Members. It went on to impose certain obligations on Members. This principle and these obligations have not of course always sat comfortably with all Members. In the course of the last 43 years first one and then another Member State has found itself irked to some extent. It is notable, however, that they have all come to acknowledge that the Organization plays an indispensable role.\nA genuine commitment finding its expression in effective operation of the United Nations in accordance with the Charter clearly has a particular attraction for a country such as ray own, whose security depends, not on force of arms but on the establishment of an international order based on the observance of international law. We would like to think, however, that our interest in the United Nations is not selfish. In an era of weapons of mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical or more conventional, and of ever greater interdependence throughout the world there can be no doubt that the framework provided by the United Nations is in the interest of all States.\nBut the existence of a framework will not of itself achieve that rule of law based on justice and tempered with generosity which is the only basis for permanent peace. There is a need for a clear commitment on the part of Member States, including actual or potential belligerents, to use to the full the mechanisms available under the Charter. Members of the Security Council have, of course, special responsibilities in this regard and we welcome the evidence of their increased willingness to discharge these responsibilities. We must all see what we can do to divert the skills and capabilities of mankind away from war, or the threat of war, and towards economic and social improvement. Such sacrifices as this may entail are small when compared with the horrific cost in human lives and suffering which any war inevitably inflicts.\nWhen looking at the record of the past year it is intriguing to wonder why this progress was made over that period rather than, say, during the preceding 10 years. It would be inappropriate in my view to seek any single reason. However, it must be acknowledged that the relationship between the super-Powers is of major importance; this relationship is the prime determinant of the international climate and this climate affects international relations in general. All Members of the United Nations welcome the improvement in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. This improvement has had a twofold effect. It has resulted in a commitment on the part of the super-Powers themselves not only to improve their bilateral relations, but to search for ways to reduce the possibilities of confrontation between them in regional conflicts. The improvement in the international climate which has thus been brought about has induced the participants in regional conflicts themselves to search for ways peacefully to resolve these conflicts.\nWhile acknowledging the importance of the super-Power relationship, it is notable that in every case United Nations involvement has been an essential element in the progress made towards resolution of regional conflicts. I should like particularly to congratulate the Secretary-General on the success he has had so far in this respect. He must be able to rely on the full support and on the loyal co-operation of all Members of the Organization, including of course the super-Powers, in his efforts to secure international peace and stability.\nIf a political commitment is a necessary condition for effective action by the United Nations to maintain peace and security and to promote peaceful resolution of conflict, it is, alas, not sufficient in itself. Of no less importance is the assurance of the necessary financial means. Those who will the end must also will the means. If they fail to do so the potential benefits of political consensus in the United Nations will not be realized and the credibility of the Organization will be seriously compromised. It is imperative that United Nations finances be put on a firm and sound footing. All that is required is that all Member States discharge the legal commitment, freely undertaken, to pay their mandatory contribution to the general budget and to the various peace-keeping accounts. It is heartening to note the recent indications that Member States do indeed acknowledge the necessity of this commitment and have taken practical steps to implement it.\nThe peace-keeping function of the Organization has been highlighted only today by the well-deserved award to the United Nations peace-keeping forces of the Nobel Peace Prize. I congratulate the peace-keeping forces of the Organization on this award. It arises at a very appropriate time. An important factor in the Organization's involvement over the past year in the settlement of regional conflicts has been the role of United Nations peace-keeping and observer forces. They have been established most recently to monitor the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan and the cease-fire in the war between Iran and Iraq. In a number of other areas where we all hope early progress towards a settlement can be made, United Nations peace-keeping or observer forces will be an essential element of the settlement.\nI should like here to focus in particular on the financial difficulties of peace-keeping operations, including those of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL\u00b7). The burden of financing these forces must not fall disproportionately on a small number of troop-contributing countries. In each case the decision to establish such forces commits the Organization as a whole. It is crucial that there be a secure foundation for financing peace-keeping operations, in order that troop contributors can be reliably assured that the agreed financing provisions will be observed and that they will not face an unfair financial burden because of undertaking this task.\nLet me say here that my concern is not related solely to money. Indeed, the sums of money involved pale into insignificance when compared to the supreme sacrifice many individual members of peace-keeping and observer forces have made while serving under the United Nations flag. The financial costs must surely be accepted as of small significance when one considers the prevention of death, destruction and human suffering that the operations of such forces usually secure, however, fragile the basis. But even in terms of financial costs United Nations peace-keeping forces are a very economical alternative to the maintenance of unilateral or multilateral forces, which impose massive costs and which, because usually they are seen to be partisan, are less likely to facilitate progress towards a permanent solution.\nMy concern is mainly with the political implications of the failure of all Member States to discharge their financial obligations under the Charter. I am not talking about the temporary difficulties of an economic or financial nature that any State may encounter from time to time. I am referring to decisions made by States to withhold their assessed mandatory contributions for political reasons. Such decisions may be interpreted by parties to a conflict as implying a lack of support for a particular peace-keeping operation. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a deliberate decision to withhold due financial contributions as other than an expression of withdrawal of support for an operation. When one considers that, ultimately, political solutions must L-s wound, that if: an unacceptable risk. If some Member States pick and choose those observer or peace-keeping missions concerning which they will make or withhold their mandatory financial contributions, individual operations may be undermined. Worse, the whole concept of United Nations peace-keeping, on which so many hopes are now hanging, would be emptied of any credibility.\nWe celebrate this year the fortieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. One could say that the very existence of the United Nations arose from a recognition borne of the bitter experience of war that real and lasting peace and security between nations must be based on universal acknowledgement of the inherent dignity and worth of the individual human being. This is as valid today as when the Declaration was first proclaimed. At its last session the General Assembly unanimously resolved to use the occasion of this anniversary to promote and protect human rights throughout the world, to renew the Organization's commitment to this objective and to encourage Member States to ensure the promotion and protection of the rights enshrined in the Declaration. If we are to build on the tremendous progress that has been made over the last 40 years in the development of international instruments for the protection of human rights, we need a sustained and credible United Nations campaign to promote the universal observance and enjoyment of these rights. At a time when grave abuses continue to occur, and are widely known to occur, there is no room here for complacency.\nPride in the achievement of the United Nations in the area of human rights is justified. Paradoxically, perhaps, one important achievement is that awareness of the degree of abuse of these rights world-wide has dramatically increased. Today the world community recognizes the inherent dignity and worth of the individual and accepts that the protection and promotion of his human rights are international obligations. While the United Nations cannot itself enforce the standards it has been instrumental in developing, it must not underestimate the moral authority it can bring to bear for the correction of abuses in this area. An important instrument for bringing pressure to bear on behalf of the victims of oppression is informed public opinion imbued with the values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Organization therefore has a very positive role to play in stimulating public awareness of the need for vigilance and in mobilizing the support of international public opinion for the correction of abuses wherever they occur.\nIreland recognizes and honours the tremendous contributions which, inspired by the ideals set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, individuals and national and international organizations have made by mobilizing effective public pressure in the defence of fundamental freedoms for victims of oppression. In many instances this has been accomplished at great personal risk to the individuals concerned. We attach great major importance to the human rights endeavour because we are convinced of the truth of the opening words of the Universal Declaration. Recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, peace and justice in the world. \nI have already referred to the improvement in East-West relations which has taken place in the recent past. My Government believes that it is essential to maintain the impetus of the Washington and Moscow summits between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev and to halt and reverse the trend towards an accelerating arms race. The agreed-upon commitment to reduce nuclear forces by 50 per cent has yet to be realized, but at least there is a commitment there.\nAt such an encouraging time in United States-Soviet bilateral arms control and disarmament negotiations it is all the more important that a fresh commitment to the multilateral process emerge and that concrete achievements be recorded, thus reaffirming the interest of all countries in the goal of general and complete disarmament.\nThe first step, and one that we believe can and should be taken without further delay, is the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. At the technical level, this could minimize, although not eliminate, the ability to design new weapons. More important, perhaps, it would be a clear signal of intention to reduce reliance on such dangerous and, in the final analysis, irrational means of defence. My delegation is convinced that the technical problems that appear to be in the way of reaching a test-ban agreement can be surmounted, given the political will.\nIt is, or should be clear that possession of nuclear weapons inevitably leads to a similar response from others, thus greatly increasing the threat to a country's security and even to its prospect of survival. Nevertheless, there is still a number of countries which have not abandoned the nuclear weapons option and remain outside the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is my Government's belief that no one can secure advantage through a proliferation of nuclear weapons. We hope that in the years ahead the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will be strengthened, that the number of signatories will be further expanded and that it will be an enduring element in an era of greater efforts to promote and achieve nuclear-arms control and disarmament.\nThe international community has been profoundly shocked by recent reports of the use of chemical weapons. We should all be very gravely concerned that what we have for 63 years regarded as progress in this area - the Protocol banning any use of chemical weapons, dating from 1925 - has been reversed. We have to ensure that this reverse will not be regarded as a headline and go further. The participants in the Conference on Disarmament must dedicate themselves to the task of negotiating a convention banning the production of chemical weapons, with a view to its early conclusion, so that this spectre can finally be banished from the Earth.\nIt is the hope of my Government that the improvement in East-West relations and recent developments in the Soviet Union will also be reflected at the Vienna meeting currently taking place of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The mutual trust and confidence so necessary to ensuring lasting peace and security must encompass all dimensions of the relations between the countries of East and West. They cannot be confined to the military area. Hence, we look forward to agreement at Vienna in the very near future on a concluding document which will provide both for new negotiations on conventional forces and for a further advance in the human dimension of the Helsinki Final Act.\nThe need for a speedy and orderly settlement in the Middle East is clear to all who wish well to the people of Israel and to the population of the occupied territories. The present situation, in the words of the statement of the European Council on this matter, \\\"cannot be sustained\\\". It will be brought to an end only by means of a comprehensive, just and lasting political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The twin pillars of principle on which Irish policy on this difficult issue rests are: the right of all States in the region, including Israel, to exist within secure frontiers, and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, with all that that implies. We acknowledge that this right includes the right to an independent State, if the Palestinian people should so decide. The Irish delegation appeals for the setting aside of all obstacles which bar the way to negotiations based on these principles.\nAny solution will call for basic mutual acceptance and reciprocal recognition of the indomitable human spirit that ensures that a people will not yield, and cannot be put in a position of yielding, to brute force. We believe that the peoples of the region, in accordance with their own best traditions, would wish their leaders to practice the principles of tolerance and good-neighbourliness enshrined in the Charter. It is our hope that the evolution of events inside and outside the region will be such as to permit the peaceful aspirations of the peoples of the region finally to be realized. The way forward requires leadership endowed with courage, wisdom and vision. These are the qualities of statesmanship particularly required in this area.\nThe difficulties in the Lebanon cannot be dissociated from the wider conflict in the Middle East. There has regrettably been a heightening of tension there in recent days. We hope that the search for reconciliation and stability in the Lebanon will be pursued and that forces outside the country will exercise restraint and will respect the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of the Lebanon, which is essential if peace is to be restored to the country. \nI should like to pay a tribute to UNIFIL, which continues to operate in difficult circumstances in southern Lebanon. UNIFIL has never been permitted to fulfil its mandate, despite its repeated renewal by the Security Council over the past 10 years. The Force must be afforded the full co-operation of all the parties to the conflict. My Government reiterates its call for an end to the harassment of UNIFIL and urges all patties to co-operate fully with the Force.\nWe have welcomed the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and should like to compliment the Secretary-General warmly on his strenuous efforts towards this end. Without in any ay underestimating the difficulties which remain to be overcome, we have been heartened that the leadership in both countries has had the courage and wisdom to take the first steps along the honourable road to peace. We wish the Secretary-General and the parties concerned well in their continuing efforts. We hope that the blessings of peace will be enjoyed by all communities in both countries.\nThe Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan represent an important step towards a solution of the Afghan crisis. They impose obligations on all the parties.\nIreland calls upon all concerned to implement fully the peace process set out in these Agreements.\nWe welcome recent contacts between parliamentarians from the North and the South of the Korean peninsula and the efforts which have been made to bring about a resumption of the suspended direct dialogue aimed at reaching a solution by peaceful means. Indeed, on another note, we extend our best wishes for the success of the Olympic Games there as an example of practical international co-operation currently being observed by millions around the globe.\nWhen we look at South Africa we can see no progress since last year. On the contrary, the apartheid system has been reinforced by further repression, harsher censorship and a ban on all those organizations which do not follow the Government line to the full. The effective silencing of the black political organizations and trade union movement and the ban on such organizations as the Soweto Civic Association and the National Education Crisis Committee are just unacceptable. They are further heavy blows on the suffering black population. Once again I must appeal to the South African Government to cease its defiance of international opinion and to take the necessary steps to dismantle apartheid, starting with the release of all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, and the removal of the ban on the 18 organizations now debarred from carrying on their work of peaceful opposition to apartheid.\nOn Namibia, early action is imperative to enable implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to go ahead smoothly. While South Africa's recently stated willingness to cease its obstruction of the implementation process is a welcome, if long overdue, development, it is the duty of the international community to ensure that other obstacles do not hamper the country's transition to independence.\nLasting peace and stability in Central America will come only through the persistent efforts of the Central American countries themselves, with the whole-hearted support of other members of the international community. We appeal to them to continue along the path which they themselves have marked out, in particular in the Guatemala agreement of August 1987, and to pursue national dialogue and the search for peaceful settlements. \nIn my address to the Assembly last year I referred to the threat to the well-being of millions of people posed by the insecure world economic environment. The interrelated problems of developing-country debt, low commodity prices, barriers in international trade, declining financial flows to developing areas are unfortunately still with us. Those and other problems, environmental as well as economic, still threaten the livelihood and even the lives of millions of our fellow human beings.\nIn recent weeks, for example, massive flooding has caused severe suffering and loss of life in Bangladesh and in Sudan. A major international effort to combat drought in Ethiopia continues. In some African countries development is also, regrettably, hindered by civil unrest, sometimes amounting to civil war. Elsewhere the unrest is wilfully provoked from outside. That is the case of Mozambique, the victim of destabilization efforts by its neighbour South Africa. As for Angola, there are now some encouraging signs that this destabilization process and the destruction of the lives of ordinary people may be coming to an end.\nAfrica's need for external help if it is to develop its potential and raise incomes above subsistence levels has long been recognized by the international community. Both individual donor countries and multilateral institutions have for more than two decades now been giving official development assistance on a large scale, although the results have been disappointing.\nLet us hope that the outcome of the recent review meeting on Africa and the recent decisions, which I welcome, to increase the capital of the World Bank and to replenish for the eighth time the funds of the International Development Association will be significant steps in dealing with Africa's development problems.\nThe balance sheet I am bringing the Assembly today on the situation in Northern Ireland is, I am afraid, a rather mixed one. I am sure that I speak for the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland, North and South, when I say that we are all saddened beyond measure at the violence which has afflicted Northern Ireland for almost 20 years and which has brought nothing but death, destruction and suffering to the people of the area, both nationalist and unionist. Suffering and pain are, as we all know, non-discriminatory in their impact.\nIt is hardly necessary for me to state again that the Irish Government shares the commitment of all democratic Governments to the fight against terrorism. Indeed, our determination in that regard has been tellingly illustrated over the past year. But the achievement of peace and political progress is inevitably a larger and more complex task than merely combating campaigns of violence. The whole history and experience of the United Nations underline the absolute necessity of responding to the causes of divisions as well as trying to treat their symptoms.\nIn the specific context of Northern Ireland, it is imperative that the rights, identities and ethos of the two traditions be not alone recognize. But comprehensively accommodated and advanced. While the effective pursuit of that objective will impinge on all areas of government, it will have immediate implications for the system of administering justice - with the need to demonstrate absolute impartiality becoming ever more urgent for relations between the security forces and the community and for addressing the very real problems of economic and social discrimination and disadvantage.\nThe Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985 seeks to address many of those Problems. The British and Irish Governments remain firmly committed to the Agreement and are implementing it actively - indeed, this year the Intergovernmental Conference, established under the Agreement, has been meeting more frequently than at any period since the Agreement was signed. Much valuable progress has been achieved. I would be misleading the Assembly, however, if I did not state clearly that a large body of sensitive issues remains to be tackled effectively. The review of the working of the Intergovernmental Conference, which is scheduled for later this year, will give both Governments an important opportunity to review progress to date and, in particular, to see how in future we can best use the terms of reference and machinery of the Agreement to achieve real political progress.\nA further lesson to be drawn from the history of this great Organization is the importance of dialogue in enhancing the understanding of problems and the parameters within which solutions must be found. All of us on the island of Ireland, no matter how our visions of the future may differ, have a common responsibility to work towards solutions in a spirit of mutual understanding and respect. Let us, as political leaders, begin to talk together in an open and generous way; we owe no less to our people, who so desperately yearn for a lasting peace.\nI know I can count on the support of this Organization in our efforts to move imaginatively and effectively towards a resolution of the problems of Northern Ireland. The achievement of peace through political progress is the objective we have set ourselves - and this is an objective which is thoroughly consistent with the Charter of the United Nations.\nWhen one reviews International relations and the prospects for progress in the period ahead, one must of necessity do so with a degree of caution. But this natural reluctance to raise unreal expectations of immediate solutions to problems which require the patient application of reason and compromise should not lead us to ignore one of the most encouraging developments of the past year - the renewed recognition on the part of Member States of the value of the United Nations as the central forum for the resolution of international conflict. It is the forum indeed in which the commitment of all members of the international community to regulate their affairs in accordance with international law should find its proper and appropriate expression. We rejoice at the recognition, even if it is a bit belated, of the unique and central role of our Organization in that respect.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of Mauritius I am pleased to convey to you, Sir, my sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. Your outstanding personal qualities and your vast experience in the field of diplomacy will be a guarantee of success in the deliberations of the Assembly's session.\nI also wish to express the appreciation of the Government of Mauritius for the outstanding work performed by Mr. Peter Florin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, the outgoing President of the Assembly.\nHis Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar deserves special mention for his devotion in pursuit of the goals and objectives of the United Nations. Despite the many hurdles in his path, he has succeeded in bringing to the negotiating table yesterday's antagonists and adversaries, and they are now talking about finding solutions to intractable problems. May we assure him of our unstinting support in the exacting tasks that confront him.\nMr. President, it is with great pleasure that, on behalf of the people and the Government of Mauritius, I congratulate, through you, the United Nations peace-keeping force on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. For decades, the blue helmets of the peace-keeping forces have been seen throughout the world, patrolling the most varied of conflicts. As the Nobel Prize citation states;\n\\\"The peace-keeping forces of the United Nations have, under extremely difficult conditions, contributed to reducing tension where an armistice has been negotiated but a peace treaty has yet to be established.\\\"\nThe Peace Prise is also a tribute to you, Mr. President, to the Secretary-General, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, and to the United Nations family as a whole.\nEarlier this year, the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament tackled the problem facing mankind. Although it was not possible to adapt a document in its final form, yet we were unanimous in grasping the major implications of the problem. Everyone agreed that differences in political, military, social, economic and other fields should not stand in the way of closer international co-operation for peace and security. The entire disarmament process would be facilitated through a positive approach and greater openness and transparency in military matters.\nNuclear weapons today constitute the greatest menace to the existence of man. Therefore, our main concern is the avoidance of nuclear holocaust. At the special session there was a beginning of consensus on priority issues relating to chemical weapons, to verification and to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We hope that further progress will be made in future discussions of those vital issues.\nThe special session welcomed the existing nuclear-weapon-free zones and debated the creation of new zones. The M Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean concluded its second and last session of 1988 on 22 July. At the conclusion of the ad Hoc Committee's work on the Indian Ocean the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee, Ambassador Daya Perera of Sri Lanka, expressed the view that the members would have the political will to convene the conference at Colombo in 1990, at the latest. We wholeheartedly share that view. I am confident that the members of the Ad Hoc Committee will have meaningful discussions during the two preparatory meetings scheduled in 1989 so that the long-overdue conference is finally convened. My delegation will give its full support to the Ad Hoc Committee in its work, as we in Mauritius are deeply concerned with the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean.\nWe have on previous occasions spoken on the vast amount of resources being spent on armaments, especially on conventional arms and forces. We are strongly in favour of the action programme charted by the international Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development. A global process of disarmament leading to a substantial reduction in military expenditure is bound to release much-needed resources to promote the prosperity of all nations. Lasting peace is more likely to be established through economic development than through lavish expenditure on armaments.\t-\nI should also like to say that Mauritius supports the stand of His Excellency Shri Rajiv Gandhi, Prime Minister of the Republic of India, enunciated in his address on 9 June 1988 to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\nIn clear violation of the principles of the United Nations the island of Diego Garcia, along with the Chagos Archipelago, was detached from Mauritius by Britain prior to our independence in 1968. The island of Diego Garcia was ceded by Britain to the United States of America, which transformed it into a military base. The inhabitants of the island were summarily relocated to Mauritius. The key strategic role now assumed by Diego Garcia has brought the nuclear peril right into the heart of the Indian Ocean. We are determined never to give up our claim over Diego Garcia. With the support of other Indian Ocean States, we shall continue to mobilize international opinion for the restitution of the island to Mauritius. We are thankful to the States members of the Organization of African Unity and the Non-Align movement, as well as other friendly countries, for their continued support of our just claim. \nIt grieves me to refer again to the sad plight of our brothers and sisters in South Africa, who have been denied their fundamental rights and have lived far too long under a regime of murder and terror. Despite the efforts of the United Nations, over four decades, to bring to an end this abominable form of racism, apartheid remains in force. Repeated calls have been made on the South African Government to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations, but to no avail. The resolutions calling for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners, the elimination of apartheid, and the establishment of a free, United and democratic society in South Africa based on universal suffrage, continue to be flouted by the racist regime. My Government has systematically condemned the policy of apartheid. We consider that there can be no peace and security in South Africa until apartheid has been dismantled. Let it also be said that the racist regime of South Africa continues, unabated, its policy of external aggression and the destabilization of neighbouring front-line States, in defiance of repeated condemnation and the enforcement of sanctions.\nThe policy of apartheid has affected not only the oppressed people of South Africa but also the Namibian people, who continue to suffer through the illegal occupation of their country. It is now more than 22 years since the General Assembly terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia and created the United Nations Council for Namibia to administer the Territory and prepare it for independence. The South African Government has used delaying tactics to block the implementation of the United Nations Plan for the Independence of Namibia, contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1973).\nWe have always supported the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in its struggle for the liberation of its homeland. We shall continue to do so until the country is ultimately free. We sincerely hope that the positive talks between South Africa, Angola, Cuba and the United States of America will yield the desired results, so that the United Nations will be able, in the very near future, to welcome to its midst the independent and sovereign State of Namibia.\nThe lessening of tension in southern Africa will enable the international community to tackle another crucial problem of the region, which concerns some six million refugees. In this context we commend the initiative of the recent International Conference on the Plight of Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons in South Africa (SARRED) for its plan of action towards reconstruction and rehabilitation measures in a region despoiled by 13 years of war.\nI wish now to set the record straight regarding the policy of Mauritius towards the racist regime of South Africa. It is indeed with sorrow and much anger that I have to denounce a systematic campaign of disinformation about Mauritius and its links with South Africa. This campaign has been orchestrated by international vested interests, which feel threatened by the economic success of Mauritius, and by jealous rivals unable to emulate the Mauritian miracle. The aim of the campaign has been to equate Mauritius's success to her links with South Africa, and to stick the label \\\"sanctions buster\\\" on Mauritius.\nI would like to take this opportunity to set the picture straight. Under British colonial rule, administrative and economic links tied Mauritius with South  Africa. Geographically, South Africa is the closest mainland to our island. However, since my Government assumed office in 1983, links with South Africa, which in any case were limited, have been diminishing as we have actively been seeking alternative sources and markets.\nIn 1982 Mauritius's domestic exports and re-exports to South Africa amounted to 0.76 per cent of its total world exports, and by 1987 they had dropped to 0.41 per cent. Our imports from South Africa in 1961 represented 9.6 per cent of our total imports world-wide in 1987 they represented only 8.3 per cent. Investment from South Africa in 1987 was 1.27 per cent of total foreign investment. Only 0.7 per cent of total investment in our export processing zone is South African, 60 per cent being Mauritian. We have diversified cur sources of tourists so that, from 22.6 per cent in 1984, the South African element fell to 14.7 per cent of total tourist arrivals.\nMauritius has a very fragile economy - being a small island State with no mineral resources, and being distant from markets and min sea routes. Despite these constraints, my Government, supported by the people of Mauritius, is, I repeat, actively diversifying away from South Africa, in accordance with our commitment to the United Nations, the Commonwealth and the Organization of African Unity.\nThe question of Palestine has remained on the agenda of the General Assembly since the founding of the United Nations, and still defies a just and equitable solution. Such a solution can only be found within the framework of a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East situation, based on Israel's total withdrawal from all the territories occupied since 1967 and the restoration of all the rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to return to their homeland, the right to self-determination and the right to establish their own independent and sovereign State on their national territory. We therefore support the speedy convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nMy Government rejoices that both Iraq and Iran have agreed to go to the negotiating table, thanks to the persevering efforts and diplomatic finesse displayed by the United Nations Secretary-General and his tireless staff. We pray that the efforts of the Secretary-General will pave the way for a peaceful settlement in that war-torn and ravaged area.\nWe also welcome the efforts of the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in their quest for a comprehensive political settlement to the problem of Kampuchea. All foreign intervention and military occupation should be brought to an end without further delay. The incessant flow of refugees from that country has created tensions and security problems in neighbouring states. The recent Jakarta informal meeting, held in the city of Bogor from 25 to 28 July 1988, is no doubt a starting-point for a peace process that can lead to the restoration of the sovereign, independent, and neutral and non-aligned status of Kampuchea. \nWe welcome the recent Geneva Agreements as a major step towards the restoration of peace in Afghanistan, This is an achievement that must be credited to the United Nations and especially to its Secretary-General. I pay a tribute also to the understanding shown by the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\nThe Korean people are also eagerly awaiting the peaceful reunification of their country. We hope that through dialogue the people of Korea, both North and South, will soon join the rest of the international community in the United Nations,\nOn the subject of human rights, my Government views with great concern the instances of violation of human and democratic rights, the enactment of the coercive internal security decree, and above all the systemic harassment of an ethnic group in Fiji. We appeal for the immediate restoration of the process of national reconciliation. Let the Government of Fiji show that it is motivated by a sense of fair play and universal justice and by tolerance and harmony.\nSimilarly, we hope that reason will prevail and that tensions in such troubled areas as Cyprus, Lebanon and Central America will give way to peace and stability. For nearly ten years now the world economy has stagnated, causing the slowing down and reversal of development, high unemployment and gruesome poverty. World trade is dominated by sharp currency fluctuations, trade imbalances between the major market economies and the debt-burdened developing countries. The 1988 World Economic Survey prepared by the United Nations has forecast that growth is expected to fall in 1989, The Survey goes on to say that, while economic growth among developing countries varied greatly last year, affected by foreign debt, decreasing overseas earnings and difficulties in orienting policies towards economic stability, growth slowed down for the developing countries, mostly in Africa and Latin America, where per capita output is continuing to fall. \nMy Government supports the call by the Heads of State or Government of the seven major industrial nations and the President of the Commission, of the European Communities at the recent Toronto economic summit, for relief for developing countries whose economic growth is paralysed by external debt. In 1987, the amount transferred to foreign creditors abroad in interest and repayments outpaced new lending and absorbed resources needed for domestic investments. Several countries have accumulated significant arrears to official creditors. The International Monetary Fund (IMP) alone was owed 32 billion in 1987.\nThe performance of developing countries is important to the world economy. Central to the prospects of the developing countries are a healthy global environment and an open trading system, adequate financial flows and also their commitment to appropriate economic reforms. The problems of many heavily indebted developing countries are a cause of economic and political concern and can be a threat to political stability in the developing countries themselves. Many indebted countries have begun the difficult process of macro-economic adjustment and structural reform necessary for sustained progress. My Government urges an increase in concessional resource flows to help the poorest developing countries resume sustained growth, especially in cases where it is extremely difficult for them to service their debts. Protectionist measures, particularly in large developed countries, should be removed without delay so that a more favourable environment can be built for accelerated growth in international trade.\nA large number of States of Africa, Latin America and Asia are still burdened with the problem of debt. The recent disorders in the stock exchange, which have resulted in sudden losses much more substantial that the total debt accumulated over the years by African countries, have revealed the vulnerability of even the most powerful economies. It is indeed paradoxical and anomalous that African States, which are endowed with a wealth of human, natural, spiritual and material resources, should, after two or three decades of independence, have turned into an exporter of capital and human technology, into importers of foreign expertise, of inappropriate technology or food they can produce, of goods that are meant to satisfy artificial needs created from abroad, in a word, that they should have turned into importers of catastrophes and frustration.\nThe international community has a great responsibility in contributing to the solution of our debt crisis. The debt-distressed countries that are most severely handicapped should receive special attention and should be the object of special measures of a concessional nature, of an increased flow of resources, and of reduced interest rates. It is also important that the praiseworthy example of donor countries which have written off public loans or converted them into grants should be more widely followed. At the same time, there is a need to ensure that solutions to the debt crisis do not reinforce the political, economic and technological dependence of the affected countries.\nWe support the recommendations in the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, which was so ably chaired by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway. Threats to the environment recognize no boundaries. International co-operation among all countries is required if we are to return to a healthy environment. Urgent action is needed to save the world from a global climatic change, from air, sea and fresh-water pollution, from acid rain, hazardous substances, deforestation and toxic waste. Mauritius deplores the actions of several unscrupulous companies which have tried to obtain facilities for dumping toxic industrial wastes in various African States. The States involved are for the most part western African States whose Governments have no separate portfolio for environmental affairs.\nIt is a matter of great concern, and not only on humanitarian grounds, it is not a question of a trade-off between growth and development on the one hand and environmental issues on the other. It has to be seen in its true context, that is to say, as being as urgent as problems of chronic indebtedness and food scarcities, if not more so. The presence of radio-active and other toxic wastes on African soil is definitely detrimental to future development programmes and to the future use of natural resources.\nWe unreservedly support the resolution adopted by the Conference of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held at Addis Ababa, which condemned the use of African States as dumping grounds by the more industrialized countries, under whatever financial terms proposed. We call upon the international community to take vigorous steps to exercise surveillance in order to prevent the recurrence of such reprehensible and irresponsible acts and to assist the affected States in the rehabilitation of their natural environment.\nThe rich developed countries should show greater concern for vulnerable small island States which are saddled with problems of development. In addition to our limited resources and capacity for autonomous development, we are far from international markets and heavily dependent upon them. There is therefore an urgent need to ensure stability in these markets, especially in respect of our commodities and manufactured goods. We therefore appeal to our trading partners in the North to remove all trade barriers and to do away with all protectionist measures which adversely affect the development of our economy. \nMauritius is actively beginning to develop regional co-operation with other countries of the Indian Ocean and member States of the Preferential Trade Area with a view to achieving greater collective self-reliance through the improvement of our trade exchanges and the setting up of intra-regional projects. In that context, we appreciate the generous assistance rapidly made available by friendly countries and international organizations so that regional co-operation nay become viable and meaningful.\nThe illegal use of and illicit trafficking in drugs threaten the well-being of mankind. There is an urgent need for improved international co-operation to counter all facets of the illicit drug problem, in particular production, trafficking and the financing of the drug trade. My Government has adopted tough laws to confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers and to prevent money laundering.\nAlthough the great eighteenth-century English philosopher Hobbes said in his Leviathan that man's life is short, nasty and brutish, we, after going through the catalogue of problems and misfortunes besetting the world, have every reason to see the light at the end of the tunnel. There is cause for satisfaction and contentment in the knowledge that recent events in northern Africa, in Afghanistan, in the Gulf region, in the field of disarmament, at the Berlin conference of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and elsewhere have taken the upward path of sanity. Above all, there is the sudden consciousness that man's destiny is the survival of the species.\nOur people are peace-loving and are dedicated to the cause of peace at home and an enduring peace in the world. Our people uphold human rights and dignity. Our people uphold democratic values, principles and practices, and freedom of association, of conscience and of speech. Our people also believe in the sanctity of human life, in unity at home and in the world, and in the splendour and richness of diversity. Our people also believe in one world and in man, and believe that we should constantly search for truth and concentrate on all the common good that binds all of us on our planet Earth and that should bind all in our common endeavour to work for a better, safer and happier world. We also believe that we have come - and that all should come - to the United Nations not to save face but to save lives.\nArmed with that conviction, let me conclude my address on this note of optimism and good cheer that tomorrow a better world will dawn.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI am pleased to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo the heartfelt congratulation of the delegation of Niger on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. His election is a well-deserved tribute to a seasoned politician and a talented, experienced diplomat. It is also testimony to the Assembly's recognition of the positive role played by his country, Argentina, in international affairs.\nNaturally, we wish also to congratulate the other members of the Bureau. I am confident that under his guidance our work will be successful, and I wish to assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation.\nThe change in world affairs since the previous session of our Assembly is a source of satisfaction because of prospects for the settlement of conflicts. Nevertheless, there are still grounds for concern.\nIn Africa, the racist Pretoria regime continues to defy the international community and to disregard all decisions taken by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) demanding the abolition of apartheid and independence for Namibia. \nNiger has been closely following efforts being made in southern Africa to set in motion, as of 1 November 1988, the process of independence for the Territory of Namibia, in keeping with Security Council resolution 435 (1978), and to find a comprehensive solution to the conflict between Angola and South Africa that has been going on for so many years. My country is not only very interested in the ongoing talks between the parties concerned but also particularly hopeful that they will lead to a lasting agreement.\nHowever, given the fact that South Africa has time and again presented the international community with underhanded manoeuvres, delaying tactics and other repeated about-turns, Niger is suspicious and intends to maintain vigil, ice\u00b7, hence it calls upon the Assembly to keep up constant pressure on that country until it heeds reason and complies with its decisions.\nWithin South Africa itself, Niger will continue to demand the dismantlement of the abhorrent policy of apartheid and the unconditional release of all political prisoners, including in particular Nelson Mandela. Finally, my country reiterates its support for the just, legitimate struggle of the freedom fighters of the African National Congress (ANC), the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO).\nIn the far eastern part of our continent, the Horn of Africa is starting to enjoy a climate of peace and security. We hope that guns will forever be silent in that region and that reconciliation and mutual trust will be strengthened between the fraternal peoples concerned.\nIn Chad, an area of peace is being established. Niger is both relieved and gratified, for it has always called for dialogue and a return to negotiation. My country hopes that the ground swell of peace we are witnessing throughout the world will reach Africa too, and in particular Chad. In this respect, we are very happy to enter the process of normalization of relations between Chad and Libya, which was initiated by the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries. In the far west of Africa, a serious problem still persists: I refer to the conflict in the Western Sahara between peoples whose origin, history, culture and religion have tended to bring them closer towards unity.\nThe Government and the people of Niger have been following with keen interest the diplomatic efforts made in the region to narrow the Moroccan and Algerian positions on the one hand and to have Morocco and the POLISARIO accept, on the other. United Nations proposals on the organization of a referendum on self-determination \nWe invite the opposing parties to avoid any action that might compromise the current peace process and to redouble contacts to narrow their differences.\nAccordingly, we exhort all parties to continue to trust in our messenger of peace, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, and to give him their full co-operation.\nThere is another source of concern in Africa that cannot be ignored. I refer o the 6 million refugees and other displaced persons and to the fact that their number is constantly increasing. \nThe plight of these unfortunate people deserves special attention by the General Assembly; this tragic situation cries out to the conscience of the world. We sincerely hope that recommendations adopted on this question, especially those adopted at the recent Oslo conference, will be implemented as soon as possible in order to end forthwith the untold daily suffering of these throngs of exiles.\nIn the rest of the world, other threats to international peace and security continue to be of concern. Of these, the foremost is the Iran-Iraq war, which is among the most fratricidal since the end of the Second World War and has lasted eight long years. Niger has followed, supported and encouraged the efforts of the United Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and, especially, the Secretary-General, Mr, Javier Perez de Cuellar, towards the conclusion and signature of a cease-fire agreement between the belligerents, followed by the convening of peace negotiations. My country is happy that Iran and Iraq have accepted Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as a basis for preliminary negotiations in Geneva.\nMy country appeals to those two members of the Islamic union to put aside past rancour and continue to show a political will as determined as that which led to the cease-fire, with a view to attaining the ultimate goal, which continues to be peace.\nAnother deadly conflict, that in Afghanistan, is also of concern to us. But the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of that country that began a few months ago following the 14 April 1988 Geneva agreement between the super- \u00b7 Powers, reached under the auspices of the Secretary-General, is a sign that peace will soon return to that country. Niger encourages Mr. Perez de Cuellar to continue his efforts to enable the Afghan people freely to exercise their right to self-determination. \nTurning to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Niger regrets that peace remains remote. There is a reason for this Israel's continued total disregard for the many United Nations resolutions rejecting and condemning the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories as well as the alteration of their demographic nature and their legal, cultural and religious status.\nWe in Niger are convinced that an overall just and lasting settlement of the Israel-Palestinian problem necessitates scrupulous respect for Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which recognize, inter alia, the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\nIt goes without saying that Niger also supports the idea of convening, under United Nations auspices, an international conference on peace in the Middle East with the participation on an equal footing of all parties to the conflict.\nThe situation in Lebanon is worrisome. That country has been ravaged by war for almost It years. Niger believes that an end to outside interference, particularly by Israel, could help end bloody confrontation and enable the Lebanese people to restore their unity.\nIn South-East Asia, the Korean peninsula has been in a state of neither war nor peace since the 1953 armistice. We hope that all countries that, like Niger, have relations of friendship and co-operation both with the Republic of Korea and with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will step up their efforts to help them bring about a peaceful reunification of their country.\nIn that same region, we continue to follow closely the situation in Kampuchea, whose people is struggling for self-determination and liberation from foreign domination. In Kampuchea as in Afghanistan we condemn the illegal occupation of territories by foreign troops in violation of the norms of international law. The national independence and non-aligned status of that country must of necessity he safeguarded and guaranteed by the international community. \nLet me say a few words about disarmament. Niger is pleased that the two super-Powers were able to conclude an agreement on the dismantling and destruction of a category of missiles. For our part, we hope that all weapons ~ nuclear, biological or chemical - will be covered by a future treaty prohibiting them once and for all. Only this will bring peace and security to mankind.\nMy delegation believes further that it would be pointless to destroy the weapons amassed on our beloved planet Earth if the arms race were to be moved to outer space and pursued there. Disarmament is the concern of all States, so let us mobilise all our efforts and resources to protect the human race.\nWith respect to the economy, we wish to say that the gap between the rich industrialized countries and the countries said to be developing is widening. Recently a conference was held at New York under United Nations auspices to carry out a mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, adopted in 1986. It noted that political measures and initiatives under the Programme have not yet resulted in any economic recovery for African States, which despite the expense have instituted structural adjustment measures and economic reform programmes.\nTo permit economic growth in developing countries in general, and in the poorest countries of Africa in particular, we believe the international community should continue action on the three fronts of debt, trade and raw materials and on the development of human resources.\nWith respect to debt, the crushing burden of debt servicing constitutes a brake on the development of our States. We believe that sustained joint effort involving a comprehensive, honest view of the problem by all is the only way to bring creditor and debtor countries together for a more just and equitable solution in keeping with the spirit and letter of the recommendations set out in resolution 42/198 and the decision of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\nUnfortunately, the damaging effects on our countries of the world economic crisis are not the only difficulties our hard-working peoples have had to face. Many disasters - drought, desertification, flooding, infestations of locusts and jerboas, and cyclones - hit us year after year, reducing to naught all our efforts and sacrifices in the name of self-sufficiency.\nIn Niger our rural populations face adversity with dignity and courage. Their efforts alone, unfortunately, are not enough to let them overcome these terrible disasters, and support from the international community is indispensable.\nNiger cannot remain silent but must highlight the important and very worrying question of the toxic and radioactive industrial waste that is dumped in Africa, secretly and criminally. As members know, this question was thoroughly discussed in June 1988 at the Organization of African Unity, which recommended finding a solution through negotiations with the industrialized nations responsible for exporting these dangerous wastes.\nNiger intends vigorously to denounce and condemn this reckless behaviour and to demand a halt to all transfers of toxic wastes to our continent. Africa cannot let itself be turned into a dumping ground: the survival of our peoples is at stake. The question of human rights has always been a major concern of this Assembly. The United Nations has spared no sacrifice to promote, defend and guarantee human rights throughout the world. The fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which we are celebrating at the end of the year, should be an opportunity for us all solemnly to reiterate our unswerving, irreversible commitment to the noble principles and ideals of that Declaration. Niger will do so unreservedly because it is enjoying an era of freedom thanks to our Head of State, General Ali Saibou. Since his accession to the Supreme Court in November 1987, he has taken important steps attesting to his determination to promote and guarantee public rights and freedoms. These include the release of all political detainees; the proclamation of a general amnesty authorizing the return to their homes of all citizens of Niger exiled abroad for political reasons; acceleration of the process of constitutional normalization; and, finally, the establishment of a national movement for society in development which, according to the Head of State, will be \\\"a special forum for political expression within which citizens of Niger, men and women, will fight to reaffirm and defend their political, economic and social rights\\\".\nThe United Nations, in addition to being an instrument for promoting and defending human rights, nations and people, is a special, irreplaceable instrument for the guarantee of international peace and security.\nNiger therefore believes that it is the duty of all Members of this Organization to give it unreserved support. As far as we are concerned, we intend to do so despite the enormous difficulties we have to confront, and we fully intend to respect the commitments we have entered into as a sovereign State.\nWith regard to the recent successes of our Organization under the stewardship of our very competent indefatigable Secretary-General, Niger does not hesitate to issue an urgent appeal to all Member States to meet their financial obligations under the Charter thereby renewing their full confidence in the Organization.\nThis gesture is particularly necessary since the United Nations has quite rightly just been awarded the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize for 1988 thanks to the exemplary devotion of the peace-keeping forces. Peace obviously has a price that is a fact we must all accept.\nAllow me now to convey to Mr. Perez de Cuellar the admiration of Niger for his diplomatic successes in various delicate missions in the service of peace and international solidarity. They certainly redound to the honour of our Organization. We would simply say to him, \\\"Thank you\\\".\nIn conclusion; Niger hopes the United Nations will continue to enjoy the trust and constant support of all Members so that it can better discharge its noble and lofty mission of the promotion of peace, co-operation and international solidarity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI consider it a great privilege to convey to the President, on behalf of the delegation of Pakistan, our sincere congratulations on his election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation looks forward to working under his guidance to ensure the success of this session. The many complex issues on its agenda demand the qualities of leadership, diplomatic skill and experience which the President so indisputably commands.\nMay I also convey our deep appreciation, through the President, to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, the Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, who conducted the forty-second session of the General Assembly in an exemplary manner.\nThe delegation of Pakistan welcomes yet another occasion to extend heartiest congratulations to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his dedicated efforts and tireless endeavours, year after year, to promote the aims and objectives of this Organization in strengthening the foundations of peace and security around the globe.\nHis faith in the role of this Organization as an instrument of international peace and security has never wavered. No challenge, howsoever grave or forbidding, has ever dimmed his resolve or led him to doubt the capacity of the United Nations to meet it. The fruits of his patience and perseverance are manifest. They bring the United Nations to the centre of the world stage, where it clearly belongs and where conflicts that appeared intractable are moving towards solutions through the direct or indirect efforts of its Secretary-General.\nThe forty-third session of the General Assembly promises to be more productive and more lively than those that preceded it. Profound changes have taken place in the world situation and we are keenly aware of the contribution which the United Nations has made to the improvement of the international climate. No one was more conscious of this welcome trend than our late President Mohammad 7ia-ul-Hact. He had made up his mind to lead the Pakistan delegation himself to pay a personal tribute to the Secretary-General and to this Organization in a year when a wave of peace was steadily moving across the globe and controlling the fires of conflict and confrontation. Alas, we lost President Zia-ul-Haa in \u0430 tragic incident before he could fulfil his desire.\nAs we look around we see dramatic reversals of the proposition that political problems can be solved by the use of military force. Our international system itself offers the strongest disincentive to adventures of this kind. Indeed, the war weariness and attrition that attend protracted conflicts have provided a fresh impulse to the peace-keeping instruments of the United Nations. There is a resurgence of faith in this Organization and a new commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Welcome signs of support to the United Nations are emerging from those powerful sources that can either help to build it into a genuine instrument of international peace and security or to relegate it to the hack water of a forum for rhetoric and sterile debate. It was the Secretary-General who said in one of his earlier reports that a modicum of co-operation between the super-Powers was indispensable for the smooth functioning of this world Organization. \nIt appears to us that a beginning has been made towards the kind of co-operation between the two super-Powers that the Secretary-General had in view. The world situation has greatly improved as a result of the summit meetings between President Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The United Nations is already a beneficiary of the lowering of tensions between the two super-Powers. The signing of the Treaty between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is a historic achievement which needs to be celebrated and applauded by the international community. It marks the beginning of a great forward movement in the collective effort to rid our planet of the prospect of annihilation in a nuclear holocaust and to reduce, if not eliminate, conventional armaments, everywhere.\nThis could be a memorable year for the United Nations. All of us, and the Secretary-General in particular, can take legitimate pride in its crucial role in contributing to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, in bringing about a truce between Iran and Iraq, in the emerging settlement in Namibia and in promising developments in Kampuchea, Western Sahara, Central America and Cyprus. We hope that the time is not far off when the seemingly intractable problems of the Middle East will also succumb to an irresistible process of peace which has been set afoot as a result of these achievements.\nWhile we are entitled to welcome and celebrate the ascendancy of the spirit of peace over our globe, we must not forget that many of the peace processes in which our optimism is rooted need continuous and careful tending by this world body if the consummations we so devoutly desire are to be realized.\nIn our immediate neighbourhood, the signing of the Geneva Accord on Afghanistan has laid the foundations of peace in that war-torn land. The entire international community is anxiously awaiting the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops by 15 February next year. We hope that this withdrawal will be completed in accordance with the time-table laid down in the Geneva Agreement.\nThe Secretary-General has rightly observed in his annual report that; \\\"The conclusion of the Geneva Accords in April represented a major stride in the effort to secure a peaceful solution of the situation relating to Afghanistan and provide a basis for the exercise by all Afghans of their right to self-determination.\\\" (A/43/1, p. 2) We must recognize the fact that the Geneva Accords, which address the external aspects of the Afghanistan issue, have not restored peace in that land. The internal conflict continues to rage. Millions of Afghans who took refuge in Pakistan and Iran will not return to their homeland until peace is restored. A comprehensive political settlement of the Afghanistan problem has yet to be achieved. Central to such a settlement is the exercise of the right of the Afghan people to self-determination.\nPakistan has been most profoundly affected by the consequences of the conflict in Afghanistan. It has been host to more than 3 million Afghans who have sought refuge on its soil from the cruel and protracted conflict in their own country. By accommodating these afflicted and courageous people and by providing them food and shelter with generous assistance from the international community, we have tried to fulfil a humanitarian obligation towards a neighbour in distress and agony. The conflict will not end for these refugees and, therefore, not for Pakistan, for their sufferings are our sufferings, until conditions inside Afghanistan permit them to return to their home safely and in dignity. \nWe await anxiously the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and the beginning of the process of intra-Afghan dialogue for the establishment of a broad-based interim government. This alone will make it possible for peace to be restored, enabling the Afghan refugees to return, and the Afghan people to exercise their sacred right to self-determination.\nAfter the loss of over a million Afghan lives and the exodus of more than 5 million Afghan refugees to Pakistan and Iran, a vast effort will be required for the repatriation and rehabilitation of the refugees and for the reconstruction of their war-torn country. We value the appointment of Prince Sadruddin as United Nations Special Co-ordinator for Economic and Humanitarian Assistance to the people of Afghanistan. We trust that this purely humanitarian endeavour will not be used by interested parties for political ends.\nIt is a matter of profound concern to us that our frontiers and airspace have been frequently violated. These violations have continued after the signing of the Geneva Agreements. On several occasions, the intruding aircraft have penetrated deeper than ever into our airspace. About 387 air and ground violations, causing 40 deaths and injuries to 114 persons, have been registered since the coming into effect of the Geneva Accords.\nThe armed incursions have been accompanied by widespread acts of subversion and terrorism. According to an annual survey entitled \\\"Patterns of Global Terrorism 1987\\\", incidents of international terrorism increased by 7 per cent last year, largely as a result of attacks in Pakistan by agents of the Soviet-backed Kabul regime. As many as 259 attacks were conducted inside Pakistan last year alone, killing 264 and wounding 1,069 people. Since the coming into effect of the Geneva Accords there have been nearly 70 further acts of sabotage and subversion, claiming 74 innocent lives and causing injuries to 55 persons. We have a vital stake in the restoration of peace and normalcy to Afghanistan. When peace finally returns, it will have been due to several causes, foremost among them the will and capacity of the people of Afghanistan to resist foreign aggression. The United Nations role in ending the conflict will have been equally important, as will the supportive role of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement and the staunch support of the United States under President Reagan's Administration. Let us also recognize and applaud, across the ravages of a cruel and searing conflict, the bold and constructive contribution of General Secretary Gorbachev to the successful conclusion of the Geneva Accords.\nPakistan signed the Accords in good faith and is committed to their implementation. The United Nations Good Offices Mission for Afghanistan and Pakistan, after a number of inspection visits, has established in its report that no evidence was found of any violations of the Geneva Accords by Pakistan.\nThe Geneva Accords pave the way for a comprehensive settlement of the complex situation inside Afghanistan. Therefore, the United Nations will have a continuing role to play in the unfolding situation until the Accords have been completely implemented, foreign forces have been withdrawn and an intra-Afghan dialogue has produced a broad-based interim Government. The Afghan refugees can then return to their homes and all the people of Afghanistan can freely determine their own future.\nWe are heartened by the fact that the call for the establishment of a broad-based Government in Afghanistan, which was made with the understanding of the four signatories to the Geneva Accords in April this year, was further endorsed by the conference of Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries which was held recently in Nicosia. I take this opportunity to convey to the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Mr. Diego Cordovez, who is now the Foreign Minister of Ecuador, our gratitude for the contribution which they made in working out the Geneva instruments, and for the patience and skill which ensured the signing of the Accords by all the parties concerned last April.\nPakistan was also closely involved, through the Organization of the Islamic Conference, in the promotion of the peace process between Iran and Iraq in the long-drawn-out war which brought so much death and destruction. That is why we join in celebrating today the great success achieved by the Secretary-General in bringing about a cease-fire that will, it Is hoped, pave the way for a comprehensive peace settlement, so that a new chapter of peace, friendship and fraternal co-operation between these two countries can be opened. There was deep anguish in Pakistan while this conflict lasted. As with Afghanistan, so with Iran and Iraq, not only are we close neighbours in a geographical sense, but historically, spiritually and culturally we are tied to them by the strongest bonds.\nThe role of the Secretary-General and the Security Council in bringing about the cessation of hostilities in the Iran-Iraq war was a critical factor. It demonstrated that concerted action by its members could enable the Council to fulfil effectively its primary responsibility under the Charter. We agree with the Secretary-General's observation in his annual report that there are two essentials for continuing success in implementing Security Council resolution 598 (1937); namely, a conviction on the part of the belligerents that genuine peace will provide the opportunity for reconstruction and progress that an uneasy truce cannot; and the continued exertion of its influence by the international community, particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, to bring about a just and lasting solution. \n\nThe eight-year-old Iran-Iraq conflict, which is mercifully coming to an end, was a comparatively short-lived calamity, as against the Arab-Israel conflict that has ravaged the Middle East for more than 4\u03c5 years. Throughout this period women and children of Palestine have demonstrated extraordinary courage and resilience in keeping alight the flame of freedom. The most ruthless use of force by Israel has not extinguished that flame. The people of Palestine are in a state of constant ferment and for as long as their legitimate aspirations have not been fulfilled Israel cannot hope to live in peace.\nThe latest phase of the Palestinian uprising, which began last December, continues unabated. Unless the relevant United Nations resolutions are honoured in letter and spirit, peace in the Middle East will be as elusive in the future as it has been in the past. The people of Pakistan have a deep commitment to the cause of Palestine's freedom - a commitment that is as old as Pakistan itself. We shall continue to uphold the Palestine cause, and we shall work unrelentingly for the restitution of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and nationhood under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (P\u0141O), their sole and legitimate representative.\nThe withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian and Arab territories, including Al Quds Al Sharif, is indispensable to the restoration of peace in that ancient land. We urge the early convening of an international conference, with the participation of all parties concerned, including the PLO, for the realization of a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.\nIt is our fervent hope that the forty-third session of the General Assembly, which is witnessing the resolution of many a regional conflict, will also witness accelerated progress in the resolution of the Middle East question, the oldest unresolved item on the Assembly's agenda. There is a discernible movement towards the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts from Kampuchea to Western Sahara and Namibia.\nWe hope that the Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea will be withdrawn immediately and that the people of that afflicted country, like the people of Afghanistan, will be left to decide their own destiny, without any interference or pressure from external sources. We also hope that this vital question will be resolved by the United Nations in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and with the collective effort and support of all freedom-loving countries.\nWe welcome the signs of progress towards the resolution of festering political problems in Namibia and other parts of southern Africa. Pakistan is committed to the independence of Namibia under the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the sole and authentic voice of the Namibian people, and we will continue to give whole-hearted support to the Namibian people until they have achieved their sovereignty and independence.\nPakistan is equally committed to the eradication of the abominable system of apartheid in South Africa. In our adherence to the Charter of the United Nations lies our commitment to uphold \\\"the dignity and worth of the human person\\\". The inhuman policies and practices of the Pretoria regime and its aggression against the front-line States cannot be tolerated. We salute Nelson Mandela, that redoubtable fighter against apartheid, and demand an immediate end to his long incarceration, which has failed to break his spirit or to weaken his resolve.\nWe also welcome the signs of movement towards a peaceful settlement of the problems in the Central American region. The Guatemala peace accord of last year, initiated by President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, together with the on-going efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group, holds hopeful prospects for peace and stability in that region.\nWe hope that the return of peace in our own part of the world and in the Gulf region will be conducive to improvements in our relations with India. We give special importance to this, while we work for peace and friendly co-operation with all our neighbours, bilaterally as well as in the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). We have taken a number of initiatives to demonstrate our desire for a good-neighbourly and co-operative relationship with India, on the basis of mutual advantage and sovereign equality.\nThe development of friendly relations between Pakistan and India would be greatly facilitated by the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, which continues to hinder the process of normalization of our bilateral relations. We shall continue to seek a peaceful settlement of this problem, in accordance with the Simla Agreement and on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\nThe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation holds great promise for our region. Peace and prosperity can best be ensured through planned co-operation by all its members acting together. Co-operation and joint action would be particularly efficacious in such situations of natural calamity as unfortunately have befallen Bangladesh \\\"n the recent past. We feel the deepest sympathy with and most profound concern for, our brethren in Bangladesh for the grave loss of life and property resulting from the recent inundations, which submerged most of its countryside and agricultural land.\nIndeed, at the third SAARC Summit in Katmandu it was decided to undertake a study of regional measures to preserve our environment and prevent natural disasters. We are convinced that timely action and co-ordinated efforts by the member countries in pursuance of this decision can effectively contribute towards preventing the recurrence of such natural disasters.\nThe on-going super-Power dialogue on arms control and disarmament has produced significant results. We hope that a treaty on reducing strategic nuclear weapons will soon be concluded. We also welcome the current efforts for confidence-building measures between the two major military alliances and for the reduction of their conventional forces.\nThe super-Power bilateral negotiations on disarmament, though important, cannot be a substitute for the multilateral disarmament process. Three months ago the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament debated issues affecting not only the question of peace and security, but also the threat of nuclear annihilation which hangs over mankind. Nearly all the participants underlined the close relationship between disarmament, security and development, and urged the reinvigoration of the multilateral disarmament process, while there were divergences on certain issues, the debate revealed the existence of agreement on many important subjects and an emerging consensus on others.\nIt is now up to the international community to preserve the gains emerging from that special session and to build upon them in order to promote the objectives of general and complete disarmament. In this context, there is a pressing need for such measures as a convention banning chemical weapons, a comprehensive nuclear test ban and the extension of security guarantees to non-nuclear-weapon States, a halt to the development of nuclear weapons, the prohibition of the introduction of new weapon systems, either on land or in the oceans, and the prevention of the arms race in outer space.\nPakistan is deeply concerned by the prospect of nuclear proliferation in South Asia and the introduction of sophisticated weapons and delivery systems in our region. These matters include the stockpiling of fissionable material and the acquisition of nuclear submarines as well as the indigenous production of lethal weapons, such as long-range surface-to-surface missiles, which will upset the regional equilibrium.\nPakistan has made several proposals in the field of nuclear and conventional disarmament in order to avert the dangers of nuclear proliferation and a disastrous arms race in our region. We are convinced that in our quest for general and complete disarmament regional approaches to disarmament hold increasing promise and can contribute effectively to this objective. Pakistan is fully committed to this approach, which we believe is the only viable one in a region that has a long history of tension and conflict. Our proposals, in both the bilateral and the regional contexts, aim at allaying the mistrust and suspicion about each other's intentions and capabilities and at fostering a climate of good will and understanding, so necessary for the promotion of the well-being of our peoples.\nThe international economic situation, particularly for the developing countries, remains a cause of concern. The 1980s are shaping up as a lost development decade. Hunger, disease and poverty continue to stalk entire continents. The living standards of many poor countries have dramatically declined. Their debt problem is increasing with the passage of time.\nIt is important to seek concerted solutions to the international economic problems. The results of the United Nations efforts in this direction need to be carefully assessed so as to evolve a fresh agreed approach at the multilateral level, revive growth and development and address the problems of the developing countries, including the issues of trade, finance and debt, and monetary reform. \nThe growing interdependence of the global economy underscores the paramount need to establish a long-term perspective for international economic collaboration. My delegation fully supports the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council calling for the initiation of a comprehensive process for the preparation of an international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade, and the proposal of the Group of 77 to convene a special session of the General Assembly by 1990 to revive growth and development in the developing countries.\nThe co-operation between the two super-Powers, which has been instrumental in laying the foundation of a significant process of disarmament, will, no doubt, have an impact on the roles they play at the United Nations. In a refreshing approach to the United Nations, General Secretary Gorbachev has singled it out for praise, and the Soviet Union has decided to pay the arrears in its contribution to the Organization's peace-keeping forces. There are signs of a similar revision of the United States policy towards the payment of the arrears to the United Nations budget. Financial support to the United Nations in this critical year is indispensable. It would indeed be tragic if, at a moment when the Organization is poised to accomplish important missions for peace which would restore humanity's faith in it, the denial of resources should cripple its efforts and deprive it of the opportunity of achieving its purposes and goals.\nIt is a good augury that both super-Powers as well as other permanent members of the Security Council and the general membership of the United Nations wish to see the United Nations strengthened, at the end of a lean period induced by super-Power rivalry. The recent successes of the United Nations in dealing with regional conflicts owe a great deal to the process of dialogue, and even a degree of convergence on certain issues, which has developed between the two super-Powers\nThe prospects for peace in many parts of the world - most conspicuously in Afghanistan, southern Africa, Western Sahara, Kampuchea and the Gulf region - have brought unprecedented credibility to the United Nations system and to the future role of the United Nations in promoting international peace and security.\nThere is a new consciousness that the United Nations is the best instrument for forging a sound international partnership for peace and progress. It is the only forum through which the moral, intellectual, political, cultural and scientific resources of all States can be combined for the benefit of mankind. As the Secretary-General says in his annual report: \\\"Multilateralism has proved itself far more capable of inspiring confidence and achieving results than any of its alternatives. Millions around the world have had a gratifying demonstration of the potential of the Organization and the validity of the hopes they place in it.\\\" (\u0100/43/1, p. 2) Towards the end of a decade marked by conflict and convulsion and often clouded by cynicism and despair, we have reason to look to the future with confidence and consolation. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI take pleasure in greeting the members of the Assembly on behalf of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of the Republic of Mall.\nIt is also a pleasure, Sir, to congratulate you warmly on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. Your personal qualities and the wealth of experience that has won the confidence of the Assembly guarantee the success of the work of this session. I take this opportunity to extend my warmest congratulations to your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, on his effectiveness in guiding the work of the Assembly at its forty-second session.\nI wish also to express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, our great appreciation of his untiring efforts to promote the ideals of the United Nations and of his bold initiatives designed to improve the performance of the United Nations and find appropriate solutions to some of the political and economic problems that afflict mankind.\nThe recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is a confirmation of the relevance of the ideals of our Organization and a recognition of its merits.\nThe United Nations is the embodiment of our common will to unite our forces and harmonize our efforts to fulfil man's profound aspiration to peace, freedom and well-being. The Charter contains the rules of conduct that should enable us to achieve those ideals, namely t the non-use of force, good neighbourliness, the peaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, respect for fundamental human rights and solidarity and mutual assistance among peoples.\nA quick look at the international scene shows that we are still far from achieving those ideals. The Charter is continually violated. Hotbeds of tension and wars persist on the planet. Material, moral and intellectual poverty continue to be the lot of millions of persons throughout the world. Fundamental human rights are still flouted as a result of colonialism and racism.\nThe most flagrant violation of the Charter is taking place in the southern part of Africa. In South Africa 21 million blacks, who make up the overwhelming majority of the population, are denied their most basic rights by a white minority. Treated as foreigners in their own country, 15 million of them have been shunted off to bantustans, those reservations where the aridity of the soil is matched only by the rigours of the climate. To keep them in a state of subjection, an avalanche of savagely repressive acts assails them every day. That is the meaning of apartheid, a policy of hatred and denial of human dignity.\nPushed to the limit by barbaric acts of repression, the black community as a whole has rebelled. It no longer fears death; with bare hands it confronts one of the best equipped police forces and armies in the world. In panic, the racist minority in Pretoria has declared a state of emergency and stepped up acts of repression, torture, arrest, deportation and assassination.\nLet, in spite of all this, the black population is continuing its struggle. The heroic resistance of the blacks of South Africa to the armed forces of the Pretoria racists is the best proof that a people struggling for its freedom is an invincible people.\nThe crystallization of antagonisms in South Africa is creating a situation that threatens a blood bath of terrifying dimensions, which must be prevented in the interest of all South Africans. In this regard, the minority regime of Pretoria should, on the one hand, refrain from any action likely to exacerbate this explosive situation and, on the other, immediately take the following necessary measures end the state of emergency; liberate all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela\u00b7, and put into effect democratic processes designed to achieve a multiracial, egalitarian society in South Africa.\nI take this opportunity to urge States which are in a position to bring the Pretoria Government to reason to use their influence to induce it to implement Security Council resolution 615 (1988), which requests a stay of execution for the Sharpeville Six and the commuting of the death sentence imposed on them.\nThe racist Pretoria Government is carrying out the same inhuman policy of blind repression in Namibia which it has illegally occupied for more than 40 years. Namibia is the only Territory under a mandate to which the relevant provisions of the Charter relating to the freedom of peoples have not been applied. The Security Council and the General Assembly have adopted an impressive number of resolutions and decisions, but their implementation has continually been impeded by the intransigence of the Pretoria Government. The best-known case is that of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The Organization of African Unity is following with particular interest the diplomatic efforts now under way to bring about a definitive solution to the question of Namibia. It supports all sincere efforts whose objective is to enable the Namibian people to regain its independence and to establish peace and security in southern Africa.\nLast August the international community in the context of the Oslo Conference, devoted attention to one of the tragedies resulting from the policy of apartheid of the South African Government - the situation of refugees, repatriated persons and displaced persons in southern Africa. The Conference adopted a plan of action for the provision of assistance to affected peoples and countries in southern Africa and the establishment of lasting peace in the region. We hope that at this session the General Assembly will endorse that plan of action.\nWe take this opportunity to express our more sincere gratitude to the international community for its demonstration of solidarity with Africa during that international Conference and to appeal to it to commit itself to the implementation of that plan of action. There are other conflicts on the African continent, including those concerning the Western Sahara and the Chad-Libya question.\nWith regard to Western Sahara there have been notable developments. With the normalization of relations between the States of the subregion, we hope that efforts already made and those that will be undertaken by the Secretary-General and the Acting Chairman of the Organization of African Unity will result in the near future in the organization in that Territory of an orderly, free and general referendum on self-determination.\nConcerning the Chad-Libya dispute, is new dynamism has fortunately been given to the peace process worked out by the ad hoc committee of the Organization of African Unity following the important initiatives announced by Colonel Mu'Ammar Qaddafi on the twenty-fifth anniversary of our continental organization, and by the very positive reaction of President Hussein Habr\u00e9 to this situation.\nIn the Middle East, the spontaneous and continuing popular uprising of the Palestinians in the occupied territories to put an end to the Israeli occupation is testimony to the indisputable Palestinian reality.\nNo lasting peace can be established in this region without restoring the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people.\nThe Organization of African Unity is convinced that the solution to the Middle East crisis depends on the convening of an international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of all interested parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nWith respect to the conflict in the Gulf, we welcome the crowning of the efforts of the Secretary-General and all those other efforts of good will which culminated in the acceptance of a cease-fire by Iran and Iraq, thus putting an end to eight years of fratricidal war.\nIt is equally gratifying to note the important progress made in the search for a solution to the Afghan problem, following upon the signing of the Geneva agreements on 14 April last.\nIn Asia, we hope that a lasting, negotiated solution to the problem of Kampuchea will soon be found and that the resumption of talks between the North and South of the Korean peninsula will also achieve positive results. In this connection, the proposal for the convening of a joint North-South peace conference on the peaceful reunification of an independent Korea deserves the attention and support of the international community.\nIn Central America, we invite the Support Group to pursue efforts at establishing an atmosphere of peace and harmony in the region.\nGiven the threat of nuclear destruction hanging over the world, the most urgent task for mankind is to promote nuclear disarmament. No people in the world is unaware of this imperative need. That is why the entire international community welcomed the signing, on 8 December 1987, of the Treaty on the Elimination of Medium-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. There cannot be genuine progress in the disarmament process as long as the world continues to live in a cold-war atmosphere. This fundamental truth was highlighted by the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which, owing to the lack of consensus on essential issues, was unable to adopt a final document.\nHence, only by translating our sense of common destiny into action will we be able to resolve the paradox of spending $1,000 billion each year in the production of lethal weapons, while only a fraction of that sum would make our planet a land of prosperity for millions of people who today suffer from illness, hunger, thirst and ignorance. For its part, the Organization of African Unity, at its very first regular session, held in Cairo in June 1964, adopted the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa. That decision was reaffirmed in several resolutions of our continental Organization.\nHowever, while the States members of the Organization of African Unity have been firmly committed to excluding nuclear weapons from our continent, the racist regime in Pretoria has engaged in a frenzied, effort to acquire nuclear weapons. The acquisition of a nuclear strike force by the champions of apartheid would dangerously jeopardize security on our continent. The Security Council must take effective measures to ensure respect for the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa.\nAnother factor threatening the security of Africa is the flooding of our continent with industrial toxic wastes. This activity, a crime against the peoples of Africa is an outrage to international morality. We hope that this issue, which we have asked to have inscribed as an item on the agenda, will be seriously discussed and that strong measures will be adopted with a view to freeing our young countries of the grave dangers inherent in the dumping of the wastes produced as the result of the development of the industrialized countries.\nFrom the time of its birth the Organization of African Unity enshrined in its charter the will of its member States to co-ordinate and harmonize their cultural policies. That decision has been met outstandingly reflected in the adoption of a Cultural Charter for Africa# in which we affirm that, for our peoples, African culture is the surest way to implement harmonious social and economic development and safeguard our great virtues. Indeed, African culture remains an inexhaustible source of our strength and our resistance. Its true significance can be seen in our struggle for political, economic and social liberation, in our struggle for development.\nThe time has come for the international community to grasp the meaning and scope of this concept of development based on values other than simply quantitative and material growth. Several years ago we ardently called for the proclamation of a Decade for Cultural Development. Our request was granted at the forty-first session of the Assembly; and now we need to act so as to ensure that this Decade will not become merely one more decade that does not produce the results expected of it.\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, the objective of \\\"health for all in the year 2000\\\" was proclaimed by the general assembly of the World Health Organization. That ambitious goal was both commendable and within the reach of mankind. The results of the actions undertaken by the African States are significant, but a great deal remains to be done. In order to step up the development process for primary health care and to meet that goal in the year 2000, a new approach known as the Bamako Initiative was set at the 37th meeting of the Committee of African Health Ministers, held in Bamako in September 1987, and adopted by the member States of the Organization of African Unity last May. This is an African strategy within the context of a generalized economic crisis; it calls for the effective commitment of peoples to define and administer their own health problems.\nOn behalf of the women and children of Africa, I should like urgently to appeal to the international community for financial, material and technical support for this bold initiative, whose impact will be of the greatest benefit for all mankind.\nThe international economic situation continues to be of concern. The crisis affects the developing countries in particular; and it is the African continent that has been affected the most. Given this situation, the African countries have firmly committed themselves and mobilized in the search the most appropriate ways and means to overcome the crisis. Thus, the Heads of States or Government of the Organization of African Unity adopted Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery of Africa, with the objective of setting the basis for sustained growth and self-maintained and self-based development at the national and continental levels. This Programme was the subject of special consideration by the General Assembly at its thirteenth special session, which culminated in the adoption of the United Nations Programme for African Recovery and Development for the period 1986-1990.\nThe present session provides us with an opportunity to consider the implementation of this Programme during the past two years and to evaluate efforts to be undertaken to ensure its full implementation. In conformity with the commitment they made within the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development, the African countries have worked out important programmes for economic reform and structural adjustment.\nIn their plans for economic and social development, the majority of the African States have given absolute priority to agricultural development, food security, increased levels of agricultural productivity and production and therefore to food self-sufficiency. The African countries have also begun reforms in the support sectors of agriculture, namely, agro-industry, trade, finance, transportation and communication.\nDespite all these considerable efforts, agricultural production has not increased to the extent we expected. The rates of growth during the period 1985-1986 for the entire African continent were for the most part below those for the period 1984-1985, nor did the situation improve in 1987.\nIn particular, regarding transportation and communication, actions dealt especially with projects designed to step up the implementation of the Decade for Transportation and Communication for Africa, 1978-1988. Evaluation of this Decade, which has just been completed, showed that the objectives of the physical integration of the continent were not fully achieved because of a lack of resources. \nIn the light of the situation the African Governments, in order to complete those efforts begun during the first decade, have proposed to the international community the launching of a second decade of transportation and communication for Africa for the period 1991-2000. It would be desirable for this proposal to be adopted by all and for the development of Africa to serve as a springboard for a contract of international solidarity.\nRegarding trade and finances, actions have been taken to provide good prices for agricultural products. A number of African countries are now guaranteeing minimum prices to producers for foodstuffs and for most agricultural exports. Similarly concrete action has been undertaken to identify and eliminate obstacles to an expansion of trade.\nAnother high priority area of the United Nations Programme is the struggle against drought and desertification. To stop these phenomena, which have created a profound imbalance in our continent between man, crops, cattle and the international environment, resort to appropriate technology is indispensable, which none of our countries can manage alone.\nMoreover, during the last two years, many African countries, already victims of drought, have been stricken by that terrible scourge the invasion of locusts. Various operations, with international assistance, have been carried out to combat these predators. Despite all these factors, in several parts of the continent great swarms of these locusts, whose reproduction was promoted by an exceptionally heavy rainy season, continue to represent a serious threat to future harvests. The international community should pursue and step up its assistance to Africa in its struggle against this scourge.\nIn the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development, the international community has committed itself to giving Africa the necessary financial resources for the implementation of this Programme.\nWe are obliged to note that during the period 1936-1988 despite certain efforts on the part of the international community, the financial flows towards Africa were clearly insufficient. There was an unprecedented decline in public assistance. The international economic environment did not improve as expected. Thus, given the lack of concrete and timely measures to support the efforts made by African countries to restore their communities, the results achieved by African foreign trade during the first two years of the implementation of the United Nations Programme had been disappointing.\nA decline in export earnings has forced the majority of African countries to reduce their imports in particular those production factors which are indispensable for development projects.\nThe problem of external debt is still a topic of the greatest concern. We will recall that at the end of 1987 the Organization of African Unity (OAU) deemed it necessary to convene a special Conference of Heads of State and Government to consider this pressing problem. At the close of that Conference, which was held in Addis Ababa, a declaration was adopted reflecting the joint position of Africa.\nThis document spelt out the development, magnitude, structure and economic consequences of the continent's external debt} it defined a strategy aimed at reducing the burden of the African debt.\nThe Conference expressed the hope that the creditor countries and institutions of Africa would take concrete measures to alleviate the burden of Africa's external debt. In addition, it asked the international community to take into consideration the will clearly expressed by Africa to convene an international conference on the external debt. This international conference should promote the establishment of a constructive dialogue based on the proposals put forward in the joint position on the crisis of Africa's external debt.\nI should like here to reaffirm that the African countries will honour the commitments undertaken under that debt and to insist that our creditors respond to our wish for concerted action and for more harmonious relations.\nIn the search for solutions to the economic problems of Africa, it is important to be aware of the relationship between factors such as financial flows, the level of commodity rates and the foreign debt. Thus it is imperative that integrated measures be adopted to reverse the present tendency which makes the African continent a net exporter of capital.\nTo allow our country to import an import rate that meets the needs for economic recovery and development, the flow of resources towards Africa must, according to the estimates of the Economic Commission for Africa (EGA), significantly increase to achieve the level of 3US 29.7 billion in 1990.\nI should like to take the opportunity provided here to hail the initiatives of the member countries of the Committee for Aid to Development aimed at cancelling part of the debt of the African countries. The international community can and must do better. It must, in particular, demonstrate the necessary political will to implement the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which deal with alleviating the burden of the external debt and transfer of resources.\nWhile recognizing that it bears the main responsibility for its development, Africa is aware that its destiny is closely linked to that of the rest of the world. It is in that spirit of interdependence that I appeal to the international community to provide appropriate, effective support for the efforts now being made by Africa to achieve economic recovery.\nThe year 1988 is the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In a few weeks\u2019 time we shall be celebrating this historic event, which makes a significant stage in our inspiring progress towards that great ideal put forward in the United Nations Charter, proclaiming our faith in fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the human person and the equality of rights of men and women, and nations large and small. This fortieth anniversary therefore, will provide a unique opportunity for reaffirming our confidence and faith in this shared ideal and our firm determination to encourage and ensure universal respect for human rights.\nForty years after the adoption of the Declaration it is high time for the international community to direct its attention to new prospects of creating an environment favourable to the liberation and development of man. The mission assigned to us by the Charter is that of building a radiant future for all peoples and for all men a future of peace, harmony and co-operation.\nI assure Members of the total readiness and full commitment of Africa and all African peoples in the march of the United Nations towards that objective.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI begin by paying tribute to the wisdom of the members of the General Assembly at its forty-third session, who, in electing you President, Sic, have made clear both the deservedly high esteem in which they hold you and the prominent place held by Argentina and, beyond Argentina, by Latin America in today's world.\nI wish to add that I deeply appreciate the great honour of having this opportunity to address the Assembly again.\nHaving just learned, as the Assembly has, the news about the Nobel Peace Prize, I wish immediately to convey my congratulations to the United Nations on the award of the Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces.\nWhen I came to this rostrum five years ago the world was dominated by the East-West confrontation, the proliferation of regional conflicts, the deepening of the gulf between North and South and repeated violations of human tights and the rights of peoples. Have those realities now disappeared? Is our planet decisively turning towards unity and peace? I shall not claim that that is so. In spite of the passing years, I seem to hear too often the same words, the same vain incantations, and to see too often the same hopes being aroused only to end in the  same disillusionment. The expectations of too many peoples remain unfulfilled. Two centuries after the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen there are still many Bastilles to be taken, many liberties to be won, many rights to be safeguarded. But here and there some progress is being seen. What had seemed for ever immovable has begun to move. Will hope come into its own again in the society of men?\nWe know how much we owe to Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev, who have had the intelligence and the courage to have done with the arms race and the escalations of confrontation.\nSimilarly, the adversaries engaged in some regional conflicts - whether they have taken stock of the limits of their action and the attrition of their strength, have changed their appraisal of their people's interests, or have wanted to contribute to the general movement towards the easing of tensions - are trying to disengage themselves from the tragedy they have been living through.\nI wish to express my gratitude to peace-loving men and women everywhere who have worked ceaselessly to bring about such a result. Among them I should mention the name of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar. Without his skill, his persistence, his constant readiness to serve and his cultural resources, we should not have come this far.\nFor the first time since the last World War the two greatest Powers have begun to explore the path of disarmament. It must be stated that their agreement on the elimination of United States and Soviet intermediate forces in Europe is a good agreement. On behalf of France, I unhesitatingly approved it from the very first day. It is now my expectation that the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will make progress in the reduction of their strategic nuclear armaments, as they have planned to do. If the negotiations they are conducting lead to agreements consistent with the imperative rules of balance and verification this will do much to strengthen the security of all.\nThese questions are, of course, of tremendous importance. But it will be readily understood that, as the head of a European State, I attach priority to the reduction of the conventional armaments which are stockpiled in Europe, and stockpiled unequally, to the disadvantage of Western Europe. It is my earnest hope that the 35 participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will take up the substance of these negotiations as soon as possible.\nWe have been offered an opportunity, unprecedented in the past half century, to ensure the establishment of a stable balance at a lower, sufficient and reasonable level of armaments. Will this balance be achieved? That will depend on the political will of the States involved. But who could assume the responsibility of rejecting this chance out of hand?\nThe objective is easy to formulate: that everyone should be able to defend himself, as is his right, without threatening anyone else. But how shall we go about this? I venture to suggest some elements of an answer.\nFirst, by ensuring that no army and no coalition of armies in the area where East and West are facing each other has the means for the sudden launching of a surprise attack, nor for waging a prolonged war. To that end, it would be desirable to arrange measures in that area for the reduction, withdrawal and de-concentration of troops and equipment - tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery, portable bridges and all other techniques for crossing water barriers - and measures for the limitation of reserves and stockpiles.\nSecondly, by preparing procedures for verification and inspection to prevent any violation of treaties. These new measures of transparency and confidence would usefully supplement the arrangements arrived at in Helsinki.\nMy country has taken a number of initiatives concerning the definition of the area in which these constraints would be applied, the ratio between new military equipment and foreign equipment and the ceiling to be set on the basis of an individual country in relation to the whole. It would also be my wish that at the end of the next two years the status of negotiations should be examined. If nothing had been achieved, there would be nothing to prevent people from exercising their freedom. However, a favourable outcome would open vast new prospects for the future of Europe. All of us, Europeans both in the East and in the West, belong to the same continent and derive our heritage from the same culture. History and geography invite us patiently to overcome, by every possible means, for the security of all, the confrontation of hostile blocs.\nAs for chemical weapons, whose ravages we have unfortunately observed in the recent past, we must eliminate them as quickly as possible. What President Reagan said last Monday about this subject was quite right. He expressed himself in lofty and urgent terms, which echoed our own concerns, and in a manner that is all the more timely because his country possesses such weapons. 1 noted with equal interest that the Soviet Union, which also possesses chemical weapons, had supported this proposal.\nThe proposals put forward by France, which has no chemical weapons, are of three Hinds. First of all, my country, the depositary of the Geneva Protocol of 1325, naturally favours a meeting of the 110 signatories to that agreement. The purpose of such a meeting, in our view, would be to solemnly reaffirm the commitment not to use chemical weapons, to prevent their proliferation to encourage new accessions to the Protocol, to improve investigative procedures - in short, to indicate a common desire for the success of the work currently being carried out at Geneva within the context of the Conference on Disarmament. .\nSecondly, my country wants to increase the role of the United Nations in the struggle against the proliferation and the use of chemical weapons. In 1982 Prance was the originator of the resolution enabling the Secretary-General to arrange investigations in those parts of the world where chemical weapons had reportedly been used. This procedure has already confirmed that such weapons have in fact been used. Let us go further: let us create a situation that would make it impossible for any State to use chemical weapons with impunity to settle its external or internal problems. If any State should use them, I think it would become necessary, among other measures, to impose an embargo on all deliveries of products, technologies and, more generally, weapons to that State. For its part, France is ready, after consultation with its partners, to submit a draft resolution to this effect. This would be without prejudice to any sanctions decided upon by the Security Council.\nThe third and last point is the one I particularly wish to stress: we must prohibit not only the use of chemical weapons but also their manufacture. The risks of the normalization and the proliferation of chemical weapons compel us to accelerate our efforts to bring about the destruction of stockpiles, as well as to maintain close supervision of the means that would make it possible to rebuild them.\nIn signing the convention, each State possessing stockpiles of chemical weapons would undertake to destroy them. In the view of experts, this will take several years, and in the meantime the chemical threat will continue to exist. This is why I believe that chemical-weapons factories should be closed as soon as the convention enters into force and, like stockpiles, should b\u00a9 subjected to international surveillance before they are dismantled. France declares its readiness, as of this moment, to renounce under the same conditions - that is to say, as soon as the future convention enters into force - any possibility of producing chemical weapons.\n0\u00a3 course, the banning of chemical weapons could not be imposed on some if others, including the nuclear Powers, retained a clear field for themselves and did not persevere in their desire for nuclear disarmament.\nIn this connection, I recall that in September 1983, speaking from this rostrum, I stated the conditions under which my country would agree to participate, at the proper time, in a nuclear-disarmament conference among the Powers that possess nuclear weapons: a decisive narrowing of the gap between the arsenals of the great Powers and our own\u00b7, a halt in the anti-missile, anti-satellite and anti-submarine weapons race; and correction of the Imbalances In conventional armaments. Today I maintain what I said at that time.\nI would add that limiting the disarmament effort must be extended to space, the common heritage of mankind. That is why France is opposed to an arms race in space but supports the use of space-borne means of control.\nBefore the INF treaty, the importance of which is becoming more apparent every day, and the on-site verification for which it provides - a clause the Importance of which can never be over-emphasized - disarmament negotiations had stalled over this problem. At the special session of the United Nations last June - the third special session devoted to disarmament - my country advocated control by satellite and by automatic surveillance, as well as the so-called routine or challenge on-site inspections. We can now define, on a case-by-case basis, a combination of means of control adapted to each disarmament agreement. But nothing can be done without the political will of States.\nComing now to regional conflicts, I can only welcome the developments in the Gulf, what has been initiated in Afghanistan, and what is expected in the Western Sahara, Cambodia and, perhaps, Cyprus. This is the easier for me because France has always refused to recognize the fait accompli, has ceaselessly condemned terrorist or military intimidation, and has tirelessly pleaded for settlement of conflicts by peaceful means. Far be it from me to underestimate the scope of the progress made in the past few months. I have noted, however, that while the rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union has contributed to the cessation of fighting, it remains insufficient to restore lasting peace, for the underlying causes persist. In this connection, I have noted that this period of diplomatic calm has not reached several parts of the globe; the Middle East, Central America, despite the Arias Plan and the action of the Contadora and Lima Groups, which France supports; and, while there may be some respite now and again, southern Africa, a direct consequence of the intolerable policy of apartheid.\nIt is the responsibility of the international community to consolidate what has been achieved and help extinguish the last retraining pockets of violence. When weapons have fallen silent, so much will remain to be done agreements to guarantee, wounds to staunch, adversaries to reconcile, economies to be rebuilt.\nIt will do no good to shower the work and the person of the Secretary-General with praise, if we are going to withhold our support from him tomorrow. For peace has its prices sending armed troops there, organizing a referendum here, and elsewhere setting up aid for reconstruction. All this has to be financed. I would hate to think that after being so lavish in their war efforts, States, particularly the most powerful, would be tight-fisted when it comes to peace efforts.\nIn Afghanistan no one can ever be satisfied with replacing an international conflict by a civil war. The withdrawal of foreign troops should normally open up the way for the restoration of the sovereignty of that country, the return of refugees and economic reconstruction. But this can only come about with extreme vigilance.\nIt is my wish that the cease-fire between Iraq and Iran will lead, as quickly as possible, to a genuine peace, a settlement of conflicts, the reconstruction of  disaster-stricken areas and the restored freedom of navigation in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.\nPeace is contagious and everyone, the States and the peoples of the region, will reap the benefits. At this time, how can we be unmindful of the fate of a minority which has suffered in a two-fold way, such as the Kurdish people? I hope that renewed conciliation in Western Sahara will prevail. We could believe it today. This will remove an obstacle to the construction of the Greater Maghreb, bringing with it peace and prosperity, a plan of which Prance approves. Here we count upon the wisdom of leaders.\nIn the Middle East, the uprising of Palestinian youth and the decision of King Hussein of Jordan have shown once again that the status quo no longer protects those who are subject to it, those who seek to benefit from it, and that it is increasingly deadly for those who are subjected to it.\nLet us go back to the basic principles of a lasting settlement, as defined by the United Nations. All members are familiar with them. For my part, I outlined them both in the Knesset in Jerusalem and in the Arab capitals. Israel has the right to exist within safe and recognized borders; the Palestinian people are entitled to aspire to a homeland and to take charge of their own destinies.\nIn order to arrive at a peace settlement, which would enshrine these rights, there must be dialogue between the parties. Each side, Israelis and Palestinians, must do its share. Each must be willing to accept for the other what it demands for itself, and each must be able to say this in no uncertain terms. I do understand how difficult it is to take the first step.\nIn order to facilitate dialogue and break down the walls of distrust, the international community must clearly act as an intermediary. A procedure exists: the international conference. It is the only framework within which teal partners can meet and establish bilateral contacts between them. The international conference has become a reference point. Let us make it a reality. I proposed some time ago that a preparatory committee earnestly go about laying the groundwork. Mr. Gorbachev was in agreement with me on this idea. Now the time has come to revive this. I suggest that a diplomatic arrangement be made among the five permanent Members of the Security Council in conjunction with the Secretary-General. This preparatory work should result in recommendations on the organization and calendar of the future conference and recommendations about who its participants will be.\nFrance, of whose ties to Lebanon need not remind the Assembly, will not resign itself to watching that country's independence and unity disintegrate. We call upon the United Nations as a witness to the obstacles which have been placed in the way of the free exercise of the sovereignty of the people. We appeal to the sense of reason of the neighbours of that country. A peaceful, reconciled Lebanon is no threat to anyone. A Lebanon dismembered and the object of conflict and dispute will remain an area of insecurity for us all. Let us urge the Lebanese to draw upon their national pride and patriotism to summon the strength and courage to have faith in their country. I can assure the General Assembly, in any case, that France will remain at the side of those who, in mutual respect, are fighting for a democratic future for Lebanon, as well as its territorial integrity and sovereignty.\nFarther away, towards the Far East, an end to the sufferings of Cambodia is in sight. The decision announced by the Government of Viet Nam to end its intervention, the initiatives of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the actions of such leaders as Prince Norodom Sihanouk may bring us closer to the hour of a political settlement. My country, which facilitated the initial meeting between the Cambodian partners, will continue to work even harder at this, and soon, I hope. We stand ready, if they so wish, to invite the parties involved to meet in Paris in due course.\nAt this point in my address, I wish to tell the General Assembly that nothing seems more important to me, whatever the importance of the subjects I have touched upon this morning - disarmament and the settlement of regional conflicts - nothing, I stress, is more important to me than closing the ever-widening gap between developed and developing countries. The causes of this disparity, as the General Assembly knows, are many: political, social, economic, demographic, financial, and so on. They have become so serious that many are tempted to dismiss all remedies as futile. \nThat is not the case with France. For seven years now - and I am certainly not the only one - I have been repeating that it is in the interests of the North to help the South; that there is no such thing as fate; that man can always master the course of events and that it is urgently necessary to do so. I see in the persistence of the current imbalances the most damaging cause of tremendous unhappiness, a misfortune which, more assuredly than any other danger, will drive the world towards the endless chaos of war, or something even worse.\nNevertheless, International multilateral or bilateral aid is stagnating or receding. France - which, of all the industrially advanced countries, allocates the highest percentage of its gross national product to development aid - believes that it has not yet done its duty. The target of 0.7 per cent remains its ambition. In particular, the debt burden calls for immediate action. \u0386 number of very Interesting Initiatives have been launched by one country or another. For ray part, I suggested to the major industrialized countries at their Toronto meeting this year that they make the terms of repayment considerably easier for the poorest countries. As for France, It has chosen to cancel one third of the debt owed to it by these countries. This significant step is but a beginning.\nFor other heavily indebted countries, particularly In Latin America and Africa, debt also represents an intolerable burden, and in certain cases a threat to democracy. In the face of this situation the International community must show that it can be more realistic and more imaginative. All debts Incurred must be repaid, but the cost of this can be reduced without passing on the burden to the taxpayers of creditor countries.\nThus, last year the United States, in a bold move, guaranteed a proportion of the principal of Mexico's commercial loans. Several countries and many experts have thought of creating a multilateral fund which would lower the cost by guaranteeing interest payments. Various methods of financing this fund have been put forward.\nIn the view of France, the best technique would be to create a fund in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to guarantee the payment of interest charged on certain commercial loans converted into bonds. This fund would lower significantly the finance charges payable by debtor countries and would involve them more actively in world trade.\nIn order to finance this, the developed countries would set aside their share of a new issue of special drawing rights for use by the developing countries. I realize that the implementation of this project would represent a significant legal and financial innovation. It would require lengthy preparatory work and many consultations among creditors and with their debtors. However, this alone would seem to be equal to the challenge.\nBut development requires many other things.  I  would mention the following: stabilizing the export earnings of countries in the southern hemisphere and diversifying and increasing the value of their production - and the Uruguay Round must take these into account; environmental protection, which only a short time ago was endangered by industrial wastes from the North being disposed of in the South - and the international community will have to agree to regulations and the necessary precautions; a massive transfer of technology and know-how from the North to the South - and I would like in this regard to suggest a new approach, modelled on what is known as Europe's EUREKA project, in which Government stimulus, together with initiatives freely undertaken by companies and universities, leads to co-operation on an equal footing. I continue ray brief list: launching major programmes of universal interest which can mobilize our energies to bring help to regions facing catastrophes due to natural causes or the folly of men. I cite as an example the stabilization of the rivers that have been flooding Bangladesh, the cause of a terrible catastrophe, as an appropriate beginning for a project of this kind. France, for its part, is ready to contribute.\nTwo centuries ago France began a revolution that changed the course of history throughout the universe. In doing so, France took a position in the battle which has yet to be won, and is still necessary, for a greater measure of freedom, equality and brotherhood. As we prepare to celebrate this bicentenary, let us defend human rights more fiercely than ever before, from the earliest recognized to the latest: human rights, the rights of peoples, the rights of mankind. Today, in certain emergency situations, in situations of distress or extreme injustice, we should affirm the right of humanitarian assistance.\nEconomic and social progress is the only solid foundation on which to build democracy; the moral weight of public opinion and unflagging vigilance will be its best guarantee.\nSo many people are still being denied their most elementary tights and for so many men, women and children poverty is the only world they know, and the absence of eights is their only horizon.\nSurely the time has come to acknowledge that rights of mankind exist and should be defined. I am thinking of the protection of our natural environment in the face of the sometimes irresponsible requirements of our economy. I was happy to hear the representative of the Soviet Union asking for a plan to be worked out before 1992 on this subject. I am also thinking of the protection of the human species, the ravages of drugs, and the extraordinary possibilities of science, in particular genetics. \nThe conference of Nobel Prize-winners which I convened in 1988 in Paris elected us to the dangers of this. It is not knowledge in itself that is dangerous; it is rather the applications of science that must be controlled, that we must master. Since we are accountable in proportion to the power we now possess in transmitting a natural and genetically intact heritage to our descendants, we must lay the foundations for the ethics of the third millennium.\nI must stop here. Since, with you, I have been looking at the future, I dream of the day when Europe, as it is trying to take shape, will be able to speak here with a single voice, using, as I have just done, the language of peace among nations and confidence in the destiny of humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt gives me great pleasure to extend warm\ncongratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the presidency\nof the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We are meeting at an\nauspicious time when there are encouraging developments on the world political\nscene. I am confident that under his guidance this session will contribute to the\nfurther improvement of the international atmosphere by addressing the issues before\nit with vision and wisdom.\n\nI should like also to pay a tribute to the President of the forty-second session, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, who presided over a\nparticularly busy session, as well as the fifteenth special session of the General\nAssembly. This year we are witnessing a growing and more effective role for the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of regional problems. We hope that the momentum\nfor peace-making efforts will be maintained, so as to contribute to the achievement\nof lasting solutions based on realism and justice.\n\nIn this connection I should like to pay a special tribute to the\nSecretary-General, whose diplomatic skill, patience and resolve we admire. I should like to reaffirm our full support for his untiring efforts in the service of the United Nations. We rejoice at the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations in recognition of the contribution of the Organization to wor1d peace. \n\nThe positive implications of the ongoing dialogue between the United States\nand the Soviet union underline the impact of East-West relations on the\ninternational atmosphere. The international setting today is much more favourable\nin comparison with the early 1980s for making progress on international issues. It\nis important to maintain and build on this trend.\nIn the past 12 months the negotiations between the United States and the\nSoviet Union have started to yield concrete results. The conclusion and\nratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and\nShorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - has been a historic step resulting in the elimination of an entire class of nuclear weapons. An agreement on the substantial reduction of strategic arms between the United States and the Soviet Union would be another fundamental development in the process of nuclear arms control. We welcome the progress made during the Moscow summit meeting with respect to those issues and hope that the entire range of arms control and disarmament issues will continue to be seriously and effectively addressed.\n\n\nThe convening of the third special session of the United Nations General\nAssembly devoted to disarmament last June also provided a welcome opportunity for\nextensive consideration of the issues involved in the arms control field. This\nexercise has been useful in identifying various approaches to the disarmament\nprocess and the different perceptions, interests and priorities of Member States.\n\nIt has confirmed the close relationship between disarmament and the security concerns of all States and the maintenance of international peace and security. Arm control and disarmament constitute a comprehensive process, encompassing nuclear as wall as conventional and chemical weapons. We hope that a convention banning chemical weapons on a global basis, accompanied by effective verification\nmeasures, will be finalized soon. We welcome President Reagan's constructive and\ntimely proposal for the convening of an international conference on this question.\nIt is imperative to keep in sight the integrated nature of the endeavours in the\nvarious fields of arms cont.ro1- The asymmetries between the conventional forces of\nthe two major alliance systems under line the need for addressing the question of\nthe overall strategic relationship in a more comprehensive way_ In this connection\nwe hope that agreement will soon be reached on the mandate of the conventional\nstability talks to be held between the 23 members of the two military alliances.\nThe success of arms control initiatives depends in the first instance on the\nestablishment of an environment of confidence among the parties concerned. I\nshould like to underline in this connection the significance of the measures\nundertaken within the framework of the process of the Conference on security and\nCo-operation in Europe (CSCE). Turkey attaches great importance to the confidence and\nsecurity-building measures adopted at the Stockholm Conference in 1986. We\nhope it will be possible to agree on the mandate of future negotiations among the\n35 States participating in the CSCE in order to expand the results of the Stockholm\nConference.\nConsidering the growing need to extend those efforts to other regions of the\nworld, in order to reduce tensions and enhance stability, a resolution envisaging a\nsimilar process adapted to the special requirements of the Islamic countries was approved at the 17th session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers held\nrecently in Amman.\n\n\nI would be remiss if I did not stress that arms control agreements and\nconfidence-building measures will not suffice if they are not effectively\ncomplemented by respect for fundamental human rights on a global scale. Turkey is\nproud of its record in this respect and on the fortieth anniversary of the adoption\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights I am glad to say that Turkey has been\nthe first country to ratify the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture\nand Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishments, of the Council of Europe. We\nhave also ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\nWe attach particular importance to cultivating peaceful and friendly relations\nwith all our neighbours and the countries of our region. Fully aware of the\ninterrelationship between security and prosperity, we wish to develop closer and\nbetter relations and mutually beneficial co-operation with all of them. We are\nfully committed to the peaceful settlement of existing differences through a\nprocess of substantive and meaningful negotiations.\nFor the first time in history, the Foreign Ministers of the six Balkan\ncountries came together in Belgrade last February to consider the possibilities for\ndeveloping lasting multilateral co-operation. Inter-Balkan friendship and\nco-operation have always been a priority foreign policy objective of Turkey since\nthe early days of our Republic. we are therefore determined to continue to play a\nconstructive and dynamic role in order to contribute to the creation of an\natmosphere of confidence among the Balkan countries. As we stressed in Belgrade,\nrespect for human rights is a prerequisite for the emergence of such an atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\nWith this understanding we have initiated a dialogue with Bulgaria. The\nProtocol that the two parties signed sets out the prerequisites and the mechanism\nfor the normalization of Turkish-Bulgarian relations. Our relations are heavily\naffected by the situation of the Turkish Muslim minority in Bulgaria, a\nhumanitarian question also involving contractual obligations. Both Turkish and\nworld public opinion await a prompt and satisfactory solution to this problem. The\nongoing process has not yet brought about any concrete results. Improved prospects\nfor the Turkish Muslim minority will certainly lead to a new era of friendly and\nco-operative relations between the two countries. We continue to hope that\nBulgaria will take the necessary action to ensure the creation of an atmosphere\nconducive to this end.\nDuring the past year important steps have been taken for bringing regional\nconflicts to an end.\n\nThe Afghanistan talks were successfully concluded with the signing of the\nGeneva Accords in April. Foremost among many factors, the perseverance and the\nsacrifices of the Afghan resistance and the patient efforts of the\nsecretary-General and his Personal Representative made that achievement possible.\n\nPakistan has sheltered millions of Afghan refugees and has been instrumental\nin the shaping of international reaction to the situation in Afghanistan for the\npast eight years. The international community is greatly indebted to Pakistan for\nthose efforts. The creation of the necessary objective conditions for the\nvoluntary return of the Afghan refugees is another important task which has to be\nfaced.\nGrievous devastation has been inflicted upon Afghanistan. A major\ninternational effort will be required for the reconstruction of the country. We\nwelcome the initiative taken by the international community to come to the\nassistance of Afghanistan, and salute the efforts made by Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan\nto co-ordinate international action that has been taken. Turkey intends to\ncontribute substantively to the reconstruction and the economic revitalization of\nAfghanistan following the establishment of a representative Government.\n\nThe cease-fire which has put an end to eight years of suffering between Iran\nand Iraq came as a great relief to the whole world. A special tribute should be\npaid to the secretary-General for his dedicated efforts, which have substantially\ncontributed to bringing about the cease-fire between our two friends and\nneighbours. We welcome the holding of talks between Iran and Iraq and fully\nsupport diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring peace between them. We know that\nthis will be a long and arduous process. As a country which maintains a sustained\nand continuous dialogue with both parties, we are ready to contribute to the best\nof our .ability to the progress of the peace process and to the prohibition of an\natmosphere of understanding and mutual trust.\nThe effects of this conflict have not been limited to the warring parties but\nhave been seriously felt in the whole area. In order to avoid the occurrence of\nsimilar conflicts, intensive efforts should be deployed to create an atmosphere of mutual trust in the region and to re-establish a climate of confidence among the\n countries there.\n\nAs a country respectful of fundamental human rights, Turkey has recently accepted, on purely humanitarian grounds, tens of thousands of persons coming from Iraq and has provided them with food, shelter and medical care. This is not the first time that we have welcomed large numbers of persons on our soil. Our history abounds with similar examples.\n\n\nSince the end of last year Palestinian resistance in the occupied territories has dominated developments in the Middle East. We regard this continuing popular resistance to Israeli occupation as an expression of the long-standing frustration and suffering of the Palestinian people and of their desire to achieve their national aspirations.\n\n\nWe believe that the ongoing uprising is a constant reminder to all the parties concerned, including Israel, and to the world of the urgent need to find a just and lasting solution to the Middle East question. Turkey believes that such a solution can be brought about only on the basis of the withdrawal by Israel from the territories occupied since 1967 and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, including their right to self-determination with all that this implies. Such a solution should also recognize the right of all States in the region to 1ive with in secure and recognized boundaries. We recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian peop1e. For the peace process to be viable, Palestinian participation is indispensable.\n\nWe are closely following the developments engendered by the recent statement\nof His Majesty King Hussein about the severance of the administrative and legal ties between Jordan and the west Bank. That is likely to have an important impact on the Middle East peace process. We shall continue to support all Middle East\npeace initiatives along the lines I have just mentioned. In this context, Turkey\nwould welcome the convening, with the agreement of all the parties concerned, of the International Peace Conference. We are prepared to shoulder our responsibilities in that regard, if so requested.\n\n\n\nThe situation in Lebanon continues to be another source of instability and\nconcern in the Middle East. We are particularly concerned about the difficulties encountered in the Lebanese presidential election. We are hoping that this latest crisis may be overcome by the Lebanese themselves, through legal means and without endangering the country's territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty.\n\n\nI should like to stress also the importance we attach to a prompt solution of\nthe situation in Kampuchea. We are glad to note the positive developments which\nhave taken place in the past few months. The Jakarta Informal Meeting is certainly\nan important beginning and a significant step aimed at putting an end to the armed\nconflict in Kampuchea through the complete withdrawal of foreign troops, so as to\nenable the people of Kampuchea to exercise their right to self-determination and\nachieve national reconciliation. Turkey supports diplomatic activities aimed at\nachieving that objective and pays a tribute to the members of the Association of\nSouth-East Nations (ASEAN) for their efforts; they have worked so hard for the\nreaching of a political settlement in Kampuchea.\n\nIn order to remove confrontation and reduce tensions in eastern Asia, we continue to attach importance to the ongoing search for a meaningful dialogue in the Korean peninsula. The humanitarian approach can be an excellent way to create\nthe favourable climate necessary for achieving progress. Peaceful solutions to the questions between the two sides will, we hope, lead to their eventual representation as full Members of our Organization.\n\nThe deteriorating situation in South Africa, resulting from the inhuman system\nof apartheid, continues to be a source of grave concern. Unfortunately, the\npolitical situation in South Africa has not improved during the past 12 months.\nTensions and violence continue to cause widespread human suffering in that country.\nWe believe that so long as South Africa has not totally abolished its\ninadmissible racial policies, and has not embarked upon a real process of peaceful\ndemocratic change, the international community should maintain its efforts. More\nthan ever before, the situation in South Africa requires firm conviction and\nresolute action on the part of the united Nations.\nThe continuation of the South African occupation of Namibia, an affront to the\nprinciple of self-determination, is another deplorable aspect of the situation in\nsouthern Africa. It is a matter of the deepest regret that the people of Namibia,\n20 years after the adoption of the United Nations plan for the independence of that\nTerritory, have not been able to exercise their inalienable right to\nself-determination.\n\nMy Government is encouraged by the progress reported in the quadripartite talks concerning this question. We welcomed the cease-fire on 10 August 1988 as a\nvital first step in the right direction. We earnestly hope that this development\nwill lead in the near future to the long overdue settlement of the Namibian\nquestion through the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 \na founding member of the United nations Council for Namibia, Turkey will continue to give its full support to the legitimate struggle of the people of Namibia for\nindependence. In this regard, my Government subscribes to the main thrust of the Istanbul Declaration and Call for Action adopted at the end of the Seminar on the\nInternational Responsibility for Namibia's Independence, held in March in my country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Central America, the time that has elapsed since the signing of the peace\nplan put forward by Costa Rica, and the proposals by other Central American\ncountries last year, demonstrate the difficulties and obstacles that exist in the\nsearch for peace. However, we must not lose heart. The search for a peaceful\nsolution must go on. This search began with the Contadora process, the most comprehensive framework for addressing the political and economic problems of that region. We believe that a viable solution must emanate from the region, and I\nwould like to reiterate our support for all the regional efforts towards peace in central America. \n\nWe have always supported the search for a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question through direct negotiations between the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek\nCypriots, under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General. Following the agreement reached in August through the secretary-General's mission of good\noffices, the two sides have embarked upon a new negotiating process. We welcome this development and express our hope that this new round of negotiations will be\nthe beginning of the process of the achievement of a lasting settlement in Cyprus\n\n\nthrough the establishment of a bicommunal, bizonal federation based on the\npolitical equality of the two peoples of the island. We shall pursue our\nconsistent policy of supporting the efforts towards a just and lasting settlement.\nAs we have previously, I wish to stress here also that it is important for all\nthird parties to refrain from taking positions that may undermine the negotiating\nprocess in Cyprus.\nThe situation of refugees throughout the world has assumed alarming\ndimensions. The problem is especially severe in Africa and South-East Asia, and\nurgently needs attention. The plight of the Afghan refugees is still a sombre\nreality despite the Geneva Agreements. Other parts of the world are also plagued\nby similar calamities.\nIn dealing with this problem, a comprehensive approach should be adopted,\ntaking into consideration of the needs of both the refugees themselves and the\ncountries of first refuge. Appropriate international mechanisms to this end should\nbe devised immediately. In this context, I would like to pay a special tribute to\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for his untiring efforts.\n\nIn view of the importance that Turkey attaches to effective international\ncooperation in action against illicit trafficking in and abuse of narcotic drugs,\nwe welcome and support the initiatives undertaken by the United Nations in this\ncrucial area, especially during the last year. In this connection, we subscribe to\nthe proposal made by my colleague Sir Geoffrey Howe to the effect that the\ninternational collU'll1nity should consider adopting measures for the seizure of the\nassets of drug traffickers wherever they are, thus preventing the diversion of\nfunds to the support of such other evils as international terrorism and arms\ntrafficking.\n\n\nAs an outcome of ongoing efforts in this field, a major step will be taken at\nthe end of this year when the conference of plenipotentiaries adopts the new\nconvention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.\nTurkey welcomes this development and expects the convention to be signed and\nratified by a large number of Member states.\nI have to state with profound regret that the threat posed by terrorism to\nevery society and to all facets of international relations has not abated. On the\ncontrary, acts, methods and practices of terrorism, which have been repeatedly and\nunequivocally condemned by this world body, have continued to claim human lives on\nan increasing scale. I feel obliged to remind the Assembly that Turkey has for\nmany years stressed the necessity of effective international co-operation against\nterrorism in all its forms. I have to point out, however, that international\nco-operation is not yet satisfactory.\nI also want to reiterate that there can be no double standard on terrorism.\nAttempts to differentiate between various forms of terrorism can only encourage the\nculprits and lead to new acts of outrage. Those who support or tolerate terrorism\nassume a grave responsibility, whatever their motives. History has shown that\nthose who support, tolerate or provide a haven for terrorism are bound to regret\ntheir short-sighted policies eventually.\nLet me now turn to international economic issues. As the decade of the 1980s\ndraws to an end the time has come for us to concentrate our efforts on policies for\nthe next decade. Careful planning for the 1990s stands out as a necessity for the\ninternational community if it is to fulfill the expectations of coming generations.\nSince the early 19808 the world economy has gone through very serious\ndifficulties. The critical external debt problem, efforts towards structural\nadjustment, widespread protectionist practices and major economic imbalances have been the chief features of this period. The severe problems we have had to face in\nthis decade remain essentially unchanged. However, this rather dismal situation\nshould not cause us to give way to pessimism for the coming years. As economic\nindicators demonstrate, the international outlook is better on balance than it was\nin the early 1980s. The international community is more experienced and has better\ninsight regarding the underlying causes of the current problems.\nRegarding the external debt problem, which has acquired serious dimensions,\nthe increased efforts on the part of debtor and creditor countries, multilateral\ninstitutions and banks to improve the situation are encouraging. On the other\nhand, the shortcomings in the structural adjustment policies of the developing\ncountries, the social costs of such policies and the need to consider them in a\nmore realistic manner are better understood. It is now evident that debtor\ncountries are in need of adequate external financial support as well as easy access\nto international markets to boost their growth on a sustained basis. In this\nrespect, the launching of the Uruguay Round and the ongoing endeavours to\nstrengthen the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are good opportunities\nthat must be seized. Nevertheless, we are convinced that the fate of both the\ntrade negotiations and indebtedness depends to a great extent on the expansionary\nnature of the global environment, and this, in turn, depends on the elimination of\ninternational imbalances and the restoration of higher growth in the industrialized\ncountries.\n\nThe erosion of multilateralism over the past decade has been highly\nnoticeable, despite the growing need to make the international framework more\neffective. In view of the increasing interdependence that transforms national and\nregional economic issues into global issues, we believe that both North and South\nhave much to gain from the rapid restoration of effective multilateral co-operation\nand dialogue on development questions.\nWe regret to see the divisions between North and South. Overcoming those\ndivisions should be the major task of the international community. We know that\nevery country has its own special circumstances as well as different priorities in\nthe implementation of development policies. Many developing countries have a\nvaluable accumulation of experience in the development process, which they can\nusefully share among themselves. In that respect, the middle-income countries\ndeserve special attention. In our view, those countries are in a position to play\na much more helpful role in contributing to the development process of others.\nSince the beginning of this decade 'fur key has been in the process .of\nimplementing measures of economic reform. This new course of action has meant a\nradical departure from previous economic policies away from inward-looking\napproaches g import substitution and excessive State intervention towards a greater\nplay of market forces and increased liberalization of the economy. Despite the\ndifficulties and costs inherent in such programmes, the outcome of this new policy\norientation has been highly encouraging.\nWithin the framework of this new approach, while trying to expand our\nrelations with the developed nations, we have also set a good example of increasing\nSouth-South co-operation. In that context, efforts have been made to enhance\neconomic co-operation among the Islamic countries. There has been a substantial\nincrease in our trade with the Middle Eastern and North African countries.\n\nIn that connection, we have allocated funds for financing technical\nco-operation with 12 African countries. We have also conducted in-plant group\ntraining programmes and provided undergraduate and graduate fellowships in Turkey.\nWe are pleased to see a sharper global focus on African development problems, and\nwe hope that the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery\nand Development 1986-1990 will bear tangible results. For its part, Turkey will\ncontinue to strengthen its co-operation and its economic ties with the African\ncountries.\nThe protection and preservation of our environment is a major task facing the\ninternational community. It is not only an urgent and pressing problem confronting\nus now; it is also a heavy responsibility that we all bear towards future\ngeneration I regret to say that, despite all official and voluntary efforts, the\ndestruction of the environment continues.\nRecently, another alarming development has become increasingly evident. Here\nI refer to the dumping of industrial wastes in developing countries. Various forms\nof waste, including toxic and chemical products and even nuclear waste, have been\nshipped through various channels to developing countries where public opinion is\nthought to be less sensitive to environmental questions. Illicit ways and means\nhave frequently been resorted to in this deadly transfer.\nEven the oceans have not been spared this modern plague. A new kind of piracy\nhas developed, in the form of dumping waste in the high seas where coastal and\ninternational controls cannot easily be exercised.\nWe believe that international conventions with effective control and\nverification measures should be speedily adopted within the framework of the\nGeneral Assembly and competent international organizations such as the United\nNations Environment Programme.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I should like to convey to you. Sir, on behalf of my delegation, my most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session. I am confident that your experience and competence will enable us to achieve the best possible results. Our pleasure at your election is all the greater because you belong to a friendly country which maintains strong relations with ours. In wishing you every success in your difficult task I reassure you that my delegation intends to co-operate closely with you in order to contribute to the success of the session.\nI take this opportunity to express also our appreciation and gratitude to Mr. Peter Florin for his competent, indeed superb, handling of the work of the forty-second session.\nWe wish, too, to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who has made strenuous efforts to strengthen the role of the Organization and played a prominent part in the international efforts which led to the solution of some of the most complex political questions. The forty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the world is beset with crises and new conflicts are added to the old ones. Thanks to the work of our Organization, we are witnessing some positive indications and developments which make us hope for true detente in international relations.\nIn spite of this optimism, we have, as an international gathering, to admit that the actual capability of the Organization suffers from numerous limitations because of the pressures exerted by certain States. Accordingly, it is incumbent on us strongly to support the existence and continuation of the Organization. We should all support its noble purposes, because we believe that it is still the only forum through which the hopes of peace-loving peoples and international peace and security can be realized.\nWe live in an era in which anxiety about our destiny combines with hope for the future. The continuation and viability of the Organization, in spite of difficulties and conspiracies throughout its existence, together with its success in maintaining some level of efficiency and independence, augur well and justify our optimism. On the other hand, the persistence of colonialism and apartheid in Palestine and South Africa, exploitation, oppression, dominance, hegemony and occupation are causes foe anxiety and trepidation. Worse still, poverty, hunger, backwardness and illiteracy have been sources of suffering for roost human beings. The cries of the oppressed, tortured and displaced ring out on high, showering curses on imperialists, racists, opportunists and warmongers. That some regimes based on occupation, usurpation, genocide and apartheid have their place in the world community today and enjoy support clearly proves that some Powers treat the Charter of the Organization with contempt. However, these regimes are given political support and unlimited material support by certain super-Powers. There is no doubt that during the life of the Organisation great historic achievements have been accomplished in the fields of decolonization and resisting fascism and racism but hotbeds of tension still abound in many parts of the world} as new wars and conflicts have broken out the freedom and sovereignty of many States have been threatened, and many peoples have suffered from the scourge of occupation, injustice, hegemony and dependence.\nA quick look at the current international situation and the agenda for this session shows that what has been accomplished so far is not enough, and that what has to be done requires a collective international will to address vigorously the prejudices of the few who refuse to uphold the principles of justice and peace, those imperialists who adopt a policy of force, threats, hegemony and terrorism to achieve their own ends, using all unlawful means, such as war, terrorism, interference in the internal affairs of States, invasion, aggression, occupation and economic blockade.\nA large number of States represented here have been subjected to these practices. I remind the Assembly of the flagrant barbaric aggression perpetrated by the United States of America against my country in the spring of 1986. That aggression was condemned by world public opinion at the time and by the Assembly unanimously in its resolution 41/38 of 20 November 1986, which recognized the right of our people to receive appropriate compensation for the great losses incurred.\nIt gives me pleasure to commend all those States which sponsored or supported that resolution, we take it that their positive and honourable stand not only strengthens our valid position, but also represents a victory for the principles of justice, righteousness and peace enshrined in the Charter of our Organization. As the American attack against Libya is one of the items on the agenda this session, we call upon all peace-loving States to reiterate their condemnation of that aggression and to support the lawful demands of our people to receive immediate and appropriate compensation for the human and material losses incurred.\nIn this connection, we emphasize that the attack should not be regarded as a purely Libyan affair, for it affects the entire international community, inasmuch as it encroaches upon the spirit and principles of the Charter. If Libya fell victim to the aggression then, it was not the first victim, and it will not be the last. That aggression is a link in the chain of persistent American practices against peoples fighting for their freedom, independence and sovereignty. It is also a component of the imperialist scheme that I have just mentioned. It is even a component of the approach of the foreign policy of the United States of America. What is happening in Central America, where the peoples of Panama and Nicaragua are subjected to the vilest kinds of blackmail and threats, provides irrefutable evidence of what I am saying.\nThe Organization's role can be truly strengthened only by a review of provisions of the Charter which have crippled some of the main organs responsible for maintaining international peace and security. Some of those provisions have not kept pace with the profound global changes which have taken place since 1945. The international situation in 1945 was completely different from today. The Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization should be aware of this fact. Its recommendations should be bold with regard to those provisions whose application has hampered the most important role of the Organization. I refer, in particular, to the right of veto enjoyed by a few States, which some of them have exploited to foster aggression, occupation, invasion and terrorism. My country took the initiative in calling for a thorough review of that privilege. It reaffirms its position and calls upon all Member States to consider the issue in an objective manner.\nThe question of Palestine - of the Arab people of Palestine - has absolute priority among my country's concerns. It is the question of an entire people who have been displaced, from their homeland, whose land has been usurped and who are subjected to the worst forms of discrimination, oppression, torture and genocide by a clique that has been assembled, financed armed and supported for that purpose. We share the belief of the Palestinian people, and all peace-loving nations, that the main question in the world today is that of progress and peace - but this cannot be achieved without freedom and justice. There can be no progress without freedom, and no peace without justice.\nHow can we think of progress and peace in a world where the largest State does not hesitate to finance the steady extermination of a tiny people in order to implant an alien in its land, its fields and houses?\nIn the past 40 years this distinguished Assembly, the Security Council and other organs of the United Nations have adopted hundreds of resolutions recognizing the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to return to their country, and to achieve self-determination. In spite of this confirmed international recognition, the Arab Palestinian people are still deprived of all their human and political rights because of the obduracy and arrogance of the occupying racist Zionist entity and these who created and foster it, disregarding all values and treating all instruments with blatant contempt.\nThe persistence of the United States, in particular, in providing unlimited support to this racist regime is the main reason for the continued plight of the Palestinian people.\nThe United States, which is a permanent member of the Security Council and is thus presumed to take the lead in establishing and maintaining international peace and security, is the Power that protects the Zionist entity and defends its membership of the United Nations, in the knowledge that that entity is defending aggression, occupation and falsehood. Accordingly, from our point of view, it remains the main indeed the only, obstacle in the way of all international efforts to find a just solution to the question of Palestine. The great patience of the Palestinian people should not be regarded as gradual recognition of a fait accompli or of submission to it, or as a sign that they have forgotten four decades of injustice and oppression. People have good memories, and falsehood is destined to vanish, however long it may last. Allah, the Almighty, says, in the Glorious Koran:\n\\\"And Allah will wipe out the lie and vindicate the truth by his words,\\\"\nand\n\\\"Nay, but we hurl the true against the false, and it doth break its head and it vanishes.\\\" (The Holy Koran, \u0425XI24 and XXI 118)\nWe have lived to see falsehood armed to the teeth with the most up-to-date and devastating weapons, staggering under the blows of the unarmed Palestinian people, who have nothing with which to fight except the stones of their land, covered with their blood and mixed with the bones of their women and children. It looks as if solid stones long subjected to the injustice of the usurper have risen to acquire the power of bombs and rockets, and the atoms of these stones have come to life. Thus, the uprising of this brave people has shown that deeds speak louder than words. It has stressed to us all that right endows the weak with strength, that the technology of injustice cannot subdue. The Arab poet says:\n\\\"Right at the hands of the just is elevated.\nAs a sword acts when brandished.\nWhatever lies are used to tarnish right.\nIt must one day be seen shining bright.\\\"\nThis uprising has stunned the occupying Power and its supporters. It has reminded everyone of the human tragedy and the grave injustice. It has also underlined the fact that all deals up to now - peace initiatives as well as unilateral agreements - have been unable to provide any basis either for peace or for a just solution. \nWe applaud our Arab people in Palestine for their heroic and honourable stand and their magnificent struggle. We reiterate our complete support for their blessed uprising and place all our capabilities at their disposal. The United Nations, which, nearly 40 years ago, was manipulated by imperialists in an attempt to confer legality on the racist Zionist entity, is called upon today to take concrete measures to remedy its historic blunder.\nWhat is taking place in occupied Palestine cannot be considered in isolation from what is happening in southern Africa,  he Powers that firmly implanted the racist entity in Palestine are the same ones that created the racist regime in southern Africa. The daily racist practices from which the peoples of South Africa and Namibia suffer are the same as those experienced by the Palestinian people. The two regimes are identical. Could it be said. Indeed, that they differ in any way? The establishment of the apartheid regime in South Africa is yet another example of the historical hardships and tragedies to which peoples have been subjected by the colonialist and imperialist movement. The United Nations should shoulder the historic responsibility of combating the evils of apartheid.\nThe problems of Namibia cannot be resolved except by enabling the Namibian people to exercise self-determination and achieve complete independence under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), pursuant to United Nations resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which represents the legal basis of international consensus on Namibian independence.\nThe- Pretoria regime has colonized South Africa and Namibia, oppressed the black majority and striven to exterminate it. It also threatens the security and Integrity of neighbouring African States. It is emulated by its twin regime in occupied Palestine, but it cannot be compelled to yield to the will of the international community except through the application of immediate and comprehensive sanctions. We regard the refusal of certain Powers, and the reluctance of others, to apply sanctions as the main obstacle facing international efforts to put an end to the most abhorrent racist regime in modern history.\nWe in Libya support the just struggle of the peoples of South Africa and Namibia for independence and human dignity. We commend the brave steadfastness of the front-line African States and declare our complete solidarity with them in their efforts to achieve the common goal of putting an end to the apartheid regime in Pretoria.\nThe collaboration between the colonial regimes in Palestine and Pretoria is an undeniable fact of great significance. As this international Assembly condemned the apartheid policy in South Africa as the most odious form of racial discrimination, so it condemned Zionism, regarding it as a form of racism and racial discrimination. This condemnation and this judgement are embodied in the historic General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX), which has been a prominent landmark and an honourable and brave utterance by the United Nations in combating racism and racial discrimination. I refer to that resolution in order to refresh memories in this international assemblage, appeal to its conscience, and urge it to be wide awake so that it may address attempts to obscure the truth and confer justice and goodness on falsehood.\nStrengthening security and co-operation in the Mediterranean Sea zone ranks high among the concerns of my country, which has always supported all regional and international efforts to this end. Our interest in this issue is based on our conviction that the security o\u00a3 the region is related not only to peace, security and co-operation in Europe and Africa, but also to international peace and security. This region has become one of the most dangerous areas of tension in the world# owing to its occupation by certain imperialist Powers which are determined to change it into a permanent base for foreign naval fleets, an arena for provocative military manoeuvres, acts of naval and air piracy and a launching pad for direct aggression against some States bordering on the Mediterranean Sea.\nTrue security and co-operation in the Mediterranean region can be brought about only through the intensification and co-ordination of the efforts by all States bordering on the Sea, through collective measures on their part to call for the immediate withdrawal of foreign fleets and the dismantling of military bases, and through the promotion of dialogue and understanding among all the parties with a view to achieving this end. In this context, we should like to endorse the final communiqu\u00e9 of the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries at their special meeting held in Havana in May 1988. We welcome anew the agreements at Beriouni on the continuation of contacts between the non-aligned countries bordering on the Mediterranean Sea and the European States in that region.\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU), to which we are proud to belong and which is considered one of the largest and most important regional entities in the world, plays an active part in strengthening international peace and security. The peoples of that organization have long-standing historical links to one another and have also been subjected to long and continuous suffering from imperialism, occupation and foreign interference. My country has played a leading role in defending the unity and cohesion of that organization, and has championed the slogan \\\"Africa for Africans\\\". Some imperialist Powers, however, were not happy about this, and worked constantly to cripple the organization and disrupt the ranks of its members. But the African peoples have risen above these manoeuvres, which ultimately failed despite their occasional limited and ephemeral successes.\nOut of this spirit, and from the belief of Libya and its Revolutionary Command that all the problems of the African continent should be solved within it and through its own organization, and out of his awareness of its responsibility for solving internal African problems. Colonel Mu'Ammar Qaddafi, the leader of the Revolution, took the initiative of declaring, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the OAU, Libya's recognition of the present Government of Chad, and expressed Libya's readiness to offer all aid and support to the Chadian people and the restoration of full diplomatic relations between the two countries. This was an indication of our good will and firm determination to forestall all imperialist attempts to escalate the crisis.\nWe would like to assure the General Assembly, and our African brothers in particular, that we abide by what we have already communicated and that a joint communiqu\u00e9 was issued yesterday to restore diplomatic relations with Chad, confirming our willingness to restore peace and co-operation and to settle disputes by peaceful means.\nFor a long time, my country was subjected to abhorrent fascist invasion, occupation and colonization, which cost hundreds of thousands of our inhabitants their lives. It was also an arena for major military operations in the Second World War, during which Libya lost large numbers of innocent civilians. My country still faces the problems of the aftermath of this war as a result of the surplus materiel and mines left by the warring parties on Libyan soil. My country took the initiative of raising this question at the international level a few years ago. Many resolutions were adopted concerning this problem, in which States responsible for deploying this debris were called upon to provide necessary information, help in its removal, and pay for the material and human losses inflicted. Nevertheless, the States concerned have not co-operated in any positive way and are still reluctant to implement the relevant decisions of international forums. We therefore renew our appeal to the international community to take appropriate measures to ensure that an urgent solution to this problem will be found.\nWe are aware of the international community's growing concern at terrorist acts that result in loss of life, and we share its conviction that specific international criteria must be developed to ensure a clear distinction between outright terrorism, which must be eradicated, and the lawful and just struggles of peoples fighting against imperialism, racism and foreign domination and for self-determination and the defence of their freedom, their sovereignty, and their very existence.\nCertain Powers prefer to see legitimate struggle as terrorism, whereas those same Powers are the sources of terrorism unleashed upon peoples as a main ingredient in the imperialistic policies and designs of these Powers. My country, which has constantly and as a matter of principle supported the cause of national liberation throughout the world, has itself fallen victim to State terrorism. Accordingly, we reaffirm our support for the convening of an international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, to define the concept of terrorism.\nWithin the framework of our concern for human rights, and out of our belief in the importance of human freedom and dignity as the main ingredients of progress and development in any society, my country took historic and concrete steps in this field. These steps were crowned by the principal popular conferences in the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya with the proclamation of the Human Rights Document legalizing the true enjoyment of all civil, economic social and cultural rights in the Jamahiriya community.\nWe sincerely hope that these actions will contribute to the strengthening of human rights at the international level, especially as we shall be celebrating during this session of the General Assembly, here in this Hall, the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, an enormous international assemblage encompassing the great majority of the members of the international community, is still a prominent and influential component in international relations. This Movement plays a prominent part in reducing tension and strengthening international peace and security. It is also a symbol of resistance on the part of peoples to their polarization by the super-Powers and their policies of hegemony, dominance and dependence. As a member of that movement and one which has great faith in its role and objectives, Libya commends anew the approach and achievements of the Movement and asserts its adherence to its principles. Libya hopes that the spirit of solidarity and integration will flourish among the members of the Movement, helping them to confront all expansionist, imperialist schemes.\nHaving followed the recent developments in the Gulf region with great concern, ray country welcomes the cease-fire and the agreement readied between the two war-weary Muslim States, Iraq and Iran, for the peaceful settlement of their problems. Libya, which has sincerely striven to stop this war ever since it began, is pleased to witness its imminent end and to see the Gulf area turn into a tranquil lake enjoying peace, security and stability, with the potential strengths of these two States channelled to face the real enemy that threatens our entire Arab and Muslim peoples, the Zionist enemy. We believe that true peace and security can be achieved in the area only with die withdrawal of all foreign military fleets from the Arabian Gulf.\nIn this connection, I should like to commend the sincere efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to put an end to that war.\nMy country, which has actively contributed to the efforts to solve the Cyprus question, would like to stress that a just, lasting and peaceful settlement of this problem must be based on the unity, sovereignty and non-aligned status of Cyprus, and must guarantee the rights of both the Greek and the Turkish communities.\nIn supporting the endeavours of the United Nations in this respect we stress the need to dismantle foreign imperialistic bases in the area for they threaten the security and integrity not only of the island but also of the entire Mediterranean Sea basin.\nMy country also expresses its satisfaction at the conclusion in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations of the agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan to settle the question of the brother people of Afghanistan.\nMy country reiterates its support for the hopes and aspirations of the Korean people to reunify the two parts of Korea and calls for the creation of a favourable climate for this reunification without any foreign interference.\nThe situation in Central America and the Caribbean has become more volatile and dangerous as the peoples of Nicaragua Cuba El Salvador Grenada and Panama have been subjected to a series of blatant imperialist provocations and interventions. In emphasizing our support for the efforts of the Contadora Group and the Guatemala agreement as the appropriate basis for the solution of the problems in the area we proclaim our solidarity with those peoples in their honourable struggle for freedom and sovereignty.\nThis session is being held less than three months after the conclusion of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. Although that session was held at a time of international detente, especially in the area of negotiations on complex and intricate disarmament issues and coincided with the Moscow summit meeting between the two super-Powers it failed to achieve any tangible results, in spite of the world-wide interest shown and the hopes that mankind placed in it. We believe, however, that the convening of the discussion at that session can be regarded as one more moderate step on the thorny path to disarmament.\nIt seems that the whole world agrees that nuclear, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction represent the main threat to mankind. The complexity of this issue is increased by the determination of certain nuclear super-Powers to engage in the abhorrent race to develop new types of these weapons, devoting vast material resources to finance research and other programmes related to them. While mankind welcomes some aspects of detente and looks forward to more and better agreements on the reduction of stockpiles devastating nuclear weapons on our planet, it sees at the same time the development of terrifying programmes and plans to militarise outer space. In this context, we should like to refer in particular to the so-called Star Wars programme - the strategic defence initiative. The American Administration is determined to pursue this and to persuade the largest possible number of States to adopt it.\nAs a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, my country supports all regional and international efforts to curb the nuclear-arms race. As we welcome the recent agreement between the two super-Powers on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles, despite its serious limitations, we hope that the results of the Moscow summit will lead to enhanced detente, to further reductions of nuclear weapons and, ultimately, to their destruction. Until this goal is reached, we stress the need, pending attainment of this goal, for guarantees for non-nuclear States against the use or threat of use of these weapons. In this context, we affirm the right of these States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Nevertheless, the fact that the two racist regimes in occupied Palestine and South Africa have acquired nuclear capability confirms the belief in Africa and the Arab region in general that imbalance and Instability will continue in these two important regions.\nWe support the principle of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones anywhere in the world, including Africa, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, although we believe that this goal will remain out of reach because circumstances favourable to its attainment have not been created.\nAs for Africa, the racist regime in Pretoria, with collaboration with certain major Western States, represents a stumbling-block to relieving the continent from the threat of the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons, which is the nightmare of African countries.\nIn the Middle East, the presence of the racist Zionist entity in the occupied territories of Palestine, its involvement in the Star Wars programme and its strategic collaboration with the United States represent a constant threat not only to the States of the region, but also to the States of the Mediterranean end African regions, especially if one takes into account the continuous nuclear collaboration between that entity and the racist regime in Pretoria. We reiterate in this respect that the persistence of certain Powers in supporting these two racist regimes intensifies tensions in both regions and represents a threat to international peace and security.\nAnother phenomenon that causes grave concern in Africa, in particular, and merits high priority today is the marked increase in the dumping of nuclear and toxic wastes in Africa by certain States, industrial concerns and transnational corporations. In strongly condemning these immoral practices, which are a crime against Africa and its peoples, we endorse the relevant resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity at its forty-eighth session. \nMy country will always reaffirm the central role and major responsibility of the United Nations in the field of disarmament and the great importance of the World Disarmament Campaign and other United Nations initiatives to sensitise world public opinion and keep it informed about disarmament issues and the relationship between disarmament and development.\nThe current international economic situation is another important issue that could threaten international peace and security. The worsening of the economic crisis is shown by, inter alia, the sharp decline in the prices of commodities, the doubling of the external debt-burden of developing countries and the depletion of their financial resources, the prevalence of poverty, disease and famine as a result of drought and conflict and the policies of economic coercion adopted by certain developed countries which apply economic blockades and embargoes and impose unfair terms of trade.\nThere is no doubt that the main reason for this crisis is the imbalance inherent in the existing international economic order. All efforts to reform this unjust order have failed because they have been mere formalities with the aim of alleviating the crisis, but not at improving the order. The only way to reform it is by restructuring it in line with the realities of the current international economic and political circumstances, which are completely different from those at its inception.\nThe present economic order has become a major obstacle to developing countries, which did not take part in determining its nature, since most of them were subjected to imperialistic hegemony in its economic and political forms. The dilemma facing these countries following independence arises from the fact that the economic order does not respond to their just demand for equality and participation in international economic decision-making. \nThe international community has recognized the need to change the international economic order. This was stated clearly in the resolution on the new international economic order adopted at the seventh special session of the General Assembly. Regrettably, it is clear now that recognizing reality is one thing, but having the will to change it is an entirely different matter. Many years have passed since the adoption of that resolution, but the intransigence of developed countries has hampered efforts aimed at changing the international economic order and implementing the United Nations resolutions on the new international economic order.\nThe developing countries are convinced that their economic and social development cannot be attained under the old order, so they are determined to change it. They have made strenuous efforts to this end since 'the late l960s. To these efforts we owe the establishment of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the holding of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly and the adoption of the proposals for the global round of negotiations and on the International Development Strategy.\nDespite all these efforts, the hopes of the developing countries have not been fulfilled, because of the failure of developed countries to honour their commitments in the field of development assistance. The developing countries have realized that co-operation among themselves is the right way to bring about political and economic solidarity. This co-operation is also an important means of attaining economic and social development in those States. This co-operation acquired greater significance when the dialogue with developed States floundered, for the developed States wanted the dialogue to further their own interests, regardless of the critical needs of developing countries. \nCo-operation among developing countries has made considerable progress. My country, which has consistently supported this co-operation as a sound basis for the achievement of its development objectives, strives to consolidate this co-operation. It has concluded economic and technical co-operation agreements with a large number of developing countries, and has also provided them with long-term loans and assistance. We believe that the developing countries should not be over-optimistic concerning the outcome of the North-South dialogue, but should begin laying a sound foundation of co-operation among themselves, so as to enter upon these talks from a position of strength.\nIn conclusion, we express the hope that the results of this session will measure up to the aspirations of mankind for a better world in which peace, prosperity and justice prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, a tradition dating back to the early days of this Organization confers upon me the privilege of being the first speaker, at the opening of our debate, to convey to you, my colleague and friend Dante Caputo, my warm and friendly congratulations on your election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am certain that you will do honour to that high office with the same qualities that have marked your steady leadership of Argentine diplomacy.\nI should also like to express my appreciation of and respect for Ambassador Nita Barrow, distinguished representative of Barbados, whose merits enriched our choice for the direction of our work.\nI once again pay a tribute to the outstanding diplomatic talent of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Javier Perez de Cuellar. His untiring efforts in building peace and strengthening the United Nations make him worthy of the appreciation of the whole international community.\nWhen I addressed this Assembly for the first time three years ago there prevailed in international affairs grave forebodings and repeated violations of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The language of confrontation between the super-Powers was becoming sharper owing to the use of advanced military technologies capable of spreading the risk of nuclear war to outer space. The persistence of localized tension and disputes frustrated the efforts to attain of the ideals of peace and security.\nAs I return here today I find that the world situation has improved somewhat. The practice of East-West detente, which seemed condemned to oblivion, has been reborn. The United States and the Soviet Union have finally reached a concrete agreement on disarmament. Their leaders are to be commended for this historic feat.\nSome regional conflicts, the protagonists worn out by the tragic toll of death and destruction, now see the dawning of a peaceful solution. In previous speeches I have condemned the recalcitrant attitude of South Africa in blocking the process of independence for Namibia, the violence which seemed to have taken hold for good in the Gulf region and the transgression of the principles of self-determination and non-interference in Afghanistan. Today it is comforting to change my words of warning and criticism to bear witness to the promising outlook for peace efforts aimed at putting an end to those conflicts.\nIn looking at the clearer skies on the world political horizon, I reaffirm my reverence for the United Nations and my belief in the effectiveness of its instruments. If the world is better today than it was yesterday, we must give credit for that to the decisive contribution of the United Nations. We still have before us, however, unfinished and challenging tasks to accomplish in obedience to the provisions of the Charter, Obstructions remain to eradicating apartheid, solving the Middle East crisis, putting an end to the suffering of the people of Lebanon and bringing peace to Central America. It is my hope that at the next session of the General Assembly we may note further progress in our quest for peace and harmony among peoples. \nAs the representative of a nation which has always sought the establishment of a just and democratic world order based on the participation of all, I must stress that the task of transforming the world will be complete only after the strengthening and consolidation of co-operation for economic and social development. In this respect, unlike the remarks I have just made on the world political situation, my words today will not differ in substance or in tone from those of my previous statements. Because of the lack of progress in international economic relations, Brazil once again brings to the Assembly a message of apprehension, of disappointment, and renews to the developed world its proposals and claims.\nReaffirming its historical adherence to the highest ideals of international life and faithful to the will and the nature of its people, Brazil has inscribed in its new Constitution, which is about to be promulgated, the fundamental principles of its foreign policy; national independence; priority for human rights; the self-determination of peoples; non-interference; equality among States; the peaceful settlement of disputes; the defence of peace; repudiation of terrorism and racism; and co-operation among peoples for the progress of mankind. The representatives of the Brazilian people, when expressing in the Constitution the central demands and concerns of their own society, were perfectly attuned to the aspirations of the international community. They also embodied in their new charter the greatest aspiration of our continent - the integration of Latin America. \nThe world, unfortunately, has come to realize how absurd is the unilateral ethos underlying the illusion that power - military, political, economic or technological power - could generate a just or even a merely stable international order. Strength cannot give birth to law, much less to peace and justice. This is what the Charter of the United Nations - and in particular its preamble - tells us.\nNevertheless there persists a disturbing tendency on the part of certain countries to place their national law above international law, both in political and in economic matters. To plead internal laws, or alleged national interests, in order to avoid compliance with obligations under international law violates the essential principle of pacta sunt servanda, which is a basic rule of civilized coexistence among nations.\nThe adventure of unilateralism cannot be replaced by self-contained bilateralism or selective multilateralism. Negotiations on matters of interest to the whole world community require the participation of all countries, large or small. Talks on peace and economic development, in particular, cannot be made into an empty exercise whereby power pays homage to law.\nRegrettably, the atmosphere of dialogue which now brings the super-Powers closer together has not resulted in an effective readiness to widen the field of multilateral understanding. The elaboration of power schemes geared to redefining and freezing a vertically structured world order deserves nothing but condemnation.\nThe difficulties encountered during the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament illustrate the concern I have just voiced. The impossibility of obtaining a document based on consensus, only a few months after the first treaty on nuclear disarmament in history was signed, clearly indicates the magnitude of the obstacle hindering the participation of the international community as a whole in deliberations concerning its own survival. The decision made by President Jos\u00e9 Sarney to take part in that session, along with other Heads of State or Government, attests to the firmness of Brazil's stand in favour of the cause of disarmament and of its open and effective discussion in the relevant bodies.\nSo strong is our people's repudiation of weapons of mass destruction and so firm our purpose to develop nuclear technology exclusively for peaceful ends that the following precept is embodied in the new Brazilian Constitution; all nuclear activities in Brazilian territory will be permitted only for peaceful purposes and subject to approval by Congress.\nThis same spirit, already enshrined in the Treaty of Tlatelolco, prevails in the understandings between Argentina and Brazil in this field. The loyal and fruitful co-operation between the two countries belies the myth of a nuclear race in Latin America.\nThe constructive purpose inspiring Brazil's foreign policy led to the convening of the first meeting of States of the Zone of Peace and Co-operation of the South Atlantic, which was held in Rio de Janeiro last July. Part of a region which is assuming its own identity, founded on deeply shared interests and perceptions, the South Atlantic countries were able to explore further the many paths of open dialogue among equals offered by the Declaration of the South Atlantic as a Zone of Peace and Co-operation.\nOur views coincided on important issues. We support the efforts for peace-building in southern Africa. We are concerned that, in spite of repeated appeals from this Assembly, negotiations have not yet begun on all aspects relating to the future of the Malvinas Islands. We believe it necessary that concrete measures be adopted, in particular by the militarily significant States, in order to ensure the non-introduction of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and the reduction of foreign military presence in the Zone of Peace and Co-operation. \nAmple possibilities exist for joint action in favour of development. We found significant points of common interest in the preservation of the environment, in the need to avoid the dumping of toxic wastes and in the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I have no doubt that the conclusions of the Rio de Janeiro meeting will receive widespread support from States Members of the United Nations.\nThe signing of the Geneva agreements and the beginning of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan have rekindled hopes for a future of peace and development for that country. We commend the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Mr. Diego Cordovez, for the United Nations participation in this process. We would only have wished that the entering into force of the mechanism for verification and control of the agreements, with the good offices of the United Nations, had been implemented only after due process.\nThe cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, welcomed by Brazil, brought the prospect of peace and economic reconstruction to the Gulf region. May I stress the extraordinary relevance of the United Nations in this initiative, as from the joint action of all members of the Security Council - over which Brazil had the honour to preside at that time - in consultation with the Governments of Iran and Iraq and with the constant, timely and balanced mediation of the Secretary-General.\nIn southern Africa, progress in the negotiations between Angola, South Africa and Cuba, with the mediation of the United States, augurs well for a peaceful and just solution to the question of Namibia under resolution 435 (1978), adopted 10 years ago by the Security Council. We hope that this will be the first step towards normalizing the situation in the southern part of the African continent through the elimination of all sources of tension and conflict. Brazil has underlined the need for strict respect for the territorial integrity of its South Atlantic neighbour, Angola, and for an immediate end to the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. \nWe regret that the odious practice of apartheid continues on its absurd course. The people and Government of Brazil long for the day when Namibia joins the community of independent nations. Peace and security can be assured in that region, so close to us, only when the odious institutionalized racism is eradicated.\nIn the Middle East repeated scenes of violence, which have shocked world public opinion, confirm that the self-determination of the Palestinian people in their own territory is an essential condition for solving the crisis. The Brazilian Government reiterates the need for respect for the rights of the Palestinian people, for Israel's complete withdrawal from the territories occupied since 1967 and for all States of the region to be able to exist in peace within internationally recognized borders. With those goals in mind, we continue to support the holding of an international conference on the situation in the Middle East, with the participation of all interested parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nThe apparent standstill of peace progress in Central America is viewed with concern by Brazil. It cannot be denied that the Esquipulas Agreement contributed to alleviating tension and that new hopes emerged with the Agreement. But the recurrence of incidents in areas of tension and the paralysis, which we hope is temporary, in the process of dialogue and understanding create a feeling of uncertainty as regards the future of Central America. As a member of the Contadora Support Group, Brazil hopes that a less tense international atmosphere may come to make it easier for the countries of the region to attain their objectives of peace and development.\nAlthough there is progress on the political scene and signs of a future world free from war and truly committed to achieving lasting peace, the international economic, situation still troubles our spirits and challenges our minds. \nIn the great majority of developing countries Members of this Organization, the dire facts continue to cry out for creative decisions which might break the stalemate that has been keeping those countries on the verge of collapse. We must no longer delude one another with rhetorical phrases and concepts. It is high time we openly admitted that a strong uneasiness is corroding the foundations of international economic co-operation.\nAlmost half a century has elapsed since we declared ourselves United Nations and, united, undertook to follow a common set of ideals among which was the fight against misery and hunger. One commitment was to halt the degradation of the most cherished values of our civilizations, irrespective of origins or beliefs. What has happened to us? Have we become less united than we were then?\nWe have only to look at this Assembly, as we meet for the forty-third consecutive year, to see that we are nations sharing universal principles and ideals. Whereas the hostilities of the Second World War had plunged us into the most hidden depths of terror and desolation, the seeds sown in San Francisco bore fruit in the Americas, in Asia, in Africa and in the Middle East - throughout the world. They are here, united, the nations which 50 years ago found themselves on opposing sides of the battlefield. They are here in this very place, united, the nations which in the following years achieved their independence, which was to a great extent the fruit of the same seeds of democracy sown in San Francisco.\nAre we less united than before? No. We are more united then before, but not as united as we wish to be in the future.\nIt is therefore sad to note that we American, Asian, African brothers still suffer from the same horrors and the same desolation that so badly afflicted our forbears. While we have done away with wars, we have not yet been able to banish hunger, which is spreading endemically in pockets throughout the continents. We are all the more ashamed to see that hunger is present in and close to the most plentiful societies man has ever known.\nSomething is terribly wrong. The real growth of production in developing countries fell from an annual average rate of 5.5 per cent in the 1970s to an average of less than 3 per cent in the 1980s. The share of developing countries in the developed market economies shrank from 28 per cent in 1980 to 19 per cent in 1987, whereas that of the developed countries grew from 63 per cent to 71 per cent in the same period. In real terms the participation of developing countries in world exports suffered a decrease of approximately 25 per cent between 1963 and 1986. And something is terribly wrong when one notes that, due to the burden of external debt, the developing countries have to transfer abroad a great amount of the resources they so badly need for their economic development.\nBrazil has, in the past few months, managed to reach with its private and government creditors a global agreement on the rescheduling of its external debt. We ate therefore keenly aware of the burdens weighing down on our economy. That is why we are convinced that only if and when the developed countries adopt appropriate policies shall we be able to reduce interest rates and improve the outlook for trade in debtor nations. Unfortunately, the erratic policy on international interest rates in recent years has thwarted the economic development of a whole generation. This policy has turned international trade into a complementary source of the reserves needed simply to service the external debt, with obvious adverse effects on expanding or even maintaining our economies' capacity to import.\nThis sad state of affairs has been made all the worse by a battery of constraints imposed vertically - from top to bottom. Proposals clothed in euphemistic language, such as \\\"voluntary export restraints\\\", cannot disguise the old formulas of protectionism and the spoliation or trade partners, formulas which are always at the root of the most serious recessions to shake the international economy this century.\nIt is our hope that the present multilateral negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will make it possible for international trade to enter into a new cycle of expansion, on a more just and balanced basis. We cannot accept that the concept of trade without frontiers should be invoked to deny third-world countries the special, differentiated treatment they should receive. Nor can we accept that the developed countries should ignore the commitments they solemnly made when the Uruguay Round was launched and demand concessions from developing countries in exchange for revoking protectionist measures.\nMoreover, it must also be acknowledged that legislative initiatives in some of the main trading countries are in essence clearly hostile, not only to international trade, but even to the scientific and technological capacity of the developing countries. My country, for example, is now under the threat of trade retaliation, simply because we - in accordance with international law and with the letter and spirit of agreements to which we are parties - have encouraged, in our own territory, research into and development of pharmaceutical products. We were taken aback to see the most \u00bf\u00a1table and predictable rules of international trade and international law being violated unilaterally.\nTherefore, conditions seem ripe for the General Assembly, responding to the appeal the President made in his inaugural statement, to relaunch on an effective, realistic and constructive basis, without resorting to rhetoric or recrimination, the North-South dialogue, without forgetting the great frustrations this endeavour has entailed so far.\nThe General Assembly is meeting at a good moment to change the course of history; to steer it in safer directions; to intensify the progress made in the fields of peace, the settlement of disputes and disarmament; and to reappraise and reinvigorate the already weakened international economic co-operation.\nThis year we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is tragic that we are still unable to settle together the problems affecting, in vast areas of the world, the most elementary rights of mankind: the rights to life, health, shelter, food and work; in sum, those rights which assure the development and well-being of peoples.\nWhereas in the task of building peace the day of hope is dawning upon the world, the struggle for development remains in frustrating darkness. It has been said that development is the new name for peace. If that is true, the Assembly cannot fail to measure up to the challenges of our times and to heed the urgent calls for justice and dignity. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first extend to Mr, Dante Caput the congratulations of the Ethiopian delegation, as well as my own, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session . My delegation is confident that under his wise and skilful guidance this session will reach a successful conclusion. In this regard I should like to assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation as he discharges his heavy responsibilities.\nMay I also take this opportunity to express our gratitude \u0448 his predecessor. Comrade Peter Florin, who presided over the last session of the General Assembly with admirable skill.\nI should like at this juncture to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez dc Cuellar, for the exemplary dedication and competence with which he has always discharged the heavy responsibilities entrusted to him. In reaffirming to him the deep appreciation of my Government, already expressed on a number of occasions over the last few years, I wish him ever greater success in his future endeavours.\nFew are those who deny that nations are becoming increasingly interdependent. There has probably been no period since the dawn of human civilization when various societies have lived in complete isolation from each other. The growth of human progress itself would have been inconceivable without close contacts and the exchange of ideas among different societies. Ours has especially become a period in history when the various challenges facing humanity can hardly be tackled outside the context of interdependence. Ours has, indeed, become a time when the imperatives of survival dictate that we all take seriously the fact that not only are we interdependent but also that we share common destiny.\nPerhaps no one denies this incontrovertible truth, but the lack of political will to bridge the huge gap between what is asserted on the plane of declarations and what is done in practice is a vivid demonstration of the fact that our actions are not commensurate with the immense challenges facing humanity as a whole. In this context two closely related challenges, among others, demand our concerted and co-ordinated action: the strengthening of peace and security on the one hand and the promotion of development and progress on the other.\nThis session of the General Assembly is being convened at a most propitious time from the point of view of the relaxation of international tension. There is no gainsaying that the period since the last session has been marked by a number of encouraging and positive developments on the international scene. The improvement in relations between the two major Powers and the increased level of mutual understanding between them accords fully with the yearning for peace that we have all been voicing for too long.\nIn this regard we view with satisfaction the Treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States on the Elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. Although only 3 per cent of the nuclear arsenals of the two major Powers are meant to be destroyed under the Treaty, the symbolic significance of the achievement can hardly be underestimated. In general we feel the Treaty represents a step forward in the area of nuclear disarmament.\nSubsequent political developments likewise give us reason to view the international political scene with optimism. Among such developments is the acceptance by both Iran and Iraq of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). This constitutes a major achievement towards the restoration of peace in the area and the enhancement of international peace and security.\nThe Geneva Accords on Afghanistan, which came into force on 15 May 1988, are yet another step which has contributed towards the change to a better political climate than that which prevailed a year ago. The positive steps that have been taken so far towards the withdrawal of South African occupation forces from southern Angola and the efforts being made to facilitate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), on Namibia, are also welcome developments. However, given the chronic duplicity of the racist regime, we feel obliged to caution that the international community should follow the unfolding situation with the utmost vigilance.\nWe also draw satisfaction from the resumption of the inter-communal talks aimed at addressing the question of Cyprus. We are likewise optimistic regarding developments towards seeking a solution to the problem of the Western Sahara.\nIt is also pertinent to mention here the concerted efforts that are being deployed to restore peace in Kampuchea and the progress that has so far been made towards the restoration of peace in that region.\nIt is a source of great satisfaction to us that the United Nations, consistent with the provisions of the Charter of the Organization, has spearheaded the search for solutions to the various political problems that I have just referred to. While this is testimony to the continued relevance of the United Nations, ray delegation also finds it most appropriate to pay a tribute once again to the Secretary-General for his dedication and untiring efforts in the cause of international peace and security.\nAs we take note of the improved climate in international relations and the prevailing relaxation of tension, we are at the same time duty bound to make a realistic assessment of what has already been achieved and what remains to be done in the area of international peace and security. I should also add that whatever conclusions we arrive at must be firmly founded on an objective analysis of the state of affairs now prevailing in the world.\nIn this connection it will suffice to refer to the disappointing result of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. As is well known, the session closed without agreement being readied on a final document, although great efforts were exerted to arrive at a consensus. It is obvious, therefore, that we should redouble our efforts towards progress on a number of interrelated disarmament measures. A comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty is a goal the achievement of which could go a long way in arresting the nuclear-arms race but which has so far eluded us, despite a near universal consensus on the issue. Other priority measures in the field of disarmament include steps to prevent the extension of the arms race into outer space, agreement on the prohibition of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the speedy conclusion of a chemical-weapon convention.\nI might also mention here the contribution that the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in different parts of the globe could make towards the ultimate goal of a nuclear-free world. In this context I wish to express our appreciation to the Government of the German Democratic Republic for organizing in June of this year an International Meeting on Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones.\nIn any discussion of the subject of nuclear-weapon-free zones it is appropriate to refer to the initiative that the peoples of Africa have taken to keep the continent free of nuclear weapons. It was 24 years ago that the Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity adopted, at their summit conference in Cairo, a Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa. This initiative represented one of the first regional attendees at the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Since then, the General Assembly has adopted a series of resolutions calling upon nuclear-weapon States to respect the wishes of the peoples of Africa to protect the status of the continent as a nuclear-weapon-free area. \n\nHowever, it has now become clear that the African peoples\u2019 commitment to free the region from the nuclear-arms race has been challenged by the reckless policy of the racist regime in Pretoria to acquire nuclear-weapons capability. In fact, it now appears from available evidence that South Africa has indeed achieved the capability to produce nuclear weapons.\nThe implications of this ominous development for international peace and security cannot be over-emphasized. Such capability, acquired by a regime that would have no scruples in using them, should be viewed with alarm by all who have genuine concern for the maintenance of international peace and security. There is, of course, little doubt that it would have been practically impossible for South Africa to achieve this capability without the support it has been able to get from those who, with characteristic myopia, regard South Africa as an indispensable partner.\nAs if this were not enough, the people of Africa are also being challenged by a new and grave development. In recent years it has become clear that some in the West have started to engage in activities that pose imminent danger to the African peoples and to the African ecosystem. I am referring here to the dumping of nuclear and industrial wastes in African countries by some Western transnational corporations.\nThe indignation of the African peoples at the callousness displayed by those who perpetrate this crime has been echoed by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), meeting in its forty-eighth ordinary session in May of this year. My delegation deems it appropriate that the dumping of nuclear and industrial wastes in Africa has been inscribed as an item on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. We are confident that the session will give serious attention to the matter and adopt decisions reflecting the gravity of the problem. \nMuch as we are encouraged by the significant political achievements registered during the first half of 1988, we remain none the less concerned by the continued use or threat of use of force, under any pretext, against the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of small States.\nNo better example of this can be provided than the prevailing situation in Central America where, despite the various regional peace efforts and the decision of the International Court of Justice, Nicaragua still finds itself under constant threat to its independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty. Thus the international community's solidarity with the people of Nicaragua must be strengthened so that that country can be totally free of the covert and overt intervention to which it has been subjected for too long.\nSimilarly, there are a number of other issues relating to international peace and security, as well as to the rights of peoples and to justice for those facing egregious forms of discrimination that still cry out for solutions.\nThe problems posed by the evil \u00a1system of apartheid in South Africa clearly demonstrate how long indeed is the distance that the international community has yet to travel in laying the foundation for international relations based on justice and basic human decency. The noble goal of eradicating this abhorrent system continues to demand unremitting struggle. Apart from the call for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist regime, for the success of which the international community needs to deploy greater effort, final victory against it requires all those who stand for justice to continue to rally behind the struggle being waged by the people of South Africa. As in the past, Ethiopia will continue to provide concrete assistance to the people of South Africa until apartheid is dismantled and justice and democracy ace firmly established in South Africa. It is also appropriate to emphasize here that continued solidarity with the front-line States is part and parcel of the struggle against apartheid. In that context, we are all duty bound to render the fullest possible assistance to these countries to enable them to withstand the military intervention and economic pressure of the racist regime.\nIn the Middle East, the problem that emanates essentially from the denial to the Palestinian people of their rights as a people still awaits a just solution. I should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm Ethiopia's continued support for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nThe situation in the Korean peninsula is one other problem that requires the attention of the international community. I believe we are all aware of the fact that the quest for reunification by the people of the peninsula is still frustrated by certain major impediments, Ethiopia fully supports the desire and efforts of the Korean people for national reunification without foreign intervention.\nWhile the past year has witnessed a number of encouraging developments in the sphere of disarmament and the resolution of regional conflicts, it is regrettable that existing negative trends have persisted in other areas.\nFar from showing improvement, the issues of development and progress that represent another challenge to the international community have instead become a cause for ever greater concern, both for their serious implications for international peace and security and for the immense human tragedy they entail.\nThe deteriorating economic and social conditions in developing countries, especially in the least developed among them, obviously require concerted action from the international community to be contained and reversed. Instead, what we have been witnessing is lack of sufficient political will on the part of many developed countries to create the necessary economic environment for developing countries to rehabilitate their economies.\nIt has now become clearer than ever before that the serious difficulties facing the developing world emanate mainly from the external economic situation, over which they have very little control. The policies pursued by some developed countries, particularly in the areas of trade, money and finance, have further aggravated the problems, which are deep-rooted in the prevailing international economic system already characterized by unjust and unequal relations.\nDeveloping countries are endeavouring, within the limits of their resources, to revive their economies and to ensure a decent life for their peoples. But to no avail. Some of the reform measures required of developing countries have, in fact, become potential causes of political and social instability. Furthermore, the determined efforts made by these countries have invariably been frustrated by such external factors as the decline in commodity prices and export revenue, unfavourable terms of trade, widespread protectionism, accumulation of external debt and decline in net resource flows, the combined impact of which has seriously impeded their overall development process.\nIn the case of African countries, most of which belong to the group of least developed countries, these externally Induced obstacles to development have further compounded the difficulties they have encountered as a result of widespread drought, desertification and other natural calamities.\nIt is to be recalled. In this connection, that it was in response to the economic plight of African countries that the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa was convened more than two years ago. The result of that session was United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. \nWhile the Programme of Action is intended to help improve the performance of African economies, the full implementation of the reform measures it requires has been rendered difficult owing to various factors. Significant among these is the unfavourable international climate characterized, among other things, by accelerated deterioration of the terms of trade \u03c1 the low level of resource flows, mounting debt-servicing, and the inadequacy of external support for our efforts. The recent raid-term review conference has clearly shown the constraints faced by Africa in the reform process. We are therefore hopeful that the international community will be more forthcoming in supplementing the efforts of African countries towards the desired objective of improved productivity and rapid economic recovery.\nAs Ethiopia is a country already confronted with immense problems caused by natural calamities, it should come as no surprise that the negative impact of the external economic environment on its efforts towards economic recovery has been enormous. Although the amount and distribution of precipitation during the main rainy season this year appear satisfactory, the adverse effects of the series of droughts my country has experienced for almost a decade and a half can hardly be tackled with our own resources within a short period of time. However, Ethiopia will continue to exert every effort to make effective use of available resources with a view to overcoming its economic difficulties and accelerating its development.\nIn this connection, it is indeed regrettable that some continue to display a glaring lack of judgement as regards my country in their assessment of the problems in our sub-region. Rather, they see fit to subject Ethiopia to their habitual criticism, which is as biased as it is unwarranted, and in sharp contrast to the prevailing reality in the country.\nFairness and objectivity would have demanded that they should, at the very least, recognize the maximum efforts Ethiopia is exerting to offset the consequences of the drought, the attainment of food self-sufficiency and accelerated development while at the same time coping with the problem created by the huge influx of refugees into the country. In the circumstances, it would have been most appropriate to sensitise the international community to this reality with a view to supporting Ethiopia's efforts to meet effectively the manifold challenges it is facing.\nWhen I had the opportunity to address this Assembly last year, I expressed, inter alia, Ethiopia's readiness to forge and strengthen relations with all countries, particularly those which are in our region and with which we have had difficult relations\\\". (A/42/PV. 22, p. 19-20)\nIn that statement, I expressed Ethiopia's commitment to peace and its determination to do as much as possible to help relax the tension in our region. We have always been willing to muster the necessary political will to take two steps forward towards the normalization of relations with all peace-loving countries for every one step they may take towards the same goal.\nToday, it gives me immense satisfaction to refer to the highly significant step that has been taken by my country and Somalia towards improving our relations. An agreement on normalization of relations between the bio countries was signed on 3 April 1988. In accordance with this agreement not only have we restored diplomatic relations and exchanged prisoners of war but we have also embarked at a rapid pace on the normalization of relations, which, we are confident, will create the necessary conditions for both countries to devote their resources and energy to their economic development. This demonstrates our good will to bury the hatchet with a view to promoting regional peace. I should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that Ethiopia will be second to none in its determination to build a bridge of friendship with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. \nIn this regard, I should like to acquaint this Assembly with the fact that, consistent with its commitment to ensure durable peace in our region, Ethiopia is at present engaged in sustained and painstaking negotiations with the Sudan with a view to identifying the root causes of the problems between the two countries and to finding appropriate solutions. For its part, my Government is determined that the Joint Expert Committee which the two countries have established will soon complete its tasks and present its recommendations. Given a similar commitment on the part of our Sudanese brothers to lasting peace between the two countries, my Government remains confident that all outstanding issues could be resolved in the interest of peace and co-operation in our part of the world.\nWe derive satisfaction from the national, regional and international appreciation and support of our peaceful endeavours. On the other hand, we find it hard to comprehend the view of those who still fail to grasp the significance of these achievements as steps towards the restoration of peace by the countries of the region themselves, and continue to express lingering anxiety about tension in the area.\nIn opening ray statement I referred to the fact that the challenges of development and progress, on the one hand, and of international peace and security, on the other, could be tackled only within the context of interdependence. Thus, it becomes obvious that our well-being lies only in multilateralism. As a founding Member of this Organization, there is nothing that gives us greater joy than to see the United Nations become increasingly effective in the quest for solutions to the major challenges facing humanity.\t\nIn recent months, the United Nations has shown how truly effective it could be in implementing and promoting the purposes and principles of the Organization as enshrined in its Charter. We are, indeed, encouraged by this positive trend. At the same time, the financial situation of the Organization continues to be a cause for concern. Putting pressure on the United Nations by withholding assessed contributions to the regular budget of the Organization constitutes a violation of a treaty obligation on the part of Member States. My delegation is hopeful that such a state of affairs will not be allowed to continue and that the growing efficacy of the United Nations will not be adversely affected by a financial crisis.\nIn the interest of global peace and security, and in the interest of the prosperity and well-being of the human race, let us therefore rededicate ourselves to strengthening the viability and effectiveness of the United Nations. As for Ethiopia, it will always remain committed to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the Government of the Dominican Republic and the allegation of which I am Chairman, I have pleasure, Sir, in asking you to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo my sincere congratulations on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-third session. His personal and professional qualities and his dedication to the path of diplomacy augur well for the outcome of the session.\nI also congratulate his predecessor, Ambassador Peter Florin, on the exemplary and impeccable way in which he presided over the forty-second session. His work contributed greatly to the Organization's good image. We also wish warmly to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the successes he has scored thanks to his persistent efforts for international peace and co-operation, efforts that have been widely and fully recognized by all members of this world body. The Nobel Peace Prize given to the peace-keeping forces is the best testimony of what we have just said. The Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization in addition to being a source of information of incalculable value for us all is a sure guide to follow in the various situations that exist in the interdependent world of today.\nAs a member of the great Caribbean family I wish also to hail an exceptional Caribbean, the Ambassador of Barbados. Her intelligence and her hard work have earned her the appreciation of the international community represented in this forum, as shown by the support given to her candidacy for the presidency of the General Assembly.\nIn referring to the Dominican Republic as a member of the great Caribbean family I am highlighting its geographical, political, economic and ethnic facts. For those same reasons, and out of a birthright, we are also part of that great thriving, generous, suffering reality, although a land aware of its effective capabilities, and I am referring to Iberian America.\nWe hope that our island, as in the past, will be the catalyst in all necessary endeavours to achieve a worthy life, something to which our brothers in the mainland and in the Caribbean archipelago are entitled.\nThe concise text of my address has been distributed to all delegations and representatives attending this session of the General Assembly as well as to the various officers of the Secretariat. However, I will now read a summary which contains the most  salient points which the Dominican delegation wishes to bring to your attention. First I wish to refer to the situation in Haiti our brother country with which we share geography economic and social interests history culture and hopes. The Haitian people have striven to open up a path to the application of human rights and to democracy, but it would be na\u00efve optimism to hope that all traumas and remnants of the oppressive system in existence for so many years and with such deep roots will disappear from one day to the next. It will take time to root them out definitively. \nThe situation obtaining in that sister nation is a sensitive one and the international common should lend generous and understanding assistance not as charity but as investment in a people which was the first to become independent in the continent colonized by Spain and which has maintained its independence despite all difficulties. The Dominican Republic has received some Haitian leaders as guests. These were human beings who feared for their lives rightly or not\u00b7 this\nwas above all a humanitarian action. This act of generosity is in keeping with the ethics of the Dominican people. Some groups in \u0449 country have criticized this action as if generosity should follow the concepts of discrimination or should be guided by political motivations. It is better that one hundred guilty parties go free than that one innocent person be condemned. The Dominican Government will continue to honour that precept because to offer asylum on a discriminatory basis would be to violate the honour of our people an. one of the most sacred principles of the Ibero-American system. \nLast year we stated \\\"Peace is not merely the absence of war or peace imposed by a superior force.\u00b7 (\u00c3/42/PV.1S P. 3) Today we say that peace should not be the outcome of a balance of forces, of the so-called forces of deterrence. An error of judgment, a mechanical failure or action in bad faith could bring about an outbreak leading to a final destruction that would spare neither the developed nor the developing countries.\nWe consider that the agreement readied between the two super-Powers on the elimination of intermediate-range missiles is a positive step for world peace. The Dominican Republic congratulates the United States and the Soviet Union on this Important agreement and trusts that the action which has begun after lengthy conversations will not be interrupted.\nThe Dominican Republic reaffirms that maintaining peace and the principle of non-intervention are the unvarying standards of its foreign policy.\nFor the Dominican Republic the United Nations is the appropriate; irreplaceable forum in which to debate the major problems facing the world today. We believe that it is neither wise nor in order to propose other forums or the creation of new organizations to discuss matters of world peace. In the list of items to be discussed In this speech we would like to refer first to drugs, since my delegation considers the drug problem to be one of the major scourges of our respective nations. Drugs are a real and growing threat to all mankind. Every effort roust be brought to bear and the various organizations fighting this scourge must unite under leadership that would avoid duplication and wasted effort. We also believe that the fight against drugs must begin in those places where the raw material is produced. To that end, however, imaginative procedures must be used which go beyond the borders of the developing countries where the farmer, frustrated and ruined by the low prices of his commodities on international markets, proceeds to sow marijuana and coca which are more profitable. It is the protectionist measures which establish quotas and prices that have taken traditional crops out and geared action towards the attractive and profitable crop of coca leaves.\nOwing to the characteristics of its social components the Dominican Republic rejects every form of discrimination, be it racial, apartheid, political or religious. Such discrimination runs counter to every ethical concept. That is why the item on South Africa has continued to appear on the agenda of this great forum and will remain there until that country changes its behaviour. \nIn our view, external debt poses a great challenge to the governments of developing countries  it is a shadow that follows us in all we do, both on the international scene and domestically. Because of its economic, social and political consequences, the level of indebtedness of developing countries is an urgent and complex problem. It grows worse given external factors weighing heavily on the debt of developing countries. These include interest-rate fluctuations, unstable floating exchange rates and action by industrialized countries to maintain their protectionist measures.\nTo ease the debt problem, some industrialized countries should promote a reduction in the real interest rates, even though to do this they will have to reduce their excessive budget deficits. International banking could contribute to the solution of this pressing problem by reducing loan margins, especially for countries in the midst of an adjustment process.\nEfforts by lending institutions are limited to viewing the situation from the monetary and economic point of view> rather than helping, their measures merely contribute to unemployment, shrinking real income and deteriorating public services in short, to plummeting standards of living for the lowest-incomes and therefore neediest groups. During this crisis, lending institutions must maintain a positive net flow of resources towards our countries. Otherwise debt servicing to those institutions will be nearly impossible to carry.\nThe debt problem is not the sole responsibility of the debtor countries. The responsibility is shared variously among the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Governments of creditor countries, the Governments of debtor nations, private and public debtor institutions and, very important, the policy of expanding credit promoted by the big banks until 1981. \nTo emerge from the international debt crisis, the industrialised nations must agree to share fairly in the adjustment efforts and sacrifices we in the developing countries are carrying out. Their greater economic power obligates to join in this task, from which we shall all benefit.\nLet me refer again to the protectionist policies of developed countries. Free and vigorous world trade is indispensable for the well-being of the in international economy. Every protectionist measure drives us further from such trade.\nNotwithstanding the great trials it has had to go through, and thanks to the work of one of the greatest statesmen, Mr. Joaquin Balaguer, the Dominican Republic is growing, using its own resources and with a very small external debt and a policy of absolute priority in the use of public resources. Only a man like President Balaguer could have achieved this feat while maintaining the climate of political, social and economic stability enjoyed by Dominican society.\nWith respect to foreign policy, we have from the very outset supported all efforts to end the conflict in Central America, and we shall support all future efforts. We firmly believe that dialogue among the parties, free from selfish intervention by third parties, is the best way to resolve situations that could develop into conflicts.\nFor that reason we opened our doors this year to the parties to the conflict in Nicaragua so they could speak freely, protected by Dominican impartiality. Our sole interest in Central America is the achievement of peace among brothers, with all its attendant benefits. \nIn the Dominican Republic all ideas - political, religious or connected with any other school of thought - can be expressed freely and without constraints. That is because ideological pluralism is the norm in Dominican political life. We therefore call for better political will to reach accord and to enable us to move forward with programmes of action already agreed upon to strengthen peace.\nIn the Korean peninsula there have been encouraging steps towards better understanding between two countries with a common origin and language and a shared history and culture.\t\nWe hope that an independent Namibia will shortly join our Organization.\nThe situation in the Middle East is very close to us as Dominicans because in our ethnic makeup there are major components of Arab and Jewish culture and blood. We maintain a steadfast friendship with the family roots of the branches that flourish on our soil, and we hope dialogue will take the place of terrorist attacks in that part of the world.\nI regret I cannot refer in this statement to all the issues worthy of attention from the nations represented here. But I cannot omit a brief reference to the situation in my country in the political and social realms, a situation founded  m the institutional end democratic process that began in the early 1960s when the Dominican Republic began a fresh period in its history as a republic.\nThe reed has been long and tortuous, but we are now setting an example of stability and substantial progress towards the final consolidation of a rule of law that will guarantee the survival of our institutions and civilized coexistence among all Dominicans with absolute respect for individual rights and total loyalty to the independence of State institutions. \nToday, the Dominican Republic is an example in the Americas of stability and democracy, notwithstanding the harsh economic pressure to which all third-world nations are subject. All this has been possible thanks to steadfast efforts by a leader who has been able to combine the solution of our local problems with fulfilment of the State's commitments. We understand and has repeatedly stated that we have a duty and an obligation to honour our debts, but not at the sacrifice of resources needed for the growth and development of the Dominican people. \nIn the Dominican Republic, the cradle of Spanish activities in the new world, there is absolute respect for human rights and, from the pinnacles of power, the independence of the institutions of the State is maintained as an inviolable norm. That is a reality which only those confused by the promptings of their conscience could deny or call into question.\nIn my country there is not a single political prisoners justice acts with absolute independence and the free exercise of political pluralism is increasingly widespread and established.\nWhat we have said is a fact that neither our nationals nor foreigners can deny without a breach of the truth, what we are referring to is an achievement which is a source of pride to us and for which we Dominicans feel religious respect, because we have learned that this is a source of social well-being and harmony for our fellow citizens. We say this because we understand that, as was said by His Holiness Pope John Paul II in his address in the Holy See to the diplomatic corps in 1988j\n\\\"Lasting peace is that which ensures that social injustices do not occur.\nThis is what we Dominicans believe and this is the spirit which the delegation I have the honour to head is bringing to this gathering on behalf of the Government and people of the Dominican Republic.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy first remarks must be an expression of congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to the high office you now hold. The delegation of Barbados finds pride and comfort in the fact that the deliberations of the forty-third session should have been placed in the hands of so able a representative of the Latin American and Caribbean region. We salute and support you. I have been asked by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government of Barbados to convey to you his very special greetings and his regrets that he cannot be with us today. However, we know that you have his very good wishes.\nWe also pay a tribute to the President of the Assembly at its forty-second session, Mr. Peter Florin, whose unfailing patience and careful chairmanship of the General Assembly at its regular session and various resumed sessions was an example to us all.\nThe deliberations at the forty-third session are shadowed by grim reminders of the vulnerability we share and the interdependence by which we are inseparably bound. The recent misfortunes of Sudan, Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico serve to underscore this interdependence and the pivotal role that the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization and other specialized agencies play in the day-to-day lives of the people of the world, to the Governments and representatives of the countries affected we offer our heartfelt condolences. \nDisaster, whether man-made or natural, bears two faces: one of despair, the other of hope. The forty-third session finds us looking into a world suspended midway between the politics of hope and the politics of despair. Perhaps never at any time in its four decades of existence have the United Nations and its Charter faced a more poignant challenge. While there is much to suggest that the task of narrowing the gap between despair and hope may be impossible, there is still much to encourage us.\nAt present the international community draws renewed hope from the spirit of responsible co-operation demonstrated by the two major Powers in their formal commitment to reducing the menace of nuclear conflagration. While we acknowledge and commend this development, we cannot, we must not, surrender our collective responsibility to make our world c safer place for humanity. The history of this century and of the United Nations cautions against this. We must never forget that the carnage from which this Organization arose might have been contained, or even averted, had it not been for the untenable notion that world peace could be the brokered product of bilateral interests, perception and prejudice. Disarmament is meaningless unless and until the wish for peace is shared by all people and their interests reflected at all levels of negotiation. No organization is better placed or equipped to advance this cause than the United Nations, despite perceptions to the contrary, the General Assembly and the Security Council have managed to reduce the incidence of armed conflict and avert the onset of a world war.\nThrough its specialized agencies, this Organization has done much to bring new hope to many areas of the world where life has been impoverished by illiteracy, disease, hopelessness and fear. Too often we are apt to overlook the contribution of non-governmental organizations. These groups of dedicated women and men work tirelessly among their communities to fulfil the lofty principles of this Organization. In various ways these groups render invaluable service to their governments and people.\nMuch of the mood of optimism present in the world must be attributed to the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General in pursuing the elusive goal of peace. Against the background of encroaching monetary crisis, his commitment to purpose and his dedication to ideals have inspired us all and may in fact have rescued this Organization from an unthinkable fate. The recent agreements on Afghanistan provide yet another example of the capability of the peace-making median isms of the United Nations and demonstrate the importance of the multilateral process in an increasingly complex world, a process which too often is underestimated and even undermined. The recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the peace-keeping forces, so richly deserved, gives recognition to the efforts of this Organization. This session will deal with many of the critical issues facing the great continent of Africa. The first days of this session found the Secretary-General, not on this podium, but in southern Africa employing his considerable diplomatic skill in diplomacy in an attempt to secure implementation of the Namibia plan and the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Resolution of the Namibian problem therefore now seems to lie within our grasp. It is my fervent hope that such a solution will lead to the inevitable freedom of our oppressed brothers and sisters in southern Africa.\nWe often state in these halls that apartheid must be eliminated. We have heard it in every speech. But have we really matched our deeds to our words? Have we done all that we could to ensure the unconditional release of that outstanding patriot Nelson Mandela? Have we used to full effect the application of comprehensive sanctions? We need to be ever vigilant to extend the freedom we enjoy to all people. I repeat the words so often used: \\\"We ate not free until we are all free.\\\"\nSignificant progress has been made in bringing peace to several areas of conflict. These have been enumerated in detail by many others. However, I will just mention them again for reinforcement and to ensure that it is known that my Government supports them.\nThe strains which have separated Algeria and Morocco are happily showing signs of easing. We owe it to succeeding generations to ensure that the United Nations plays its role in finding a just solution to the conflict in Western Sahara.\nThe conflict in Kampuchea has divided households and families and created millions of refugees. We hope that the Jakarta Informal Meeting held in July will encourage all concerned to redouble their efforts to achieve a speedy solution to the problem based on the right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own destiny, free from external interference. Let us at this forty-third session make every effort to assist in finding lasting solutions to their problems and achieving the reuniting of separated families, upon which the well being of nations rest.\nWe are happy that the French authorities and the people of New Caledonia have initiated a dialogue on the status of the Territory and that positive measures are being taken to promote political, economic and social development in New Caledonia, which would provide a framework for the peaceful progress of the Territory to self-determination, taking into account the rights and aspirations of the indigenous peoples.\nThe Charter recognizes the desirability of regional solutions to regional conflicts. For this reason, the efforts of Central American leaders to bring peace to that troubled region ate to be encouraged and supported by the international community.\nNever before has the international climate been more favourable for a concerted effort towards a permanent solution to the conflict in the Middle East. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that all legitimate interests are adequately accommodated, in the interest of a just and humane peace.\nWe must all be heartened by the progress towards peaceful settlement of long-standing conflicts now emerging in the many areas mentioned. However, we must not be lulled into a false sense of security until the promises now made are fulfilled through the requisite action. Much has been accomplished, but much more remains to be done.\nIt was my privilege to participate yesterday in the ceremony so ably organized as a tribute to the African diaspora. For roe, a daughter of the diaspora, it was a moving experience. The States of Africa and those of the Caribbean have much in common. They have faced and will continue to face intimidating obstacles in the course of their development. \nFew issues are of more immediate concern than the protection and beneficial management of the environment. Drought and desertification menace much of Africa's population. Hurricanes and floods cause frequent havoc in Asia and the Caribbean, that not all our threats come from nature, and not all are beyond our control. Irresponsible and criminal pollution of the land, sea and air now places in jeopardy the health and livelihood of citizens in many developing States. This matter is of special concern to us in the Caribbean, dependent as our economies are upon the ocean.\nScientific research continues to reveal pernicious threats to the environment, which threaten the very existence of the human race. I need mention, as has been done by others, only the so-called greenhouse effect of atmospheric pollutants and the depletion of the ox on e layer, which demand the urgent attention of the world community.\nThe causes of these problems are as diverse as the problems themselves. However, they all to some degree reflect our insensitivity to the fragile nature of the environment in which we must all exist. They challenge the ingenuity of the international community to devise new means of co-operation, what is needed more than ever before is universal acceptance of the principle of sustainable development. What is essential is a comprehensive reassessment and readjustment of our relationship to the environment; a concept of progress free of the wanton exploitation which has to date characterized our industrial efforts. This will not be an easy route and no doubt it will be necessary to provide developing countries with the resources to reflect such an approach in their development strategies, that we must keep uppermost in our minds is that the environment belongs to us all. For only with this realization can the necessary steps be taken to preserve the environment for the future of our children. \nReassessment and a readjustment of similar proportions is required in the way our societies relate to each other. I refer specifically to the relations between developed and developing States, between the industrialised and the non-industrialized.\nThe burden of external debt has reached the level of crisis. We have heard that again and again. It constitutes what must be considered the gravest threat to sovereignty ever encountered by States on their road to development. It undermines the vital capability of political leaders to satisfy the basic social and economic aspirations of their people. Inevitably, therefore, it engenders those social forces which work against civic calm and stability.\nThe problem of external debt cannot be isolated from the other enemies of social justice. While the burden falls disproportionately upon poorer nations, the eventual effect should offer little comfort to the more prosperous among us. There is no doubt that the upheaval in the economic and social life of these countries will generate repercussions throughout the international community, for such is the nature of our international economic system. The fates of creditor and debtor are inseparably bound.\nIf this Organization is to take seriously its mission to safeguard the welfare of future generations it must be given a greater say in the way in which this global problem of debt is addressed. We must be cautioned that unless meaningful co-operative efforts are made to assist developing States in the management of their debts the prospects for global economic recovery will be dim. However, developing countries must be more fully integrated, not only in the efforts to find solutions to the debt problem, but also in the search for a new order in the global economy. A situation in which appeals for the transfer of wealth and appropriate technology are met with antipathy while the transfer of wastes is being actively pursued suggests that ours is rapidly becoming a community of contempt. This is clearly in defiance of the United Nations Charter.\nThe scourge of the illicit trafficking in drugs now leaves no region of the world untouched by its destructive proficiency. The immediate target of this nefarious market is the youth of our societies.\nThe island States of the Caribbean with their open borders are uniquely vulnerable to the threat, located midway between the centres of production and the centres of consumption, these States have become unwilling units in the deadly interplay.\nThe Government of Barbados has always demonstrated a passionate dedication to the preservation of all those fundamental rights and freedoms necessary for the full development of the human spirit. It is a dedication nurtured by the experiences of slavery and colonization. It has resulted in the peaceful attainment and exercise of national sovereignty. In a few months time, Barbados will celebrate the three hundredth and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of its parliament, which, except for periodic elections, has met continually since 1639.\nIt is this tradition and this experience which fortify our faith in and commitment to this Organization, our faith in its effectiveness in protecting and promoting the welfare of humankind. We believe therefore that human rights, the rights of women, the preservation of our societies from the devastating effects of war, famine, drug addiction and disease are all priorities to which our collective attention must continue to be devoted.\nMr. President, you have assumed the presidency of this session at an historic moment in the life of the United Nations: at a time when the Organization faces a most challenging future; at a time when the demands on multilateral diplomacy are even more evident; at a time when there is ever more need for a rededication to the values of multilateralism. We are aware that yours will not be an easy task for the myriad problems that confront the Members of this Organization all deserve our attention, and we must demonstrate that as a family of nations we are concerned about the fate of all its members.\nThe United Nations is of course many things to many people. It is above all a forum for negotiating at all levels, from the bilateral to the multilateral. In this regard, the United Nations facilitates the viability of small States whose diplomatic outreach is constrained by their lack of resources. As Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld noted so very perceptively in this Assembly on 3 October 1960, it is the small States that need the United Nations for their protection.\n\\\"In this sense,\\\" he continued, \\\"the Organization is first of all their Organization and I deeply believe in the wisdom with which they will be able to use it and guide it.\\\" (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifteenth Session, 883rd plenary meeting, para. 11)\nWe pledge ourselves to that vision for we fully understand it.\nWe would do well to remind ourselves that this is an organization founded as a result of conflict and the context of its operations remains one of conflict. As such it presents an honest reflection of the human condition. We, all of us, exist in a state of perpetual tension. As individuals we are torn between our need for order and tranquillity and our innate abhorrence of fetters and restraint. As political societies we are torn between the demands of sovereignty and the realities of interdependence.\nSurrounded by this swirl of contending forces, the United Nations becomes something of a moral epicentre. We who gather here year after year must, in my view, seek not to remove such conflicts from our midst - our history suggests that that would be impossible - but, more realistically, to redirect these natural forces from the avenues of destruction to those of development. This is the fundamental task of the United Nations to convert the human condition from despair into hope.\nAs we reflect on the events of the past year we must see signs that reason and good will, when allowed to function promote progress and peace. What this Organization has done for four decades has been to provide an oasis of civility from which our several conflicts may be viewed with reason and good will.\nIt seems to me that we are justified in drawing from these developments renewed devotion to that cause which inspired the creation of the United Nations Charter. I suggest that our deliberations will be neither effective nor complete without constant regard for the ideals that motivate them. We may consider the words of Seneca, the Roman statesman and philosopher,\n\\\"Not to know what was transacted in former times is to remain always a child.\\\"\nIn full awareness of our past and in conscientious commitment to the future, the delegation of Barbados dedicates itself to the success of this session. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt gives me great pleasure that a distinguished son and eminent representative of a country with which my country has close and cordial relations is presiding over the General Assembly at its forty-third session. I extend to Ambassador Caputo our warm felicitations on his well-deserved election. We are confident that with his exceptional ability and experience the deliberations of the Assembly have already been assured success. I would like also to place on record our deep appreciation for the effective leadership that his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, provided to the General Assembly during its forty-second session.\nIn his report on the work of the Organization for 1988, the Secretary-General recalled that he was cautiously optimistic that \\\"the sails of the small boat in which all the people of the Earth were gathered seemed to have caught a light but favourable wind\\\". (\u0414/43/1, p. 2) I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the man who has played no mean role in the careful and patient navigation by which the vessel has come within sight of large sections of the shore. The Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, has earned the admiration of all for his patience, his skill, his understanding touch and his grasp of the larger questions as well as the small details involved in the various issues dealt with by the United Nations. The decision to confer the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding on our Secretary-General was a tribute to his exceptional contribution to the cause of peace.\nThis year, 1988, has been the year of the United Nations. In the past few months the patient and persistent diplomacy of the United Nations was capped with the signing of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan, the entry into force of a cease-fire on the Iran-Iraq border, the renewal of inter-communal talks in Cyprus and the creation of an environment conducive to the resolution of the problem of Western Sahara. Even those who tended to pass judgement on the United Nations purely on the basis of the criteria of the maintenance of international peace and security are happily acknowledging today that this is indeed an impressive record of which the United Nations can be justifiably proud. \nIndia welcomes this reaffirmation of faith in the United Nations. For an overwhelming majority of Members, support for the United Nations has always been an article of faith. The universalization of this support during 1988, which we applaud as we always did, will no doubt strengthen the capacity of the Organization, not only with respect to preserving peace but also, equally, to tackling other scourges facing humankind, such as poverty, hunger, ecological degradation, terrorism and narcotics. We trust that the United Nations will be reinvigorated, not only in political terms but also in terms of concrete financial support. Let the coming decades be the decades of the United Nations. Let the all-round support which the United Nations always deserved, but seems to have got this year, be always available to it hereafter.\nIndia, along with the rest of the international community, rejoices in the transformation of the international climate during the past year. We are indeed living through historic times. The dramatic improvement in relations between the super-Powers, for which we salute the leadership of the two countries, has had a positive impact throughout the world. History, however, teaches us that good times, like bad times, do not normally last forever. But one may be forgiven on the present occasion for entertaining the belief that the principal players have by now made a realistic assessment of the long-term interests of mankind, along with their respective national interests, and that hence the current thaw may be more lasting than those of the past.\nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, since its inception, has worked tirelessly precisely for such a turn in the international climate. By taking principled positions on major issues of our times and by refusing to get entangled in the confrontation of competing military alliances, the non-aligned countries have helped in containing conflict, and have thus contributed to the peace process which has always inhered in the minds of the millions, although it had been rendered dormant and muted by the display of military might. Therefore, we the non-aligned can claim part of the credit for the improved state of affairs. But along with claiming the credit the Movement needs to redouble its efforts to make the peace process irreversible, no longer vulnerable to the braking mechanisms which operated earlier owing to motivations too well known to need recounting.\nThe new air of euphoria is totally understandable as it marks a welcome departure from the intense and often bitter rivalry between the major Powers which at times brought the world to the brink of a catastrophe. It seems to have been replaced now by healthy competition for presenting proposals for strengthening peace, supporting the United Nations, saving the world from ecologic disaster, among others. It is true that this long-awaited spirit of change unfortunately has not extended to the economic field. We would therefore be well-advised to remain watch full and alert, while pursuing determined efforts to make the transformation to peace final and all-pervasive so as to comprehend all facets of human life and activity on our planet. While the primary responsibility would remain with the major Powers, the rest of us and, of course, the United Nations, can and must play a very important role.\nThe ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - by the United States and the Soviet Union was a historic first step which must, within an agreed time-frame and in well-considered stages, lead to successive reductions and eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons. While we are fully aware of the complexities involved in disarmament negotiations, we find that political will has enabled the experts to find satisfactory answers to what were projected as almost un-resolvable difficulties of adequate verification. Similar political will would be needed in solving the whole gamut of disarmament questions, beginning with the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons by 50 per cent, which has already been agreed upon.\nThose steps, each important in itself, have to be viewed in the perspective of a comprehensive scenario of total disarmament. Only thus do they make sense and become effective and beneficial. At the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament in June this year, my Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, put forward a comprehensive action plan for the total elimination of all nuclear weapons by the year 2010. That action plan has received appreciation in the Non-Aligned Movement, among other Governments as well as non-governmental organizations. We put forward our proposal to give concrete shape to the desire of a large segment of world public opinion for a time-bound action programme to eliminate nuclear weapons. We should also take into account other related aspects including verification.\nWith regard to verification, delegates will recall that the delegations of countries participating in the six-nation initiative for peace and nuclear disarmament presented a concrete proposal at the third special session on disarmament the endorsement, in principle, of an international verification agency within the United Nations. It is the intention of the six countries to revive this initiative at this session of the General Assembly.\nThe linkage between disarmament and development is by now well-recognized. Hardly anyone can dispute the proposition that the resources being spent on armaments could be more profitably employed in peaceful developmental activities. The decisions taken by the United Nations Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, held last year, need to be followed up and acted upon.\nRegional conflicts have dominated discussions at the current session of the General Assembly. This is perfectly understandable. Success in achieving breakthroughs is most of these conflicts is attributed, and justifiably so, to the patient diplomacy of the United Nations, as well as to the rapprochement between the two super-Powers. There is, perhaps, a lesson for all of us in this, particularly for the non-aligned and developing countries. If the tendency to seek massive external military assistance and to pursue dangerous nuclear weapon policies in the illusory hope of strengthening one's bargaining position with one's neighbours were resisted, there would be fewer regional conflicts and consequently less dependence on outside Powers for the solution of such conflicts.\nIndia rejoiced at the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq which came into effect on 20 August 1988. Thanks to the statesmanship of the leaders of the two countries and to the efforts of the Secretary-General, the international community has been spared witnessing the eighth anniversary of the war. The cease-fire is an important first step and must be consolidated. The negotiations between the two countries currently under way, under United Nations auspices, must be pursued. The issues involved are complex and highly emotional for both sides. India has been involved in discussing the issues in detail with the two countries as part of the efforts of the Non-Aligned Movement. That experience makes me feel confident that the issues, though complex, will eventually be solved. India has the closest of ties with Iran and Iraq, and we know that the two countries are anxious to get on with the stupendous task of reconstruction.\nMy country rejoices at the release of the Indian national, Mr. Mithileshwar Singh. We hope that all the other hostages will also be freed and reunited with their families at an early date.\nIndia has welcomed the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan. We have had historical ties of deep friendship with the people of Afghanistan. The Geneva Accords have established & framework which would enable the Afghan people to decide on their future free from foreign interference or intervention. While the withdrawal of Soviet troops has proceeded on schedule, we are greatly perturbed at persistent reports of violations of the Geneva Accords and hope that they will be implemented faithfully by all the parties. In addition to restoring peace and stability to the region, the implementation of the Geneva Accords would also remove the ostensible cause for introduction of sophisticated arms into the area.\nWhile positive developments have taken place in the Gulf as well as in Afghanistan, the continued great-Power naval presence in the Indian Ocean remains a factor contributing to tension and instability. We reiterate our call for the withdrawal of all military forces of outside Powers from the Indian Ocean so that it can emerge as a zone of peace.\nThere is more than a glimmer of hope for the resolution of the conflict situation in South-East Asia. The horrors suffered by the people of Kampuchea in the 1970s must not be allowed to revisit them ever. The dialogue at the Jakarta Informal Meeting was a welcome beginning, which we appreciate. We also applaud the initiative of the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to explore ways and means in which the Movement can assist the efforts to solve the Kampuchean problem. Given India's historical ties with the peoples of South-East Asia, we are ready and willing to contribute in whatever way we can to this process.\nIn our neighbourhood, we have watched with growing concern the trials and tribulations faced by the people of Burma, with whom the people of India are bound by close ties of history and culture. India has always scrupulously avoided interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. However, we cannot but sympathize with democratic aspirations. We are saddened by the growing number of innocent dead in Burma. We hope that a way will be found to end this tragic conflict as soon as possible.\nThere is renewed belief that the long-delayed solution to the Namibian question is at hand. Responsibility for the delay rests squarely with the South African Government, which has, with impunity, refused to comply with its international commitments and obligations. The world community is committed to the emancipation of the Namibian people engaged in a historic struggle for freedom under the leadership of the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO). Their sole and authentic representative. India was the first country to accord diplomatic recognition to the representative of it. We look forward to welcoming Namibia as the 160th Member of the United Nations at the General Assembly session next year.\nWhile there is movement on the question of Namibia, the situation in South Africa itself shows no sign of improvement. The racist Pretoria regime continues its reign of terror, subjecting the people of South Africa to the most inhuman forms of oppression. The evil system of apartheid cannot be reformed, it has to be abolished in total. South Africa must open \u0430 dialogue with the genuine representatives of the oppressed people. Nelson Mandela, the universal symbol of courage and fortitude, whose state of health is a cause of concern to all of us, must be released immediately and unconditionally. Effective pressure in the form of comprehensive mandatory sanctions must be applied, without invoking unconvincing arguments regarding their effect on employment of the oppressed people, and so on.\nThe Action for Resisting Invasion, Colonialism and apartheid (AFRICA) Fund, established by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, has received pledges and contributions from a third of the world community. Described at the recent meeting of the non-aligned in Nicosia, Cyprus, as an instance of the Movement's capacity for collective action, the Fund demonstrates an international commitment to the front-line States and liberation movements of southern Africa transcending geographical or political barriers.\nThe international 00tmunity should be opposed to racial discrimination no matter where it is practised. Last year my delegation referred to the unfortunate developments in Fiji, which had distinct racial overtones. He hoped that the groundswell of international public opinion would help restore the spirit of trust, harmony and concord which had prevailed in Fiji since its independence. As a Member of the United Nations and as a member of its Committee on decolonization, India had been in the forefront in the fight for Fiji's independence. It is a matter of great regret to us that the situation in Fiji has considerably deteriorated during the past year. There are clear indications that an attempt is being made to institutionalise racial discrimination in Fiji. We understand that there is to be a process of consultation with the various communities before the draft constitution is finalized. We hope that this process will enable all sections of the people to participate in it in a non-discriminatory manner. There was a time when Fiji used to be described as \\\"what the world should be like\\\". The racial harmony, peace and tranquillity in Fiji used to be a model for the world to follow. We hope that Fiji will return soon to those harmonious times.\nIndia's support of the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people has its roots in our own struggle against colonial rule. Many changes have taken place in the region. What has remained constant, however, is the determination of the Palestinian people. The message of intifadah to the world is unambiguous, 20 years of occupation have utterly failed to suppress the fierce nationalism of the Palestinian people. It should also have made it clear to the world, including Israel, that territories illegally occupied cannot be retained forever. Israel must withdraw from the territories it has occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem. We reiterate the call for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all the parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), on an equal footing. Such a conference, we believe, should facilitate the establishment of an independent homeland for the Palestinians and the creation of conditions in which all the States in the region can live within secure and recognized boundaries.\nIndia has always supported the aspirations of the people of Cyprus to live together in \u0448 independent and non-aligned country, with its territorial integrity intact. We deeply appreciate the resumption of dialogue between the two communities under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General. We urge both sides to spare no effort to find a solution to the problem within the time-limit envisaged by the Secretary-General.\nSimilarly, we ate heartened by the acceptance by the two sides concerned of the Secretary-General's proposals for finding a solution to the problem of Western Sahara. Here again, we hope that this question will be resolved satisfactorily so that the people of the territory, as well as other countries in the Maghreb, can live in peace and co-operation with one another.\nIn the Korean peninsula, which unhappily remains divided, there is an overwhelming sentiment in favour of peace, reconciliation and dialogue. We hops the aspirations of its people to peaceful reunification will find early fulfilment.\nThis year marks the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration, which furnishes the philosophical basis for the human rights work of the United Nations, is of seminal importance. Like the Charter itself, it points to the interdependence of human rights, social and economic progress and international peace and security. Over the past four decades, the concepts embodied in the Declaration have been developed and enriched, particularly with regard to economic, social and cultural rights. It remains our firm belief that the inherent dignity of the human person requires full respect for his civil and political rights and, equally, for his economic, social and cultural rights.\nWhile there; have been encouraging developments recently in the political sphere, the outlook in the area of international economic co-operation remains bleak. The low rates of growth of world trade and output in recent years will not suffice to resolve any of the major problems facing the world economy. In the industrialized countries high rates of unemployment persist, making it difficult for them to undertake the structural adjustments that ate necessary in the long term. The major imbalance, with its attendant uncertainties, continues to persist. For the developing countries the outlook is even worse. Inadequate resource flows, deteriorating terms of trade and the heavy burden of external debt have all but halted the development process of these countries. They have retarded attempts to address the fundamental problem of poverty and deprivation. The 1980s are being characterized as the lost decade of development.\nThe policies of the major developed countries constitute the essential determinants of the external environment for the developing countries. There has been no coherent and considered effort to fashion these policies on the basis of co-operative international action, taking into account their impact and consequences for the developing countries. Here it is useful to recall the proposals made by the developing countries for removing the structural deficiencies and fundamental failings of the international monetary, financial and trading systems. The underlying structural and systemic problems of the world economy have to be addressed by deliberate and co-operative international action that gives full recognition to global interdependence. Both the developed and the developing countries need to pursue convergent and mutually reinforcing policies in the interrelated areas of trade, money and finance.\nThe area of international trade is being increasingly characterized by an erosion of the accepted rules and regulations and by reliance on unilateral discriminatory action. Despite repeated affirmation of commitments on standstill and rollback, protectionism continues to grow unabated. Protectionist measures ate imposed in those areas where the developing countries have demonstrated their competitiveness and made investments for structural reforms. There has been little progress so far in the ongoing Uruguay Round on multilateral trade negotiations in areas of direct interest to the developing countries, such as safeguards, textiles, agriculture and tropical products. The Uruguay Round should provide an important opportunity for strengthening and preserving the multilateral trading system. It should also help to reduce the tensions and distortions that characterize the world trade system.\nThe proposals made in the new areas in the Uruguay Round have to be consistent with the right of developing countries to manage their economies in accordance with their national objectives and priorities, to regulate activities of transnational corporations and to channel investment into those desired sectors of their economies. Such proposals should promote the autonomous and self-reliant development of those countries.\nAnother area of concern is the stagnation or decline, in real terms, of resource flows to developing countries. The international financial system has failed to ensure the transfer of adequate resources on proper terms and conditions to developing countries and thus provide adequate financing for development activities. The alleviation of the current development crisis requires \u0437 more effective system that will guarantee an increasing flow of resources, in particular official development assistance resources, to developing countries and also guarantee access by international monetary and financial institutions to adequate resources.\nLet us collectively recognize the need to evolve a more broad-based system for managing the world economy that reflects the interests of all groups of countries and provides an equitable and harmonious basis for the collective management of global interdependence. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was a small step in this direction. In the coming days we must make use of other opportunities for building a renewed consensus on development directed against the global problem of hunger and poverty. The formulation and elaboration of an international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade provides such opportunity.\nThe virtual paralysis of the North-South dialogue makes it all the more important for the developing countries to redouble their efforts to collective self-reliance through the economic co-operation among developing countries. It has become imperative for developing countries to build on complementary in their economies. In this respect the conclusion in Belgrade earlier this year of the Agreement on the Global System of Trade Preferences was a significant achievement. It laid down for the first time among the signatory developing countries the legal and institutional foundation for trade expansion.\nIn our own region the formation of the South Asian Association of Regional Co-operation has provided a framework for wide-ranging economic and technical co-operation. Specific areas of mutually beneficial co-operation have been identified and practical measures are being implemented by member States.\nOne is, however, constrained to note that economic co-operation among developing countries has developed only partially and its full potential remains unexplored. What is needed is a hard look at concrete programmes to address, in the first instance and in the main, the elementary human needs of a large chunk of humanity. In these areas it is possible to make a better impact than has happened so far.\nDuring the current year many developing countries have been hit by natural disasters requiring urgent international relief operations. Large areas in Africa have been afflicted by prolonged drought. Jamaica has been devastated by a hurricane of unprecedented magnitude, and Sudan by floods. Our own region, South Asia, has witnessed widespread havoc caused by floods, above all in Bangladesh, though we too have not been spared the ravages of floods. It was our privilege, as a friendly neighbour, to be the first to go to the assistance of the people of Bangladesh in response to an appeal from the Government of Bangladesh. A task force of experts from Bangladesh and India has been set up to study the Ganga and Brahmaputra waters jointly for flood management and the water flow thereof. \nOver the past two decades, drug abuse and illicit trafficking in drugs have assumed proportions of a major global problem, not only affecting consumers but also posing serious problems for transit States. We hope that the Plenipotentiary Conference scheduled to convene in Vienna later this year in order to finalize a draft convention on this question will meet with success.\nThe United Nations is dedicated to the pursuit of the twin goals of peace and development. It can claim credit for significant achievements in both these spheres, and in particular in recent months we have seen encouraging progress in the resolution of complex political issues. But in the sphere of economic and social development, its major successes belong to past decades; its achievements recently have been relatively modest. We must renew our commitment to the eradication of the evils of poverty, disease and illiteracy through concerted international action. This is a struggle that must be waged in common by all humankind. As Jawaharlal Nehru told the Assembly in 1963, \\\"The only war we want is a war against poverty and disease and its brood\\\".\nMany centuries ago India's sages gave the calls \\\"Let us move, together. Let us talk, together. Let us be of single common mind.\\\"\nThe renewed sense of community witnessed in the United Nations today gives hope that over the coming year, in time for its forty-fourth session, the world body can set before itself a viable specific agenda for the 1990s that would help render our planet ready for the century drawing in upon it. Such an agenda must assess and chart the means of fulfilment of the minimum needs of man. The world, as Mahatma Gandhi put it, has enough to fulfil man's need, but not his greed. This distinction between need and greed becomes all the more real and crucial at a time when geo-environmental, geo-economic and geo-political imperatives have to be fully harmonized in the interest of survival. Runaway desires of imprudent humans must be tailored so as to be compatible with the capacity to fulfil them. If we collectively determine to do that, this forum, the United Nations, is the place where we must begin, for the United Nations is as strong, and only as strong, as the will of its Members.\nAnd when we talk of Members, let us not forget that behind the Member States represented in this Assembly are the men and women of the world. It is they that give this Organisation its flesh and its blood and should therefore legitimately dictate its aspirations and efforts. Their control over rulers who fall short of or go beyond their mandate is not as palpable as it should be, but that is part of man's constant aspiration, which the United Nations needs to be inspired by in order to give effective voice to the millions who cannot speak for themselves.\nThe United Nations should thus promote the ascendancy of peoples, translating into reality the relationships which the peoples would wish to have among themselves.\nInvested with a popular dimension, rooted in a time when the process of peace can be rendered irreversible and man's scarce energies given a chance to better his own being, this is the moment for the United Nations which should endure until the mission for humanity is completed.\nWe must not fail.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIn recent years those of us who have taken part in these debates have normally begun by giving a pessimistic description of the world situation and a list of conflicts and situations threatening international peace and security. The persistence of centres of tension and unjust situations and the emergence or worsening of certain disputes justified this gloomy picture and to some extent caused our warnings, our feeling of hopelessness faced with what appeared to be problems without a solution, to become a habit.\nThe United Nations was not spared that criticism. There was scepticism because of what was regarded as a paralysis of the Organisation's capacity as a mediator. We believe that the facts show that the criticism was groundless, and that, as we have affirmed in the past, this alleged weakness of the United Nations was caused only by a lack of as, element or in many cases the feeling of resignation of its Members.\nIn international relations there are two alternating tendencies: a period of co-operation follows one of conflict, like swings of a pendulum, though in practice the periods often overlap. It would seem that in recent years there has been a change from the phase of conflict towards that of co-operation.\nThe United Nations has played a part in this new dynamic. In fact, in many instances it has created the necessary framework in which the way towards a final settlement of long-lasting conflicts may at last be found, through dialogue and negotiation.\nThis year, and particularly in the last few months, a number of breakthroughs have taken place which can be attributed largely to the Organization. It gives me great satisfaction to begin this statement by expressing the recognition of the Argentine Government of the key role played by the Secretary-General. Mr. Perez de Cuellar has succeeded in giving orientation and drive to the trend of co-operation to which I have referred.\nOn the question of Afghanistan, after six years the determination and perseverance of the Secretary-General and of his Special Representative, now Ecuador's Foreign Minister, Mr. Diego Cordovez, led to the signing in Geneva of the agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan, guaranteed by the Governments of the United states and the Soviet Union.\nIn the case of Iran and Iraq we have also arrived at a cease-fire. Argentina, a non-permanent member of the Security Council, reiterates its commitment to the establishment of a just, honourable and lasting peace within the framework of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), and urges both parties to redouble their efforts towards building the future of peace and co-operation that both nations deserve.\nI consider it appropriate to emphasize at this point the momentum gained lately by the United Nations peace-keeping forces. In recent decades we have actively co-operated in various peace-keeping operations. Also, as an additional contribution to this undertaking, the Argentine Government today contributes personnel to the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.\nWithin this framework we also notice positive signs in the Maghreb region, and we welcome the resumption of diplomatic relations last May between Algeria and Morocco. We also view with hope the development of the process of consultations by the President of the Organization of African Unity and the Secretary-General of the United Nations with the countries of the region. We trust that just and lasting solutions to the question of Western Sahara may be found.  \nWe cannot fail to mention the encouraging aspects of certain other major issues. I refer here to the new talks that are taking place on Cyprus and South-East Asia and between the two Koreas. Recent developments also make it possible for us to look hopefully towards the future in southern Africa. We must not slacken our efforts until a just, democratic and egalitarian society has been established in an independent Namibia. The only internationally agreed basis for the peaceful settlement of that question is the United Nations plan for the independence of the Territory, contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). All the relevant conditions for implementing the plan have been met. We hope that the talks engaged in by the Governments of Angola, Cuba, the United States and South Africa may be a sign of a change in the attitude of South Africa, marked so far by defiance of the international community. However, if that is not so, and if, on the contrary, South Africa seeks to perpetuate illegally its policy of colonial occupation of the Territory of Namibia, the United Nations must take the necessary steps, including those provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter, to achieve its goal of making Namibia independent.\nIn parallel with these situations, we cannot but regard with concern the persistence of certain problems, with respect to which we must redouble our efforts, so that they are not left out of the phase of co-operation that I have mentioned.\nThe events that have been taking place since last December in the occupied Arab territories have added another element to the already unstable and explosive situation prevailing in the Middle East. A just and lasting solution to the situation in that region can be reached only if it includes both acknowledgement of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to live in their territory, with the authorities and form of government that they freely choose, and the right of all States of the region, including Israel, to live within internationally recognized boundaries. Argentina considers it necessary to open channels of negotiation in order to find viable formulas for all the parties concerned. In this context, the convening of an international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation and consent of all the parties, could be an appropriate mechanism.\nThe situation in Lebanon is again causing particular concern to the people and the Government of Argentina and occupying their attention. The Lebanese people must be able to exercise their inalienable right to live free of all foreign interference, thus recovering their full sovereignty.\nAnother question is that of ending the apartheid regime of the South African Government. The rejection of apartheid has been clearly reflected in many General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. There will be no peace in southern Africa until it is totally and definitively eradicated. The most appropriate, effective and peaceful way to achieve that is to apply mandatory sanctions against the Government of South Africa, under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nI should now like to refer to the situation in Central America, a question in which my country has a direct interest, and which affects in a special way the whole continent. Last year in this debate we highlighted the political will of the five Central American Presidents, who confronted the regional crisis by signing the Guatemala agreement. Our country, a member of the Contadora Support Group, has worked, and is continuing to work, towards a peaceful and negotiated solution to the problems of that region. We understand that the objectives sought by the United Nations can be achieved only if the principles of non-interference and self-determination are respected, without delays or conditions.\nWe believe that peace is directly linked to the concept of development. That is why we have sponsored the plan of assistance and co-operation for Central America worked out by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and adopted by the General Assembly this year. Since the signature of the Esquipulas II agreement, the countries of Central America have taken important steps towards peace. That shows that the way that has been chosen is the right and the only appropriate one consonant with the principles of the United Nations.\nThe difficulties that have emerged in recent months must be dealt with in the same spirit. We the countries of America that feel committed to contribute towards a solution to this crisis, are convinced that force, threat and economic coercion must be left behind - indeed, that they have become a thing of the past.\nOnly through co-operation, increasing integration and effective political will it be possible to initiate economic development, which is the key to any future stabilization. We are convinced that Latin America has entered upon a period of active solidarity in the solution of its problems. The initiatives of the Contadora Group and the Support Group resulted in the creation of the permanent mechanism for consultation and concerted political action. The Presidents of the Group, at their meeting at Acapulco, established a dynamic system for unifying the criteria for consultation and negotiation, with the basic aims of promoting the peace, development and democracy of our peoples, aims that are in agreement with the basic principles of the United Nations. \nOur work also includes other fundamental areas in which we must strengthen the co-operate phase upon which we have now entered: I am referring to disarmament, to social and humanitarian affairs, and to international economic relations.\nDisarmament, while it contributes to detente, ought also to be its logical consequence. The heads of State and Government of India, Greece, Mexico, Sweden, Tanzania and Argentina have continued to work actively in the Group of Six on the initiative for peace and disarmament, particularly in the priority task of nuclear disarmament.\nThe implementation of the Treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles is, undoubtedly, an important step in the process of disarmament. The possibility of reaching agreement on the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons is, in turn, another auspicious element in the area of bilateral disarmament. Both will undoubtedly benefit international peace and security. However, this new atmosphere is not yet reflected on a multilateral basis. We believe that the present session is a propitious occasion to reflect the possibilities offered by this new situation in the field of disarmament.\nThe convergence in political will should allow the Conference on Disarmament to make progress on such priority issues as stopping nuclear-weapons tests and preventing an arms race in outer space, as well as on the early conclusion of the preparation of a convention banning chemical weapons on a non-discriminatory basis.\nWith regard to Argentina, we cannot, in dealing with this central issue of the United Nations over-all policy on disarmament, fail to mention the situation in the South Atlantic. Our country has fully and resolutely supported the initiative of the General Assembly, as reflected in resolutions 41/11 and 42/16, in which the South Atlantic has been declared a zone of peace and co-operation. The South Atlantic has been subjected to an unjustified militarization by nuclear-weapon States, which have established bases, carried our manoeuvres and moved their naval units in the area without restrictions, thereby adversely affecting the security of the region as a whole.\nFor that reason a firm and vigorous response was called for. The States that co-sponsored the resolutions to which I have referred have worked actively towards the establishment of a concrete and effective means of consolidating peace and security in the region pursuant to General Assembly resolution 42/16. The final document produced by those countries and signed at Rio de Janeiro last July sets forth some basic principles; the issues of peace and security are linked with those of development and militarily significant Powers are urged to reduce their military presence and show restraint in this regard, banning the introduction of nuclear armaments.\nIn the social and humanitarian field, my delegation wishes to associate itself with the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nNor can we fail to refer to the question of drug trafficking. We are resolutely determined to fight against that scourge, and we acknowledge the effort being made by our Latin American brothers, despite the difficult economic circumstances they are experiencing.\nProgress in the political field is in sharp contrast with the prospects for international economic relations. The truth is that, with regard to the question of development, little or nothing has been accomplished in the past few years. The main consequence of this omission during the present decade has been that the developing countries, particularly those of Africa and Latin America, have not been able to contribute to the growth of the international economy in a manner proportionate to their potential.\nThe growing external debt of those countries has caused a massive reverse flow of financial resources that is setting up insurmountable barriers against the imports of the developing world and is posing a formidable obstacle to the growth of world trade. Sharp increases in interest rates, restrictions on commodity trade and protectionist measures in the industrialized countries, along with the enacting of subsidies for their own agricultural exports, indicate the lack of a global development strategy.\nAs part of any global strategy it is essential that substantial progress be made towards the liberalization of international trade at the new round of multilateral negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which the mid-term review, to be held at Montreal in December, should agree suggested by the Cairns Group at its meeting at Bariloche, upon long-term reform in agricultural policy, a contractual freeze and a gradual reduction in agricultural support and subsidy measures and other policies that cause the greatest amount of economic distortion.\nThe new strategy for global development must focus on a lasting solution to the problem of debt, which encompasses, on the one hand, a continuing process of structural reforms in the debtor countries and, on the other hand, the reduction of the total amount of indebtedness and a real transfer of financial resources towards those countries.\nDevelopment is also necessary to ensure global security, within the framework of interdependence which I mentioned earlier. This analysis of the international situation and the dynamic process in which we are immersed leads to me share with you some thoughts about the internal functioning of our Organization. In 1985, the United Nations decided to initiate a process of reform that would enable it to respond to the challenges facing it with the greatest effectiveness and efficiency. Since then many efforts have been exerted in the search for formulas acceptable to all. However, much remains to be done. We believe that if we are to rely on the United Nations as a suitable instrument capable of meeting the needs of our times, we must as soon as possible move beyond this transitional stage. We are convinced that we will find solutions satisfactory to all. To achieve that, we are willing to make our contribution and to co-operate in the quest for agreements that will enable us to implement the objectives we set forth in General Assembly resolution 41/213. \nAt the same time it is indispensable that the Organization be provided with stable financing so it may be in a position to give us what we expect from it. Otherwise, we alone shall be to blame. Thus, each Member State must continue to make every effort to fulfil its obligations without imposing conditions not provided for in the Charter.\nI wish to conclude my statement by referring to two matters on our agenda that are of special importance to my country. The first is the question of Antarctica. Argentina is linked to that continent by sovereignty, history and continuity. As an original signatory of the Antarctic Treaty, Argentina has participated actively in creating an effective and flexible system, open to all States, which has kept the continent free from conflicts, ensured that it be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and prevented it from becoming a setting for international discord.\nThe second is the question of the Malvinas, an old colonial issue that has existed since the earliest stages of Argentina's independent development. A settlement became a real possibility with the advent of the decolonization movement encouraged by the United Nations, The Assembly is aware of, and has shown unmistakable signs of agreeing with, the constant willingness of the Argentine Government to achieve a just and final solution to this matter, which has high priority in my country's foreign policy.\nSince 1965 a succession of resolutions have called for negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom to reach a peaceful solution of outstanding problems, in particular the problem of the future of the Malvinas Islands. These resolutions lay stress on Argentina's efforts to comply with the demands of the international community, but so far these have been repeatedly thwarted by the position of the British Government, which has refused to begin comprehensive negotiations,, despite the efforts of the Secretary-General, whose mission of good offices to bring together the parties to the dispute has been and continues to be acknowledged by Argentina.\nThe recent heightening of tension in the area owing to measures that deepen the differences between the two countries is another source of concern for the region and the world\u00b7, this makes the prompt resumption of bilateral contacts even more essential.\nWhile reaffirming its sovereign rights over the Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the adjacent seas, Argentina reiterates its willingness to enter into a dialogue with the United Kingdom, a wide-ranging, sincere dialogue, without pre-conditions, which would take into account and respect the interests of the inhabitants of the islands so as to ensure their well-being and prosperity.\nOn this issue, as well as on other regional and global problems, my country is ready to co-operate actively in fulfilling the fundamental purposes of this Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI am pleased to convey to you, Sir, on behalf of the Government and people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the warmest congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. Your election to that exalted office undoubtedly indicates the high standing of your country, Argentina, and at the same time confirms your well-known ability and experience and your great diplomatic skill, which will certainly be of the greatest assistance to us in ensuring the success of our work and the achievement of the desired results. \nIn like manner I am happy to express thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, for the consummate skill with which he presided over the work of our last session, which had a major impact in terms of the marked successes it achieved.\nIt also gives me pleasure, at the outset of my statement, to convey to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the gratitude and appreciation of the Government and people of my country for his continuing efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations and for this year's valuable report on the work of the Organization, which in our view will represent an extremely important contribution to the success of our deliberations at the current session. We wish him every success in the tasks before him. \nThe decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988 to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is for us a source of the greatest gratification and pride. The award, coming as it does at this precise juncture, transcends any narrow sense of tribute-paying and conveys the widest recognition and strongest intimation of the vital and essential role that the United Nations continues to play in the preservation and maintenance of international peace and security. The decision demonstrates a just evaluation of the significance of the role of the United Nations and is a triumph for the multilateral principle in action. The Norwegian Nobel Committee was correct in pointing out that the United Nations peace-keeping forces represent the manifest will of the community of nations to achieve peace through negotiation, and that the forces, by their presence, have made a decisive contribution to the initiation of real peace negotiations. On this momentous occasion, I extend sincerest congratulations to the Secretary-General, to whom, because of the role he has assumed and the active contribution he has made, must go a great deal of the credit for the award of this most prestigious Prize.\nWe participate in the present session of the General Assembly imbued with the hope of working in co-ordination with Member States with c view to reaching the best possible results, particularly since the problems facing mankind are of a global character and thus require that the international community share in their solution. In so doing, there is no alternative to dialogue, diplomacy and negotiation, which are a moral imperative and a logical prerequisite for the creation of a better world.\nMy country believes that the United Nations, whose Charter was drawn up in the higher interest of all Member States, continues to be indispensable to the world's people, and that the full utilization of its capabilities and States' vigilance in being guided by its Charter in the formulation of their foreign policies will enhance the Organization's effectiveness and strengthen its role in the settlement of conflicts, the solution of regional and international problems and the maintenance of international peace and security.\nProceeding from Jordan's commitment to the Charter, we reaffirm that the principles of the United Nations and its authority are two pillars which are indissolubly linked with the implementation of the resolutions adopted by it. We therefore reject partiality and selectivity in the application of its resolutions, particularly those involving such political and moral principles as the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, the rejection of foreign occupation, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the right of peoples to self-determination, we consider such resolutions, particularly those relating to the questions of Palestine, the Middle East, Lebanon, the Iraq-Iran conflict, Namibia, Cyprus and Kampuchea, to be vital and to be reinforced by the purport of the relevant international instruments..\nThis session of the General Assembly is perhaps distinguished by the fact that it comes in the midst of new developments and positive changes at the international level, as exemplified by the climate of international harmony that has accompanied the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles and made possible substantial breakthroughs with respect to numerous regional problems - in Afghanistan, Central America, Kampuchea, Namibia and Angola - and by the highly positive development in the context of the Iraq-Iran conflict represented by the cease-fire and the trend towards peace. This should encourage \u0438 and provide us with the incentive to step up the efforts made to address the long-standing issues and problems that currently jeopardize regional and international security and stability, including the Middle East problem, at the core of which is the question of Palestine, and the policy of apartheid in South Africa. \nWe are thus hopeful that all the positive developments and all the indications of detente that we have witnessed in the past year will be channelled towards strengthening the United Nations itself, particularly the Security Council, and will enable it to fulfil the role required of it in the current situation.\nThere can be no doubt that the efforts made by the Secretary-General and his personal assistants highlight in an unequivocal manner the importance of the United Nations in devising solutions to pending issues. We have evidence of that in the long and sustained efforts made under the leadership of the Secretary-General until they were crowned by success in the signing of the Afghanistan Accords, the successful entry into force of the cease-fire arrangements between Iran and Iraq and the subsequent talks embarked upon with a view to terminating the state of war and achieving a comprehensive and just settlement of the conflict between the two neighbouring countries\nIn this connection, and at a time when we recognize the urgent need to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations and give it the thrust it needs to have a new reign in pursuing the tasks, activities and responsibilities entrusted to it, it is also evident that the Organization's financial crisis is becoming increasingly acute, to the point where it dangerously jeopardizes the continuity of the Organization's work and perhaps its very existence, and thus threatens to destroy the hopes placed in it by mankind.\nWe are even more saddened and concerned by the fact that the roots of the crisis do not lie in any inability to pay but stem, rather, from a serious decline in respect for the legal, political and moral commitment to the United Nations and the principles for which it stands. This being the case, the focus must be on addressing the crisis more as a problem arising out of the decisions made by States than as one of tapping resources. \nThis does not absolve us from recalling that the immediate causes of the crisis are default, withholding and procrastination by certain States in the payment of their assessed contributions on time. This constitutes a breach by those States of one of their most important international obligations to the Organization as the focus of mankind's hopes for security and prosperity. Thus, while calling upon those Member States to respond to the appeals of the Secretary-General to pay their overdue contributions now and their future contributions on time, we are hopeful that action will be taken to ensure an effective solution to the Organization's financial crisis over the long term by devising a stable system of financing with a sound organizational structure that will prevent any party from bringing financial pressure to bear to influence the functioning or independence of the Organization.\nIn presenting our view of the major international issues and problems I will begin with the Middle East region in the very midst of whose conflict, at the core of which lies the question of Palestine, my country, Jordan, finds itself. That region has become a living embodiment of the international community's state of decline and one of the most dangerous hotbeds of tension in the world, just as it has come to mirror the attempts made to diminish the role of the United Nations. There, expansionism prevails, the Organization's impotence in the face of events in the region is evident, and competition among the great Powers has found such fertile soil that the legitimate interests of the peoples of the region take second place to theirs.\nMore than 21 years of Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Syrian Arab Golan Heights have now elapsed. At the outset, Israel claimed that it was prepared to withdraw from those territories as part of a comprehensive settlement that would guarantee its peace and security. The falsity of that claim has become clear so that all are now convinced that Israel has no intention of withdrawing from the territories it has occupied. From the beginning of the occupation it set about annexing Arab Jerusalem and implanting settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and it proceeded to destroy their separate economic structures. At the same time it showed persistent opposition to Arab and international peace moves and initiatives and to the United Nations resolutions relating to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Deluded by its military success in 1967 Israel persisted in endeavouring to go against the logic of history and the Charter of the United Nations by changing the temporary character of its occupation into a permanent reality without regard for the lessons of history and without calculating the consequences. \nThese circumstances, created as they are by Israel and by the practices it has continued to pursue for 21 years circumstances which do not provide a fitting background for the co-existence of peoples and which constitute a grave obstacle to the potential for peace rather than a sound basis for its achievement have begotten and provoked a very major development in the context of the question of Palestine and the Middle East problem as a whole. And that is the uprising of the Palestinian Arab people under occupation in all parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, an event the developments of which are followed by the whole world through political news reports and the international media which have brought out Israelis true character and revealed the horror and abomination of its oppressive practices directed against a defenceless civilian population which rejects occupation. The uprising has underscored the consensus of the Palestinian people on rejecting and resisting the occupation and has conveyed to the conscience of the world a cry for help in bringing that occupation to an end just as it has brought home to Israel that the mere passage of time since the occupation began does not make that a fait accompli has been irrevocably established and that the question is closed. To attribute the uprising to causes other than the sense of frustration and despair at finding a way out of the impasse of occupation that is felt by citizens under occupation is tantamount to an attempt to ignore the true state of affairs. Most unfortunately the negative and savage approach adopted by the Israeli occupation authorities in coping with the uprising indicates that Israeli attitudes are still dominated by ideas of intimidating the inhabitants of the occupied territories and using force and violence as means of settling the conflict. Instead of reconsidering its erroneous posture and responding immediately to Arab or international peace initiatives or even initiatives proposed by its friends Israel has resorted to procrastination and manoeuvre as well as to persistent talk of what is rejected by the Arabs and internationally unacceptable, for the purpose of perpetuating the occupation and implementing its unlawful schemes. In the same way, it has engaged in attempts to impose a blackout on what is happening in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in order to conceal the full extent of the force and violence with which the array of occupation confronts defenceless Palestinian citizens. \nJordan, which has lived through the tragedy of the Palestinian people in all its dimensions from the very beginning and which bears the greater part of the burden of its humanitarian, economic, social and political impact, has always called for reason, moderation and the search for a just and durable solution. In adopting that course, its people has identified itself with the hopes and travails of the Palestinian people. In 19S0, Jordan united its destiny with that of the West Bank voluntarily and of free choice in a constitutional unity, achieved through democratic methods, which stipulated that both banks of the Jordan would respect the historical rights of the Palestinian people and preserve their rights in any settlement in keeping with international law. The union of the two banks forms the basis in international law and the principles of international legitimacy on which Jordan relied in its political moves to end the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank begun in 1967, in its turn. Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which was adopted by consensus, also gave concrete expression to the importance and legitimacy of Jordan's legal role in working for, and demanding, an end to the occupation. Jordan nevertheless responded positively to the situation which emerged on the Arab scene in 1374 with the proclamation of the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Despite the fact that our acceptance of that situation created something of a duplication of roles, we coped with it by endeavouring to reconcile our role in Jordan, under the umbrella of constitutional unity between the two peoples and international law, with that of the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We were, accordingly, prompt to lend it our support in international forums, to co-operate with it in order to facilitate its political action and to secure its participation as a key party to international peace initiatives, particularly in the light of the declared positions of the United States and Israel to the effect that they would refuse to deal with the Palestine Liberation Organisation.\nJust as Jordan responded to the call made to it by the Arab States at the 1974 Rabat Summit to continue to deal with the West Bank through Jordanian institutions in order to support the steadfast resistance of the Palestinian people under occupation, it has also responded, further to the Arab Summit Conference held at Algiers last June, to the desire of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and in accordance with the inter-Arab policy on the matter, to stress the Palestinian identity of the land of Palestine both formally and substantively by severing the legal and administrative link between the two Banks. That may perhaps also prompt the States concerned, whether directly Involved or in a position to bring strong influence to bear, to face up more realistically and more seriously to the responsibilities that devolve upon them with respect to the attainment of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace and to enabling the Palestinian people to achieve its legitimate rights and to live in freedom and dignity like all other peoples of the world. For our part, we in Jordan are hopeful that this step will also support the valiant uprising and highlight the role of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, in its endeavour to establish an independent Palestinian State on the soil of the Palestinian homeland. At the same time, we resolutely assert that Jordan will continue to perform its national role as a major party to the Arab-Israeli conflict and to fulfil its duty in assisting the Palestinian, people and supporting its legitimate struggle to achieve its national goals, and we shall do this on the basis of our special and distinctive relationship with the land and people of Palestine. Palestinian identity has at no time been in conflict with or opposition to Jordanian identity. Bather, when we speak of the question of Palestine and ' Palestinian rights, we are referring to a particular land and a specific people that inhabited that land for many centuries before Israel uprooted it in 1948 and dispersed it in the Diaspora going beyond that in 1967 to occupy the entire territory of historical Palestine and place one and a half million Palestinians under its occupation in what is a horrendous prison. This, then, is the problem, and it will only be solved by Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian and other Arab territories that it occupied in 1967, by respect for the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland, by enabling the Palestinian people to exercise its inalienable rights, principally its right to self-determination and to establish an independent State on the soil of its homeland, and by guaranteeing the right of all States of the region, including Israel, to live in peace within secure and recognized borders.\nIn our view, the only way to achieve such a settlement is through Israel's acceptance of and agreement to the holding of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East as the sole means of conducting direct negotiations between all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, within an international framework, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council, on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and the various United Nations resolutions relating to the question of Palestine, the rights of the Palestinian people and the Arab-Israeli conflict in general. The United Nations, through its Charter and its resolutions, represents the natural and proper framework for the achievement of such a settlement, particularly since it is the forum which gave rise to the Palestinian issue. There is an urgent need for new thinking by the Israeli leadership, since it must accept the International Conference as representing the only way to a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement, thus breaking the vicious circle of violence, oppression and moral decline. The pretexts advanced by Israel, such as its fear of the possibility of bringing upon itself international pressures which would place its security in danger, have no basis in truth since one of the key goals of the Conference is to overcome mutual suspicion by guaranteeing the security of all, a security that neither of the parties can achieve at the expense of the other. Failing that, we see no secure future for Israel until it withdraws from the occupied territories. \nIt cannot have both land and peace, and its security will not come from occupying territory or creating defensible borders. It is genuine peace with the Arabs that will ensure its future and provide it with security. The popular uprising in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has demonstrated the falsity of Israeli claims that those areas are essential to its security, and Israel has created for itself a security impasse by persisting in its occupation and attempting to subject the Palestinian people by force.\nIn this connection, we should like to stress that the Security Council, having been established for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security, is entrusted with a unique mandate and accorded certain privileges and because of its political make-up and its international prestige, it is an effective instrument of pressure and action for the convening of the international peace conference on the Middle East, This should take place as soon as possible, given the gravity of the situation with regard to the popular uprising in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, a situation which also requires the Security Council to remain on the highest state of alert and to face its responsibility by adopting immediate measures to protect the civilian population.\nWith regard to the situation in Lebanon, we in Jordan call for the full and speedy implementation of all the resolutions adopted by the Security Council on the question, particularly those calling for full and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and the deployment of United Nations forces up to the internationally recognized borders. We call for the restoration of Lebanese sovereignty over all Lebanese territory regardless of any Israeli pretexts for prolonging its occupation of southern Lebanon. This would provide the basis for reconciliation in Lebanon and the restoration of the unity, security and stability of that peaceful country. \nThe constitutional crisis through which Lebanon is currently passing is a grave and momentous development, one that requires the co-operation of all parties concerned if they are to reach an agreement reflecting the consensus of all communities and factions in the country on the principle that democracy should be strengthened, on the election of a new President of the Republic and on adhering to an order that will guarantee the unity of the land and people of Lebanon, thereby preventing the advent of a situation that might constitute a step towards the partition of the country. The international community is fully aware of the formidable risks inherent in any partition of Lebanon and the dismantling of its social and political order. Serious damage would be done to the security and stability of the countries of the Middle East region, with a consequent negative impact on international peace and security in general. We pray God that the times of anguish the people of Lebanon is undergoing today will soon turn to times of glory in which it will triumph over the intricacies of the crisis and, through the support and assistance provided to it, achieve overall national reconciliation in a free and united Lebanon, restore the basic economic and social structures of its homeland and achieve the security and prosperity to which it aspires.\nJordan welcomes the recent developments in the Iran-Iraq war in terms of the, cease-fire and the moves for peace through direct negotiations. We view these negotiations as a key mechanism with which the two parties should persevere in their endeavour to discuss all the points at issue and address all the causes and manifestations of the obstinate conflict between the two neighbouring States, with a view to reaching a just, lasting and comprehensive peace ensuring stability, good-neighbourliness and close co-operation between them and all other parties in the region. We call foe efforts to be stepped up to impart to the ongoing negotiations between the two countries the political and moral thrust that will make it possible to discuss the conflict and the pending problems associated with it within a framework of judicious political and diplomatic action. While, in this connection, we call attention to the flexibility and commitment to international responsibility which has characterized the political position of Iraq since the outset of the conflict, and which also continues to guide it in the present negotiations between the two countries, we hope that that will be appreciated and reciprocated in a spirit of goodwill and lead to the signing of the treaty of peace, friendship, co-operation and good-neighbourliness guaranteeing the security, prosperity and progress of the peoples of the region as a whole.\nThe achievement and signing of the Afghanistan Accords has also been a source of gratification to us, and we hope that they will be implemented in letter and spirit in order to enable the people of Afghanistan to exercise its right to self-determination in such a manner as to ensure the unity, integrity, independence and neutrality of Afghanistan within the framework of commitment to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. We are happy, in this context, to commend the important role played by the United Nations, and the role and efforts of the Secretary-General personally, which, with the co-operation of the parties concerned, made it possible to achieve such positive results.\nSimilarly, it is with much hope that we have followed the latest developments towards detente in connection with the problem of Namibia. We therefore endorse the negotiations being conducted by the delegations of Angola, South Africa, Cuba and the United States to pave the way for the independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1976), in the hope that the Secretary-General of the United Nations will be able to announce a beginning of the implementation of that resolution as early as possible this year with a view to achieving independence for Namibia so that it can take its proper place among nations. \nIn the same spirit of optimism and support, we have been following the positive developments with respect to the situation in Central America and the signing of the agreement at Esquipulas, in Guatemala, and we hope that a common understanding for the settlement of all the problems of the region and the establishment of security and peace there will be reached. This represents the necessary basis for overcoming the economic and financial problems from which the States of the region are suffering and ensures the security and welfare of their peoples.\nIn general, the principles on which ray country's policies are based, particularly those relating to the right of peoples to self-determination, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and rejection of occupation, govern its positions on all other international conflicts. In this context, my country welcomes the dialogue that has begun between the parties to the conflict in Kampuchea, with a view to achieving a just and definitive political settlement ensuring the withdrawal of foreign forces and the right to self-determination of the Kampuchean people. We also welcome, in that connection, the recent efforts of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the States of Eastern Asia to promote dialogue and achieve the desired settlement.\nIn like manner, my country also endorses all the moves made to achieve detente and conciliation in the Korean peninsula. The process of dialogue between the two Korean parties must therefore be encouraged in order to build confidence between them as an important and indispensable foundation for the achievement of peaceful unification of the two countries. We will support and endorse that move on the grounds that a united Korea would, in our view, constitute a guarantee of peace, stability and prosperity in that important region of the world. We welcome the idea of both States becoming Members of the United Nations, especially since that would provide an opportunity for them to meet within the United Nations framework in accordance with its principles and work to bring their points of view closer together.\nJordan calls for a speedy peaceful settlement of the Cyprus problem through dialogue between the island's two communities, with a view to achieving a settlement that will ensure the unity and sovereignty of Cyprus and its non-aligned status. The recent meeting between the President of Cyprus, Mr. George Vassilou, with the leader of the Turkish community, Mr. Rauf Denktash, under the patronage of the Secretary-General, was a positive sign and indicated that the two parties to the dispute had the political will and genuine desire for constructive dialogue we hope will continue in an atmosphere of mutual confidence to achieve the desired negotiated settlement. In that connection, we endorse the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General and the good offices he is making available to the parties concerned with that end in view.\nThe situation in South Africa does not differ greatly from that in the Middle East because the African States suffer from the racist and aggressive policies of the Government of South Africa and because of the practices of oppression, repression and violence that this regime continues to pursue against the oppressed majority of the population in a vain attempt to suppress the national resistance and perpetuate the policy of apartheid. The Government of my country reaffirms its support for and solidarity with its brothers on the African continent in their just struggle, in which the entire international community participates in order to persuade or compel the Government of South Africa to abandon its policy of apartheid and transform the State into a democratic, unitary country. Here again we cannot fail to stress the role of the United Nations in meeting the need to monitor and condemn the co-operation that exists between Israel and South Africa in the military and nuclear fields, because of the threat that co-operation poses to the African continent and the peace and security of the world as a whole.\nTo complete my presentation of Jordan's viewpoint on the regional and international issues and problems that threaten the security and peace of our peoples, I must refer to the question of disarmament. In our view, disarmament is a basic element in the restructuring of all areas of international relations to establish a comprehensive order of peace, security and prosperity in a world free of violence, in which priority will be accorded to the preservation of human life and the achievement of cultural, scientific and economic progress for human society. That cannot be achieved without eliminating nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. My country welcomed the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles by the two super-Powers with satisfaction. It sees this as the beginning of nuclear disarmament and an important step in preparing the political climate for the continuance of efforts towards comprehensive disarmament. We look forward to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations, to enable it to give the necessary thrust in seizing this historic opportunity and making the process of disarmament and detente permanent and irreversible. \nIn conclusion, we believe that the surmounting of the political problems and international conflicts that deplete human potential and waste financial resources will not be enough to achieve peace in the long term if it is not combined with development. This is particularly true since the world economic situation today is far from reassuring would the slow economic recovery achieved by the industrialized countries has not expanded to a degree that ensures its reaching the developing countries, whose progress is essential for the sound development of the world economy as a whole. These countries continue to face deficits in their balance of payments as a result of the fall in commodity prices and growing protectionist trends on the one hand and the rising prices of their imports of manufactured goods on the other. In combination, these factors have led to a drop in exports and foreign currency earnings and consequently aggravated the debt-servicing burdens of the countries concerned. Accordingly, the industrialized countries and the international institutions must take effective measures to enable the developing countries to overcome their economic crises  and they must do this in a context that takes account of the global nature of the world economy and the need for intensification of the North-South dialogue.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffForty years ago this month, my compatriot Count Police Bernadotte was murdered during his mission as United Nations mediator on Palestine. His name reminds us of the planned political violence which, however meaningless, is still a reality. His name also reminds us that the practical work for peace and security has been a central task of the United Nations during its entire existence.\nThe world's expectations of the United Nations have varied over the years. The United Nations role in recent efforts for peace has once again raised expectations.\nLast year we were many in this Assembly who discussed how the United Nations was to overcome the crisis that threatened its existence. The issue today is how the Organization can live up to the expectations, how the United Nations can best make use of the \\\"window of opportunity\\\" that has opened.\nUnder the skilful leadership of the Secretary-General, the United Nations has contributed to creating new opportunities for solving conflicts and restoring peace. Strong support for the United Nations work for peace is called for. Such support would also contribute to making the United Nations the strong and effective organization that is needed if we are to meet the global challenges of the 199Us\u00ed halting the arms race, protecting the environment, safeguarding our resources and promoting development.\nThe threats to our survival are coming from various directions. We are becoming increasingly dependent on global co-operation. It is the United Nations that must channel and organize this co-operation.\nThe cease-fire between Iran and Iraq has brought to an end eight years of war with immense human suffering and immeasurable material damage. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the Secretary-General's intensive work to implement the resolution have been important contributions. The negotiations that have been initiated have Sweden's strong and active support. Consequently, Sweden has responded in a positive way to the Secretary-General's request for participation in the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group. The Swedish Government was honoured that the Secretary-General, in consultation with the patties, appointed Mr. Jan Rliasson, Sweden's Ambassador to the United Nations, to be his personal representative at the peace negotiations. It is our fervent hope that the parties will show goodwill and succeed in achieving a comprehensive, just and honourable settlement.\nUnited Nations peace efforts have also made progress in the Afghanistan conflict. Sweden supports the endeavours to carry through the Geneva agreements, not least by participating in the United Nations Observer Group in the area.\nPeace has not yet come to Afghanistan. Continued warfare is delaying the enormous work of reconstruction that needs to be carried out. The millions of refugees cannot yet return in safety. It is of utmost importance that the United Nations be given a central and co-ordinating role in the repatriation of refugees and in the reconstruction of the country. In the past years Sweden has given humanitarian assistance to the war victims in Afghanistan. We also intend to give strong support to the assistance programme being prepared through the United Nations Co-ordinator of Humanitarian and Economic Aid to Afghanistan.\nIn the Middle East, the uprising in the territories occupied by Israel has created a new situation. The people in the occupied territories have clearly shown that they no longer accept their plight. Israel's continued control over these areas rests on force. Ws condemn Israel's brutal oppression of the Palestinians. The occupation must cease and Israel withdraw from all the territories occupied since 1967. This is the path to the achievement of a lasting peace. A heavy responsibility rests upon Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They must recognize each other as negotiating parties. Israel must recognize the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, including the right to establish a State of their own. The Palestinians must recognize Israel's right to exist within secure boundaries. Both the PLO and Israel have to accept and implement resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Both sides must renounce terror. An international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of all the parties directly concerned, is the path that should be taken as soon as possible. To oppose this is to oppose the quest for peace. \nProgress has been made in the negotiations between Angola, Cuba and South Africa. The negotiations must lead to independence for Namibia based on Security Council resolution 435 (1978), and also to peace for Angola. Sweden confirms its undertaking to assist the United Nations in this process through, among other things, participation in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. Sweden is also prepared to enter into extensive development co-operation with a free and independent Namibia, as we did with the frontline States.\nSettlement of the Questions of Angola and Namibia will not eliminate the root cause of conflict in southern Africa, which remains apartheid. South Africa's apartheid policy and its destabilization of neighbouring countries continue to constitute a massive violation of human rights and a threat to international peace and security. Pending a United Nations decision on effective sanctions against South Africa, Sweden has introduced a ban on both trade with and investments in South Africa and Namibia. This is in accordance with a Nordic programme of action. We hope that our measures and those of other countries are the embryo of massive pressure on South Africa to abolish the apartheid system.\nThe search for a peaceful settlement in Kampuchea is still at a preliminary stage. A peaceful solution requires that the Vietnamese troops be withdrawn and that the Kampuchean people be allowed to decide their own future. Also, guarantees must be given that atrocities of the kind that took place during the years 1975 to 1979 are not to be repeated.\nThe best foundation for peace in Central America continues to be the peace plan signed by five Presidents of the region a year ago. Great efforts have been made to implement the peace plan, but the breakthrough has yet to come. Renewed efforts must be made by the Central Americans themselves and by the international community. The peace plan's principles of democracy and of international law must be respected by all, both in and outside the region. With its great influence, the United States bears a special responsibility. Development assistance is necessary if the countries in the region are to be capable of tackling the consequences of many years of economic and social injustice. Those are the primary causes of the conflict.\nIn Cyprus and in Western Sahara, the Secretary-General has contributed to renewed hopes for progress towards a peaceful settlement. We also hope that the contacts that recently took place on the Korean peninsula will lead to reconciliation and a peaceful solution.\nWhile positive steps are being taken in several regional conflicts, human suffering has increased in the countries in and around the Horn of Africa. The United Nations has an important role to play in supplying aid to refugees and others in distress in that region. The political problems in the region are also in urgent need of a solution.\nSweden has a long tradition of participating in United Nations peace-keeping operations. The most recent United Nations operation in this field illustrates the Organization's capacity to meet new demands expeditiously. It is all the more disquieting that the financing of the peace-keeping operations remains a grave problem. It is in the interests of all Member States that these operations rest on a solid financial foundation.\nArmed conflicts afflict people in a brutal and shockingly palpable way. There are, however, other kinds of threats, which develop slowly and less spectacularly, but which in time have come to constitute a danger to the entire planet. Among those are environmental degradation and its dramatic and large-scale effects. As a threat to our survival it is not inferior to the arms race.\nAlarming research reports tell us that the climate has begun to change as a probable result of the greenhouse effect. Life-giving resources are being destroyed by erosion, desertification and the devastation of forests. People's health is increasingly being affected by the poisoning of water and food chains and depletion of the ozone layer.\nThe causes of these threats to the environment lie in excessive exploitation of natural resources, brought on by poverty, and in industrial pollution and waste of resources, not least in the field of energy. The impact of man on the environment may have reached the threshold of unknown environmental disasters.\nThe United Nations is in a unique position to rally the world's Governments to action. Preparations should immediately be initiated for a global United Nations conference on environment and development in 1992. Such a conference must take concrete decisions on joint measures both to solve acute environmental problems and to achieve long-term changes in policy. This year's session of the General Assembly should decide on a conference and request the Secretary-General to present to its next session proposals on the aim and direction, organization and preparation of the conference. As I mentioned in the Assembly last year, Sweden is again prepared to act as host, if this is the general wish.\nThe agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of land-based intermediate-range nuclear weapons is historic. But it is essential that results be rapidly achieved in the negotiations on the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons and of conventional forces as well.\nThe third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ended without agreement on a concluding document. However, we must now look ahead and take as a starting-point what was achieved during the special session.\nWe must quickly bring about negotiations on a comprehensive test ban within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament. The time is also ripe to investigate the possibility of the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, based on international law. Continued attention must be given to naval armaments. The United Nations must be given an increased role in monitoring compliance with disarmament agreements. The nuclear powers must abandon their policy of neither confirming nor denying the existence of nuclear weapons on naval vessels visiting foreign ports. This would remove a cause of widespread anxiety among the general public. The United Nations reports on the use of chemical weapons in the war between Iran and Iraq have once again reminded us of the terrible effects of these weapons. We have also been greatly concerned by allegations that they are still being used by Iraq against the Kurdish population. Sweden and a number of other countries have requested that those allegations be investigated. The cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq must not be exploited for the persecution of the Kurdish minority.\nChemical warfare is a violation of international law and must be condemned. The negotiations on a global convention banning chemical weapons must be concluded with urgency. Sweden looks favourably upon the initiative launched yesterday by the President of the United States on the convening of an international conference on the use of chemical weapons.\nOne of the most important contributions of the United Nations has been to draw up rules within the field of human rights. Several conventions have come into existence over the last 40 years, but rules are of little use if they are not observed. In all too many parts of the world the task remains to translate the rules into practical use. Respect for the rights and personal integrity of the individual must not remain just empty words.\nThe past decade has been a period of deepening crisis for many developing countries. The debt crisis, low domestic savings and falling investments are today among the most serious obstacles to development. The internal readjustments that have been necessary as a consequence of this have been distressing and have aggravated the social problems.\nThe international community has an obligation to mitigate this crisis. It is disheartening to have to say that only a few among the most affluent have reached the goal of 1 per cent of gross national product for development assistance. Co-ordinated measures to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest developing countries are today an important task for international assistance.\nAll United Nations activities concern peace and security in one respect or another, and they require an efficiently functioning Organization. The work on reforming and revitalizing the United Nations continues, largely thanks to dedicated efforts by the Secretary-General and his staff. This process must be carried further.\nProgress in the reform work depends on the loyalty of Member States to the world Organization. The United Nations must not be forced to struggle with an acute financial crisis at a time when great and urgent tasks require its attention. All Member States must fulfil their financial obligations laid down in the Charter. We are gratified to note that the United States intends to change its position on this matter, as did the Soviet Union some time ago.\nIt is imperative that Member states establish a sound and lasting financial basis for the world Organization's activities. Sweden has actively participated in discussions with the Secretary-General on solutions to both the short-term and the long-term problems. We are prepared to continue these discussions and accept our share of the responsibility in order to overcome the crisis.\nSweden earlier put forward ideas for a more even scale of assessment. This would be one way of making the Organization less vulnerable.\nNo conflicts have been finally settled anywhere during 1988. We know how easily relapses into earlier conflict patterns occur and how quickly the international climate may change. But the global challenges we are facing are of such a scale that this time we cannot afford to return to the antagonisms that permeated and divided the world community for so long. The utmost efforts are required of all United Nations members to strengthen and develop the positive trend that has characterized 1988. Let us all contribute to making this year a turning point in the aspirations both to live in peace and to build a United Nations capable of upholding respect for international law and coping with the threats to our survival. In these endeavours there is no alternative to a strong global organization.\nIn closing, I should like to quote the late Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme, who said:\n\\\"we look at our world today and remain convinced that the United Nations is only at the beginning of its history.\\\" (A/40/PV.43, p. 64)\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe Democratic Republic of Madagascar would like to express to Mr. Dante Caputo its felicitations on his election to the presidency of this session. In him we congratulate the representative of a country that has consistently proclaimed its dedication to the principles of non-alignment. I am confident that once again he will devote to the service of our Organization the distinguished qualities which have characterized his brilliant career.\nTo Mr, Peter Florin, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, we convey our thanks for the able way in which he guided our work, and we lay special emphasis on his perseverance, impartiality, detachment and sense of political responsibility. We would say to the Secretary-General that this year will have been for him and his chief co-workers a challenging and exciting one. The Assembly had given him the task of disentangling the political, financial and administrative crisis of our Organization. At the same time we expected him to pursue his missions of peace, mediation and conciliation in Western Sahara, Central America, Western Sahara, Afghanistan and Cyprus, among other places. We pay a tribute to his diplomatic initiative, the results of which speak for themselves, and for the efforts he has constantly devoted to restoring to multilateralism and to our Organization the role to which they are entitled.\nDuring this decade two words, \\\"global\\\" and \\\"interdependent\\\", have been spoken so frequently that there hardly seems to be any need to define them any longer. Development is global, as are peace and security, and the three words are interdependent. The axiomatic character and the linear development of this argument may seem troublesome, but no statement can escape that fact, and this demonstrates that despite our differences we are moving towards a universal way of speaking.\nI hope I shall be forgiven for these haphazard reflections, but I have the impression that we are choosing the same topics, expressing the same ideas and arriving at the same conclusions, although the words may change in connotation depending on the ideology, the commitment or the degree of economic development and the social situation of the country in question. I take, for example, the question of security, a question that worries us all and erne on which we cannot afford to have substantial differences. But that is not so. The most idealistic among us still dream of a system of collective security as provided by the Charter while at the same time we realize that this structure rests on the will of the great Powers and on their ability to go beyond the constraints of national interests and their willingness to accept an end to the status quo that has paralysed us for two generations.\nOccasionally it happens that we support initiatives regarding the establishment of a general system of peace, the strengthening of international security and the redefinition of that system by making it better adapted to the realities of a changing society. On each such occasion we are told about the sacrosanct character of the Charter or the grim prospects of an Organization that would be dominated by propaganda or a false ideology. \nMust we for much longer accept this theory that the only security is military security, with its recurring pattern of cold war, retrenchment, detente, confrontation and balance of deterrence? May we now hope that the great thaw between East and West will indirectly have some effects on the political-economic situation of the South? To a degree, the events of the last nine months seem optimistic in that regard, especially for those who hold to a geocentricism not necessarily justified by a healthy grasp of the world situation. Indeed, there are still stubborn hotbeds of insecurity in the political, economic and social spheres, as well as at the regional level. The arguments we are hearing in the present debate do not allow us fully to face those challenges, particularly since some of them have an urgent if not immediate tone. Thus we have no alternative but to fall back on some arguments we have often used in the past.\nThe promoting and safeguarding of security cannot be dealt with exclusively by reference to a past that has not always been glorious. If new prospects are opening before us, which should lead us to recognise far-reaching changes in our society, then let us have the generosity and courage to admit that such an endeavour requires the involvement and participation of all that the interests of some must yield to the common interest and the interests of the international community; and that spheres of influence, interference, dependence domination and exploitation are now obsolete. In short, let us have security for all, and in all spheres. \nThere can be no security without development, nor development without security. We shall be told that this is merely one more slogan. But the immediate and complex problems posed by development could, if left unresolved, undermine political and military security, which, we must acknowledge, for the moment benefits only the North.\nThere has often been discussion of a clash between North and South, because poverty and wretchedness know no borders, nor do they disappear merely because of logic or debate. And what would it be like, a world one half of which enjoyed the benefits of security while the other half continued to struggle with countless economic difficulties?\nConversely, so long as international security is not secured, the efforts and resources that could be devoted to development will be diverted to other goals; politics will prevail over economics, and the rivalry of the great Powers will continue to have repercussions on choices of nodes of development.\nIdeally, on both fronts - security and development - initiatives should be taken concurrently and simultaneously. Gut the realities are otherwise. The struggle against underdevelopment is momentarily being left aside and we are being led to believe that the North must organize itself and ensure its security before the South can benefit.\nBut let us suppose that the industrialized North, cutting across all lines, has resolved its problems of stability, confidence, security, restructuring, liberalisation, inflation, growth, unemployment, interest and exchange rates, budgetary balances and integration. Could we then conclude that the dispossessed South would automatically benefit? We still remember with bitterness the promises of the 1970s, when we were advised to wait until inflation was brought under control before we called for any increase in development aid. As for the \\\"trickle-down effect\\\" and the laws of the market, the length of time necessary and the precariousness of their results are matched only by our patience. \nThe policy of laissez-faire has entrenched itself in international economic relations, and it is the debt question that finally has aroused some awareness of responsibilities and disparities. We recognize that the impasse faced by national and international financial institutions has led them no longer to address the question of debt in financial and accounting terms to seek means that were formerly thought of as legally dangerous to accept that structural adjustment should take into account human, social and political elements. There are, of course, risks in such an exercise, but an accumulation of bad debts cannot serve the cause of international monetary and financial stability, and even lees the cause of an equitable, just and sustained development.\nIn this respect, let those who hold the initiative concede that the burden of debt is paralysing development efforts and that this is not the key to the problem. Development has many aspects and one cannot always put all the factors on an equal footing. This is the case, for example, with commodity prices, which we are told should depend on the laws of the market, and are not protected by protectionism. We may well wonder whether it is decent that the survival of a country should be subject to the clash of different schools of thought, degree of teamwork is called for here, even if some of the most valid rules occasionally need to be bent.\nWe did not abandon our spirit of teamwork and solidarity when some presented to use the notion that structural adjustment would be our contribution to improving the international economic environment. Its price remains enormous, increased unemployment, deterioration of social indicators, a decline in productivity, inadequate basic social services, under-utilization of human resources and so on. On the side of our partners, we find it hard to see the existence of a real will to tackle the problem of development, to give up the notion that growth can remain the reserve of the few, or to ensure that national policies and practices favour the e emergence of an economic order of benefit to everyone. Teamwork not followed by concrete action or supported by specific commitments is not real.\nIt may be objected that so long as uncertainties deriving from the constraints of file world economy have not been removed, it will be difficult to restructure priorities, to redefine certain preferences and to alter objectives. If that is so, then we must give up on that global vision of the world that has always been held out to us, especially at difficult times. So division is the rule, wait and see\\\" remains the byword, and let each draw his own conclusions. \nAs for us, we shall continue to argue, from the standpoint of a true development, code of ethics, that development is concerned above all with improving, the human condition that it calls for a consistent collective reaction in the form of a long-term programme with objectives, commitments and the availability of adequate resources that in the establishing of world economic security the United Nations has a primary political role to play, in the clear formulation of principles, the definition of priorities and co-ordination of the various organizations and institutions concerned with development, whose approach and ends are not necessarily harmonised or convergent.\nWe shall continue to discover new problems, obstacles and disappointments on the way to security and development. Even if the advent of a golden age is not on the horizon, it would be wrong to abandon all hope, because we must examine the problems of security, development and peace from a global perspective, without any preconceived order of priorities, without pre-judging their interaction and without claiming a monopoly regarding initiatives or means of implementation. Such an approach, if adopted, would constitute a guarantee of the establishment of a true peace that would be shared by all, whether from East or West, from North or South. Nevertheless, we should recognize that progress has been made, in the quest for peace and in creating a climate favourable to its attainment, thanks to the convergence of unilateral initiatives, bilateral consultations and recourse to multilateral diplomacy. We should therefore pay our tribute to and congratulate all those who have made the prospects for this session less negative than they might have been.\nThese include, first, the Organization, whose peace-keeping forces have just received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their contribution to achieving the fundamental purposes of the Charter and to bringing about the negotiations now under way, lb the United States and the Soviet Union, for concluding the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles for undertaking negotiations with a view, to reducing their strategic nuclear arsenals, and for their determination to explore those spheres in which significant progress can be envisaged\u00b7, Iran and Iraq, for accepting the cease-fire recommended in Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and carrying on direct talks on the establishment of a true peace, in a spirit of trust and understandings all those that, like Prance, decided, when the cease-fire was announced, to withdraw their naval contingents from the Gulf, thus reducing the dangers that a foreign military presence might represent for the independence, sovereignty and security of the States of the region the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the countries of Indo-China, which, despite the complexity and difficulty of their exchanges of view, especially on Kampuchea, are gradually moving towards the creation of a zone of security and co-operation in South-East Asia the Soviet Union and Viet Nam for, respectively, the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, in the framework of the Geneva Agreement and the establishment of a timetable for the withdrawal from Kampuchea; the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which recently took initiative to bring about unification, conciliation and harmony and to eliminate confrontation, mistrust and tension, with a view to bringing about the reunification of the peninsula the Republic of Cyprus and other Cypriot representatives, who decided to attempt to achieve, through resumption of inter-communal talks, a negotiated settlement of all aspects of the problem, in a spirit of Independence, sovereignty and the unity of Cyprus, the Organization of African Unity for pursuing its mediation efforts to bring about a negotiated political solution to the dispute between Libya and Chad, which have just re-established their diplomatic relations  Ethiopia and Somalia, which, after so many years of confrontation, have succeeded in normalizing their relations in a spirit of good-neighbourliness, Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic, whose acceptance of the Secretary-General's proposals on Western Sahara constitute a positive step towards the implementation, in letter and spirit, of the relevant United Nations and Organisation of African Unity resolutions on initiating direct negotiations and the holding of the referendum on self-determination of the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO), the sole and legitimate representative o\u00a3 the Namibian people, for having, at the beginning of the quadripartite talks, unilaterally announced the cessation of its military operations; and the countries of Latin America, which, despite the existence of internal and external problems, insist that the only way of solving the region's problems, without external interference or the injection of ideological considerations, remains the faithful implementation of the Guatemala agreement, the reaffirmation of which is urgently necessary.\nAfter this summary of the disputes that have arisen between States, what can we conclude and what lesson can we draw, if not that the sense of responsibility of the countries of any region and their support for the settlement of conflicts in their geographic area have peeved more positive and effective than interference and intervention prompted by external interests.\nHaving presented this somewhat optimistic view of the world, I am constrained to return to the painful realities affecting southern Africa and the Middle East, where conflict of interests is the order of the day. On 1 November this year the Secretary-General will begin to take the steps necessary for the deployment of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia. We all hope that this first deadline will be respected and will not be made unduly dependent upon the results of the quadripartite talks on South West Africa. We maintain that only the immediate and definitive application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will make it possible for the Namibian people to regain their independence, sovereignty and dignity, until this happens, the political, legal and moral, responsibility of the Organization will be at stake. \nIn South Africa we are still seeing a clash between two worlds. On the one side we see the illegitimate and illegal regime of apartheid, with all the ' tyranny, oppression, discrimination, inequality and monopoly that it involves. On the other side, we see a people suffering in body and soul, but a people which, through the voice and through the initiatives of its liberation movement, the - African National Congress (ANC), is crying out for the right to participation, to freedom and to democracy. We are, still wondering when we, will find the resolve to apply concrete and comprehensive solutions to defeat the apartheid regime. Nothing can be built on immorality and compromise. One cannot expect anything from apartheid; reformed or not.\t  \nAs for the Middle East, it is time we stopped trying to find some form of balance at any cost, which is of advantage only, to one side, \\\" The Palestinian people, a victim of injustice, oppressed, condemned to wandering and despair, has the right to demand more consideration and more sympathy. Reasoning politically and legally, after the adoption of resolution 181 (IT) who can question the existence of a Palestinian State distinct from Jordan? Sooner or later, the independence of that State will be formally proclaimed. As an Organization, we must take an unambiguous stand.\u00b7 That act will not suffice to end the conflicts between Israel and the PLO, but it would have the advantage of enabling the more hesitant to consider the International Peace Conference in new terms. \nThis year, we are going to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and everyone will proclaim full and unqualified dedication to it, although no country is really free of allegations of violations of these rights. Is it not ironic to note that at the end of the twentieth century those who dedicate themselves to preaching and to the-systematic use of human rights for political purposes, are sometimes the last to accept the consequences of respect for, and' the promotion of, human rights in southern Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America?\nThat the flowers of human rights are blooming in a field of injustice, misery and poverty is something that is being accepted through a grim form of formalism.\nAs I listen to the statements of my colleagues, or reread them, I have the impression that the quarrel between bilateralism and multilateralism, for which some other systems have been sought, is now a thing of the past. The key point for us now is to invest in the new capital of confidence that has been accorded to our Organization, to build innovatively on the experience of more than 40 years, to put to the test the true potential of the United Nations despite its momentary loss of credibility.\nIf the United Nations is to be the expression of our international political conscience, we cannot continue to enclose it within the narrow framework of a Charter that needs to be revised, if only with respect to the right of veto. We must accept that the concept of security should be enlarged and that the concept of responsibility should be more binding. We must prepare ourselves to codify the guarantees of peace, security and development in a context which reflects the general desire of members of the international community, with especial attention to the priorities dictated, as the Secretary-General has said, by the entry of mankind into a new period of its history, and the imperative of a development which must be balanced and as fair as possible. Only at that cost can we respond to the aspirations of humanity in the midst of a crisis for its very survival, grappling with uncertainty and anxiety.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to convey the warm greetings and good wishes of His Majesty Jigiae Singye Wangchuck,\u00b7 King of Bhutan, to you, Mr. President, and through you to all the representatives for the success of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\nMay I also extend the hearty felicitations of my delegation to you, Sir, on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Given your outstanding credentials, I am confident that you will lead this session to fruitful conduction.\nI also wish to put on record our deep appreciation for the skill with which Mr. Peter Florin guided the forty-second session. His fine stewardship of the General Assembly has earned for him and for his country, the German Democratic Republic, the respect of the international community.\nWe express our thanks to our Secretary-General, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, for his incisive report. The exciting possibilities outlined in it stem in large part from his inspired leadership and hi, work as an apostle of peace. During this past year especially, he was omnipresent, and his labours and those of his colleagues have borne abundant fruit. His tenure is a milestone in the history of the United Nations.\nWe are entering the dawn of a new era. The United Nations has generated the momentum of peace on a number of fronts, bringing long-standing conflicts to an end and creating new opportunities. In this past year alone we have been witnesses to the success of the peace-making process. Never have the prestige of the world Organisation and pride in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter stood higher, undeniably, the efficacy of multilateralism has been borne out. The awarding of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping farces is \u0430 just albeit belated recognition of the effective role that the United Nations has played in maintaining peace in the world's trouble-spots during the past 40 years.\nThe easing of East-West tensions has created a more favourable international political climate and has contributed to the resolution of several regional conflicts. We applaud the two great leaders who signed the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - in Moscow last spring, and express the hope that this will lead to further agreements on the reduction and eventual elimination of strategic nuclear arms.\t\u00b7\nMy delegation also applauds the agreement on Afghanistan sponsored by the United Nations. This breakthrough will, it is hoped, lead to a lasting peace for that war-torn land, ending nine years of bitter fighting. The withdrawal of foreign troops is now taking place, but much work remains to be done in terms of reconciliation, repatriation of refugees and the building of a national consensus. We welcome the efforts of the United Nations for Afghanistan's economic reconstruction. We are, however, deeply concerned by the continued internal struggle and foreign intervention that could jeopardize the very fragile basis on which the current initiatives have been taken. We urge all parties concerned to honour and abide by the Geneva accords.\nThe cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, mediated and arranged by the United Nations, is another cause for the rejoicing of the world community. Eight years of this fratricidal war have taken an appalling toll - some 1 million dead, 1.7 million wounded and 1.5 million refugees. All in all, it has been one of the century's most brutal wars. Therefore, we commend the United Nations Secretary-General for his efforts to achieve an honourable agreement between the two parties within the framework of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). \nWe observe with satisfaction the development of encouraging signs concerning the future of Kampuchea. We welcome the initiative taken by Indonesia to bring all the leaders of the opposing sides together for the first time, we support the commitment and effort of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to facilitate a durable political settlement, and are heartened by the indications of an early withdrawal of foreign troops. \nIn southern Africa the recent cease-fire between the belligerent parties involved in the war in Angola is yet another development of great significance. Bhutan hopes that \u0430 firm schedule for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Angola will soon be established. Of related and equal significance is the outcome of the talks between the parties concerned on the independence of Namibia, which is illegally occupied by South Africa, in flagrant violation of United Nations resolutions. In this context we express our full support for the Secretary-General in his efforts to ensure that implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) begins next month.\nIn spite of South Africa's apparent willingness to negotiate the independence of Namibia and the beginning of its troop withdrawal from Angola, the situation in southern Africa remains highly volatile. This is because South Africa continues to wage two wars - the war on its own people and the frequent incursions against its neighbours. The racist regime continues to hold the majority of its people in subjection under apartheid. This brutal system, colonialism at its worst, is an affront to the whole civilized world. Atrocities are committed daily in its name: arrests, torture and intimidation of thousands, mass deportations, and press censorship amounting to a strangulation of the news. The regime remains utterly intransigent in refusing to negotiate with black leaders or accept United Nations mandates. Unless steps are taken to alleviate the situation, a bloodbath will inevitably follow.\nWe call upon South Africa to release Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and to dismantle the institutionalized inhumanity known as apartheid. We state categorically that we are not deceived by the cosmetic so-called reforms. Until such time as real and constructive changes are brought about, we call for comprehensive economic sanctions and an arms embargo against South Africa, for It is the responsibility of the world community to put pressure on the regime and to work for the establishment of a non-racial society in a united South Africa.\nThere are certain areas of tension that have sadly withstood the pacifying winds of change. The recent uprising in the occupied territories has only added greater bitterness to the Arab-Israeli conflict. On the other hand, while absolute solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggle to regain their inalienable rights is essential, the discord among themselves continues to be a source of concern to their well-wishers. We nevertheless express the hope that the recent separation of the West Bank from the Kingdom of Jordan will enhance the cause of the Palestinian people and their rightful claim to a sovereign homeland.\nThat said, we wish to make it clear that we support the security and right to exist in safety of all States in the area, including Israel. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon continue to be violated by foreign forces. At the same time its people remain torn by religious bigotry. Saddened by the increasingly apathetic attitude of the world to the plight of this nation, we urge that renewed efforts be launched to resolve the question of Lebanon in a manner that will enable the Lebanese people to determine their own future, free from any foreign interference.\nDuring the recent XXIV Olympiad in Seoul, the best and most universal summer Olympic Games in history  the world witnessed the extraordinary economic accomplishments of South Korea. The Korean people, however, continue to remain tragically divided. In our view the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula can best be brought about through the building up of mutual confidence between South and North Korea. In this connection we welcome the special declaration of President Roh Tae woo made in the interest of national self-esteem.   .\nBeyond these regional discords end conflict problems that know no boundaries have been forced on our attention with increasing urgency. I refer to the degradation of our physical environment. 'Will earth survive?\u201d asks a recent article with pointed relevance. Mass deforestation, depletion of the planet\u00b7 ozone layer, the poisoning of rivers, skies and sections of the oceans, the destruction of whole ecosystems which have reached insurmountable proportions. Have we turned our planet into a vast dumping ground? Furthermore, those who experienced this past summer in New York know about the greenhouse effect first hand. However, such reports as that of the world Commission on Environment and Development, entitled \\\"Our Common Future\\\" - the Brundtland report - outline constructive steps to address, and even reverse, present trends.\nOur gravest threat by far, however, remains that of nuclear holocaust. While the historic signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and the recent destruction of weapons are cause for hope, we cannot afford to be complacent. The current supply of nuclear weapons could destroy the planet many times over. We are still not free of the spectre of disaster of the testing and stockpiling of new nuclear weapons. \nIt is our collective responsibility to work for general and complete disarmament. The first three special sessions on disarmament pointed us in positive directions and were initial steps on the road to our ultimate goal of comprehensive disarmament. However, we must look forward to a fourth special session to build on our progress. Let us add here that Bhutan welcomes the establishment of the third Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament, to be located in Kathmandu, Nepal. Beyond this, my delegation once more calls for a complete halt to the testing of new nuclear-weapon systems and for a freeze on the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. We call for a halt to the production and proliferation of conventional weapons and, in particular, for a total ban on chemical weapons.\nWorld expenditures for military purposes are now in excess of S900 billion a year and could, if present trends continue unchecked, reach the astronomical figure of 31 trillion a year - this while fully two thirds of the world's people live below the poverty line. What a distorted sense of priorities, what a twisted perspective! So many of the world's scarce resources are poured into the technology of destruction, with no return in terms of either real security or an enhanced quality of life.\nThis problem is part of the larger picture of the fundamental injustice of current economic relations, of the growing disparity between rich and poor nations. In almost no sense could the global economic outlook be called healthy. \nThe problem for our region and international trade system, are the increasing protectionist trade policies, reduction in the flow of financial assistance to the developing countries, volatile exchange rates, mounting interest rates, and the collapse of the prices of primary commodities, which are at their lowest level in 50 years. All these factors feed into the overwhelming debt problem that has crippled the development levels of so many of the poorer countries. Overall, it has been said that the 1980s have been a lost decade of development. The results have been appalling. In 1986, 850 million people lived in countries that experienced no increase in per capita output. What this means in real terms is that not only has economic development suffered an enormous setback in these countries, but that progress in the social sphere has been severely hampered as well for these things are intertwined. We must add that the least developed countries have suffered these shocks the most.\nHow can we reverse the downward spiral? The solution must be found in the resumption of the North-South dialogue and the implementation of the New International Economic Order. As a first step, we renew our call for the early convening of an international conference on money and finance for development. Clearly, there is an ever greater need for a more equitable world economic infrastructure - for a comprehensive approach to the interrelated problems of money, finance, debt, trade, and development. The developed nations cannot continue to flourish at the expense of the developing countries in the end, this proves counter-productive for everyone. In our increasingly interdependent world, there is no alternative to effective co-operation. The kind of creative partnerships we envision would impart a new dynamism to the global economy and promote self-reliance through co-operation, thereby creating opportunity for all. \nThe South Asian Association for regional Co-operation (SAHRC) is an attempt at South-South co-operation. This is an association of which Bhutan has been a proud member from the beginning. Increasingly the seven member nations, with a total of 1 billion people among them, have expanded their areas of co-operation, in spite of our widely differing cultures and historical experience\u00b7, we work together in a fraternal spirit to promote the objective\u00b7 of individual and collective self-reliance and to further the cause of peace, progress and stability in South Asia.\nThe goal of self-reliance has been the cornerstone of Bhutan's development policy. Bhutan has been a number of the world Organisation only since 1971. However, in that short span of time the various specialized agencies and affiliated bodies of the United Nations, working closely with our government, have rendered invaluable assistance. They have played a pivotal role in all aspects of our development - in such diverse areas as road and communication infrastructure, health and educational services and, above all, human resources development. In particular I should like to express our drop gratitude to the united Nations development Programme (UNDP) , the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) , the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAO), the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the World Health Organisation (WH\u041e), the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FM) the United Nations Volunteers (UNV}, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the United Nations Department of Technical Co-operation for Development ((JNDTCD) , and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).\nThe United Nations has proved its efficacy, both in the day-to-day operations of the specialised agencies and affiliated bodies, and in its role as peacemaker, negotiator, and mediator. Its dramatic success in resolving a number of long-standing conflict\u00b7 this year have put the world Organization in its limelight. Yet at the very moment when its prestige is at its zenith, and the principled of the Charter have at least gained truly universal acceptance, the United Nations faces an unprecedented threat. Unless the fiscal crisis is relieved in the immediate future, the United Nations will be forced to shut its doers forever. Even if it were merely a forum for the communication of ideas and for blowing off steam, the United Nations would be invaluable, for nothing comparable exists. But the world Organization is so much more than this. It is our last best hope. How tragic it would be if this were realized after its disappearance.\nThis world cannot do without the United Nation\u00b7 At this critical juncture - most especially when peace-keeping forces are about to be dispatched to far-flung parts of the globe - we cannot sit idly by and watch the United Nations collapse, we therefore call upon all nations to fulfil their financial responsibilities at the earliest possible date.\nThe present system of assessments, made on the capacity of nations to pay, is equitable. It is the result of the wisdom that prevailed at the time of the founding of the United Nations.\nBut times have changed. The present financial crisis has opened our eyes to the vulnerability of the world body to the pressures of a few nations that currently bear the brunt of the payments. Therein lays the inherent weakness of the United Nations. Indeed, we can easily foresee the possibility of the United Nations being similarly held to ransom again unless the assessment of dues can be established through a new formula. The financial burden must be shared in a different manner. \nThe United Nations provides equal political opportunities to all nations, thus earning it its distinction as the parliament of nations but it is the poorer and less developed countries that enjoy greater benefits in terms of expertise and financial assistance. Therefore, the developing nations nay have to pay a larger share of the United Nations operating costs. This may sound like a radical proposal, but the benefits we reap from the world Organization should enable us to accept this idea with a greater sense of responsibility and willingness. Above all, we must ensure the survival of the United Nations.\nYet today we are presented with opportunities as never before. The United Nations is in the ascendant and is brilliantly carrying out its appointed work, healing wounds and making a constructive difference in the lives of people everywhere. In times past, men sought the Golden Fleece or El Dorado. We seek something nobler and more realistic: a renewed commitment to the vision of the Charter to bring to birth a prosperous and equitable world order, a new and better life for all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of Norway I add my congratulations to those of the speakers who have preceded me, Sir, on your election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\nThe community of nations is looking to this forty-third session of the General Assembly with high hopes and great expectations. After years of decline in multilateral co-operation, are we finally witnessing the turn of the tide? The conspicuous, constructive role that the Organization has lately successfully played with regard to many regional conflicts clearly demonstrates the need for an effective United Nations. We, who as a matter of policy and conviction have always supported the United Nations, are encouraged to see it resume its rightful role as the protector and promoter of peace and stability, a centre where nations harmonize their policies and actions in Favour of a more secure world based on social and economic justice.\nAs policies and positions of nations change we must have one focal point in the world which is constitutionally and permanently charged with the task of searching for negotiated solutions to political, economic and social solutions.\nThere have been long periods when the United Nations has suffered from the divisions between blocs, and in particular from the lack of dialogue and co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union, but the post-war bipolar world has yielded to a multipolar one. The major Powers are gradually realizing that it is in their own interests to maintain a more effective world Organization.\nThe improved bilateral relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, epitomized by the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - will undoubtedly have positive effects on the ongoing endeavours for substantial arms reductions. It remains a primary concern for the Norwegian Government to capitalize on what has been achieved and to work towards agreements on deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons, a comprehensive test-ban treaty, a ban on chemical weapons and the elimination of asymmetries with a view to establishing a balance of forces on a lower level of conventional armaments. This is particularly important in Europe, where the concentration of weapons is the largest and the most threatening to peace and stability.\nDisarmament and arms control is a matter of global concern. The United Nations has an important role to play in encouraging, supporting and supplementing disarmament negotiations conducted in other forums - multilateral, regional and bilateral.\nAn encouraging feature in today's improved international atmosphere is the willingness to address serious regional conflicts in a new and constructive manner. We welcome the fact that the various parties are increasingly making use of the good offices of the Secretary-General, thus allowing the world Organization to serve as a real catalyst for progress towards a more peaceful, just and safer world.\nI should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General. Years of patience and hard work are now paying dividends. Stalemate and setbacks are giving way to meetings of minds and to progress. We have witnessed this new attitude in the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan, in the success in bringing about a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and in the progress towards peaceful solutions in the Western Sahara, Kampuchea and Namibia.\nIn other areas of conflict, progress is desperately needed. We welcomed the Esquipulas Agreement of last year. Expectations were high that the five Central American Presidents would themselves, find solutions to the problems of that troubled region. The present stalemate is, however, severely prolonging the plight of the peoples of Central America. We urge the parties to return to negotiations and to continue the implementation of the peace plan.\nIn the Middle East the state of chronic unrest in the Israeli-occupied territories underscores the need for Israelis and Arabs to make genuine and determined efforts aimed at achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace. The Norwegian Government supports the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. We believe that such a conference, with the participation of all parties directly concerned, represents the best way to achieve a negotiated settlement. Meanwhile, Israel has a special obligation under international law to protect the civilian population in the occupied territories and to secure their human rights.\nIn South Africa the apartheid system is still being upheld in defiance 06 basic principles of civilization. The apartheid system must - and will - come to an end. Apartheid, representing institutionalized racism, cannot be reformed: it must be abolished. International pressure on South Africa must be increased, Ten years have passed since the United Nations was able to agree on limited mandatory sanctions against the Government in Pretoria. Now we need to move towards the adoption of comprehensive and effective sanctions, and we need to move now.\nWe are encouraged by the Secretary-General's optimism concerning the improved prospects for the independence of Namibia. We welcome the news that an advance team can now be sent to Namibia to prepare for a United Nations military and civilian presence in the Territory as it assumes its rightful role and place amongst the sovereign and independent nations of the world. Norway will stand firmly by its commitment to participate in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group.\nThe system of apartheid, wars and natural catastrophes in southern Africa have produced millions of refugees and displaced persons. An international conference held in Oslo last month focused on the situation for those unfortunate and deprived people. The conference stressed in particular the need to cater for displaced per sons, who at present fall outside the responsibility of United Nations agencies. It also underlined the need for emergency programmes, contingency plans and early-warning systems. We must all support the programme of action adopted at that conference.\nIt is a paradox that at a time when the political climate in the United Nations has improved considerably the Organization should be threatened with financial bankruptcy. The financial crisis facing the United Nations is unacceptable from every point of view. It impedes planning it creates a bad climate for the implementation of reforms and it undermines the morale of the staff of the Organization. Unilateral withholding of contributions undermines multilateral co-operation. All Member States must respect the United Nations Charter and meet their financial obligations. We urge all countries to settle all their debts promptly.\nWe are living in an era of rapid change. In general terms the peoples of the industrialized countries have experienced a rapid improvement in their living conditions. For the developing countries this is not so. While the 1980s may be a decade marked by real progress in respect of international peace and security, the decade is one of lost opportunities for the third world. Very little has been done to prevent the gap between '\u00bfhe rich and the poor countries from widening. As we approach the turn of the millennium, we face the major challenge of overcoming the global development crisis. We must launch a victorious battle against the poverty that continues to tie hundreds of millions of people to an existence that cannot be reconciled with human dignity.\nStability, prosperity and social and economic justice are coming to different parts of the world at different speeds. Corrective action needs to be taken. The challenge that confronts us is ethical as well as political. We can safeguard the future only by working together; we cannot safeguard it at each other's expense. The future will depend on how successful we are in adopting common attitudes towards our common challenges.\nMost of the developing countries are witnessing a reversal of the earlier were hopeful trends in growth performance. A sharp deterioration in the international economic environment has played a major role in triggering the acute crisis which now afflicts the third world. This was clearly established once again during the mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990 conducted here in New York over the past two weeks.\nThe critical economic situation for the developing world is characterized by unsustainable, crushing burdens of external debt; a substantial decline in export earnings due to severely depressed commodity prices and to increasing protectionism a significant decline in flows of resource transfers, in particular with regard to private lending and investment; and the chronic instability of the international currency market; as well as abnormally high real interest rates.\nIs it not politically, morally and economically perverse that there has been a net transfer of resources from poor countries to rich countries totalling over $100 billion in the past few years? Is it not appalling that while close to a billion people are living in poverty and squalor, the per capita income of some 50 developing countries declined last year?\nThese trends will have to be reversed, not only because the situation in itself is unacceptable, but also because it is in the self-interest of all developed countries - West and East. There is a need for a fresh start in international development co-operation. Development aid and lending must be increased. I emphasize this, and I see no reason to conceal the fact that while Norway in recent years has given around 1.1 per cent of its gross national product (GNP) in official development assistance (ODA) to developing countries, we are disappointed that at the same time the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average has declined to a meagre 0.34 per cent. Clearly, many countries can and must do better, much better. We call on those donor countries which have been lagging behind in their transfers to make renewed efforts commensurate with their abilities. \nThere is a need for a double-track approach: the development and the debt crisis have to be urgently and effectively addressed. The two are interlinked and they are equally acute. Many countries are caught in the vicious circle of having to service, reschedule and refinance their external debt while necessary investments and reforms are being suffocated. Urgent action is now needed to alleviate the debt burden in ways that represent a fairer burden-sharing between debtors and lenders. Norway has taken concrete steps to alleviate debt, and strongly advocates further multilateral co-ordinated debt-relief measures.\nIt is obvious that the heavily indebted low-income countries will never be able to repay their debts. We must fully recognize this and deal with it accordingly. We cannot continue to maintain iron codes that carry with them the risk of political destabilization and increased suffering for the most vulnerable groups, codes that negatively affect women and children, block the development of human progress and human resources, curtail investment and innovation and make it virtually impossible for many debtor countries ever to assume their rightful place in the international economy.\nThe decisions taken at the Toronto economic summit brought some new hope that the major economic Powers are willing to act upon these issues. Although they have recently agreed on some further steps, in particular with regard to Africa, much remains to be done by the large industrial countries to alleviate the debt problem.\nThe recent proposals by the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are steps towards a real solution of the debt crisis, which is indeed a common crisis - both for the North and for the South.\nThe industrialized countries of the North must now demonstrate that they see the poverty of the third world as their common challenge. We need a more equitable world order based on common responsibility, on mutual respect and solidarity, and on the fundamental principles of human rights. The protection of human rights is a matter of priority concern for the Norwegian Government. To work for human rights is to work for democracy, development, solidarity and progress. Unfortunately, systematic and persistent violations of human rights still occur in many countries. We must work tirelessly to counter these violations and to strengthen the instruments of implementation that we have created. This year we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It gives us an opportunity to reconfirm our obligations and to redouble our efforts to upgrade our civilization.\nThe world's population may double by the middle of the next century. It is clear that meeting the needs of present and future generations will require forceful, sustainable economic growth supported by a world-wide campaign to protect the environment and our natural resources. In the 1970s, environment and development were seen by many as plainly contradictory. At that time, environmental concerns were considered as something only the rich could afford. Today they are concerns no one can afford to ignore.\nThe time has come to start this process of change that is needed. We need a new sense of mission and we need a vision of a better future. We need a common framework and concepts that can unite us.\nThe threats to the ozone layer have opened even more eyes to the fact that no single country can protect its environment in isolation. Global problems require global solutions. The Montreal Protocol of last year needs to be followed by further agreements on measures to protect the atmosphere.\nThe problem of dealing with hazardous and nuclear wastes and recent cases of dumping in the third world clearly show that a strict international regime is required also to protect the developing countries from becoming a dumping ground for industrial excesses in the North.\nIn the ongoing negotiations led by the United Nations Environment Programme the developed countries must now sensitise themselves towards the just demands of the developing countries with a view to adopting a global consensus early next year.\nAt the Oslo Conference in July this year, the Heads of 22 United Nations agencies discussed the follow-up of the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. They agreed with the Commission that to achieve sustainable development, environment and development policies must preserve peace, secure growth on a sustainable basis and alleviate poverty.\nAt last year's session of the General Assembly, the proposal was put forward to hold a global follow-up conference in 1992. Norway supports the proposal to hold such a conference, which should focus on the broad issues of sustainable development. One hundred years ago the Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen said: \\\"Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.\\\" Sustainable development is such an idea Together we must make it a reality.\nHumankind is exposed to risks - political and economic risks - and we are becoming increasingly aware that we run the risk of an ecological disaster comparable in scale and impact to large-scale nuclear destruction. The next decade will be crucial. Vital and difficult decisions will have to be taken. We have the capacity to destroy life on this planet, but we also have the capacity to save and to enhance it. To achieve the necessary changes we need a stronger commitment to the international institutions we have created. We need a coalition of reason and a real co-ordination of policies. The Secretary-General of the United Nations must have our firm support. He must be accorded the authority and the resources necessary to promote the basic objectives for our own survivals peace, development and environment.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great pleasure for me, speaking on behalf of the Tunisian delegation and on my own behalf, to congratulate the Ambassador of Argentina on his election as President of the General Assembly at the forty-third session. We are convinced that, with his experience and wisdom, he will preside successfully over the work of this session of the Assembly. In entrusting him with this responsibility, the Assembly has paid a tribute to his ability and also to the important role played by his country, Argentina, on the international scene. It is also my pleasure to be able to assure him of my delegation's whole-hearted willingness to co-operate closely with him.\nI should like to take this opportunity also to express to his illustrious predecessor, Mr. Florin, our admiration and appreciation for the devotion, skill and patience with which he presided over the forty-second session, which underwent a period of intensive and continuous activity during the past 12 months. I should also like to express to the Secretary General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, our deep appreciation of the noble work he continues to do to secure the influence of the Organization and its Charter. His determination and patience have earned him the trust and support of the international community, thus enabling the United Nations to play the pioneering role set out in the Charter for settling international problems and strengthening peace, security and co-operation among nations.\nTunisia has always demonstrated its devotion to the spirit and the letter of the United Nations Charter. This is one of the pillars of our foreign policy and is the principle governing our bilateral relations and determining the position we take on the international scene. Tunisia has always worked to support the United Nations; it has always respected the Organization\u2019s principles and defended the noble objectives it espouses, in the knowledge that the purposes and principles laid down in the Charter and the values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are among the most valuable achievements in modern history.\nGuided by these principles, since the events of 7 November 1987 - the change of Government - we have totally redrawn Tunisia's political landscape, enabling our citizens to take part in the decision-making process and to exercise responsibilities under the Constitution. These changes are intended to meet the legitimate aspirations and the authentic civilizing values of the people.\nConsequently, \u0430 whole series of legal and social measures have been enacted. These include an amendment to the Constitution to eliminate any provisions restricting the right of the citizen to exercise freedom of choice or his right to dissent; the promulgation of a new law governing political parties, to act as the legal basis for the creation of political organizations in a multi-party State; and the rehabilitation of the constitutional institutions - in particular, the Chamber of Deputies - so that they can properly carry out the tasks entrusted to them with respect for democratic norms, under the aegis of the Constitutional Council that has been established to ensure constitutionality.\nLikewise, we have adopted a series of bold measures relating to fundamental freedoms, intended to ensure freedom of opinion and expression, while safeguarding human rights. These measures include abolition of emergency courts, changes in the laws governing custody and preventive detention, and ratification of the international Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In taking that step, Tunisia withdrew the reservations it had expressed with respect to a number of articles in the Convention. Aware of the noble mission of human rights bodies, the Tunisia of the new age has anted those bodies full freedom of action. Similarly, it has confirmed the political and social gains of Tunisian women - these gains being considered as the fruit of a fundamental and an irreversible national choice.\nAt the international level, the new Tunisia has reiterated the fundamental tenets of its foreign policy - upholding law, justice and freedom - as well as its determination to honour its commitments, consistent with strict respect for its sovereignty and independence. In his statement of 7 November 1987 the President of the Tunisian Republic, His Excellency Mr. Zine Elabidine Ben Ali, stressed the importance Tunisia attaches to the strengthening of its Arab-Muslim identity and its determination to work resolutely to construct the Arab Greater Maghreb on a basis of commonality of interests and destiny. Together with its brother countries, Tunisia is continuing to make great efforts to improve and harmonize its relations with these countries, looking beyond past vicissitudes, in order to lend impetus to the process of constructing the Greater Maghreb and, thus, give concrete expression to the will of the peoples and the leaders of the countries in our region to bring about broad and varied co-operation with the ultimate goal of attaining organic complementarity within the framework of a Maghrebi community without borders or obstacles, a community that is solid and coherent.\nThus we have managed to create a climate in which we can eliminate sources of tension and establish constructive dialogue. This has made it possible to meet the pre-conditions for launching the process towards constructing the Greater Maghreb in a spirit of understanding and concord.\nOur age is one of blocs and regional groups, which necessitate integrated action by our countries - the prerequisite for our survival, for safeguarding our sovereignty, and for managing our affairs in such a way that the Arab Greater Maghreb can become a factor for stability, peace and security in the region. In this respect, we welcome the outline of a just and lasting settlement of the question of the Western Sahara, and it is our hope that the efforts the Secretary-General of the United Nations continues to make will be crowned with success.\nThe period since our last session has been marked by very positive developments in International relations. Hence this session is taking place in a more favourable climate, which augurs well for an age of understanding and d\u00e9tente. There have been clear signs of d\u00e9tente since the signing, on 8 December 1987, in Washington, of the Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, and the subsequent summit meetings between the leaders of the two countries. These developments have indeed contributed to a lessening of tensions and to containing the regional conflicts which had for a long time given rise to serious concern in the international community and caused instability in many parts of the world. We welcome this course of events, and it is our hope that efforts made in good will can help to resolve chronic, and heretofore insoluble, conflicts, dispel feelings of hate and bitterness, and open the road to peaceful coexistence and international understanding.\nIt is strange, and regrettable that, despite the climate of d\u00e9tente, the international community has said nothing about a policy based on continuous aggression, force, occupation, expansionism and domination that flouts all international laws and regulations, disregarding the strictures of morality. I refer to Israel's policy in the Middle East.\nThe situation prevailing in the occupied Palestinian territories as a result of the repressive campaigns waged by the Israeli occupation authorities against defenceless Palestinians since the beginning of the heroic uprising in December 1987 gets worse every day. This is borne out by the number of dead and injured, the detainees and individuals reportedly as well as by the arsenal of coercive measures which the occupying authorities resort to daily in violation of United Nations resolutions and international instruments, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, of 1949.\nIn recent months, the Security Council has repeatedly been called on to consider this dangerous situation, and has adopted resolutions condemning these practices. It has called on Israel to observe the Geneva Convention, and has emphasized the urgent need for a just and lasting settling to the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nThe uprising by the Palestinian people has demonstrated to the whole world that this struggling people, this people aspiring to freedom and dignity, is more determined than ever, if necessary at the price of its own blood, to regain its rights and dignity, and even the most ferocious repression will be unable to dissuade it.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and all Arab countries have constantly reiterated their determination to work for a peaceful, just and comprehensive settlement based on international law, as set forth in United Nations resolutions, within the framework of an international conference on peace in the Middle East, organized under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation, on an equal footing, of all parties concerned, including the PLO, and the permanent members of the Security Council. The purpose of this would be to restore the Palestinian people's legitimate right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State, guaranteeing the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories and the strengthening of international peace and security in the region. \nIn the same part of the world, our brothers in Lebanon are experiencing a tragic situation which is the direct result of the colonialist policy practised by Israel since its creation. After occupying a part of its territory, and repeatedly violating its sovereignty, Israel has set out to sow dissension and discord throughout the territory, reviving internal quarrels and provoking massacres and destruction.\nWe welcome the signing of the Geneva agreement on Afghanistan and its entry into force, especially since that demonstrates the special role the United Nations has to play as the framework for dialogue and the settlement of conflicts on the basis of law; it has also rewarded the great efforts made by the Secretary-General and his assistants, as well as the efforts made by all peace-loving forces which have greatly contributed to the rapid conclusion of this agreement. In this regard, Tunisia has always called for respect for the sovereignty and independence of Afghanistan, and it has always called for the people of Afghanistan to be able to exercise their right to choose their own system of government. By noting with satisfaction the continuing withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, in keeping with the Agreements signed by the Government of the USSR, Tunisia also hopes that all the parties concerned will manage to find the best possible way to implement the Geneva Agreements under the best conditions.\nWe find deep satisfaction in the fact that our Organization has been able to resume its proper role in establishing peace and settling regional conflicts. Indeed, after having contributed to the settlement of the Afghan question, the United Nations has succeeded, with great effort and imbued with the same spirit, in putting an end to the confrontation between Iran and Iraq. Tunisia has been saddened to see these two brotherly countries, with which it is linked by religion, tear themselves apart in that destructive war. Within the framework of the League Arab states and its Committee of Seven, within the framework of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIS), of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations, Tunisia has constantly called upon of the two parties to resort to dialogue to settle the conflict with a view to a just and honourable peace, in keeping with international law and United Nations resolutions.\nWe welcomed with satisfaction the acceptance by Iran of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), a resolution which Iraq had accepted from the very time of its adoption. This is what we have constantly called for as a means to establish the necessary conditions to bring about peace and security and to preserve stability in the region. We hope that the two parties will succeed in overcoming all the obstacles so that they can turn a new page and build fraternal links and good-neighbourliness, while respecting each others sovereignty and the political choices, thus restoring peace and security in the region, and thus opening up the way for sincere and fruitful co-operation, and eliminating the spectre of upheavals and the waste of energies.\nWe also observed with deep satisfaction the talks which the leaders of the two Cypriot communities held in Geneva under the auspices of the Secretary-General, We consider them a positive step, one which will strengthen confidence between the two parties and which will prompt them to redouble their efforts to succeed in bringing about a final settlement of the Cypriot problem. We welcome the fact that the leaders of the two communities have decided to undertake new negotiations in order to reach a negotiated settlement before 1 June 1989. We are convinced that the two parties are sincerely seeking to realize this goal while respecting legality and justice.\nSimilarly we have noted with hope and optimism the signs of detente resulting from the agreement among the Angolan, South African, Cuban and United States Governments to end the aggression of the racist regime of Pretoria against the countries of the region and to work for a settlement of the question of Namibia. We are very hopeful that this agreement will contribute effectively to facilitating Namibia's accession to independence.\nThe Security Council played a decisive role in the search for a settlement that would bring about an end to the occupation of Namibia when it adopted resolution 435 (1978), which remains a model of objectivity and fairness. The time has come for the Namibian people, who have suffered so much from colonialist occupation, oppression and aggression to rejoin the community of independent nations.\nFaithful to its principles, and faithful to its sacred duty to give unfailing support to the just cause of peoples, to the cause of liberty and to everything that might contribute to preserving dignity and human rights throughout the world, Tunisia reaffirms today its unreserved support for the peoples of South Africa and Namibia in their struggle to regain their legitimate rights and to shake off the yoke of bondage and colonialism. \nTunisia calls upon the international community to redouble its efforts to eradicate this evil and to put an end to these practices, which are immoral and contrary to the rules of international law. Proud of belonging to Africa, Tunisia, which itself had to fight fiercely for its independence, reaffirms its commitment to the Charter of the Organization of African Unity, which has spared no effort to carry out its role and its responsibility in the search for solutions to the problems facing the African continent. We are persuaded that the United Nations has a pre-eminent role to play in strengthening the climate of confidence and d\u00e9tente between the two super-Powers. This is done by committing them to intensify their efforts to bring about disarmament, especially nuclear disarmament, in order to create new possibilities for lessening the tensions created by certain international conflicts. This is also done by allowing other countries to commit their natural resources, human resources, and other resources, to the service of social progress, in response to the aspirations of people to live in dignity and in peace; and this is also done by promoting international co-operation in the areas of the economy, science and useful technologies.\nSuch has always been the noble mission which we have undertaken constantly to achieve, within the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, a movement which makes tireless efforts to build international relations on safe and fair principles. This Movement has spared no effort in undertaking initiatives to settle the main problems haunting the present and the future of mankind, so that the non-aligned countries have become an important partner, enjoying a weight and a prestige which are acknowledged on the international scene.\nThe success in the struggle on the part of peoples for their emancipation and liberty, and the signs of understanding and d\u00e9tente visible on the international scene would remain fragile and would be unable to bring about an irreversible process if there were not to be a complete restructuring of the international economic order. The situation with regard to international economic relations calls for a radical change in certain factors related to development, such as protectionist policies, the deterioration in the terms of trade, inflation and the debt burden. The road leading to the revival of our economies, therefore, is still filled with obstacles. \nTunisia has made a number of proposals as its contribution to the search for a solution to the crisis. Indeed, in a message which he addressed to the most recent summit held in Toronto, President Ben Ali proposed first, the partial or complete cancellation of the public debt of the least advanced countries? secondly, limitation of the debt service of the other countries to 15 to 25 per cent of the export earnings; thirdly, the elimination or the reduction of the interest on all public loans\u00b7, fourthly, the establishment, in favour of the most indebt African countries, of a system which would allow them to convert their medium-term loans into bonds payable over a period of 10 to 20 years. Furthermore, an in-depth study of the world situation should be undertaken, with a view to establishing a new international monetary order. While the structural adjustment programmes which the crisis has imposed upon us certainly strengthen our credibility, it none the less remains true that our people have been called upon to make enormous sacrifices.\nThe industrialized countries, which to a large extent are responsible for the occurrence and for the persistence of the crisis, must therefore seriously examine, along with us, the means for restructuring international economic relations, as well as restructuring their own economies. Those countries should not limit themselves to occasional interventions when the crisis worsens. Indeed, it is evident today, for everyone, that the future of the industrialized countries is to a large extent linked to the development and industrialization of the third world.\nWe still consider that the adoption of the final text of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) demonstrated the willingness to pursue and to establish this dialogue seriously. In this regard, we also consider that the proposal made by the developing countries at the last summer session of the Economic and Social Council offers an excellent opportunity for 4 beginning such a dialogue within the framework of a special session of the General Assembly at the highest level, in order to examine the world economic situation and to revitalize it by reactivating the economic growth and development of the developing countries. Such a session should, in our view, lead to a consensus which would serve as a basis for international economic relations. Moreover, the convening of such a conference in the near future would allow them to benefit from the trade negotiations which are to take place in December 1988 in Montreal as part of the Uruguay Round.\nAll the peoples of the world are looking to our Organization for the establishment of an international order based on law, justice and equality of opportunity, for, in the final analysis, the United Nations remains the last hope for a happy future for all of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, it is my honour and privilege on behalf of the Government of His Majesty King Mswati III and the peace-loving people of the Kingdom of Swaziland, to convey our profound appreciation and congratulations on Mr. Dante Caputo\u2019s well-deserved election to the presidency of this historic forty-third session of our Organization's General Assembly. This delegation is not only convinced of his outstanding diplomatic skills and sense of duty, but it is equally confident that under his stewardship our proceedings will indeed again be marked with historic excellence and constructive results.\nOur tribute and profound gratitude also go to his outstanding predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin, a noble son of the German Democratic Republic, who safely guided the Assembly's affairs with rare excellence. Indeed, his tenure in office was characterized by some of the most problematic scenarios in the annals of contemporary international affairs.\nMy delegation notes with a sense of pride and humility that the international situation in which the current session is being held is not only politically favourable but also holds some optimistic promises for mankind. It is an era influenced by new political thinking as well as by bold diplomatic initiatives to resolve current conflicts.\nWe further take pride and draw inspiration from the fact that we are witnessing positive trends towards a new epoch of effective mechanisms for global political-crisis management, largely inspired by the United Nations system. My delegation therefore welcomes the current relaxation of tensions between the super-Powers and their initiation of a meaningful dialogue on numerous important global issues, especially in the field of disarmament, and including some hotbeds of conflict of both regional and international dimensions. We believe that to be fundamental and consonant with the United Nations Charter by promoting international peace and security. \nHis Majesty's Government and the people of Swaziland have followed with keen interest the unfolding events in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf. We too share the sentiments of the international community, which, under United Nations auspices, has spared no effort in seeking an amicable political settlement to resolve one of the most protracted post-Second-World-War crises, whose dimensions have tested the strength of the Organization.\nWe continue to share in the guarded optimism that United Nations initiatives to resolve the Spanish Sahara and Kampuchea conflicts will further enhance its future role and our resolve in multilateral diplomacy.\nAt this juncture, I should like to pay a tribute and express gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His Majesty's Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland continue to follow his reports and recommendations that chart out multilateral processes in international relations. We therefore note with pride the fact that the Secretary-General and all Members of the United Nations have brought their good judgement to bear on many international crises. In their continued search for solutions to some very intractable conflicts they have played a pivotal role. We further salute the apostles of peace for having made it possible to defend the cause of freedom and human dignity under the umbrella of the United Nations peace-keeping forces.\nOn the other hand the delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland is forced to note the painful analysis that for far too long has unfairly regarded the United Nations as a non-functional world body and characterized it as a talk shop. To the surprise of the prophets of doom, evidence that such is not the case has dramatically emerged. The United Nations has managed to initiate successful negotiations towards a solution in Afghanistan in the Iran-Iraq war, in Kampuchea, in the Angolan conflict and in Western Sahara.\nHowever, many other issues remain partly or totally unresolved in spite of the efforts of the United Nations. The Organization continues to struggle with the elimination of the last vestiges of colonialism from the face of the earth. The external-debt burden is worsening by' the day, and that is an indication of the gap that still exists between developed and developing countries. The United Nations is fully aware that millions are faced with hunger and starvation in many parts of the world. Many Member States, like our beloved country, Swaziland, are faced with an influx of refugees and displaced persons.\nAt the end of 1987, Swaziland, which occupies an area of only 17,364 square kilometres, with a population of about 750,000, had 350 registered urban refugees and approximately 45,000 rural refugees. The numbers are increasing rapidly on a daily basis, and the critical situation faced by the refugees involves the shortage of food and the inadequacy of land, which limits the scope for productive agricultural activities.\nThe complex situation in the Middle East is cause for great concern, for it has reached an explosive stage where strife between Palestinians and Jews continues to prevail. Swaziland encourages the United Nations to redouble its efforts towards the attainment of a peaceful solution to that critical issue.\nThe Korean peninsula is still characterized by tension between the North and the South. That unhealthy atmosphere has promoted distrust and hatred in the peninsula, which was unfortunately divided by differences in ideology. We strongly recommend that all external forces cease forthwith from interfering in the internal affairs of both Koreas, and, in this regard, we believe that the people of the peninsula have the tremendous responsibility and capacity to enter into direct inter-Korean negotiations themselves.\nWe also commend the efforts of the United Nations in bringing about speedy and genuine self-determination and independence to the people of New Caledonia. We wholeheartedly support United Nations initiatives to conduct an unbiased referendum, which will undoubtedly indicate the true aspirations of the people of New Caledonia.\nIn Central America and the Caribbean we continue to note with great concern that a number of countries are increasingly strife torn by reason of their deteriorating economic situations, social unrest and political instability. Nicaragua and Panama, for example, have been and are still being subjected to pressure by military and paramilitary activities, as well as by economic embargoes. Consequently, the economies of those States, which are suspected of importing foreign ideologies, have been hard hit, to the social detriment of their peoples. We appeal to all Member States in the region to resolve their problems by peaceful negotiations, as advocated by His Majesty King Sobhuza II and currently by His Majesty King Mswati III of the Kingdom of Swaziland.\nThis year marks the forty-third anniversary of the beginning of the arms race. The horrendous events that occurred at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, resulting in the deaths of millions of people and in massive destruction of property, are an indelible part of the annals of history. What mankind now faces is the enormous production of highly sophisticated nuclear weapons that are capable of destroying mankind many, many times over. \nMy delegation views with utmost concern the currently escalating arms race which must o\u00a3 necessity be stopped in order \\\"to save succeeding generations 'from the scourge of war\\\". The outbreak of another world war, which would certainly lead to nuclear holocaust ~ a situation that would mean unprecedented disaster for mankind - must be totally avoided.\nIt is the responsibility of the international community to promote world peace and security for purposes of global development and co-operation by moving in the direction of complete disarmament. The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore commends the efforts of the United Nations in organizing three major conferences in 1978, 1982 and 1988 aimed at sensitising Member States to the need to reach a common consensus in the area of disarmament. Although all these conferences have failed to attain this major goal, it must be realized that they have, to a great extent, already stirred the conscience of the world community. The seriousness of the arms race was demonstrated by the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries at the seventh summit conference held in New Delhi in March 1983, at which it was observed that\u00b7.\n\\\"... the greatest peril facing the world today is the threat to the survival of mankind from nuclear war. Disarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament, is no longer a moral issue it is an issue of human survival. ... Nuclear weapons are more than weapons of war. They are instruments of mass annihilation.\\\" (A/38/132, para. 28)\nIt is our humble view that the excessive expenditure on weaponry suffocates the development of the world economy, thus perpetuating the misery and poverty afflicting more than two thirds of mankind, we therefore call for the immediate conclusion of a convention on both chemical and conventional weapons, not only to prohibit their development, production, stockpiling and possible use, but also to provide for the earliest destruction of existing weapons. The people of the Kingdom of Swaziland has learned with great shock and alarm that certain nuclear-possessing States have resolved to dump their nuclear wastes on the continent of Africa. What we find disquieting in this rather sinister episode is their justification of this act by the following reasons: first that their nuclear garbage is devoid of potential chemical or toxic risks to the people and the environment they are not prepared themselves to dump it inside their countries; and, secondly, that compensatory financial aid follows the dumping exercise.\nWe in the Kingdom of Swaziland remain ardent believers in the norms of international economic co-operation and in the positive spirit of multilateralism. However, my delegation continues to view with added concern the plight of our hard-hit fragile economies in the many developing countries, and particularly the grave agony of Africa's economic crisis. Indeed, it is our strangest observation that, in spite of the economic recovery experienced in some industrialized countries, developing countries continue to be confronted with an adverse external environment whose dimensions have devastated our strenuous efforts towards achieving the goal of economic self-reliance.\nThese countries continue to suffer from a combination of serious economic problems, inter alia, declining commodity prices, sharp exchange rate fluctuations, a severe debt crisis prompted by excessively high interest rates, and stagnation of official development assistance.\nIt may also be observed that studies conducted by world financial institutions do predict that the situation is extremely bleak for the sub-Saharan countries which, over the years, have been experiencing the worst economic declines in history, particularly in per capita income, investment and consumption. For instance, while growth in output was estimated at 3.2 per cent in 1987 compared to 4 per cent in 1986, the grim reality is that debt servicing has assumed crippling proportions, ranging from 30 per cent to 100 per cent of exports. The World Bank, on the other hand, also estimates an annual resource gap of more than $2.5 billion for these countries for the period 1986 to 1990, that is, if import levels of 1980 to 1982 are achieved and the necessary structural reforms are carried out. This is certainly not an encouraging scenario for North-South and South-South economic relations. We further wish to observe that the Kingdom of Swaziland is a small land-locked country whose economic development solidly depends on external trade. Thus, such unprecedented declines in commodity prices and the unfavourable international economic outlook represent a major collapse of our fragile economy.\nAbove all, for us in Swaziland the agricultural sector plays an important role in our economic development. It generates 71 per cent of our export earnings and provides 75 per cent of our labour force. It is therefore the policy of His Majesty's Government to intensify our industrial base development in order to enhance the quality of life and the betterment of living standards for our citizens. Thus we are active members of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference, whose cardinal principles and purposes remain aimed at nothing other than the modest consolidation of our hard won s\u043e\u0441io-economic and political independence.\nMy delegation has no illusions about the task that lies ahead, but we do have confidence in the modern technological institutions, headed by the United Nations system, that seek to harmonize the activities of our global village. We therefore, pay our highest tribute to the donor community, the United Nations system, and our partners in economic development for all the generous assistance rendered to improve our country, Swaziland. \nRespect for human rights is of cardinal importance in our world. It is a pity that we still learn of torture, disappearances and wanton killings in different parts of the world. His Majesty's Government strongly condemns such sinister practices  and urges the international community to reaffirm its fundamental duty and encourage respect for human rights and freedom. Practices such as racism and racial discrimination have no place in the evolution of international law and modern civilization. The Government and people of the Kingdom of Swaziland attach great significance to the long-drawn-out conflicts in southern Africa. In our view, they do not augur well for the progress of human civilization, and, as members of that volatile region, we certainly cannot afford the consequences of indulging in the luxury of standing by with folded hands when our future is at stake. Equally, we have no illusions when analysing the events unfolding in our political backyard, but we are fully determined to pursue resolutely our mission of peace. Swaziland is on record as having initiated some bold diplomatic steps in the now historic Manzana Diplomacy, whose fundamental aim and objective is to build bridges of peace in our region. Above all, it seeks the promotion of direct, peaceful dialogue among leaders in southern Africa.\nFurthermore, we note with great admiration the important role played by the Administration of the United States of America in bringing together the Governments of Cuba, Angola and South Africa in an attempt to find a peaceful solution to the Namibian and Angolan problems and consequently to the chronic problem inside South Africa.\nWe equally applaud the continued United Nations diplomatic initiatives in seeking a genuine and permanent political solution for the problems facing southern Africa, and we urge all towards peace in our region. My delegation also wishes to reaffirm in the strongest possible terms that the policy of His Majesty's Government is based on concrete factors of pragmatism rather than narrow political and ideological expediency. We are, therefore, committed to the sacred principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and those of the Organization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement, particularly the principles pertaining to the right of self-determination and independence of peoples under colonialism, neo-colonialism and other pernicious forms of human oppression. \nAbove all, Swaziland is committed to the settlement of international disputes by peaceful negotiations and the non-use of force, as envisaged in Chapters I and VI, particularly Articles 1 (2) and 33, of the Charter.\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the tremendous role played by the United Nations in the comprehensive formulation, development and shaping of the law of the sea, which transcends the limits of national jurisdiction and accommodates the international uses of the sea and its resources. We are confident that the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea will continue to make effective progress, in the Interest not only of the common heritage of mankind but also of the maintenance of peace and justice for all peoples in the world. It is particularly heartening that even my small, developing country, Swaziland, stands to benefit immensely from the successful implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \nWe in the Kingdom of Swaziland are greatly perplexed by the spread of international terrorism, whose victims are innocent people, including women and children. We humbly urge all parties concerned to exercise both moral and political restraint in resolving their differences.\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to pay a glowing tribute to the evolution of the United Nations system. This Organization is unique and remains \\\"the last best hope for mankind\\\". The people of Swaziland are only too proud to be associated with this noble Organization that has galvanized mankind into new and fresh concepts, guiding our onward march to a more peaceful and stable world of multilateral diplomacy. Thus, only a few weeks ago, the Kingdom of Swaziland celebrated its twentieth anniversary as a sovereign State; and, like many new States In the family of nations, we cannot forget how grateful and indebted we are to the international community for having made our national dreams possible. We further salute and honour the men of vision and wisdom whose Yalta and Dumbarton Oaks negotiations ushered us into this new world of the United Nations.\nHowever, let us be realistic: the challenges that face us are daunting ones, but they are not beyond the ingenuity of humanity to surmount. We must, therefore agree that we have not done sufficient. We must, therefore, move from words to deeds and make sure that together we can create true common security and peace for our peoples.\nHis Majesty's Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland wish to reaffirm their faith in and adherence to the principles of the Charter. They look forward to continued and fruitful co-operation with the United Nations and its specialized agencies.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the post of President of the Assembly and to convey to him our best wishes for the successful discharge of his\nimportant duties. We also congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, on his efforts to enhance the role of the United Nations in the cause of peace.\n\n\nFor more than four decades now, each year, at each of its sessions, the\nGeneral Assembly has discussed major problems of concern to the international\ncommunity. These deliberations have sought to strengthen the role of the United\nNations in finding solutions to problems relating to the aspirations of peoples for\nfreedom, independence, national sovereignty and independent development. If the\nUnited Nations has not always been able to discharge its functions, it is because\nthe super-Powers have tried, in various ways, to use it to promote their own\npolicies and interests. SO many times the United Nations machinery has been\nmisused to stifle the criticisms of Member States. Doubtless these attitudes run\ncounter to the interests of the overwhelming majority of States, which wish to see\nthe United Nations make sincere efforts to carry out its mission as a universal\nOrganization in keeping with the Charter.\n\nAt present we are seeing signs of detente. We cannot but welcome this trend.\nNevertheless, the fact is that we are living in a world fraught with contradictions\nand confrontations. We are far from a real, lasting peace. Relations between the\nSoviet Union and the United States have entered a period of adjustment based on\ntheir political, economic and military interests. Indeed, recent decades have\nshown that confrontations and arrangements between them have become cyclical.\n\n\nTheir policy has not really changed its basic trend towards hegemony. One of the\nmost important and constant parameters of this policy is the accelerating arms race.\nThe most recent testimony to this was the third special session of the United\nNations devoted to disarmament, which was held in June this year and ended without\nany result - even without the adoption of a final document. Outside the United\nNations, as Members are aware, the two super-Powers, the United States and the\nSoviet Union, have reached an agreement on missiles which they hailed as a new\nstage in the process of disarmament, whereas here at the United Nations at a\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, the voices of\nreason of Member States on the problem were ignored. This shows that the\nsuper-Powers consider questions of disarmament as matters exclusively within their\nCompetence and interests and that they minimize the role of other States in this\narea, deeming it negligible. This tendency to monopolize world affairs and to\nexercise diktat over 'international relations is a real danger for sovereign peoples\nand States. However important their role may be in view of their economic and\nmilitary potential, it cannot in any way replace the role of the international\ncommunity, in which all States must have an opportunity to state their views and to\ndecide jointly on questions relating to the destinies of peoples and humanity and\nto international peace and security.\n\nThe world economic situation is a source of real concern and cannot be\ndivorced from the political situation.\nUnbalanced international relations continue to penalize primarily the\ndeveloping countries, as a result of which most of them become increasingly\nimpoverished and experience grave and widespread backwardness. Therefore the\nestablishment of international economic relations on the basis of equality has now\nbecome a matter of great urgency.\n\nThe economic situation and at the same time the political situation are\nindicators of the fragility of current international security.\nWithout underestimating the value of any initiative taken to lessen tension,\nin the opinion of my delegation, the Treaty between the United States and the\nSoviet Union on Euro-missiles does not yet mean that peace in Europe and the world\nhas become more secure. As long as there is still confrontation between the two\npolitical and military blocs on the continent of Europe and as long as the concept\nof security is based on the balance of power, it will be difficult to talk about\ntrue security. Life has shown us that the policy of blocs - the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact - and the military presence of the\nsuper-Powers limit the national sovereignty of other States that are members of\nthem and kindles and increases the spirit of distrust and confrontation. By its\ntotally independent policy outside of blocs, Albania has, in its own way, made its\nmodest contribution to the cause of peace in the Balkans and in Europe.\nPeace, international security and co-operation are one and indivisible. There\ncan be no peace on one continent while there are tensions and conflicts in other\nparts of the world. There can be no true security in Europe if the Middle East or\nother areas are in flames and in a state of insecurity.\n\nAlbania has always been against regional conflicts and in favour of a\nnegotiated settlement of discards. These conflicts, which have brought suffering\nand poverty to the countries involved, have always been exploited by the\nimperialist Powers to the detriment of peoples and of peace.\nThe Albanian Government welcomes the steps taken recently by the parties\ndirectly involved in the conflicts to extinguish these hotbeds of tension. In our\njudgment, when it is a matter of putting an end to regional conflicts, it is\nimportant to define settlements that are acceptable to the parties involved, and not short-term solutions imposed from above. Similarly, we believe that it is just\nas important that the main contributions to these settlements should come from the\nStates of the region where the conflict is taking place since they are the ones\nmost interested in having a cease-fire in seeing peace established.\n\nWe cannot disregard the fact that, frequently, conflicts are kindled or\nextinguished depending on relations between the United States and the Soviet\nUnion - in most cases, even at their instigation. Therefore, to allow them then to\nbecome the arbiters of these conflicts would be to let the seed of discord and\nconflict remain. This can be seen very clearly from what is now taking place in\nAfghanistan. Those who committed aggression, as well as those who have constantly\nfanned its flames throughout the conflict, are now posing as the saviors of the\nsituation, acting as guarantors of the Afghanistan agreement.\n\nBut what kind of guarantors can these two super-Powers, the United States and the\nSoviet Union, be, if even after the agreement they continue to support and\nencourage the adversaries, in order to impose on the Afghan people a government\nthat would defend the interest of one or both of them? The Afghan people should be\nfree to decide their own future without any foreign interference.\n\nThe Albanian people and its Government welcomed the cease-fire between Iraq\nand Iran, which was welcomed by freedom-loving people throughout the world. We\nappreciate the steps taken by the two countries to put an end to a war that has\nserious consequences for the two neighbouring peoples and which is fraught with\ndanger for overall peace and security. We hope that this wisdom and this\ndetermination will characterize the negotiations now under way between the two\ncountries. We cannot fail to stress that peace in this region is still threatened\nby the presence of foreign fleets in the Persian Gulf. Peace cannot be preserved\nby the gunboats of the super-Powers; it can be preserved only by the peoples of the\nGulf States themselves. For all those who have sent warships into the region the\nquestion of the withdrawal of the fleets will be the real touchstone of their true\ndevotion to international peace and security.\n\nThis year the Middle East has witnessed some very important events. The\nuprising of the Palestinian popular masses which broke out on the West Bank and\nGaza against the Israeli occupiers and which has been resolutely carried on for\nmore than a year now has created a new situation and the immediate task at hand is\nfor the Palestinian people to achieve their legitimate national aspiration for\ntheir own land. Doubtless, a lasting solution to the problems of the Middle East\nis impossible without a solution being found to the Palestinian problem. The\nGovernment and people of Albania, consistent in its support of the just cause of\n\nthe Arab peoples, will continue, as we have done in the past, to support\nunreservedly the struggle of the suffering people of Palestine and that of all\nfraternal Arab peoples, to oust Israeli aggressors from the occupied territories.\nAs a Mediterranean country, we cannot fail to be concerned about the\npersistent presence of the war fleets of the super-Powers in the Mediterranean and\nwe cannot fail to stress the danger it involves. Their presence has not only made\nthe sea one of those militarized zones in the world, but has also more than once\ncreated a dangerous situation.\n\nThe most recent proposals for the so-called demilitarization of the\nMediterranean also seek to justify the balanced presence of the fleets of the\nsuper-Powers. In order for the Mediterranean to become a sea of peace and\nco-operation, the war fleets must be withdrawn and the bases and foreign troops\neliminated.\nThe development of friendly relations between our States and the Balkan States\nis a basic, ongoing tenet of the foreign policy of Albania. Albania not only\nproclaims the advantages of, and the need for, a policy of good-neighbourliness,\nbut by implementing it in practice has done its utmost to establish a political\nclimate favouring understanding, trust and true co-operation among the countries of\nthis area.\n\n\nThe Albanian Government has never sought conflict in the Balkans. It deems it\nits duty to work towards the establishment of stability in our region and the\nconstant improvement of the situation. Destabilization of any Balkan country would\nharm the balance of that area and peace in general. We believe that those\nprimarily concerned with the security and stability of the Balkans are the peoples\nand States of the region themselves. They cannot fail to appreciate the importance\nfor them of keeping foreign elements at bay.\n\nIn our view, the existence of different political and social systems in the Gulf countries should not become an obstacle to the development of State relations. Recognition of this fact and respect for it constitute an important premise for Balkan co-operation. We welcome the meeting of the foreign ministers of the Balkan States as a positive development, one that is helping to establish a spirit of understanding, trust and co-operation in our region. We are convinced that joint efforts could lead to steady progress in this positive process.\n\nOf course, the Balkans have problems. These are basically of a bilateral nature, but they also affect the region as a whole. However, common sense and\nrealism should prevail over the sad past, dominated by heated emotion. They should prevail over a present that is sometimes full of prejudice and actions fraught with consequences. One of the most acute problems, one that continues to be of concern\nto the States of our region, is that of the nationalities and minorities living in the territories of various countries. In the treatment of this rather thorny problem, on which the level of relations between Balkan countries has often depended, it would be necessary to proceed without undue emotion, but with wisdom, political wisdom, in a spirit of justice, keeping in mind specific historical facts, free from any narrow spirit of nationalism. This policy would help to strengthen understanding and trust between neighbouring countries. It would help to lessen and eliminate tension and to pave the way towards bilateral and multilateral cooperation. \n\nWhen minorities and nationalities enjoy all rights without discrimination, they become cohesive factors within a country, elements of rapprochement and friendship between peoples and countries of the region.\n\nJust as the extension of multifaceted relations between States is to their  advantage, the democratization of relations between various nationalities within\neach country, equality between nations, nationalities and minorities, their\npromote friendship between them. We believe that the peoples and States of the\ncultural and economic emancipation help to bring people closer together and to\nBalkans, which cannot fail to have learned from their past and present history, are\ncapable of achieving that.\n\nThe economic situation in Africa is of concern to the United Nations, which in\nMay of 1986 held a special session of the General Assembly devoted to this\nquestion. Quite rightly Africa continues to be concerned with the gravity of this\nsituation, which in many cases has amounted to destitution and in which a\ndisquieting shortage of food is threatening whole regions with real famine.\n\nThe causes of this situation must be sought in brutal colonial domination and in\nthe present neo-colonial exploitation, which, in the most diverse forms and ways,\ndevours the rich resources of the continent and its cheap commodities, guaranteeing\never-higher profits for the exploiters.\n\nSimilarly, the imperialist, racist policy of the South African regime, which\nimposes inhuman oppression and violence on the Azanian and Namibian peoples and is\na permanent threat to the countries of southern Africa, is fraught with\nconsequences for the peoples and countries of Africa.\nThe Government. and people of Albania supports unreservedly, and will continue\nso to support, the struggle of the Azanian people for freedom, the struggle of the\nNamibian people for national and social liberation and the struggle of all African\npeoples against racism, apartheid and neo-colonialism. The People's Socialist\nRepublic of Albania also supports the efforts of the Korean people to bring about\nthe independent reunification of its homeland.\n\nHumanity is at the threshold of the twenty-first century. The mind and\nintelligence of man have made possible unprecedented progress in discovering the\nsecrets of nature, as reflected in discoveries that have become milestones in\nscience and technology and open up great possibilities for progress in discovering\nnew horizons. We are bound to state, however, that the achievements of science and\ntechnology, instead of fully serving the cause of progress for the betterment of\nmankind are often, because of imperialist policies, used to serve the arms race and\npreparation for war. It is inadmissible that the achievements of science, instead\nof being the priceless asset of the whole of mankind, should be made the monopolies\nor domains of those that use them not only as a source of super-profits but also as\na method of exerting pressure on and dictating to others. On more than one\noccasion during the past decade the majority of Member States, in particular developing countries, have forcefully raised the question of the transfer of technology as one of the goals of efforts to establish more just and equal international economic relations. Despite everything, these just demands have so far fallen on deaf ears.\n\nAt the present time we are facing another negative phenomenon. Although by its very nature this problem may seem to be purely ecological, which it is, there is also a marked political overtone. I refer to the covert or overt efforts of\nsome States to rid their territories of industrial waste, including toxic and\nradioactive waste, and dump it in other countries, primarily the developing\ncountries.\nIt is therefore a paradox and unfair that the industrially advanced countries,\ninstead of transferring to the developing countries the technology that would help\nthem to make progress, are offering to transfer waste, including toxic waste. As\nif not content with the exploitation and other injustices they have imposed on\nthose countries, the big Powers are now committing against them acts that are\ninadmissible even from the most elementary human standpoint.\nIt is true that the concern arising from ecological problems has now taken on\nregional, even world-wide, dimensions. The safeguarding of the environmental\nbalance has now become a real concern for the Adriatic and Mediterranean\ncountries. The dumping of industrial waste, particularly from the chemical\nindustry, has caused intolerable pollution, especially in the northern Adriatic.\nThis is a semi-closed sea and the consequences of this type of pollution are even\nmore serious.\nMy country associates itself with the first steps towards co-operation in the\necological sphere on an approach to problems regarding the protection of the\nenvironment in the Balkan peninsula and in neighbouring areas.\n\nThe People's Republic of Albania pursues a totally independent foreign\npolicy. Its centuries-long history, as well as the history of the past 40 years,\nhas taught the people of Albania to place its freedom, independence and complete\nsovereignty, which are the basis of our State policy, above all else. Most\nimportant of all, it has not considered these assets apart from the context of what\ngoes on outside our country, apart from the freedom and independence of other\npeoples. we therefore respect other people and, at the same time, ask for: their\nrespect. Accordingly, we are not afraid to co-operate with other States we desire\nsuch co-operation. We see it as Q way to promote our own development and to\ncontribute to the development of international relations and co-operation. It is\nimportant also that this co-operation be based on equality and mutual advantage,\nand that it do no damage to the sovereignty or social system of any country.\nThe delegation of Albania has stated the views of its Government on some of\nthe most basic\\\" questions relating to current developments with the sincere desire\nof making its modest contribution to the consideration of certain agenda items\nbefore the Assembly. It will spare no effort, together with other Member States,\nto help to ensure that the work of this session will be as fruitful and successful\nas possible.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first offer my sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his assumption of the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. His election to that high office is apt recognition of his eminent qualities as well as a reflection of the esteem in which Argentina is held among the community of nations. His impressive record in international diplomacy gives us confidence that he will guide this session with authority and efficiency.\nI should also like to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, for the exemplary manner in which he presided over our deliberations during a very busy year.\nBefore proceeding I should like to convey Indonesia's sincere sympathy and solidarity to the Governments and peoples of Bangladesh, Jamaica and Sudan in the wake of the massive human suffering and destruction recently visited upon them by natural disasters. It is our earnest hope that the international community will extend adequate and timely assistance to the process of rehabilitation and reconstruction in those countries.\nA new climate of conciliation and mutual accommodation appears to be asserting itself throughout the world. Despite continuing uncertainties and ambivalence, some seminal trends in international developments are emerging as well as signs of a general relaxation of tensions, especially between the two super-Powers. In a number of regional conflicts, confrontation is giving way to dialogue and to efforts at finding negotiated solutions. Concurrently, basic movements are taking place on the economic landscape, propelling the world economy towards ever greater interdependence and integration.\nWe have all welcomed the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan as a significant contribution to both regional stability and international security. We likewise rejoiced at the cease-fire and the start of negotiations between Iran and Iraq in the conviction that the blessings of peace will not only accrue to the benefit of the peoples of Iran and Iraq themselves but also to the interest of stability and progress in the entire Gulf region and beyond.\nSimilarly, we are encouraged to note the enhanced prospects for a solution of the Western Sahara issue on the basis of the peace plan jointly submitted by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. On the question of Cyprus, a renewed dialogue is taking place between the President of Cyprus and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community which hopefully will yield an early settlement of all aspects of the problem.\nIn southern Africa, progress is being made in negotiations which could prepare the way for the long overdue implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and for the total independence of Namibia. And in South-East Asia, the Jakarta Informal Meeting on Kampuchea, held last July, has generated a new momentum in the process towards a just and comprehensive solution of the problem,\nIn laying the groundwork and in sustaining efforts towards finding solutions to those and other protracted conflict situations, much of the credit should go to the United Nations and to our Secretary-General. Indeed r at no time in recent history has the irreplaceable value and potential of the United Nations been so vividly manifested. Consequently, there has been an upsurge of support among Member States for this unique multilateral forum, including a renewed commitment to its strengthening and revitalization. This year\u2019s award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is indeed a timely confirmation and magnificent vindication of the role our world Organization has played and continues to play in maintaining and building the peace in a tense and troubled world. \nWhile these developments augur well for our efforts to bring about greater peace and justice and equitable prosperity for all nations, we cannot deny that the international situation is still fraught with unresolved tensions and economic disorder and with a pervasive sense of insecurity and common vulnerability to the threat of nuclear holocaust. The politics of power, of political domination and economic coercion, of blatant intervention and aggression still feature all too prominently in present-day international relations. Vestiges of colonialism and institutionalized racism continue to obstruct the universal impulses for freedom, equality and the social and cultural advancement of peoples. Deeply rooted imbalances and unacceptable inequities still permeate international economic relations. And if, indeed, a hopeful brightening can be discerned in the global East-West relationship, the problems and predicaments in the North-South polarization are, on the contrary, being even further aggravated.\nIt is clear that in facing the new opportunities as well as the challenges inherent in the evolving international situation we can no longer rely on such out-dated approaches as unilateralism or selective bilateralism, or on such notions as spheres of influence or power-bloc politics. The complexities of dealing with the new developments and trends now asserting themselves as global phenomena call for a conscious commitment to multilateralism, based on the imperatives of interdependence, common interest and shared responsibility among all nations of the world.\nYet the major nuclear Powers still appear reluctant to accept that basic proposition, even on issues of such transcendental importance as disarmament and international security. While wholeheartedly welcoming the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and the ongoing negotiations on strategic arms between the two major Powers, we cannot fail to observe that there has been no substantial easing of the arms race, especially in its qualitative or technological aspects. Furthermore, virtually all major issues on the disarmament agenda, be it the comprehensive test ban treaty, non-proliferation, the prevention of nuclear war or the militarization of outer space, continue to be subjected to such untenable arguments and considerations as strategic deterrence or the professed primacy of bilateral undertakings between the two major nuclear Powers. That is the undeniable reality faced by the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, which has yet to produce a single, substantive disarmament agreement since its reconstitution. That too was a major cause for the deeply disappointing outcome of the recently concluded General Assembly special session devoted to disarmament, which could not agree on even a Chairman's summing-up, let alone a final document of substance.\nPreventing the non-nuclear States from contributing actively to the process of disarmament negotiations is entirely unacceptable to us. The non-aligned and neutral States, including Indonesia, are therefore determined to assert their legitimate role in this respect and to redouble their efforts to achieve security for all, through multilateral negotiations leading toward total nuclear disarmament, the abolition of all other weapons of mass destruction and balanced reductions in conventional armaments. In that context we should in particular like to see the Conference on Disarmament complete as soon as possible the negotiations on a chemical weapons convention. Any other proposed course of action would serve only to divert us from this paramount objective. The conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty should also continue to be accorded high priority, as such an agreement would singularly contribute to arresting the development of new weapons systems and the refining of those already deployed, together with the delegations of Mexico, Peru, Sri Lanka and Yugoslavia, my delegation has formally submitted a proposal to the depository Governments of the Partial Test-Ban Treaty with a view to convening a conference at the earliest possible date to consider an amendment to the Treaty that would convert it into a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We believe that, in the light of the continuing deadlock in the Conference on Disarmament on the efforts to achieve such a treaty, the proposed amendment would provide a positive impulse towards that goal.\nOur collective capacity to rise to the challenges of a new era will be seriously impaired so long as millions of persons continue to languish under colonial domination and so long as the utter immorality of apartheid and racism continues to be condoned.\nWith regard to Namibia, Indonesia has followed with keen interest the ongoing negotiations between Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States to establish a basis for just and durable peace in the south-western region of Africa and to ensure Namibia's independence. While we sincerely hope that these discussions will achieve concrete results, we cannot forget that South Africa was also a party to the negotiations leading to the adoption of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence and had committed itself to abiding by the provisions of that plan. But, ever since, Pretoria has used every means to undermine and forestall all efforts to effect its implementation. We must remain vigilant, therefore, and prevent the process now under way from being turned into yet another ploy by which the racist regime will again seek to gain time further to entrench its illegal occupation of the territory.\nIt should be out common resolve that in this year of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) we shall finally secure the faithful implementation of the plan for Namibian independence. To that end, Indonesia supports the call for the early convening of the Security Council in order to adopt a resolution enabling the Secretary-General immediately to proceed with practical steps necessary for the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia. In the meantime, we should continue our strong support for the Namibian people's struggle, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), to achieve the establishment of a truly independent and united Namibia.\nIn South Africa itself, there has been no let-up in the brutal terror and repression by the Pretoria regime against all forms of opposition to apartheid. Consequently, the polarization and confrontation between the racist minority and the oppressed majority have taken on ever-more-violent dimensions. My Government remains convinced that the imposition of comprehensive, mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter will be the only effective means to bring a peaceful end to apartheid, so that in its place a non-racial and democratic society can be built. The international community should also intensify action to compel Pretoria to desist from its incessant acts of aggression and destabilisation against its neighbours. Concrete, material support to the African front-line States should also be stepped up in order to enable them to free themselves from this perpetual state of political blackmail and economic strangulation. The establishment of the Action for Resisting Invasion, Colonialism and Apartheid (AFRICA) Fund by the Non-Aligned Movement at the Harare summit conference in 1986 can be seen to be a concrete response to this challenge. Indonesia was pleased to be able to pledge a cash contribution of $2,250,000 to the Fund, to be disbursed over three years. \nThe struggle of the Palestinian people for justice and national independence has always been at the root of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Today the question is no longer whether the Palestinians will be victorious in their sacred cause but, rather, how long it will take and at what sacrifice. The intifada, the sustained popular uprising in the occupied territories, has fundamentally altered the strategic equation by effecting a qualitative transformation in the nature and level of the struggle against Israeli oppressor. It has at the same time shattered the status quo of the past 20 years and with it the false air of smug complacency of the Tel Aviv regime. Indeed, the daily atrocities and acts of wanton violence unleashed against unarmed Palestinian protestors in the West Bank, in Gaza and in the Holy City of Al-Quds fully expose the bankruptcy of Israel's attempts to impose an annexationist fait accompli in the occupied territories. Those developments have also galvanized the people of the Palestinian nation, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (P\u0141O), their sole and legitimate representative, to prepare for a new phase in their political struggle.\nIndonesia fully supports the call of the States members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries upon the Security Council to place Palestinian territories under temporary United Nations supervision in order to put an end to the acts of intimidation and oppression against the Palestinian people. At the same time, political and diplomatic pressures should be brought to bear on Israel to persuade it to cease its opposition to the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East envisaged in General Assembly resolution 38/58 C, for it offers the only viable framework for a comprehensive settlement based on the total withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, and the early realization of the Palestinians' inalienable right to self-determination and to a sovereign and independent State in Palestine.\nAs events of the past year show, Israel's obsessive determination to impose by force of arms its own aggressive and expansionist designs on the region is also reflected in its blatant occupation of sovereign Lebanese territory. The arduous taste undertaken by the people of Lebanon to restore their unity and to bring about normalcy are continuously being undermined by such illegal Israeli actions. Indonesia therefore fully supports Lebanon's demand for the immediate, unconditional and complete withdrawal of all Israeli occupation forces.\nFor the past nine years Indonesia, together with other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), has been engaged in efforts to put an end to protracted strife and bloodshed in Kampuchea and to the immense suffering of the Kampuchean people. As ASEAN's interlocutor, Indonesia has explored practical modalities that could bring about genuine dialogue and negotiations among the parties to the conflict and that, in turn, could lead to a comprehensive, just and durable solution. In the Ho Chi Minh City Understanding reached between the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Viet Nam in July of last year and at the Jakarta Informal Meeting that was structured on the basis of that Understanding and convened in July this year we believe we have found a viable framework within which to realize that long-sought goal.\nThrough the Jakarta Informal Meeting a start has been made to replace armed conflict and confrontation with political dialogue and negotiations. It also represents the first time that all parties directly involved and the other concerned countries of the region were able to sit down together and to have a direct talk with one another to identify possible areas of common ground as well as the real obstacles to a solution.\nAfter frank and constructive discussions the participants in the Jakarta Informal Meeting agreed on the need to solve the Kampuchean problem through political means and thus not through a military fait accompli. A common understanding was also reached on the ultimate form of such a solution, namely through the establishment of an independent, sovereign, peaceful, neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and on the basis of self-determination and national reconciliation. The participants shared the view that the two key and interlinked issues of the Kampuchea problem are, first, the withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea, to be carried out within the context of an over-all political solution, and, secondly, the prevention of a recurrence of the genocidal policies and practices of the past regime. They also concurred on the need to ensure the cessation of all foreign interference and external arms supplies to the opposing Kampuchean forces, to set definite timetables and to provide for an effective international presence to supervise those processes.\nThe Meeting further agreed to continue discussions through a Marking Group in order to examine specific aspects of a political solution. The Working Group is to complete its work by December 1988 and make recommendations on the convening of another Meeting. In that connection Indonesia is set to act as host for a meeting of the Working Group in the second half of this month.\nWe realize that the Jakarta Informal Meeting cannot and should not be the only valid approach to negotiations and the settlement of the problem. We are aware of, and are in full sympathy with, the initiatives and parallel efforts that are being undertaken by others. In that regard we do appreciate the unremitting efforts of the Secretary-General to find a political solution to the problem and to try to devise a feasible scenario towards that end. In the same vein Indonesia welcomes the initiative of the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to complement and reinforce our regional efforts on Kampuchea, and, of course, Indonesia and ASEAN remain fully supportive of Prince Sihanouk who, because of his pre-eminent stature and prestige, continues to play an indispensable role through his unrelenting guest to bring the sufferings of his tormented people to an early end.\nWe all recognize the complexities of the Kampuchean problem in its many dimensions and aspects and in its regional as well as its international ramifications. In view of that, and considering that wide divergences of view still exist, especially on the modalities of a solution, we believe it to be pertinent and prudent to engage in a preliminary phase of informal discussions before proceeding to formal negotiations in the context of an international conference. That is and has always been the modest goal of the Jakarta Informal Meeting. Indonesia and ASEAN have from the outset worked on the assumption that a comprehensive solution to the Kampuchea question, especially in its extra-regional aspects, can be achieved only through an international conference with the participation of the parties directly concerned and the countries of the region, as well as the major Powers and other interested States. However, it is clear that adequate substantive preparations should precede the convening of such a conference if success is to be obtained. We therefore hope and trust that the international community will continue to lend its support to the regional peace process initiated by the Jakarta Informal Meeting.\nWe are encouraged by the interim agreements that have been reached on the future political status of New Caledonia. The modalities that will be set in motion bolster our hope that the decolonization of the Territory will be carried out in accordance with the aspirations of the indigenous population for self-determination and independence, while taking into account the rights and interests of all of its inhabitants.\nThe situation in the Korean peninsula remains a source of recurrent tensions in East Asia. It is regrettable, therefore, that the recent dialogue between the North and the South did not make much headway. At the same time we realize that after decades of mutual mistrust and suspicion the initiation of efforts towards national reconciliation is indeed a formidable task. It is our sincere hope that the resumption of their talks later this month will lead to tangible results, in conformity with their shared aspiration for peaceful reunification. In Central America, the signing of the Esquipulas agreement last year reflected the determination of its leaders to resolve peacefully and comprehensively the tension and strife that beset the region. It was our expectation that regional harmony and common economic progress could henceforth be fostered in accordance with the principles of sovereignty, common security, non-interference, democracy and development. We note to our dismay, however, that now, one year later, the momentum of the peace process has stalled. Indeed, the progress achieved so far may be in jeopardy unless there is renewed commitment by all the parties directly involved to the full and faithful compliance with the agreement.\nOn the question of the Malvinas, my delegation commends the flexible approach adopted by Argentina and hopes that a climate of trust will be created for the resumption of formal negotiations leading to a peaceful and definitive settlement of the sovereignty dispute.\nAs in the political sphere, the world economy is also going through changes that are fundamentally transforming the shape and substance of international economic relations. Over the past few decades, scientific and technological innovations have progressed at a phenomenal pace and in the process are drastically altering the patterns of production and consumption, of trade and financial exchanges and of comparative advantage. Obviously, these basic shifts in economic patterns will have significant implications for the policy premises and assumptions underpinning present development strategies.\nConcurrently, other developments of far-reaching implications are emerging and gaining prominence throughout the international economic landscape. The 12 member countries of the European Communities are pursuing the integration of their national economies into a powerful, single market by 1992. The United States and Canada have recently signed an agreement that would eliminate all tariff barriers between them. The centrally planned economies have embarked on paths of economic restructuring that will integrate them further into the mainstream of the world economy. And, as widely predicted, the centre of gravity of world economic activity and development may soon sill ft from the Atlantic to the Pacific bas in. There can be no doubt that these changes will further propel the integration of the world economy, as well as the ever closer inter-linkage of the issues of money, finance, trade and development.\nWhat is most regrettable, however, is that these dramatic changes are unfolding while, at the same time, the position and interests of many developing countries are being increasingly marginalized.\nFor the greater part of the 1980s, aptly described as the \\\"lost decade for development\\\", developing countries have been caught in a web of cumulative constraints and setbacks. Consequently, their economies remain mired in sluggish growth, their development punctuated by stagnation, reversals and even regression. External indebtedness, often exacerbated by adverse exchange rate fluctuations in the major currencies, has now reached critical levels. Financial flows for development, both official and private, have contracted drastically. Their exports to the developed countries are encountering a plethora of protectionist barriers. Commodity earnings, the economic lifeblood of a majority of developing countries, continue to be in a prolonged slump. Meanwhile, the austere adjustment measures undertaken by most developing countries at the behest of international financial institutions have not only cut deeply into their productive capacities for growth but have also undermined their programmes and projects designed to alleviate the plight of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of their societies. It is obvious that if no concerted action is taken to reverse their predicament, many developing countries will inevitably remain locked in underdevelopment and risk being side-lined permanently on the periphery of the world economy, thus adding the real and potent threat of social upheaval to national and international peace and stability.\nIn the light of these stark realities in the North-South polarization, there is a clear and urgent need for the United Nations to put the issues of development and international economic relations back on the priority list of the global agenda. It is also clear that in this era of growing interdependence and integration of the world economy the path forward can only be through dialogue and negotiation, based on the premise of mutuality of interests between the North and the South.\nIndeed, a beginning in this direction has already been made. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII), constructively addressed the interrelated issues of resources for development, commodities, international trade and the problems of the least developed countries. The Uruguay Round, if conducted in strict adherence to the Punta del Este understandings and commitments, offers new hope for a more rational and effective multilateral trading system. And the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development adopted in 1986, has joined the international community in a unique partnership of shared responsibility to arrest the continent\u2019s threatened slide into further economic deterioration.\nWe should vigorously pursue and build upon these efforts. A comprehensive, durable and development-oriented solution to the debt crisis, anchored in the shared responsibility of both debtors and creditors, has become imperative. The general principles that should guide us towards such a solution have already been defined in General Assembly resolutions 41/202 and 42/198 and in the Final Act of UNCTAD VII. Urgent action to remedy the commodity situation is required, and we look forward to the Common Fund becoming operational soon. The painful paradox of net transfers of resources from the developing countries to the developed should be reversed and rational perspectives to international development financing should be restored. Central to this objective is the need to convene an international conference on money and finance for development. The recommendations of the recently held Mid-Term Review on the African Recovery and Development Programme should help to intensify international co-operation and mobilize the required financial resources for the Programme's implementation. Additionally, the proposed special session of the General Assembly on .the reactivation of economic growth and development in the developing countries, to be held not later than 1990, will afford us a timely opportunity to adopt a global consensus on concrete action in these interrelated issues. It should also be an occasion to forge greater unity and coherence in our collective responses to the historical opportunities facing us today and in the years ahead.\nRecently, environmental issues have attracted the heightened attention of the international community. This has resulted from the introduction of two major reports to last year's General Assembly and the intensified concern for such issues as toxic waste, acid rain, climatic change and the \\\"greenhouse effect\\\", depletion of the ozone layer, desertification and escalating pollution. The danger of irreversible destruction to the environment is being increasingly recognized. Intense economic activity related to development; as well as conditions of mass poverty and deprivation, ace inextricably linked to the ecological balance of the environment. Essentially, the effective protection of the environment can only be secured through sustainable development and the adoption of stringent international legal instruments. Thus, last year's General Assembly resolutions and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, ace indeed steps in the right direction. What is new required on this crucial issue of our common survival and common future is that we foster solidarity and partnership among nations for ensuring continued economic growth and development without compromising the well-being of our future generations.  \nThis year the world celebrates the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principles enshrined in this Declaration have provided the basis for subsequent international and national human rights efforts and have served as a set of guiding principles for our political and social behaviour. In this anniversary year, let us renew our commitment to ensuring recognition of the dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. In the same spirit, let us not slacken our efforts to eradicate the illicit trafficking in narcotics and to end the tragedy of drug abuse. Nor should we, in the face of the unprecedented numbers of refugees who, fleeing war, natural calamities and the threat of starvation, have sought shelter in neighbouring lands, allow their numbers or the extent of their needs to dissuade us from finding equitable and lasting solutions.\nAs we approach the beginning of a new millennium, there is a resurgent sense of hope that concrete progress is possible in resolving the most intractable global issues that have for so long defied solutions. In this regard, we should indeed pay a tribute to our esteemed Secretary-General, who through his patient and unflagging efforts has considerably brightened the prospects of bringing peace to conflict-ridden regions. But, as he himself pointedly observes in his report on the work of our Organization, the emerging world situation, with major conflicts on the way to solution, is bound to impose additional responsibilities on the Organisation - political, economic and humanitarian. If we are to meet this expectation, it is essential that the financial health of the United Nations be restored and that the process of reform and restructuring to improve its functioning, efficiency and effectiveness be matched by the consistent support, including financial support, of all the Members. Moreover, as we move into what we hope will be a more constructive phase in world developments, it will be incumbent on all Member States, large and small, to utilize the potentials of our Organization in much more rational and purposeful ways. Let us, therefore, seize this opportunity and marshal our collective resolve to strengthen out co-operation and to harmonize out actions in this multilateral forum that is so uniquely qualified to advance our shared aspirations for just peace, common security and equitable prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI wish first of all to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo, Minister for External Relations of the Argentine Republic, an illustrious exponent of Latin American diplomacy and intellectual traditions, on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the Assembly.\nI take pleasure in expressing here my affection and respect for Ambassador Nita Barrow, whose attributes and diplomatic experience are a credit to our region.\nI wish also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his tireless and effective quest for peace and harmony among nations, and to assure him of my admiration and support. The Government and the people of Bolivia wish to express, through me, their solidarity and sympathy with the Governments and peoples of Bangladesh, Jamaica and Mexico in connection with the natural disasters of recent weeks, which caused such serious loss of life and material damage.\nThe forty-third session of the General Assembly is beginning its deliberations within an auspicious framework of profound changes in world politics. The East-West agreement on disarmament and understanding has opened up the prospect of lasting and beneficial peace by initiating a broad process of dialogue and negotiation which we hope will help put an end to the insanity of the nuclear arms race. Dialogue has begun to eliminate, we hope for ever, polarization based on the fragile theory of peaceful coexistence - polarization that has put at risk the system of international security. We are living in a new era of reason, of faithful and sincere relations among States, which give a fresh impetus to dialogue and strengthen the political will of States to consolidate peace and effective co-operation to overcome hegemony and irrational pressure and thus create a world order based on the dignity of the individual.\nThe changes that have taken place will be to the common benefit in the context of the objective of beginning a new era in North-South relations on the basis of symmetrical interdependence, so that well-being will no longer be an exotic flower that blooms only in industrialized countries, which are wealthy because they are industrialized, and which monopolize the magic of technology.\nThe understanding between the super-Powers on the establishment of this historic foundation of peace will test our will to co-operate in the service of those on the neglected fringes of the world who are tackling the obstacle course of development in the face of brutal frustration and at the cost of enormous social sacrifices. \nIn recognizing the blessings of nuclear disarmament we must acknowledge the peace efforts of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. These reflect the humanistic idealism of the San Francisco Charter, which advocates a just and harmonious international society, and are based on the philosophical foundations laid at Bandung and Belgrade.\nThe solidarity of the weak countries of the third world has undoubtedly helped to promote the cause of mankind, which has been strengthened by East-West co-operation, thanks to the theory and practice of active neutrality in a world which until recently lived in fear induced by nuclear terror and which still suffers from the devastating scourge of the absolute poverty affecting two thirds of the world's population. This last challenges the very survival of mankind.\nThe future of the developing countries will be at serious risk until stable conditions are established to foster their development and provide a political solution to the problem of external debt- Early in this century force was used to make a Latin American State discharge its public obligations, and it was then that the Drago doctrine emerged, which made recovery of such debts by coercion illegal. Today there are more subtle ways of putting pressure on States, particularly those of Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. These create intolerable financial strangulation, cause developmental regression and impoverish the peoples concerned. In these times, it is quite incongruous to accept the principles of protectionism in the face of this heavy burden borne by the third world. And, of course, the threat or use of force in any form is unacceptable. This matter is in essence political, and involves the responsibility of both creditors and debtors. Despite its struggle to free itself from the worst hyper inflationary crisis that any country of Latin America and the Caribbean has ever suffered, Bolivia recognizes the existence of this financial obligation.\nWe have been negotiating the buying-back of our commercial debt on terms acceptable both to us and to the creditor banks. We have met our payments to multilateral official financing agencies, and on the bilateral level we have been flexible in our approach to negotiations with the Paris Club. However, these efforts and this true demonstration of our good faith and of our recognition of what we owe should not lead anyone to take unilateral decisions of non-payment. But the sacrifice borne by our people is overwhelming because the servicing of this debt involves more than 25 per cent of the value of our exports, which imposes a stranglehold on my people's right to strive to achieve disarmament and to combat poverty. This situation is repeated mutatis mutandis in almost all the debtor countries. As a result, the entire world community - and particularly the creditor countries - must become aware of this grave matter, and undertake the realistic and practical measures needed to prevent this question of debt from becoming a political and financial disaster of unforeseeable consequences for the whole world. The negative burden of debt on the economy of my country is revealed in tragic terms in a document which I have annexed to my statement and which will be distributed with the official version of my address. \nI have referred in some detail to the problem of external debt because this is the roost obvious link in the chain which binds the Third World to a cruel and unjust destiny that must be overcome. But, unfortunately for us, it is not the only link. We suffer from acute problems and shortages with respect to external financing for development, and in terms of trade, to mention only two aspects of a very gloomy and multi faceted picture.\nIt is not possible for the flow of capital to run from an impoverished South to a prosperous North. Latin America and the Caribbean alone contribute, through interest payments and other obligations, close to 32 billion per year more to the creditor countries than they receive. We must ask ourselves: Who is contributing to the greater development of whom?\nAlthough Bolivia appreciates and is grateful for the technical and financial co-operation which it receives from bilateral and multilateral sources, and which goes towards its development, this is patently insufficient and not consonant with our determined resolve to escape from our current stage of underdevelopment. And in this forum it is appropriate to mention the co-operation of agencies of the United Nations system, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC) and others. But it is also necessary to state our hope that they will participate at a higher level of resources in my country's development endeavours.\nThere can be no doubt that the heterogeneous and pluralistic make-up of international society does not make it possible for there to be absolute agreement on assessments of world and regional problems. But we must recognize that in many cases this play of interests has a disruptive and decisive effect on the internal policies of States. However, we are borne up by the conviction that it is not on the basis of prejudiced attitudes and preconceptions that we shall be able to improve international relations. For we believe that if we come together each year in this forum, we do so in order to find appropriate solutions to the problems and conflicts facing it, and not to deepen our differences further. There are universal ethical values which are in keeping with the very essence of the dignity of a human being, whatever his or her culture, education, or national identity. These values encompass the will and resolve of all peoples of the planet to achieve peace, individual and social freedom, the right to development, and the full validity of international law.\nThe peace solution in Central America can no longer be deferred. This abode of humanity, this Continent of Hope, with which we have the warmest solidarity, has been suffering the consequences of fratricidal struggle for so many years, and to date it has not been possible to eliminate the violence.\nPerhaps it might be appropriate for new diplomatic initiatives to be taken, designed to put into effect the very fruitful work carried out by the Contadora and the Support Group to ensure that the negotiating framework among the Central American Governments my really come into proper effect immediately. This is a matter of urgency, and there is a valid solution to a worthy and fair political formula which will bring about a cessation of hostilities and promote understanding on the basis of practical implementation of the principles underlying the thinking of this world Organization and its regional branch, the Organization of American States (OAS). It is not inappropriate to mention, in connection with this matter, the analogy which may be traced to the results achieved in promoting peace in other regions of the world, which are very fresh in our memories. \nOne of the principles of international law - perhaps the most important and fully valid one - rejected at a very early stage the colonialist policy which prevailed at that time, regarding as an execrable practice the extension of sovereignty over Territories and populations that were beginning to form their own socio-historical identity. For this reason, we reject any formula that springs from the colonialist mentality, which still persists and continues to trample underfoot the dignity of certain nations.\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations has on many occasions condemned the continuing imposition of the colonial power of the United Kingdom on the Malvinas Islands, and on this occasion my country renews its support of the historical rights of the Argentine Republic over this southern island Territory occupied by Great Britain, and our support for the resumption of negotiations designed to find a peaceful solution to this conflict.\nWith the same pan-American awareness, Bolivia's support of the Panamanian Republic over the canal continues to be constant, and it is imperative for the international community to guarantee the fulfilment of the 'Ttorrijos-Carter Treaty.\nThere are discrepancies in other latitudes that have been the subject of General Assembly resolutions, and we should be resolved to safeguarding the principle of independence which cannot be trampled underfoot by foreign interference. We are referring to the conflicts in Kampuchea, Cyprus, Lebanon, Namibia said the Western Sahara.\nIn the same spirit, we appeal to the parties concerned to achieve unification in Korea on the basis of dialogue.\nFortunately, and thanks to the endeavours of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the war in the Persian Gulf, which so greatly disturbed world peace, is approaching its end. This is a historic achievement by the United Nations, which has solidly established itself as the highest and most trustworthy world-wide machinery for managing, negotiating, and bringing about the achievement of peace wherever it may be interrupted or disrupted.\nWe should also welcome the beginning of the process of withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, and the respect shown for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country. That, too, is an achievement of this world Organization.\nThe policy of apartheid of the South African Government is an abominable scar on the face of human society. It is repugnant to the legal and ethical conscience of the world that this racial segregation should continue to be practised with impunity by the Government of this country. And that Government should be the subject of the strongest possible sanctions for its conduct, which runs totally counter to all the codification of international law in the area of the validity and respect for human rights.\nRecent months have been fruitful, in the sense that the conflicts have been controlled and fresh conflicts prevented. The United Nations' activities have shown it to be a great neutral and trustworthy participant, helping to create conditions that should lead to dialogue and the resolution of conflicts. There is a promising atmosphere for the \\\"creation of peace\\\", with love, reconciliation and good faith. A new spirit has emerged, a spirit that will lead to the creation of peace through the broad avenues of negotiation, which will, in turn, provide incentives to the economic and social, political and moral sectors of our society, doing away with the need for and the possibility of violence. These are mechanisms which are based on the principle of the maintenance of peace, and States have begun once again to believe in and trust the bodies of the United Nations system, whose impartiality and neutrality can be relied upon.\nThe item on development and strengthening of good-neighbourliness between States undoubtedly is the one that most strikingly demonstrates the need to foster and further friendly relations between States bound by geography and common borders. This period in man's history is a time of physical and economic integration. A happy example of reconciliation and the establishment of lasting peace for mutual benefit is that of Europe and the Economic Community. In Latin America and the Caribbean we are striving eagerly to achieve that goal of political reintegration and economic integration. That is the path of unity and the quest for a common destiny.\nThis item should be tackled with total intellectual honesty, defining the causes which at times make it impracticable to maintain friendly relations between neighbouring States when unnecessary conflicts await solution - conflicts which need to be overcome precisely because of the people's new objectives of peace and development, within the framework of imaginative diplomatic activities and with the creativity consonant with the changes now taking place in all parts of the world.\nWe must increase the ability of the United Nations to achieve its purposes. All initiatives designed to strengthen the system of international peace and security deserve our warmest support, because we are convinced that we have not yet succeeded in adopting an efficient system that will avert conflicts and provide for the solution of disputes. Solutions can be found if we continue to work faithfully within the framework of the competence of United Nations bodies and the principle that an appropriate solution should be found for any conflict within a reasonable period. It is in the interest of the international community to find machinery and procedures that facilitate the implementation of General Assembly resolutions on the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nTo this end, the intervention of the Secretary-General can be decisive, as has been demonstrated in practice, in promoting dialogue between the parties or in proposing alternative formulas, so that all conflicts are solved satisfactorily.\nThe item relating to the peaceful settlement of disputes among States Members is of particular interest to Bolivia and we have therefore sponsored draft resolutions urging all states to fulfil and comply in good faith with the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes.\nOnce again we reaffirm this juridical position, which is of enormous moral significance in terms of the prestige of the world Organization since the United Nations and the regional organizations  ere established precisely to maintain international peace and security. That objective is being achieved through good faith and frankness, in keeping with honest statesmanlike conduct, by means of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nWithin the framework of these universal principles and in the light of American regional policy, Bolivia has proposed, since 1979, a solution to the problem of the landlocked status imposed on it as the result of armed aggression in 1879. The world public knows that my country achieved independence in 1825 with a Pacific Ocean coast, the coastal province covering an area of approximately 160,000 square kilometres. The coastal mutilation was never accepted by my country and for more than a century we have been snaking persistent efforts to find a solution to this problem through direct negotiation and, from 1979 onwards, with the participation and diplomatic and political support of the Organization of American States (OAS). \nBolivia needs sovereign control over access to the Pacific Ocean that will restore its original status as a coastal country. To this end, we have carried on intense diplomatic activity, which has created a genuine awareness of this problem among the world public. During these multilateral diplomatic activities, and particularly in the regional framework of the OAS, a number of resolutions have been adopted in which the parties involved in the dispute have repeatedly been urged to begin negotiations designed to find a just solution to this problem. It will be understood how much political, economic and moral damage my country has suffered as a result of this despoiling of its marine patrimony at a time, fortunately long past, when might was the supreme law of nations.\nThis outstanding issue has a political and diplomatic basis on which we seek to redress a historic injustice. We are not seeking to deny the legal validity of longstanding bilateral agreements, but today they need to be supplemented and brought up to date in the light of the present realities of international life. It is no answer to offer mere free transit as a substitute for the return of usurped territory. That is why successive Bolivian Governments have sought a just solution based on Latin American brotherhood. This is not an issue that can be clouded by casuistic speechifying and claims based on historical situations that are fossilized and out of date.\nIn keeping with the resolutions of the Organization of American States, in 1987 Bolivia put a proposal for the solution of the conflict to the Government of Chile as the basis for negotiations, which took place in Montevideo in April of that year. Unfortunately, that basis for an understanding to our mutual benefit, which would have opened up the prospect and great possibilities of integration, peace and development, was arrogantly rejected, to the surprise even of the people of that country.\nDespite the continuing aggressive and arrogant policy of the present Government of Chile, my country will continue its efforts until it exhausts the regional resources available to it in the OAS before transferring the problem to the United Nations.\nBolivia cherishes the hope that international solidarity and the practical viability of calm and up-to-date bilateral diplomatic negotiations will make it possible for our country to regain access to the Pacific Ocean by means of this policy of peace, integration and development.\nWe are certain that all Member States are carrying on a whole-hearted struggle against drug trafficking, which in the last two decades has assumed unprecedented proportions owing to the stubborn attitude of the criminals engaging in this very lucrative business, who challenge the capacity of State institutions, for action and control because they are able to draw on considerable economic power. This is a crime against mankind which we must eliminate. Its perverse and insensate nature goes beyond any reasonable considerations and our purpose must be to eliminate all aspects of this inhuman activity. The international community simply cannot live with drug trafficking and its consequences.\nIn the face of this inescapable fact, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Movement of Non-Aligned States and the international community have been the first - and this has been accepted by all States - to put forward the principle of collective, shared responsibility in the struggle to eradicate this scourge once and for all. The new definition of the crime does not separate the developing countries, which have been capriciously called producer or transit countries for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, from the developed countries, which, in similes fashion, have been characterized as consuming countries. The problem of the criminal activity of drug trafficking affects everyone equally, with its attendant negative impact on economies and the scourge of drug addiction.\nWe should note the steps taken as a result of genuine international solidarity in the struggle to combat this evil through the activities of the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control and the United Nations Development Programme, as well as the United States of America and the countries of Europe, which have announced, and in many cases put into effect, programmes of economic assistance for those countries that are affected by production, so as to enable them to attack this problem effectively.\nDespite good intentions, the degree of co-operation is still quite low and does not encompass the minimum needs of existing plans to deal with this problem.\nBolivia has just promulgated a strong law which it is applying in this unequal struggle against the power of drug traffickers: \\\"Law governing coca and controlled substances\\\". It is one of the most modern laws ever adopted in recent years in the area of positive anti-drug law. Its special characteristics combine harsh penalties with the replacement of coca crops by means of planned alternative development aimed at agricultural substitution and providing the necessary economic incentives to those farmers affected by the elimination of the traditional crops.\nThe positive aspects of that law have clearly achieved encouraging results: while the confiscation of cocaine paste has increased substantially, many of the most powerful drug traffickers have been arrested and hundreds of cocaine factories have been destroyed. In addition, thousands o\u00a3 hectares of coca cultivation have been eradicated in compliance with our international commitments But it is clear that these efforts could be undermined if the industrial countries, such as the United States of America,   not effectively contribute in a timely manner the financial resources they have pledged. In this connection, my country calls on the international community to make a decisive contribution to the eradication of improper use and illegal trafficking of drugs and to double its efforts, without applying pressure or setting conditions, because our decision to continue the fight to final victory is being demonstrated daily.\nIn conclusion, I wish once again to reaffirm our unswerving commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and our conviction that mankind must, with the support of all, pursue the course that has been so auspiciously begun in recent times towards its glorious destiny of peace and justice.\nMay God bless world peace.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. His country Argentina and mine, Syria, both of which are members of the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries, have always maintained relations of friendship and co-operation. We are confident that his political skill in guiding the deliberations of the present session will ensure the success of our work.\nIt is also a pleasure to express my appreciation of the outstanding success achieved by his predecessor, Mr, Peter Florin, in guiding the work of the forty-second session. To him and to his friendly country, the German Democratic Republic, we offer our best wishes for unceasing progress and success.\nThe achievements of the Secretary-General and his assistants in reinforcing the role of the United Nations merit our deep appreciation and gratitude. We have especially high regard for the Secretary-General's personal initiatives and  participation in efforts to tackle a number of difficult regional problems. This year the United Nations has begun to take significant steps towards restoring its international stature, which was greatly affected during the cold-war years. A new and serious way of thinking has revitalized the role of the international Organization in finding solutions for pressing world problems, foremost among which are regional conflicts.\nThere is no doubt that the Soviet-American dialogue has created an atmosphere of d\u00e9tente in relations between East and West which has been reflected in one way or another in dealing with regional conflicts, which will make it easier to find just solutions for many of them. The climate of detente has been roost vividly manifested in the cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran war, the situations in Afghanistan, South West Africa and South-East Asia, and the important meetings conducted or supervised by the Secretary-General of the patties directly involved in the problems of Cyprus and Western Sahara.\nHowever, we must reiterate in this important international forum that the Arab-Israeli conflict continues to escalate, unaffected by the atmosphere of international detente, despite all the international efforts made lately by both East and West to arrive at a just and comprehensive settlement. There is not even a sign on the horizon that would indicate that the success of such efforts hinges on the results of the forthcoming Israeli or American elections. The conditions for a solution set out in the platforms of the two main rival political parties in Israel would not bring about peace in the Middle East. As for the United States of America, peace in the Middle East is not even on the agenda of either of the two candidates competing for the Presidency. Furthermore, if it were to be included it would be simply a matter of a race to win Israel's favour and stress the special relationship} it would have nothing to do with the way to achieve just and comprehensive world peace according to a clear and independent American perspective.\nIt has now become more clear than ever before that the special Israeli-American relationship, as it stands, does not serve the cause of peace; instead, it has become an additional obstacle to the attainment of a comprehensive, just settlement in the Middle East. It is indeed regrettable that these special relations, with their dimension within the fabric of the American society, should be harnessed to increase tension in the area, destabilize it and deprive its peoples of the just peace that they aspire to achieve.\nWe cannot now rule out the possible collapse of the convictions of those who have always pledged themselves to employ the special Israeli-American relationship to make peace, achieve Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, and restore the national rights of the Palestinian people. Rather, it has become clear to them that such special relations provide Israel with sufficient influence on American policy to keep the Arab-Israeli conflict outside the atmosphere of international detente - an atmosphere that is not in tune with Israel's expansionist policy. On the other hand, the United Nations, which adopted a resolution establishing Israel, has so far failed to make Israel take one of the political options provided for in the Charter: either to implement United Nations resolutions relevant to the Palestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict, or to face comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nThat reference to the lack of ability of the United Nations in this field is not meant to minimize the complications surrounding the adoption of Security Council resolutions, nor does it signify lack of awareness of the big hurdles which stand in the way of implementing those resolutions once they have been adopted. What we want to highlight here is that the non-implementation of the political options provided for in the Charter has made the Israelis feel that they have an international mandate, besides the biblical one which they claim for themselves, to resort to military means to carry out their expansionist plans wherever and whenever they can.\nSince the early days of the Arab-Israeli conflict myths have been confused with truths and legends with facts. The rulers of Israel have been intent on magnifying their legends at the expense of the land and the tights of the Palestinian people. They have gone so far in their racist practices against Arab citizens as to be no longer willing to acknowledge the tights of the Palestinian people to their own land and home country, deluding themselves that Israel's military and technological superiority will go on forever, and that Israel will always be able to impose what it wants, anytime, anywhere,\nIsrael still occupies the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Syrian Golan and parts of Lebanon, but this occupation is no longer an easy task for Israel, nor should Israel take it for granted. In southern Lebanon the Lebanese resistance is still making sacrifices. Yet it is costing Israel considerable losses and it will continue its struggle until the liberation of the last inch of the Lebanese territory. In the Golan the Syrian Arab citizens are continuing their absolute rejection of Israeli identity cards and are clinging tenaciously to their Syrian identity. In the West Bank and Gaza Strip the Palestinian uprising is still bravely facing the Israeli occupying soldiers for the tenth consecutive month, despite all the barbaric practices perpetrated by those forces. The spirit of the uprising has pervaded Israel itself, where the Palestinians, who number about three quarters of a million, have started to revive their Arab identity, their attachment to their country, Palestine, and to express in one way or another their solidarity with their brothers in the other Arab occupied territories.\nThe picture is grim in Israel, and for the future of Israel. Israel, a technological and military superiority can do very little to change that picture.\nThe Syrian Arab Republic continues to call for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, and with participation of all the parties involved in the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization and the five permanent members of the Security Council. Such a conference should be given the full and effective capacity to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, based on the principles of the Charter and United Nations resolutions relevant to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question, and on complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, and the safeguarding of the national rights of the Palestinian people, including their inalienable right to return, their right to self-determination and the right to establish their own independent State on their national territory. \nRecent developments in Lebanon have taken that brother country once again into a dark tunnel, although hopes had been entertained for the emergence of a new era of national reconciliation, constitutional reforms and the election of a new president. Those who undermined the presidential elections during the prescribed constitutional period by blackmail, political manoeuvring, and threats and by preventing deputies from reaching the parliament building should be held responsible before the Lebanese people. Lebanon's unity, its Arab identity and its independence should never be the subject of blackmail or bargaining.\nThe historical ties between Lebanon and Syria, their common destiny, their mutual interests and their interdependent security are deeply rooted in the people of both countries and not just in their Governments, it is self-evident that those historical ties, and nothing else, dictated for Syria all the great sacrifices it was prepared to make and the heavy burden it shouldered in assisting all the Lebanese people. Had Syria been otherwise motivated, the map and the realities on the ground would have changed since the first days of the Syrian forces' entry into Lebanon.\nWe should like to emphasize, in this international body, that there is no alternative to national reconciliation in Lebanon. The attempts to partition Lebanon and all the other Israeli plans which Syria has been able to foil during recent years should not be allowed to succeed. All the sacrifices and efforts made by Syria for many years to help Lebanon should not be unavailing just because a small minority of the Lebanese decided to ignore the true interests of Lebanon and attempted to impose their will on the absolute majority of the Lebanese people.\nThe national conference held in Lebanon last Thursday, in which most Lebanese political personalities, Muslims and Christians, took part, reiterated its belief in the unity of Lebanon and its Arab identity and its total rejection of all attempts at partition, and called for an end to the Israeli occupation. The conference also stressed the duty of all Lebanese to work together to reconstruct their country on the basis of equality and justice and to open a new page in its history, a page of national reconciliation. The conference called upon the government of Dr. Salim Al Hoss to continue to ensure the functioning of the country's institutions, in the whole of Lebanon, and to take the necessary measures to enable the presidential election to take place as soon as possible. Because of its strong historical ties with Lebanon and its deep awareness of the grave dangers posed to the unity and role of Lebanon in particular and Arab interests in general, Syria has been and will always be committed to offering all possible help to that brother country in order to overcome its current crisis, to {,reserve the unity of its land and people and to maintain its security and independence.\nAfter the eight years of wide-scale killing and destruction between two neighbouring countries that for hundreds of years enjoyed historical and cultural relations, the cease-fire between Iraq and Iran certainly is a positive step. Syria condemned this unjustified war from its very outset and immediately welcomed Iran's official acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). Syria is well aware that that acceptance will have a positive effect on the tense situation in the Gulf region in particular and the Middle East in general. We wish the Secretary-General success, and  e express appreciation to him for the patience he has shown in his efforts to achieve the goal, which are hampered by great difficulties that should not be underestimated if the desired results are to be attained.\nInternational terrorism is a major source of tension in international relations. The Syrian Arab Republic participated actively in the drafting of General Assembly resolution 42/139, which is regarded as a significant and advanced step in the efforts to combat international terrorism and eradicate its evils and dangers and to distinguish between terrorism and the struggle of peoples for national liberation. The importance of that resolution is evident from its condemnation of international terrorism and, at the same time, its emphasis on the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples that are under racist or colonial domination or foreign occupation for liberation self-determination and independence. We stress once again that the convening of an international conference to define terrorism and distinguish it from the struggle of peoples for national liberation will significantly contribute to combating international terrorism. Such a conference would undermine the deliberate attempts being made to confuse terrorism, which we condemn, with the struggle of peoples, which we support.\nGeneral and complete disarmament should be given the first priority on the agenda of the international community because this question is intrinsically linked with the continued existence of the human race and life on earth.\nThe Syrian Arab Republic welcomed the conclusion by the Soviet Union and the United States of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles in Europe. We urge both those countries to move quickly towards the achievement of the goal of a 50 per cent reduction in strategic offensive missiles, as a giant step on the path to the total liquidation of nuclear arsenals in the world. Despite the set-back constituted by the inability of the General Assembly's third special session devoted to disarmament to achieve the hoped-for results, efforts should continue to be made to convince the nuclear-weapon States to make a solemn declaration not to use or threaten to use their nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States.\nThe establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the world is an essential prerequisite to effective implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Syrian Arab Republic has fully supported the establishment of such zones and has urged the pursuit of efforts to turn the Middle East and other areas of the world into nuclear-weapon-free zones, as well as the taking of appropriate international measures for doing that. The nuclearization of Israel certainly undermines all the efforts to ensure the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. That objective cannot be attained unless Israel is compelled to submit to United Nations resolutions which demand that it adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and place all its nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nStill on the issue of nuclear armaments, Israel's release of a military satellite would stimulate a new arms race in the region, which would expose it and the world to further dangers.\nThe economic crises and social and political tensions witnessed in the world during the past few years should lead the industrialized countries to acknowledge that it is no longer possible to maintain a one-way system of prosperity and growth at a time when the peoples of the world aspire to establish international economic relations based on equal co-operation, mutual trust and common interests. The problems of the staggering, indeed astronomical, debt burden from which most developing countries of the world are suffering, the increase in already high interest rates, the decrease in the prices of commodities and the growing tendency of the industrialized countries to practice protectionism cannot be solved without the establishment of a just economic world order. The interdependence of international economic relations, despite differences in social and economic systems, requires that all countries co-operate in attempting to solve these international economic problems. There is no doubt that a serious resumption of the North-South dialogue would greatly contribute to providing a better climate and conditions for accelerating the process of development, to the benefit of all parties concerned. \nThe important question of the protection of the environment must be addressed. The dumping of industrial and toxic wastes in developing countries poses the gravest dangers to their environment. The international concern over the problems of the environment requires that the General Assembly make joint effort to protect the environment and mankind from the dangerous consequences of these toxic wastes, and that it take the necessary measures to prevent the dumping of such wastes in developing countries.\nThe continued occupation of Namibia is an act of aggression against the Namibian people, who are deprived of their right to self-determination and independence and are subjected daily to barbaric and oppressive practices. We support the efforts made by the Security Council and the Secretary-General to achieve the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We lend our support also to the struggle of the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), for liberation and self -determination. \nThe racist regime in Pretoria is still relentlessly committing barbaric crimes against the black African majority and is continuing its policy of apartheid, which has been judged by the international community to be a crime against humanity. There is no doubt that the Pretoria regime could not have persisted in challenging the international will had it not been for the support it receives from some - Western countries and its co-operation with Israel in many spheres, in particular the military and the nuclear. We consider it the duty of the international community to intensify its efforts to bring about the total eradication of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic society on the basis of equality and justice in South Africa. The most effective means of eradicating apartheid would be through the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nAs for the situation in Afghanistan, we say again that we welcome the Geneva Agreements reached in April 1988 and we stress the importance of implementing the provisions of those Agreements and of refraining from interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, of preserving its territorial integrity and non-aligned status, and of achieving national reconciliation among its people.\nThe problem of Cyprus, a neighbouring country with which Syria has always throughout history enjoyed friendly relations, still awaits a just solution. We hope that the ongoing contacts between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities will lead to a comprehensive settlement based on United Nations resolutions.\nWe once again renew our support for the efforts being made by the Democratic Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula through negotiations and the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea. We also support its call to make the Korean peninsula a zone of peace, free, of nuclear weapons and foreign military bases.\nIn Central America, Nicaragua continues to be subjected to external pressures and interference in its internal affairs. We welcome the efforts made by the Central American states, the Contadora Group and the Support Group for the establishment of a true and lasting peace in Central America that would ensure the independence and sovereignty of all States in the area.\nThe optimism arising from the announcement of a new phase of detente and co-operation in international relations after a period of tension and confrontation is a natural expression of the aspirations of people to solve the intricate problems from which they suffer and of an inclination towards a world in which peace and justice would prevail while injustice, oppression and aggression would disappear. Fulfilment of those great aspirations is not easy to achieve, but they are legitimate aspirations which could be satisfied if good intention and political will were to prevail. We hope that action will be taken to translate them into a tangible reality.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe forty-third session of the General Assembly is beginning its work at a time when the international community is anxiously stating and claiming, more than ever before, its right to secure and lasting peace and tranquillity. This session, therefore, must not dash these urgent hopes of the human community, which, for countless valid reasons, calls It the hope of mankind.\nAgainst the background of that yearning of mankind, the delegation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, which I have the honour of heading at this time, congratulates the President of the Assembly on his well-deserved election to preside over our discussions. His country and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea have had close and excellent diplomatic relations for a long time. Moreover, the Argentine Republic Is one of the countries that responded sincerely and positively, with grants and loans, to the call for help by His Excellency Mr. Qbiang Nguema Mbasogo, when he first took power, for help in rebuilding the country, which had been ruined - indeed, devastated - by the previous regime. The people of Equatorial Guinea government and will always remember this. For the moment, all I have been asked to do is express wholehearted thanks to the people of Argentina.\nThe Argentine Republic's support for the ideals o\u00a3 the United Nations is also acknowledged and appreciated by the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\nThe President's personal dedication, together with his negotiating experience and his recognized diplomatic gifts and talents, guarantees that the resolutions that will be adopted at the end of the debates will be impartial, beneficial and profitable for everyone. To that end, my delegation is fully at his disposal. We assure him that we shall do nothing to hinder his work to achieve the desired consensus.\nOn behalf of the delegation of Equatorial Guinea, I extend our congratulations to the other officers of the Assembly, whose hard work in co-ordinating our activities is not always fully recognized and appreciated.\nWith great nostalgia we express our gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Peter Florin, for the diplomatic and political wisdom with which he guided the delicate work of the forty-second session of the Assembly. His conduct gave us encouragement to continue the struggle against the injustice confronting the human community, and to do so in accordance with the words of our national emblems unity, peace and justice.\nThe people and Government of Equatorial Guinea express to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, special gratitude for his great dedication and total devotion to the problems of the international community and his sincere aim of seeing concrete form given to the lofty and noble ideals of the San Francisco Charter. In paying this tribute to him, we should like to think that the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces was to a large extent the result of his efforts. If that is not the case, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea proposes to the bodies responsible for these awards the individual candidacy of the Secretary-General for the next Nobel Peace Prize.\nThe report submitted by the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization is a very significant and eloquent document, with regard both to the positive achievements it describes and to ones it is hoped will be achieved - given, of course, the political will of the Governments involved in each case. In our opinion, there have been many successes. That is demonstrated by the very fact that the general debate of this forty-third session has reflected great optimism and a sincere recognition of the validity of multilateralism as well as the strengthening of the role and credibility of the United Nations. The United Nations has relit the torch of confidence which can guide us on the path to the solution of difficult, delicate and complex problems. Thus, it is the ideal forum and the impartial arbiter for; dealing with questions of interest to the international community. And that was what the Organization's founding fathers had in mind. That is a source of pride to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. We reaffirm the confidence that we reposed in the United Nations when we became a Member. This confidence is not just a word; it is embodied in facts - facts that are applied within our country, where the recommendations of the United Nations are implemented in all sectors at the national level, and externally in all the international forums, where we pursue a strict policy of good-neighbourliness, co-operation, openness and dialogue with other States, in order to preserve the peace and tranquillity of our region, our continent and the world. \nIn that respect, within our country governmental adjustments are made and new political, social and financial institutions are established, as the circumstances require, in order to comply with constitutional mandates. Examples are the political democratization programme and the economic reconstruction programme to achieve the desired comprehensive development on a firm basis.\nI should like to summarize by referring briefly to the political process in my country.\nOn the basis of the law adopted by our Parliament in relation to political parties, the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea was recently established. Its first congress is being held now in the city of Bata. The democratization process has readied a stage where the participation of the people in the country's economic recovery and development can be more in keeping with their participation in the management of political affairs, thereby closing the gap which had continued to exist in our community's political and administrative organization. With the help of the United Nations Development Programme and other institutions of the United Nations system and bilateral donors, the Government of Equatorial Guinea has devised a global and sectoral strategy for the country's medium-term development and has convened a second round-table conference of donors in Geneva from 28 to 29 November. We ask the United Nations to make an appropriate assessment of the situation in Equatorial Guinea so that, in harmony with ongoing negotiations with international financial institutions, that conference might have truly successful results.\nSimilarly, externally, every day our country accedes to governmental, non-governmental, regional and subregional organizations, and international economic and financial institutions, and it has broad-ranging diplomatic relations with other States. For example, recently Equatorial Guinea has acceded to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which were adopted by the General Assembly on 16 December 1966. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea has also recently acceded to the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer, concluded in Vienna on 22 March 1985.\nThe Government of Equatorial Guinea has likewise taken due note of the recommendation contained in paragraph 1 of resolution 1988/54 of the Economic and Social Council, not only to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also conscientiously to reply to certain pernicious insinuations and references ~ to show that the Government of Equatorial Guinea has nothing to hide but, on the contrary, carries out its public activities in conformity with established rules and with the consent of the people. \nOur optimism and our confidence at this session are based on the report of the Secretary-General and also the course taken to solve the problems of Angola, whose negotiations with the Governments of Cuba and South Africa, with the positive mediation of the United States of America, have opened up a new era of hope.\nAlso, with regard to the sad case of Namibia, Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is beginning to have positive effects in the achieving of full sovereignty and independence for Namibia years after it was declared.\nThen there is the open dialogue with Pretoria to do away with the system of apartheid and racial discrimination and to ensure recognition of the fundamental political rights of the black population, and on the question of the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela and other compatriots, who should be returned to their loved ones.\nThere is also reason for optimism in the reopening of diplomatic relations between the sisterly and friendly countries of Morocco and Algeria.\nWe hail the achievements in the improvement of the climate of relations between Chad and Libya and the cessation of hostilities between them. Once again, we express hope concerning their resumption of diplomatic relations, which we trust can be achieved within the framework of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) so as to achieve a suitable peaceful settlement to their border dispute.\nWith regard to the referendum on self-determination proposed by the Secretary-General in co-operation with the OAU, accepted by His Majesty King Hassan II and shared by the POLISARIO Front, it must be carried out freely under international supervision and put an end to a conflict that is both painful and tragic. We welcome the new developments in this field.\nOur delegation is pleased to see that a direct, sincere and peaceful dialogue is taking place between the two Cypriot communities, as suggested by the Secretary-General, in an attempt to settle the long-standing dispute and to guarantee the unity, sovereignty, and independence of the Republic of Cyprus. My Government is especially pleased at the news that the Governments of Iran and Iraq have agreed to accept compliance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as the basis for a just and lasting solution. We are sure that this will lead to peace and harmony between those two sisterly countries.\nWe are optimistic also with regard to the people of Afghanistan, given the accords signed in Geneva in April of this year, the positive effects of which are beginning to be felt with respect to self-determination and the independence of a people that has suffered for so long.\nWe cannot fail to mention Kampuchea, which after so much pain and suffering has an opportunity to speak of peace and stability and end its people's suffering. My Government supports the initiation of dialogue between all parties to the conflict, for we believe that to be the only way that might lead to the establishment of a broad-based Government and lead to national reconciliation, which implies the withdrawal of all foreign forces.\nWe wish warmly to congratulate the two Koreas on their expressed willingness to engage in a process of reunification. We also congratulate South Korea for the efforts it has made during the 40 years of its independence to activate this process of reunification free of foreign influence. The ideas of Korea's being among us as a Member of the Organization merits reflection by us all.\nThose are a few of the cases that have gained well-deserved approval from the international community and led to some serenity. But there are others that remain sources of concern, and we wish to state our hope that they too will be solved.\nThere is, for instance, the doleful case of the Middle East, concerning which we say again that there is urgent need for the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and for the carrying out, with greater realism, of agreements that will result in the implementation of the Palestinian people's right to a sovereign State, which will guarantee the peace and security of the peoples of the region and their right, including the sovereign State of Israel, to live within safe and secure boundaries.\nWe are even more gravely concerned about the crisis in Lebanon, which erupted as long ago as in 1975. The deterioration of the situation there must be stemmed by means of a sincere and peaceful dialogue between the authorities of the two communities. We hope that thus Lebanon can achieve peaceful coexistence, sovereignty, independence and unity.\nWe are equally concerned about the situation in our sister countries of Latin America, where there are visible and chronic signs of outside interference that obstructs their self-determination and puts obstacles on their path to the stability and the development they desire. We regret the lack of compliance with the Esquipulas II peace accords signed in Guatemala by the Central American countries last year, which assumed the existence of the spirit of harmony necessary for the solving of the various problems among those nations. Regrettably, the situation concerning the Malvinas Islands is still one of stagnation. We therefore appeal to the Governments involved to begin genuine efforts to find a viable and internationally acceptable solution.\nAlthough consideration of the question of East Timor has been postponed to the next session, we invite the Governments of Portugal and of Indonesia to continue their contacts and redouble their efforts to achieve an acceptable solution. We deeply appreciate and are interested in the intention of the administration of New Caledonia to lead that Territory to self-determination.\nSome months ago the United Nations General Assembly held its third special session devoted to disarmament - a session which, to our great regret, concluded without formal agreement. Nevertheless, there was great optimism at the dialogue and bilateral agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. On that occasion, at this very rostrum, the head of the delegation of Equatorial Guinea said\u00b7.\n\\\"The Republic of Equatorial Guinea, paradoxically, will not eliminate or diminish this monstrosity of weaponry simply because it neither possesses nor produces them nor does it consider attaining them. But we do hope to eliminate and lessen the widespread illness, hunger and poverty that are the scourges of my country. There are countries that are wasting millions of dollars every minute on weaponry while our country is talking about debts of thousands of dollars as a matter of survival.\\\" (A/S-15/PV. 21, p. 7) The delegation of Equatorial Guinea does not believe it necessary to go into great detail on the subject of armaments as the great threat to world peace, because, as we have seen, it is being dealt with by the giants who consider themselves the masters of the world. We prefer to speak about the economic imbalance between the nations of the world and, in particular, the countries of the third world, and the least developed countries, to whose number the Republic of Equatorial Guinea belongs. This, for us, is the real disarmament issue.\nLittle or no progress has been made on the question of the new international order since it was first mentioned here and in other international forums. Every day we see the gap widening between the intransigent and arrogant positions of the industrialized countries and the just claims of the developing countries. The thinking of the two sides differs so enormously that a solution satisfactory to both seems impossible. We do not believe that a serene and happy world can come about while a large part of mankind lives at subsistence level.\nWe also regret the fact that one of the cynical solutions invented and offered to the countries of the third world is the one of which the African continent has recently been a victim. I refer to the dumping of industrial, toxic, nuclear and radioactive waste, which is offered to African countries as the only way of achieving the degree of development of the industrialized countries. The fact that my country has not yet fallen victim to this Machiavellian machination is due to the great respect it has for the honour and dignity of a sovereign and proud country. The biased statements in this connection which are totally unfounded and are designed to distort the image of Equatorial Guinea, should be ignored by the international community, because they amount to pure imagination. Nor can the statements change our stand with respect to what is needed for the well-being of our people. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea knows what it really wants and knows how to achieve it. I take this opportunity to declare that my country has not received, and will not receive, any industrial, toxic, nuclear or radioactive waste. \nThe delegation of Equatorial Guinea would like once again to state in this Assembly that His Excellency Obiang Nguema Mjasogo took charge of our country in 1979 when, because of its complete self-isolation from the outside world, it was about to disintegrate as a sovereign /hate. All the steps which have been taken since then have been arduous and slow, but they have been safe and good steps. The Government is observing fully the rules of the Constitution, which was adopted in 1982 under the supervision of the United Nations. The programme of democratization and comprehensive development that we began is irreversible. In this connection, we would like to invite anyone wishing to visit our country to do so, provided that he is willing to assess the considerable changes without preconceptions and in an impartial manner.\nHaving said that, I should point out that we are convinced that the basic principles of international coexistence and the attributes of national sovereignty may be greatly harmed by continuing interference in the internal affairs of States. Thus we express once again our rejection of any interference in the internal affairs of Equatorial Guinea. This is a firm and indisputable principle of all States and also of the United Nations.\nAt the beginning of this statement I said that the forty-third session of the General Assembly was the hope of mankind and that we should not frustrate or disappoint it. Equatorial Guinea hopes that at this session the General Assembly will adopt resolutions that will help to bring about world peace and security and that it will give priority in its resolutions to the situation of the poorest States. It urges other nations to abandon their selfish nationalism and calls upon them to view the problems of mankind from a point of view that will allow us to preserve the individual, who deserves better conditions, conditions enabling him to achieve the ultimate goal for which he was created. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nAs my first duty, permit me, Sir, to congratulate you on your election to the important and honourable post of President of the General Assembly at the current session.\nWe are meeting at a remarkable time. Though it may appear quite unremarkable on the working calendar of our Organization, it is a time filled with extraordinary events - events that can become the norm for the life of mankind if we succeed in turning them into a trend. Such, in our view, should be the main thrust of the current session, which in many respects is a watershed for the world community. I am referring to a new world calendar which is being created by the efforts of States and peoples, by the efforts of the United Nations. \nA character in the classical comedy \\\"Woe from Wit\\\" exclaims, \\\"Calendars all lie\\\". However, the calendar that has taken shape today does not deceive us. It tells of change in the world; change that is a product of reason. We find on that calendar the Moscow summit meeting, at which Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan exchanged the instruments marking the entry into force of the Treaty on the elimination of intermediate- and shorter-range missiles; the conclusion of the Geneva Accords on political settlement around Afghanistan; the first ever public destruction of nuclear missiles; and the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. \nAll this is a product of reason, of a new political intellect, which has superseded the dark legacy of the past. It is destroying the reciprocal \\\"enemy images\\\" that have existed and is shaping the image of co-operative partners. \nIt has made it possible to discuss a world without arms in the emerging context of real disarmament, as was recently demonstrated at the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. It offers us a chance for the successful conclusion of the Vienna meeting, which is a major milestone in the process of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) .\nAll that has occurred in the year 1988, which has witnessed many other remarkable events. This year has witnessed the four-party talks on southern Africa; the movement towards a political settlement around Kampuchea; contacts to resolve problems existing on the Korean peninsula; dialogue between the leaders of the two communities in divided Cyprus that were until recently irreconcilable; and the positive response to the initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General concerning a settlement of the problem of Western Sahara. I shall permit myself to include among the year's landmark events the Party Conference in my own country. Its main conclusion was that perestroika is irreversible. It is irreversible in both our domestic and our foreign policy. Radical change in our own house - and here I am quoting Mikhail Gorbachev - has engendered new approaches by us to international affairs too. In a sense, the calendar that I have brought to your attention is one of the consequences of that process.\nTwo years ago we said here that group, bloc or ideological considerations were beginning to give way to an understanding of peace as the supreme value. Only peace, translated from the language of declarations into practical action, can give mankind a chance of survival. The Soviet Union has grasped this world-wide trend and coupled it with its own perestroika, its process of renewal.\nToday the world is changing along new lines. Through the joint efforts of States and by implementing the principles of the new political thinking, it has become possible to avert the threat of war. To a large extent this is due to the political will demonstrated by the leaders of States, and here I can only agree with President Reagan's remarks yesterday about the beneficial impact on that process of Soviet-American political dialogue.\nWe are now moving further ahead - towards comprehensive security. This requires truly international co-operation. This universal international alliance must rise above differences, which, to use the words of Albert Einstein, are infinitely small compared to the danger that threatens us all.\nThe formation of this alliance is being facilitated by the emergence of mechanisms of interaction among States and peoples, first and foremost through the United Nations and its institutions. Its main working unit, its engine, its heart, is here, in our house of peace, as are the people who have found way to increase the power of the instruments of peace-making, and we thank them for that. There is however, no better way of expressing gratitude than by a collective effort to enhance the role of the United Nations and make it stronger not only as a unique international forum but also as an equally unique global centre for ensuring universal and regional security and the security of each country. \nIn this capacity the United Nations should, in our view, play a more active and direct role in eliminating the main threat to mankind - the threat of a nuclear catastrophe. We would like to see greater involvement by the United Nations in the process of nuclear disarmament, in reaching a global agreement on the cessation and prohibition of nuclear-weapons testing, and in creating nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world.\nSpace should become an area for the priority attention of the United Nations. The international community has a vital interest in preventing it from becoming an arena for military rivalry. Today this can still be done; tomorrow will be too late.\nThe Soviet Union has made the case for setting up a world space organization, which could include a centre for international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space, to be established on the basis of the Krasnoyarsk radar, as proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev.\nWe call upon the Government of the United states to follow that example, and thus allay our concern with respect to United States radar facilities in Greenland and Great Britain. By doing that, we would not only lay the material groundwork for international co-operation in space but also strengthen the ABM Treaty regime.\nThis Organization could become involved, in practical terms, in resolving the issue of conventional arms limitation. The Soviet Union supports the idea of setting up, within the United Nations, a register of conventional arms sales and transfers, and is ready to take part in developing the parameters of such a register. \nThe arms race cannot be curbed without putting under control the use of scientific and technological achievements for military purposes. We support the proposal by India and other countries to set up a group, under the United Nations Secretary-General, to provide assessments and forecasts in the area of new technology.\nThe United Nations will measure up to all these tasks if we take a fresh look at the practical aspects of our work. First of all, the General Assembly, as one of the principal bodies of the Organization, should substantially increase its contribution towards finding ways and means of solving international problems, inter alia, through renewing and improving its methods and procedures.\nThere is but one criterion here - that decisions be productive and democratically worked out and adopted. A first step in this direction would he to adopt an increased proportion of United Nations decisions by consensus, though it is important that General Assembly resolutions adopted by a vote should not be devalued.\nIt is also necessary to reinvigorate the work of the Security Council, and to ensure closer interaction among its members. At consultations among the five permanent members of the Council, attended by the Secretary-General, it would be useful to hold periodic reviews of situations in areas of conflict and to identify priority measures to improve the situation. It is felt that there is a need for periodic meetings of the Security Council at the foreign-minister level, as envisaged by the Charter.\nThe idea of convening special expanded Security Council meetings in regions of tension is worthy of consideration. Such meetings could also be held in the capitals of the Council's permanent members. The Soviet Union confirms its readiness to host such a meeting in Moscow. We all owe a debt to the United Nations, and it is in our common interest to repay our debts. We can repay them in full if, in addition to dollar contributions, we invest innovative thought in the activity of the Organization's institutions, if we revive its main function - as a centre for the settlement of international conflicts through united efforts.\nLet there be no lament, then, over the sacred national prerogatives. The Soviet Union is a firm advocate of strengthening national sovereignty, particularly wherever infringements of it are most keenly and painfully felt. We regard as highly objectionable the anomaly of foreign military presence - military bases in other States' territories - as well as violations of national sovereignty by the undeclared arrival of nuclear arms in, or their transit through, ports of other countries. We have stated clearly what we believe: that any military presence must be confined within national borders.\nBut what we are speaking of now is voluntarily delegating a portion of national rights in the interests of all - paradoxically enough, to strengthen national security, while at the same time strengthening universal security.\nThe interrelationship of events in an interdependent world increasingly compels us to delegate some national prerogatives to an international organization. In fact, this is happening already. Military activity is ceasing to be taboo. Having cleared the verification barrier, and having initiated the process of real nuclear disarmament, the Soviet Union and the United States, the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands gave up some of their rights when they permitted the inspection of facilities in their territories. This was done in the interests of universal security. By establishing new, previously inconceivable, rules of openness in the military sphere, the world is undoubtedly moving towards the creation of a common sovereign right - the right to survive. When the United States Secretary of Defence sits at the controls of a top-secret Soviet bomber, and the Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet armed forces tours an equally secret United States base, that is something more than a mere exchange of protocol courtesies in the spirit of the times; it indicates that the elimination of secrecy is becoming a factor of security.\nWe draw this conclusion from the conviction that, today, it is no longer possible to achieve political goals by means of war. To put it simply, war is ceasing to be - indeed, it has already ceased to be - an instrument of rational policy.\nLet us consider this from the perspective of regional conflicts, while they flare up and develop in different ways, they still have one feature in common - they drag on intolerably long, without delivering positive political results.\nHowever, positive political results are not slow in coming when interference in regional conflicts gives way to the efforts of the world community to promote their settlement. No one should hinder this process. In this context we have to speak of Afghanistan.\nThe Geneva Accords are not just an isolated local instance of the settlement of a regional conflict. They ate the first step in a chain reaction leading to a healthier world. They are a new promising beginning in world politics, attesting to a qualitative change in political thinking. They are a message of good news to other regions. Any violation of the Geneva Accords undermines those achievements.\nThe Soviet Union and the Republic of Afghanistan are observing their obligations under those Accords faithfully, to the letter. There is no need to prove that. However attempts are being made arbitrarily to alter the formula established by the Geneva Accords, thus significantly changing its meaning.\nAs soon as the Soviet troops began to withdraw, a non-stop production line of violations was set in motion. The list of them would totally refute the assertion heard here yesterday that bloodshed has diminished in that region. On the contrary, terror has been mounting sharply and is increasingly directed against civilians.\nIn the circumstances, the fact is that faithful compliance by some with their obligations creates conditions for others to commit new crimes, of which the most heinous is the destruction of hard-won hopes. This must not be allowed to happen. The chain of conflict settlement generated by Afghanistan must not be allowed to break.\nWe are not complaining to anyone. We have the means to make things fall into place. But we are responsible to the United Nations, and therefore we are appealing to it. We are proposing that a meeting of the permanent members of the Security Council, hosted by the United Nations Secretary-General, discuss the question of compliance with the Geneva Accords. It would also be appropriate to invite to such a meeting representatives of the parties directly concerned. \nThe deep involvement of the United Nations in the resolution of major international problems has spotlighted the acute need for new mechanisms of verification and control. We propose that consideration be given to the idea of an international monitoring and verification agency within the framework of the United Nations.\nThat body's terms of reference could be very broad. Disarmament and security in all its aspects are becoming an increasingly multilateral and truly international process. The institution for monitoring and verification should also be international.\nMany countries feel the need for it. Thus Japan is proposing an interesting idea for the world-wide seismic monitoring of nuclear explosions. France has what we regard as the reasonable idea of setting up an international satellite monitoring system.\nThese are interesting ideas, but how could they be implemented? Naturally, the most sensible way is to make their, part of a universal monitoring and verification mechanism that would operate under United Nations auspices or within its structure.\nVerification is no longer a preference but an imperative of our time. It is an imperative of our time to search for forms and methods for the development of societies that would be in keeping with modern requirements. Certainly this is true with respect to socialism, but with equal certainty it applies to other socio-political systems. While we are changing in both our own and international interests, we are entitled to expect the same kind of perestroika from others.\nSeparating the wheat from the chaff, distinguishing the right choice from the wrong, and achievements from deterioration, we are unforgiving in judging the past. To be self-critical is the canonical rule for politicians who believe in their people and want the people to believe them. But we expect certain leaders of States who address the international community to be equally self-critical in assessing the past.\nIt is appropriate to mention this in the year that marks the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which some are marking by reasserting the supremacy of law, and others by preaching their own faultlessness. We could list numerous international instruments on human rights that have not been ratified by the countries represented here by some speakers. We could talk of the continuous practice of violations of civil rights in those countries. But we prefer to speak of ourselves.\nThe supremacy of law is the corner-stone of political renewal in our country. Creating a State based on the rule of law also has a direct bearing on our foreign policy.\nA constitutionally authorized mechanism for working out and adopting strategic foreign-policy decisions is being put in place in our country. Questions such as military budgets, the use of troops outside the country, and innovations in the development of the armed forces will also be subject to constitutional and legal scrutiny.\nFor us, the principle of the supremacy of law and the policy of democratising our society ace indivisible. The emergence of a State based on the rule of law links with the world-wide will to assert the primacy of international law as the standard for mankind's existence. Among politico-military, economic, humanitarian and environmental guarantees of universal security, we view its legal guarantees as paramount.\nFrom States based on the rule of law to a world based on the rule of law - such is the logic of the movement. A starting-point on this path could be the elaboration of a major long-term programme for the development of international law. Its thrust could be expressed in the motto \\\"Security, trust and co-operation through law\\\". \nWe must also work persistently to enhance the effectiveness of the International Court of Justice on the basis of developing a common approach by all States to that main judicial body of the United Nations. Completion of the preparation of a code of crimes against peace and the security of mankind would be a major step.\nProbably nowhere is the role of law so important as in ensuring freedom of choice, which is the linchpin of the new political thinking. For how can there be any freedom to choose one's own course in situations in which international law is constantly violated - as in southern Africa, the Middle East, Central America and elsewhere?\nFreedom of choice defies confinement within ideological borders or geographical zones. It cannot be stopped by \\\"crusades\\\"; it can only be recognized. It is absolute, and equally -resolute is our respect for it, regardless of the orientation of any particular country.\nBy defining freedom of choice as the key link in the new political thinking, we hope to use that key to open many doors that until now have been tightly locked. Recognition of the diversity of interests, the priority of universal human values and the supremacy of political means in solving international problems, and replacing confrontation with dialogue - those and other components of the new political thinking have resulted in substantial and, we trust, irreversible positive changes. Yet, the fires of political inquisition ace still blazing in the world, and some would try to bring to the stake entire nations and movements accused of the heresy of having freely chosen their own course. Ideology in the shape of missile projectiles crushes them with the cruelty of a medieval axe. I should like to stress that our sympathy is on the side of those who seek to achieve freedom of choice.\nWhy, for instance, can the great American people have their own great dream, and why should the Cuban or the Nicaraguan, the Angolan or the Vietnamese people, the Ethiopian people be deprived of the right to have their own ideals? Why cannot the Palestinian people have their homeland? Why should other nations, countries and movements be humiliated by great Power arrogance? While not renouncing any of our values or denying to others the right to have their own, while continuing to respect the yearning of peoples for national self-assertion and liberation from economic subjugation and political dependence, the Soviet Union supports the de-ideologization of international relations and the exclusion of the overwhelming component of ideological differences from foreign policy and diplomacy. It expects and hopes that others will do likewise.\nIt expects the problem of how to pool our efforts to be recognized as commensurate with the problem of the survival of mankind. It expects the force of peace-making policy to prevail over the policy of force which has run its historical course.\nThe division of mankind into great and small countries is something which has also run its historical course. And, if the term \\\"great Powers\\\" is to be kept at all, it is only in the sense of great responsibility towards the rest of the world. Divisions and re-divisions of the world into spheres of influence are historically pointless. Today, we must all have only one sphere of influence \u2013 our planet. It will perish if our influence on the threatening course of destructive developments is divided and fragmented into blocs and systems. Therefore, the Soviet leadership has attempted to reinterpret more profoundly the idea, originally inherent in Marxism, of the interrelationship between class and universal human values, according priority to the interests shared by all nations. In our vision of peaceful coexistence as the universal principle of international relations, it does not emerge as a special form of class struggle.\nA rigid polarization of the world, which is becoming increasingly diverse, must give way to its consolidation, which allows the rivalry of two different systems to take on non-confrontational forms. This, if you will, is also a choice, the freedom of which is born of the new political thinking and of its dialectics- which makes it possible to put policies to the test of real life.\nBut it would appear that not everyone measures up to this freedom. Obstinately clinging to divisive fetishes, some would try to put a brake on the action of the centrifugal forces. As a result, any red-letter days have not appeared on the new calendar of peace this year. For example, it does not include the date marking the completion of a treaty on 50 per cent reductions in strategic arms. The pace of real disarmament set by the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles is slowing down as negotiations proceed.\nWe seemed to have dealt once and for all with the issue of verification, but it has arisen again because of the negative position of our negotiating partners. It looks as if the Russian proverb \\\"Trust but verify\\\" is good only when applied to the Soviet Union but is not applicable to the United States.\nOnce again we call on the United States of America to reconsider its attitude to verification of the process of reducing and eliminating nuclear arsenals. For verification is something more than the technical checking on the parties compliance with their obligations. It is the material expression of sincerity and honesty, without which it is impossible to make policy today. It is also regrettable that an agreement barring weapons from outer space has not been concluded in 1988.\nWe had every reason to hope that 1988 would see the signing of a history-making global convention on the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons. Indeed, most of the complex fundamental issues have either been settled already or ace close to agreement. But once again, the sticky quagmire of procrastination is thwarting the final step towards victory. Meanwhile, in the absence of progress an alarming trend towards the spread of chemical weapons and what I would call chemical permissiveness is surreptitiously beginning to develop.\nWe do not object to the exploration of alternative ways. The Soviet Union takes a positive view of the proposal made yesterday by the President of the United States to convene a conference of the parties to the 1925 Geneva Protocol. At the same time we, of course, assume that the drafting of the convention banning chemical weapons will be continued and, of course, completed.\nThe beginning of the process of nuclear disarmament has brought into sharper focus the problem of conventional armed forces and armaments, including naval armaments. Here, too, great hopes were being pinned on this year. The programme of radical reductions in the military capabilities of the two opposing political-military alliances proposed by Warsaw Treaty countries has put the problem on the track of practical solution.\nWe have a clear goal - to achieve a situation in which the two sides would . have only the forces and capabilities sufficient for defence but insufficient for launching a surprise attack or conducting offensive operations. \nThere is also another priority problem. Access to conventional weapons in their most modern modifications is expanding. Their technological sophistication makes it easier to use them. There is now no need to spend much time or money on special training, and anyone can easily operate those infernal devices. In other words, conventional weapons are becoming part of everyday life, a common tool in the hands of too many people. This dangerous situation, which is particularly typical of regional conflicts, calls for joint efforts to constrain international arms markets.\nWorking out a mandate for the future negotiations is also a collective undertaking. Jointly with our allies, we have been finding solutions which bring general agreement closer.\nOn the question of unfulfilled hopes, we must mention the lack of progress in settling some of the most pressing problems, such as those of the Middle East, Central America, and certain others.\nToday, it is clearer than ever what needs to be done. Elementary common sense enjoins that consolidation of forces must be placed above their fragmentation, and constructive dialogue must be placed above destructive scepticism. None of us can any longer waste our time on mutual fault-finding, on mutual recrimination and reproaches. The growing physical destruction of our planet is the verdict against the existing division of the world. It is because of that division that so many pages in the 1988 calendar have not been filled. It is foe the same reason that this year has had such a generous supply of sombre dates.\nIt is perhaps for the first time that we have seen the stark reality of the threat to our environment - a second front fast approaching and acquiring urgency equal to that of the nuclear and space threat. For the first time we have seen clearly that, in the absence of any global control, man's so-called peaceful constructive activity is turning into global aggression against the very foundations of life on earth. For the first time we have understood clearly what we had guessed: that the traditional view of national and universal security, based primarily on military means of defence, is now totally obsolete and must be urgently revised.\nFaced with the threat of environmental catastrophe, the dividing lines of the bipolar ideological world are receding. The biosphere recognizes no division into blocs, alliances or systems. All share the same climatic system and no one is in a position to build his own isolated and independent line of environmental defence.\nMan-made \\\"second nature\\\" - the technosphere - has turned out to be dangerously fragile. The consequences of many of its breakdowns are becoming international and global.\nThe environmental crisis is being exported on an increasing scale, with toxic technologies, facilities, products and wastes spreading, overtly or covertly, through the channels of economic relations.\nQuite deliberate attempts are being made to turn densely populated areas of the third world into toxic waste dumps.\nIn a situation like this it is suicidal to try economically to rein in progressive national developments, to wear down an imaginary enemy by economic pressure. That is the kind of thinking that belongs to the Stone Age.\nIt is unreasonable to impede the economic reconstruction of countries that seek to restructure the energy industries and to introduce resource-saving and waste-free technologies, thus making the world less dangerous.\nHow much more sensible it is, as we ate proposing to the United States and other countries, to abolish some planned or ongoing military programmes and channel the funds thus released towards instituting an international regime of environmental security.\nAll the environmental disasters of this year have placed in the forefront the task of pooling and co-ordinating efforts to develop a global strategy for a rational management of the environment.\nAll of us - and I emphasize this, all of us - need an international programme to manage the risks involved in economic activities and to shift to alternative technologies that spare both man and nature.\nWe need resources to save our planet, instead of destroying it. I believe that the world community possesses such resources. But they have to be supplemented, first, by the will and readiness to act and, secondly, by an effective mechanism for international ecological co-operation.\nIt is quite clear that in this area, too, nothing can be done without the tools of the new political thinking. In this area, too, it must emphasize the factor of time. We have too little of it - very little - and problems are piling up faster than they can be solved.\nEven the implementation of the positive decisions already adopted could take years and years. Just the physical elimination of intermediate- and shorter-range missiles will take three years of continuous daily work and the Treaty's entire sequence of implementation will take 13 years. This makes it incumbent upon us to take responsible decisions today.\nWhat are our liabilities? Tens of thousands of nuclear warheads and hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic agents; mountains of conventional armaments; holes burnt in the ozone layer and the eroding biosphere; the greenhouse effect and the depletion of non-renewable sources of energy; acid rains and deserts devouring the green world; forest fires-and floods; drying up seas and dying fauna; terrorism against the peoples and aggression against nature.\nWhat are cur assets? The world's growing maturity which makes it possible to raise and solve global problems on a planetary scale; a growing world-wide \\\"Green Peace\\\" movement; shared perceptions of environmental scientists and policy-makers who are becoming increasingly active as environmentalists, as demonstrated by the document of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the recent appeal issued by the peace movement; the report entitled \\\"Our Common Future\\\", prepared by the World Commission headed by Mrs. Brundtland, and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) models of environmental renascence to counter environmental apocalypse; the experience of the past three years which attests to the possibility of removing corrosive growths from the body of the earth; the experience of pooling the efforts of States in the use of advanced technology, such as thermonuclear fusion and superconductivity, in the interests of human survival.\nThis year's calendar has also included another event; the inauguration of the Centre for the development of an international experimental thermonuclear reactor by scientists from very many countries who will chart the way towards inexhaustible sources of energy for the coming century and at the same time develop a model for concerting efforts in the interests of all peoples. \nAmong our assets is the realization that a monopoly of a small number of countries over advanced technologies and attempts at all costs to keep others on the sidelines of the emerging science-and-information world may boomerang against the monopolists.\nAmong our assets is the United Nations, whose high efficiency has been so graphically demonstrated by the events of 1988. They have also highlighted a simple but very profound truth; when nations, particularly the great Powers, begin to co-operate, the United Nations gains in influence and strength, once again recapturing the spirit of its initial objectives.\nIt is true that the fable about two elephants stamping our grass is still popular. President Reagan's statement yesterday would seem to indicate that this grass is not being threatened.\nWe do not want to fight, and love is still a remote possibility.\nBut speaking seriously, the world community has gained much from the improvement in Soviet-American relations.\nIn this regard I am pleased to cite a remark by Mr. Perez de Cuellar.\nThe meeting between Gorbachev and Reagan, he said, has shown the world community an example of voluntary dialogue. Governments have suddenly realized that the United Nations is an entirely appropriate place for negotiations and solving problems. Precisely, but I would say \\\"the most appropriate place\\\". If in the past it has not always been that, the Organization itself is least to blame.\nLet us speak frankly and say that many of us, including particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, are to blame for the fact that at some point certain fundamental values of our Organization embodied in its Charter were devalued. Now that they are regaining their initial level, it is our duty to learn the bitter lessons of the past for the sake of the future.\nToday, for instance, the Soviet Union is reconsidering its previous attitude to the Organization's economic institutions. In particular, we attach great importance to the activities of the United Nations Economic and Social Council and would like to contribute to enhancing its effectiveness.\nNo country stands to gain by remaining aloof from the international forums of our Organization. Having drawn this more than obvious conclusion, we are asking: should not some of our partners take a fresh look at their attitude to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)?\nThe permanent members of the Security Council should set an example in strengthening the authority of the united Nations, enhancing its role and expanding and enriching its peace-making functions. All of us here are witnesses to the beginning of the renaissance of our Organization. At the same time we are architects of this process. We shall enhance the role of the United Nations even more by concerted efforts to combat the threats to our environment. It is, we believe, precisely within the framework of the United Nations that international machinery should be established to formulate urgent decisions on pressing global problems, above all economic and environmental problems. \nThe Soviet Union proposes a discussion on the question of how to turn the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) into an environmental council capable of taking effective decisions to ensure ecological security. It proposes that a three-event series of emergency meetings be held - of course, under the auspices of the United nations - to co-ordinate efforts in the field of ecological security; a consultative meeting of experts to discuss the health of the Earth, in 1989? a summit meeting of the leaders of, say, 15 or 20 States representing all continents, and the influential force of our time, the Non-Aligned Movement, in 1992 the holding of the second United Nations international conference on the environment, as planned, in 1992, or even earlier, but in any event at summit level.\nWe have been speaking of a calendar of real achievements, a calendar of ideas as yet unrealised, a calendar of hopes and plans for the future. The review of this year that we have undertaken is not an end in itself. What can be an end in itself is the inner moral objective of achieving progress and acceptance of the political need to identify the moment of truth, which from time immemorial has tended towards movement, towards overcoming inaction.\nThis year has been full of both movement and slow-downs. It has shown that Mikhail Gorbachev was right when he said;\n\\\"A complex and in many respects unusual situation is developing in the world. We are at the beginning of a new, long road that offers new prospects and new problems\\\" Which tendency will prevail? What will gain the upper hand - the tendency towards further movement ahead or the inertia of stagnation?\nThe answer is to be found in abandoning certain dogmas, even though cast in the form of eternal truths. We have to write a new catechism of international existence, in which the beginning will be thought and reason, followed by deeds for the sake of our common salvation and development. We must stop sermonizing from lofty international rostrums and recognize the principle of equality in international dialogue.\nAs for the dogma of \\\"peace through strength\\\", let us leave it to those who worship the faded commandments of the past. The keynote of history is peace through reason, and this, too, is a commandment foe the future.\nThe past has great power over us, but although that is true, the future has an even greater gravitational pull. The poetic metaphor, \\\"to win the affection of space, to heed the call of the future\\\", takes on a lofty political meaning.\nLet us not be deaf to that call. Let us respond to it by really uniting to save life on our Earth.\nLet us begin now.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSince our last session the international situation hats clearly changed. Our goal of peace and development seems closer. Conflicts and tensions that have aroused our concern in recent years are being resolved, and we hope very sincerely that the dialogue that has started between the various belligerents will produce the necessary solutions.\nBefore continuing, Sir, I am pleased to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your eminent qualities and attributes, which made a big contribution to your election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I congratulate you most warmly.\nI also pay tribute to the outgoing President of the forty-second session, Ambassador Florin of the German Democratic Republic. We are grateful to him for the outstanding way in which he conducted the General Assembly's work.\nI also wish to express my Government's gratitude to the Secretary-General, t Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his ceaseless, praiseworthy efforts for world peace, I wish him well as he continues to persevere in his noble mission. We are gratified by the recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces.\nAs I have just emphasized, this session is of special interest. It is being held at a time when major events are being witnessed, such as the cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran conflict and positive developments in the question of Afghanistan,\nIn recent times East-West relations have been marked by the combined efforts of the two great Powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, to promote international detente. The most striking event was the signing of a Treaty to bring about a 50 per cent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons. We hope that that positive event will not only lead the parties to respect their commitments as scrupulously as possible, but will also provide a new point of departure to conclude new agreements leading to comprehensive and complete disarmament.- It is time to envisage building a non-violent world, free of nuclear weapons.\nThe Government of the Republic of Djibouti welcomes the desire for peace shown by the two neighbouring Muslim countries, the Republic of Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, by their acceptance of the cease-fire and Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We urge the two countries to abide by their commitments to peace and to start direct negotiations, a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of a just and lasting settlement in the region.\nFurthermore, we hope that this peace will not be limited to the borders of the two neighbours, but that it will be extended throughout the region, because other neighbouring areas have experienced dangerous tensions. Pot that to be achieved, it is important that all States fully enjoy freedom of navigation.\nWith its hundreds of thousands of victims, the Iraq-Iran war has been one of the longest and most deadly conflicts since the end of the Second World War. The Republic of Djibouti expresses its full support for the process under way and hopes that it will fully succeed, so that the peoples of Iraq and Iran may finally live in peace.\nFor almost 10 years the situation in Afghanistan has caused deep concern. However, after the repeated appeals of the international community, a partial withdrawal of foreign troops recently occurred. We believe that the fraternal people of Afghanistan should recover its independence and freedom by freely choosing the political system that it considers appropriate, without any constraints.\nThe question of Palestine remains at the core of the Middle East problem. We support the legitimate popular uprising of the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territories and condemn the policy of oppression and aggression practised by Israel in those territories. Faced with a defenceless population, the array of occupation does not hesitate to fire on children, women and old people. It uses all kinds of weapons, in violation of international law. The massacre of the civilian population continues and the number of victims increases daily. Faced with the repressive Israeli machine, the resistance is increasing, at the cost of hundreds of martyrs.\nThe Palestinian people must recover its territory and fully exercise its legitimate rights, under the guidance of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), its sole and legitimate representative. Another requirement for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem and southern Lebanon.\nWith regard to Lebanon, we urge all components of the Lebanese people to take part in a frank and sincere dialogue to bring about mutual trust, for the establishment of peace and national unity.\nDjibouti supports the efforts to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East, in conformity with the provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions, a conference in which the PLO would participate as an independent party and on an equal footing with the other parties.\nIn South Africa the racist regime is perpetuating its hateful, inhuman system of apartheid, and the situation gets worse every day, with new restrictions imposed on the South African people, with, in particular; continued detention, torture and assassination. My country supports the just struggle of the people of South Africa, and appeals to the international community to take appropriate steps to dismantle apartheid. \nThe serious internal situation is coupled with acts of aggression and destabilization perpetrated by the racist regime against neighbouring States. A just settlement of the question, in conformity with various United Nations resolutions, can be brought about only by imposing comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the Pretoria regime. Such sanctions remain the most effective way to dismantle apartheid.\nThe international community must also put pressure on the South African regime to obtain the immediate, unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners.\nThe racist regime of South Africa continues its illegal occupation of Namibia, in contravention of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We hope that the quadripartite talks new under way will make it possible to give the Namibian people power on the basis of their own wishes, freely and democratically expressed. Finally, we pay tribute to the South West Africa People's Organization, the sole representative of the Namibian people, for the heroic struggle it is waging.\nOn the Korean peninsula the beginning of dialogue between the two fraternal countries is an encouraging sign and will permit the development of a climate of mutual trust.\nIn Kampuchea we desire the total withdrawal of foreign forces so that Democratic Kampuchea may regain its independence and enjoy full sovereignty and integrity.\nWith regard to the question of Western Sahara, we welcome the Secretary-General's efforts to resolve the conflict, and support the holding of a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara, organized by the United Nations.\nThere can be no world peace and security without prospects of economic prosperity for all mankind. Peace, security and well-being are closely linked, like members of a single body. \nThe world is a single entity. Everything that happens in one region has direct repercussions in other regions. All nations need each other, without exception. Unfortunately international economic relations are structured nowadays in such a way that it is the developing countries that suffer from the damaging effects of an obviously unjust international economic order. In order to remedy this profound economic and financial crisis, we must find meaningful solutions and proceed to the elaboration of principles and instruments to establish a new order in international economic relations.\nThus the United Nations, in 1986, adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa, and the Organisation of African Unity, in July 1985 adopted the Priority Programme for the Economic Recovery of Africa for the years 1986 to 1990. While it is not necessary to speak at length here about the crisis affecting Africa, or to mention the price paid by the African countries, we cannot fail to stress the meagre results achieved, particularly after these two years of effort and sacrifice by our continent.\nTo create the basis for self-sustained economic development, the African countries decided to take a number of steps to attain that goal. More than half of them, in fact, have instituted economic reforms, as devised in the Priority Programme for the Economic Recovery of Africa, and they are already at the stage of implementing their structural adjustment programmes, with the support of financial groups such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \u201e However, these structural adjustment programmes do not provide an answer to economic conditions, particularly at the present stage of development of the majority of the developing countries.\nWith regard to the African debt, the international community has acknowledged that it is a major obstacle to development. Accordingly, the Toronto summit in June proposed, some debt relief. Certainly, this can be viewed as an encouraging sign, but unfortunately it is limited in scope, involving only a certain number of African countries. But fairly satisfactory results can be obtained if the industrialized countries implement the resolutions of the General Assembly and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on debt relief, and if they provide specific effective support for the recovery efforts of Africa, as included in the United Nations Programme of Action. Furthermore, we salute the honourable initiative taken by certain donor countries which wiped out the debt as ODA - official development assistance - or which took similar steps in keeping with resolution 165 (S-IX) of the Trade and Development Board of UNCTAD and we hope that that initiative will be followed by other donors.\nGiven the critical economic situation in Africa and the specific nature of the crisis, the responsibility that falls on the international community is basic. The international community has pledged assistance to these countries by taking supplementary steps and providing the necessary resources. However, we hope that the quality and modalities of this assistance and co-operation will be improved upon and strengthened.\nAfrica refuses to rely entirely on external action to resolve its problems, and is committed to making the necessary efforts for its own development. Several initiatives bear witness to this - inter alia, the fact that economic regional and subregional groups have been established or are now being established. Without a doubt this type of group will provide a basis for the true African community and will thereby help to resolve a certain number of problems.\nIt is within the intergovernmental authority on drought and development that sincere dialogue is now under way in Djibouti between our two neighbours, Ethiopia and Somalia - dialogue which, as representatives know, has led to the cessation of hostilities and to the restoration of diplomatic relations and an exchange of prisoners. Over the last decade major progress has been made in Djibouti in achieving our development goals - achievements that have helped to build an independent, sovereign, neutral State. These assets have been enhanced by a climate of political stability. Indeed, faithful to its traditions, the Republic of Djibouti has made constant efforts to ensure the full mobilization of its domestic resources to achieve our fundamental goals of socio-economic development and the promotion of human rights.\nDespite efforts made by the Government of Djibouti, the economic situation remains precarious. The prolonged drought we have experienced in recent years has seriously disrupted the lives of much of own nomad population, causing major losses of livestock and imposing on the Djiboutian authorities the additional costs of implementing resettlement programmes and providing services. The Government of my country launched an appeal for international assistance.\nThe problem of refugees has been such a heavy burden on our State that it deserves special attention. The Government of Djibouti has steadily stepped up its efforts to provide an adequate solution, and in 1936 launched a programme, in co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), for voluntary repatriation. However voluntary repatriation is the only authentic solution and, therefore, it is urgent to increase assistance to continue this programme.\nBearing in mind all the serious problems that hamper to a large extent the process of economic development in Djibouti, members of the group of least developed countries look forward to support and assistance from the international community - from countries and from international organizations. The challenges of poverty, ignorance and hunger are enormous. Greater solidarity from the international community is necessary to overcome these scourges. Therefore we must combine our efforts because, together, we can build a better world. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIn addressing this Assembly, I would like to assure it of the political will of the delegation of Guinea to make its modest contribution to the success of the work of the forty-third session.\nI should like to take this opportunity to convey the message of friendship of the people of Guinea, and of its Government, which is courageously led by His Excellency General Lansana Cont\u00e9.\nYour well-deserved election as President of this session, Sir, is a just reward for your laudable efforts and your outstanding human qualities, which give our work a spirit of serenity and expectation of success. Your country, in addition to belonging to the third world and to the Non-Aligned Countries;, has warm and friendly relations with Guinea, which therefore is sincerely gratified by your election. We can assure you here and now of the active support of our delegation.\nFurthermore, the forty-second session is still fresh in our minds, and I should be remiss if I failed to pay a sincere tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, who guided the work of the last session with sensitivity and skill.\nWe should like solemnly to hail our outstanding Secretary-General, whose firm dedication to the cause of pea e and fruitful co-operation among all States has been expressed in the various negotiations he has skilfully guided throughout this year to find just and comprehensive solutions to the various regional conflicts.\nThe full shouldering of this heavy responsibility is a clear guarantee of the achievement of the legitimate hopes which mankind has placed in the universal Organization. Although, unquestionably, many events have occurred in the past year and a new impetus has been given to the dynamic process of finding solutions to them, it is reasonable to conclude that consideration of the international situation does not justify undoubted optimism. In fact, hotbeds of tension continue to exist throughout the world, and more specifically in the southern hemisphere, which is subject to various political upheavals, aggravated by an extremely precarious economic situation.\nAgainst this backdrop, the alarming situation in southern Africa is of vital interest because of the policy of apartheid and the acts of destabilization carried out by the racist regime of Pretoria against neighbouring States, as well as its illegal occupation of Namibia. We are therefore following with continued attention the four-Power talks that are now taking place with regard to the sensitive area of the African continent. In fact, we remain confident that these talks will lead to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), on the accession to national sovereignty of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Moreover, we support the Declaration and the Plan of Action adopted by the International Conference on the Plight of Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons in Southern Africa, held last August in Oslo. \nThe South African regime cannot stamp out the internal contradictions which batter at the apartheid regime. The attention of international public opinion cannot be distracted from the imposition, of a state of emergency and from all the other violations, including repeated acts of aggression against the front-line States and the support given to puppet movements.\nThe permanent members of the Security Council have a particular responsibility and a decisive role to play in bringing Pretoria round to reason. We hope that these countries, which are dedicated to Freedom and to human rights, will assume their share of responsibility for success in the implementation of global and binding economic sanctions as a means of exerting effective pressure on the racist regime of Pretoria.\nWith respect to the Organization of African Unity (OAU), bold decisions have been taken here by the heads of State and Government, designed to strengthen moral and material support for the fighters of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), as an essential condition for its intensification in the struggle against apartheid and for the establishment in South Africa of a multiracial egalitarian and democratic society.\nAmong our concerns, the question of the Western Sahara is of high priority. It is encouraging to see the lifting of the clouds which for a long time have darkened the relations between Algeria and Morocco, two brotherly countries linked by history, by geography and by culture. These events reflect not only an act of faith but also mark an important step in re-establishing confidence and the consolidation of Afro-Arab co-operation and the building of a united and prosperous Maghreb.\nMy delegation greatly values the commendable efforts made in particular by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. His wisdom and far-sightedness have been important factors in resolving the crisis and in ensuring a return to an atmosphere of mutual understanding.\nIn this respect I should like also to pay a tribute to the OAU and to all the brotherly African and Arab countries whose contribution has in any way helped to improve the situation.\nWe note with satisfaction the favourable development of the process of settling the dispute between Chad and Libya under the guidance of the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU, and my delegation firmly supports its mediation efforts.  The significant results of contacts between the leaders in the Horn of Africa deserve our attention. This resumed dialogue should be encouraged and pursued with a view to establishing unity, fraternity and co-operation, in the sub-region on the ashes of hostility and mutual distrust.\nWe must also stress the positive development of the situation in the Comorian island of Mayotte. We hope that the talks will lead to a just solution to the question.\nThe same holds true for New Caledonia, where any initiative likely to eliminate the atmosphere of confrontation should be implemented. Here, the repercussions of the recent visits of the Prime Minister of France to New Caledonia and the new steps undertaken by his Government are clear signals of good will.\nThe developments in sensitive areas dominated by instability make us think of the continuing crisis in the Middle East. In that region the heroic uprising of the Palestinian people as the expression of the natural right to legitimate defence against foreign occupation. It is as a function of this inalienable right that justice-loving nations demand the recovery of the occupied Arab territories and the creation of an independent Palestinian State under the aegis of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nThe convening of an international peace conference in the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all parties concerned, including the PLO, now seems a viable means of concerted action to find a lasting solution to the conflict.\nMoreover, we cannot but be satisfied today at the happy outcome of the fratricidal war which for eight years has pitted Iran against Iraq and which has caused untold loss of life and damage. The cessation of hostilities will doubtless give vigorous impetus to the work of national building and will lead to progress and stability. Here, we should hail the persevering efforts of the Secretary-General to bring the two parties to a peaceful settlement to the conflict through the proper implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and as an important stage in seeking a just and global solution to this terrible conflict. For its part, the Government of Guinea encourages the two parties to the conflict to pursue negotiations and to demonstrate political will, given the steps that are being taken at various levels to overcome all obstacles, within the frameworks of a peaceful settlement of this dispute.\nConcerning the situation in Afghanistan, we continue to hope that the process of normalization will continue through the proper and systematic application of the Geneva agreements by all the parties involved. This will allow that country in the very near future to decide on its own destiny, free from any foreign interference.\nThis trend towards the defusing of tensions also holds true regarding Kampuchea, where the withdrawal of foreign troops remains the key to the problem. The direct and indirect talks among interested and concerned parties deserve our encouragement.\nTensions continue however in the Korean Peninsula despite the existence of numerous constructive proposals. Foreign intervention and the policy of over-arming seem to be the two fundamental obstacles to the peaceful and independent reunification of the northern and southern parts. The meeting of the North Korean and South Korean parliamentarians is an encouraging event inasmuch as it provides a possibility for the opening of dialogue, which can lead to conclusive results.\nRegarding the crisis on Cyprus, the last meeting between the President of the Republic of Cyprus and the representative of the Cypriot-Turkish community in Geneva gives rise to a glimmer of hope regarding the re-establishment under the aegis of the United Nations of national unity and territorial integrity. \nThe situation in Central America continues to be of concern to our community. The hope aroused by the Arias Plan for a global political settlement to the conflict is no longer being reflected in facts. The establishment of an atmosphere of good-neighbourliness among all States of the region and the return to democratic principles, as laid down in that Plan, could, however, have created the necessary conditions for a return to peace and security. There is, therefore, reason to encourage the Contadora Group and the States of the Support Group to continue their efforts with a view to for the integral application of this Plan.\nRegarding disarmament and the growing threat which the build-up of nuclear arsenals represents for mankind, the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to Disarmament had the task of assessing and adopting corrective measures. My delegation keenly regrets that the session was unable to adopt a final document because the defence of national interests dominated over the categorical imperative of global security. Benefiting from a favourable international climate, that session could, through a process of consensus - which to be sure is difficult to achieve on a question as thorny as that of disarmament - have supplemented the positive gains achieved in the bilateral negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. \nHowever, throughout this period the arms race has been continuing, devouring enormous financial and material resources which could have contributed to the process of socio-economic development throughout the world. In my delegation's view it is impossible to maintain peace without a consistent policy of general and complete disarmament under effective international control, just as it is unrealistic to attempt to establish a balance in international relations in an environment characterized by non-military threats to security. \nA new\u00b7/ vision has emerged over these last years in dealing with crucial questions linked to security, following the progress achieved in the disarmament field - in particular, nuclear and chemical disarmament. It is up to multilateral disarmament forums to pursue that work in order to achieve even more substantive results. In addition, the rather positive geo-political environment of the last few years, characterized by a definite will to go beyond political and ideological divergences, is a manifestation of a progressive awareness of leaders and peoples of the virtues of frank dialogue and serious concerted action.\nConcerning the zone of peace and co-operation in the South Atlantic, the Government of Guinea will support all efforts likely to promote achievement of the objectives of the declaration in resolution 41/11. It was in this spirit that my country participated in the meeting at Rio de Janeiro, whose final document symbolizes the determination of the States of the South Atlantic to make of their region a genuine zone of peace and co-operation.\nParadoxically, these recent encouraging and positive developments are in contrast to the rather gloomy picture of the international economic situation, given the continuous and increasing difficulties experienced by the developing countries in general and by the African States in particular. Indeed, despite the great sacrifices made by the latter in their various programmes of structural readjustment, they have not yet been able to enjoy the advantages that they have the right to expect, even if, on the domestic front, they have had a slight rise in their gross domestic product and some growth in food production.\nIn any case, we note with some concern that financial flows are dwindling. The tendency rather is for a transfer of capital from the South to the North. In fact, foreign investment, which represents for our economies a life-saving breath of oxygen, which can achieve certain national growth for development, is drying up. A glimmer of hope appeared when the international community demonstrated understanding and political will by adopting the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. The assessment of the implementation of that Programme has not yet shown prospects for specific measures, although certain international institutions have demonstrated some readiness to take action.\nThe situation regarding debt-servicing is unfavourable, while inequalities in international terms of trade are worsening. There are reasons for satisfaction at the conclusions of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which, although of limited scope, stressed these problems while urging rich and poor to pursue negotiations, which at the moment are deadlocked, in order to promote continued and lasting growth of the world economy.\nIn the Sudano-Sahelian region of Africa, natural disasters, such as locust invasions and floods, are, first and foremost, endangering food production and are decreasing the volume of exports, which have suffered already from unequal terms of trade. That is why it is essential to have an overall view of these various economic and social trends and to emphasize the ever-growing interdependence in international economic relations, ultimately, in the multipolar world in which we are living, balance can be achieved only through political will, linked to a realistic approach on the part of the international community. \nIt will be recalled that a positive initiative was undertaken by the Secretary-General in 1986 regarding the setting up of a strategy to enable us to cope, through the United Nations Programme for the Environment, with the damage caused to the environment. This decision was based specifically on the attention given to environmental problems throughout the world and, in particular, in the African countries confronted with a most alarming advance of the desert because of deforestation, the practice of large-scale cultivation and other factors contributing to deterioration.\nAnother ecological phenomenon, which is even more ominous, is threatening the developing countries. If I take the liberty of stressing this, it is precisely because my country, like many others, has been considered a dumping-ground by certain groups of countries and companies\u00b7, which find yet again in Africa a favoured place for casting out all the evils and ills of this world. Energetic measures must be taken by the international community to do away with such attitudes, which seriously endanger biological diversity and the ecosystem, and are in violation of all international conventions in this field.\nAbove and beyond its will to co-operate with all well-intentioned countries, the Republic of Guinea, for its part, will adhere to all legal guarantees that are in conformity with international norms and to the recommendations of the Organization of African Unity concerning prohibition of a recurrence of this type of situation in its national territory. We consider that these inhuman actions contribute to the sowing of disorder and dismay among our peaceful peoples and that they are a serious threat to present and future generations.\nThe promotion of respect for human rights and their universal application, by encouraging co-operation among States, is one of the fundamental objectives of the world Organization. In keeping with the spirit and the letter of the Charter, the events of today are an acknowledgement of the close relationship between respect for human rights and the maintenance of peace and international security- The fact that, through zealous efforts, the United Nations has succeeded in establishing a set of human-rights principles and rules that are internationally recognized should be noted among its most outstanding successes. For us, one of the essential tasks of the United Nations is to take effective measures against mass and flagrant violations of human rights, violations which are indeed a threat to peace and international security. Lack of respect for the right of peoples to self-determination, as well as humiliating practices and policies inspired by racism or apartheid, or existing for any other reason, require of our Organization, and of each of the Member States, the adoption of a firm position and adequate measures. The principle that there must be respect for, and implementation of, human rights is, we are convinced, the corner-stone of our civilization - a value shared by all mankind, a value that we have all set, and one that we must preserve and allow to grow.\nThe United Nations has demonstrated that it is an irreplaceable universal forum, whose central role has enabled us to resolve certain conflicts and to expand the foundations of democracy, peace, security and development. Its Charter includes rules and general principles that must serve as permanent reference points in our collective and individual actions. Any concept that is opposed to multilateralism undermines the idea of the interdependence of nations and sabotages the will to co-operate. It is by that will that all States - large or small, rich or poor - can effectively contribute to the establishment of a world free from distrust and terror, so long as its structure and means of functioning are adapted to today's realities.\nWhile the uncertainty of a better future makes some sceptics view happiness on this Earth as a mirage, or as the horizon which recedes as we advance towards it. My delegation, for its part, nevertheless dares to hope that with the dawn of the third millennium the human race will provide the necessary surge of awareness to achieve - burning and eternal in all disillusioned hearts - the basic prerequisite for man's existence which is the thirst to live free and in peace. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI warmly congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. I am confident that his vast experience and reputation will ensure that our work at this session is greatly facilitated and enhanced.\nThe Secretary-General has been an untiring champion of peace. I wish to common him highly for the tremendous strides made in the past year in his efforts to resolve the problems of long-standing areas of conflict.\nMuch has transpired since I last addressed the Assembly that gives cause for optimism. It may be that a glorious era of peace is about to bless the generations of our time. The super-Powers have reached accord on the elimination of a whole class of nuclear weapons. The international common is on the verge of negotiated settlements affecting Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq war. Within the grasp of the United Nations is the potential for the resolution of other intractable problems of the decade, which include those of Kampuchea, Cyprus and Namibia. It is encouraging also to hear that southern Africa may have set its schedule for peace. A new international convention against narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is near completion. All of this indicates vitality and purpose and makes it imperative that Member States renew their commitment to the United Nations and to multilateralism.\nFurther, the soldiers who are deployed around the world in the United Nations peace-keeping force, ensuring armistice and reinforcing the peace structure, ate to be warmly congratulated on the recognition they have received by winning the Nobel Peace Prize. The Secretary-General is to be thanked and commended for his great efforts, and the United Nations may feel justly proud of this achievement.\nThe question of arms limitation and disarmament is timely today and will be much discussed in the foreseeable future. May I point out three examples that show the process of multilateralism at work. First, at the 1988 session of the Disarmament Commission, last May, the Commission was able to make specific consensus recommendations on two of its eight substantive items: verification and guidelines for confidence-building measures. Secondly, later in May the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, meeting at Havana, Cuba, continued the process by adopting a consensus appeal to the two major Powers to reach agreement on disarmament. Thirdly, although a consensus text could not be produced at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, last June, a spirit of co-operation governed the deliberations of the working groups. \nThat success in arms limitation and disarmament holds the key to reducing military confrontations and minimizing the danger of nuclear war cannot be denied. This fact has provided the impetus for the role that the Bahamas played in the negotiations at those several meetings and as Chairman of the Disarmament Commission.\nToday, the confidence of the Bahamas in the United Nations is as strong as it was the day we joined the Organization in 1973, and our commitment to the United Nations has not faltered and will not falter. Indeed, we hope to translate this commitment into specific action by serving on the Economic and Social Council and the Committee for Programme and Co-ordination, for which out candidature is known, and on the Security Council, for which we will be a candidate during the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. This action will be reinforced by the experience of more than 15 sovereign years of stability, moderation and prosperity, a record unmatched by any State of similar size and natural resources.\nThe recent momentum in solving some of the globe's most pressing problems has served to underscore inconsistencies that may challenge the solution of others. The AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) epidemic has escalated to alarming proportions, while unabated drug abuse and addiction defy the powerful and baffle the weak. Internal and regional conflicts have been experienced on every continent, resulting in catastrophic casualties. Natural and created disasters have taken their crippling toll. It could be salutary were the diplomacy and enthusiasm brought to solving problems between the super-Powers in military matters to be applied and paralleled, with similar understanding, to these other problems, which are just as important to the survival of mankind.\nOver a year ago there was much cause for optimism when the countries of Central America signed the peace accord. The Bahamas is convinced that Esquipulas II remains the most effective mechanism for achieving lasting peace in Central America. We join the international chorus in calling upon all parties to continue to search for peace, and challenge all States to support their efforts, encouraging but not pressuring them as they seek to find their own paths to lasting peace.\nIn our region, Bahamas wishes to encourage the parties to territorial disputes to continue to work towards a negotiated settlement. In welcoming the new initiatives, the Bahamas reiterates its support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize and Guyana.\nAs the international common confirms its commitment to democracy and human rights. South Africa remains the bastion of racism and apartheid. The racist policy has as its foundations discrimination, denationalisation and the brutal repression of the black majority.\nThe rising tide of black resistance to apartheid is evidence that the black majority is undaunted by the brutal and savage repression of frequent and lengthy states of emergency such as the present one. Democracy, racial desegregation, social justice and the abolition of apartheid are now considered by many to be indispensable life-and-death issues.\nEconomic pressures have forced South Africa to offer the black majority only trivial concessions thus far. What is required is a range of economic sanctions that are sufficiently costly to compel South Africa to initiate the process of dialogue with representatives of the African National Congress and other legitimate organizations of the black population with a view to establishing a non-racial democratic Government. The sovereign States neighbours of South Africa ought to be protected from incursions and bombing by the South African military, which murder innocent civilians and wreak havoc on their societies and economies.\nThe Bahamas continues to encourage the United Nations and all Mender States, especially these with significant economic relations with South Africa, to implement effective economic sanctions in an effort to abolish apartheid, for its part, the Bahamas will continue to lend full support to all efforts leading to the eventual dismantling of apartheid.\nIn the midst of international despair regarding the apartheid regime of South Africa there is a glimmer of hope. Recent developments in Namibia increase our optimism that Namibia may at last achieve its independence. We encourage all concerned to continue to strive for the achievement of that noble objective at the earliest date possible. \nThe cease-fire is most welcome in the war between Iran and Iraq which has for eight years threatened international peace and security. The Bahamas was therefore pleased to note the recent developments which may at last lead to peace in that region. It is our fervent hope that all parties to the dispute will continue to search for a negotiated settlement in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987) which would end the war and the attendant loss of life and destruction of property. The Bahamas wishes to record its appreciation for the mediation efforts of our Secretary-General and hopes that all States will lend him their full co-operation and support.\nThe Bahamas has always supported Israel's right to exist. The Bahamas also strongly supports the right of peoples to self-determination. Self-determination should be guaranteed to the Palestinian people. The Bahamas therefore supports the convening of the international peace conference on the Middle East, with all the parties to the conflict being represented. Although the Palestinian issue is complex, we are satisfied that until it is resolved the chances of peace may be remote.\nNarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances remain a burning issue for our region and for the entire international community. The threat that drug abuse and drug trafficking pose to the security, stability and socio-economic viability of many States continues to elicit an unprecedented multilateral response. With the necessary political and diplomatic will, a plenipotentiary conference could adopt a new convention against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances later this year. last year more than 130 States represented at the International Conference against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, convened on the initiative of the Secretary-General, unanimously declared drug control to be the collective responsibility of all States. \nThe United Nations efforts for drug control are paralleled by standing bodies in virtually all regions of the world. In our own Latin American and Caribbean region, the Inter-American Drug Control Commission has taken up the challenge to co-ordinate a comprehensive hemispheric response to the phenomenal illicit prediction, traffic and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in the Americas. The activities of the Caribbean Community (CARIOOM) accurately reflect the critical concern of Member States in reducing the vulnerability of the region to the illicit transit traffic in narcotic drugs. CARIOOM's initiatives are substantially focused on protecting the people of the subregion from the scourge.\nAlso of concern to the Bahamas are the increasing interventionist attitudes, pronouncements and measures adopted in the region, which arise from the war on drugs. Although regional Governments agree on a common vigorous course of action against the drug trade, overzealous and unilateral measures are nevertheless taken which threaten the stability of co-operative Governments themselves. The pursuit of such attitudes, pronouncements and measures is a blatant abuse and is not in the interest of peace and security in the region and particularly of small States such as the Bahamas, which ensure vulnerable because of their geographical locations.\nThe antidote for such interventionism is the strengthening of multilateral co-operation. Small States, such as the Bahamas, with a stable economy, low inflation level, balanced budget and one of the highest per capita income in its region, must rely on the multilateral approach which this world Organization alone affords. The progress made toward solving some of the world's most serious problems are indicative of what can be achieved if more support for and less bashing of the United Nations is encouraged. The Bahamas takes positive note of and applauds recent decisions to deal with the troubling question of arrears in contributions. \nThe Bahamas is heartened by the fact that, after months of discussion about Africa  crushing debt burden, the major Western creditor countries have finally agreed to ease the plight of the world's most indebted nations. At their summit conference in Toronto on 19 to 21 June the leaders of the leading Western industrial States - the Group of Seven - agreed in principle to a set of options to alleviate the debt-servicing burden. That breakthrough may be considered the result of pressure which the February report of the Secretary-General's Advisory Group on Financial Flows to Africa brought to bear upon the creditor nations.\nEqually encouraging is the fact that preparations are in the final stage for an in-depth review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990, just two years after its adoption by the General Assembly, in June 1986. The review will focus on the economic policy changes undertaken by African Governments and will also spotlight the role of the international common and the United Nations in supporting Africa's recovery and development efforts.\nBefore closing, I should like to join with those of my colleagues who have expressed caring concern over the human suffering, loss of life and serious damage to property caused by natural disasters in our fellow Member States of Bangladesh, Jamaica and Mexico. Bahamas is encouraged by the wide expressions of sympathy by, and commitments of support received from, the  international common. We are hopeful that the support of the international community will assist those Member States in the immense task of their reconstruction.\nI conclude by referring to a view which I quoted from a leading national journal of a Member State some years ago. It said: \\\"... the sad, even bitter, truth is that the United Nations is no longer in the mainstream of world politics\\\". At the time I stated my opposition to that statement. Years later the United Nations has undeniably vindicated itself.\nWe owe it to present and future generations to establish a legacy of peace and security which can be realized only through an effective United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nAfter a period in which the United Nations was seen by many as marginal to the great issues of the world, events during the past year have demonstrated quite the contrary. The Organization can play a key role in the solution of serious international conflicts. In particular, after years of tragic and bloody wars in Afghanistan and between Iraq and Iran, the United Nations has made crucial contributions, in co-operation with the various parties, towards bringing them to an end.\nThe painstaking end meticulous efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative with regard to Afghanistan were brought to fruition with the conclusion of the Geneva Accords in April; and in August, Iran and Iraq finally agreed to a cease-fire, on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1988), after years of careful diplomacy by the Secretary-General and the Council. Much remains to be done, of course, but firm bases for bringing these international conflicts to an early end have been formed.\nLet me take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his skilful and quiet diplomacy, as well as to those military officers from various countries who have selflessly volunteered to serve as United Nations observers in the two areas.\nThe United Nations and its Secretary-General have also, in varying degrees, important roles to play in finding comprehensive, just and lasting solutions to other regional conflicts; Cyprus, Kampuchea, southern Africa, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Lebanon, Western Sahara, Central America. While the political will to find peaceful solutions on the part of the partiers concerned is indispensable, impartial United Nations mediation provides an essential ingredient in helping these parties to overcome their differences and implement agreements reached. All Member States must support such efforts. My Government welcomes this resurgence of confidence in multilateralism. It is testimony to an increasing awareness that regional conflicts affect us all and that commonly agreed solutions are therefore called for.\nWith these substantial achievements in mind, one can hardly believe that the United Nations is at the same time struggling financially. The fact is, however, that the very existence of this Organization is at stake owing to withholdings of assessed contributions from Member States.\nIt is evident that it is time - indeed, more than time - for all Member States to live up to their financial commitments to this Organization. It is not only a Charter obligation, but also, as illustrated recently, in the clear interest of all Member States, both individually and collectively, to have a strong and effective United Nations, while statements of political support are important, \\.hey must now be followed by the necessary action from those Member States which have not paid their dues. In this connection we welcome the recent first steps taken by the United States Administration.\nAt the same time this Organization must be efficient and rational. The reform process decided upon two years ago has already shown much progress, in particular owing to the follow-up action undertaken by the Secretary-General.\nHowever, with regard to the study of the United Nations intergovernmental structure and functions in the economic and social fields undertaken by Member States, the results were highly disappointing. Denmark believes that renewed efforts towards achieving major reforms in the economic and social fields are necessary in order to make the United Nations more effective and thus to strengthen its work in these areas.\nThe international situation facing us today is filled with signs of hope and promise, and in some cases also with remarkable achievements. It would be incorrect, however, if I tried to imply that all issues on which the East and the West do not see eye to eye have disappeared over the past year. That is still far from being the case. But even in this field we have witnessed developments and results which make us believe that the community of nations is on the right track in coming to grips with many of the outstanding problems.\nThe achievement of President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev at the summit meeting in Moscow, where for the first time in history agreement was finalized on the dismantling of a whole class of nuclear weapons, sent a message of hope to people all over the world.\nRegular and constructive dialogue at the highest level is a positive factor in its own right and gives us great encouragement.\nThe agreed solution to end the tragic occupation of Afghanistan is another sign of improved international relations. Those are only examples, albeit very important ones. I venture to believe that developments will not stop here, that the process of improving East-West relations will go on, that both sides know the agenda ahead of us and that there is a willingness to move forward. We are aware that many of our partners in the East are deeply engaged in transforming their own societies in fundamental ways. We are following their efforts with interest and we are hopeful that these efforts, if successful, will in themselves serve to lessen tension and to promote understanding and co-operation among countries in both East and West. Still, we must get on with the work between us.\nAn early conclusion of the Vienna Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) follow-up meeting with a balanced and substantial result will be a major contribution to consolidating the improvement of East-West relations in Europe. A successful conclusion of the Vienna meeting will pave the way for East-West negotiations on conventional stability. It will also open up possibilities for major progress in the human rights field of direct relevance to ordinary human beings in all Europe.\nPossibilities for achieving substantial progress in negotiations on disarmament are favoured by the prevailing political climate in the world. Against this background we regret that it did not prove possible to reach consensus on a final document from the third special session on disarmament. It would, however, be wrong to classify the session as a failure. The discussions and negotiations took place in a positive and co-operative atmosphere, and valuable work was done during the session. On many issues the session succeeded in narrowing differences and in reaching new grounds of consensus.\nOne of the tasks of this session of the General Assembly will be to recognize and affirm the progress made in individual areas and to continue the pressure and encouragement towards further agreement in the disarmament field. We must strive to maintain confidence in the multilateral negotiating system.\nMany have been the calls over the years for a ban on chemical weapons. We appreciate the progress made at the Conference on Disarmament. The abhorrent use of chemical weapons has made even more urgent the task of reaching agreement on a global convention prohibiting such weapons. All sides must take an active part in the negotiations towards this end.\nDenmark has signed the 1925 Protocol without conditions. We do not have any chemical weapons. We do not want any. This has always been our policy and we have declared it openly. It would be a sign of confidence and an important political signal if all countries declared their policy towards chemical weapons and whether or not they possessed those weapons.\nWe note the call made yesterday by the President of the United States in his statement for an international conference to consider actions which can contribute to prevent the use of chemical weapons as an important initiative, which is of particular attraction after the horrible use of chemical weapons which we have witnessed in the Gulf war - a use for which not even the slightest excuse can be found and which we strongly condemn. \nThe Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remains one of the most important arms control agreements reached to date. Since its entry into force 20 years ago, it has made a significant contribution to world stability. Reports of nuclear ambitions of certain countries in various parts of the world are extremely worrying. The nuclear option must never become an attractive solution to perceived security needs. Suspicion and mistrust must be countered by openness and trust. The non-proliferation regime is a crucial part of building that trust. We therefore urge all States at present outside the NPT to accede to the Treaty. \nIncreased concern over the complex issue of conventional disarmament has been manifest over the last years. All States have a direct responsibility in this field, and the issue of conventional disarmament should also be kept at the forefront of the multilateral debate on disarmament in the United Nations. This would serve to stimulate and support efforts and negotiations at the regional level.\nAmong regional conflicts, one area which suffers from particular tension and armed violence is the Middle East. Lately, however, we have seen the beginning of a dialogue take the place of armed confrontation in perhaps the most brutal conflict of our times. Denmark has consistently supported the efforts of the United Nations to bring about an end to the war between Iran and Iraq, and we rejoiced when it became clear that a termination of the hostilities is no longer a distant hope but a reality at hand.\nIt is understandable that eight years of warfare does not create an atmosphere of mutual confidence conducive to a peaceful settlement of the dispute. The road to permanent stability may be long and arduous, but we must do whatever possible to ease and shorten it. Peace and security will not only bring immense benefit to the peoples of Iran and Iraq; it will make the world a safer place to live in. \nI pledge our wholehearted support to the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative, Ambassador Eliasson, in their further efforts in this conflict. The Danish participation in the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) bears witness to our commitment to contribute to a peaceful solution. It is a source of deep concern to the international community that, in the aftermath of the war, arms have been turned against Kurdish civilians. Not only is this brutality evidenced by the presence of a huge number of refugees in a neighbouring country, but we have even received reliable reports that chemical weapons have been applied. This is despicable. The use of illegal weapons and violations of human rights are not internal matters but a legitimate concern of the international community.\nDialogue has regrettably not replaced confrontation in the Arab-Israeli conflict. An atmosphere of violence and mutual mistrust prevents the creation of an environment of mutual trust which is indispensable for getting negotiations between the parties off the ground. The tragic events in the territories occupied by Israel bear this out only too clearly. We appeal to all parties to exercise restraint. The repressive measures taken by the Israeli forces are not in conformity with international law and must stop.\nThe declaration of 31 July by His Majesty King Hussein to the effect that Jordan no longer claims sovereignty over the West Bank has created a new situation. I implore all parties to exercise moderation and take only steps which will further the cause of peace.\nAn international conference under the auspices of the United Nations seems at present the only way to bring about a just and lasting settlement of the conflict.\nIn Lebanon, mutual mistrust has had disastrous consequences in terms of disorder, civil strife and human suffering. The constitutional crisis over the election of a new President has highlighted the problems, and we appeal to all parties to exercise restraint and good will to save the very existence of Lebanon. It is obvious that the serious situation now existing in southern Africa is to a very large extent the result of South Africa's policy. Through acts of destabilization in the form of military aggression, economic pressure and direct support to armed rebel movements in the neighbouring countries. South Africa has severely undermined social and economic development in the region, thereby adversely affecting the daily lives of millions of persons.\nIn South Africa itself the abhorrent apartheid system continues without major changes in sight. Apartheid remains a flagrant violation of the fundamental human rights laid down in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Many thousands are gaoled for political offences. Others are forced to seek refuge abroad. For the millions of victims of apartheid that remain in South Africa the situation is constantly deteriorating. There is an urgent need for a genuine national dialogue in South Africa across lines of colour, politics and religion. It goes without saying that it is incumbent on the Organization to reflect and act upon the deep concern and indignation of the entire international community at the persistence of such serious violations of fundamental human rights as those being perpetrated by the apartheid regime. Apartheid cannot be reformed. It must be abolished.\nIn Namibia the South African illegal occupation and the oppression of the population continue. Namibia's independence is long overdue and should be pursued by all peaceful means. The ongoing negotiations between the United States, Angola, Cuba and South Africa have established the basis for some hope that the South African Government will withdraw its forces from Namibia and that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will be implemented. Denmark hopes that the negotiations can stop armed interventions by South African troops inside Angola and lead to the establishment of peace in Angola. \nThe Danish Government has for many years actively supported the struggle against apartheid and assisted the countries of southern Africa in their development efforts. Pending mandatory sanctions by the Security Council, the Danish Government has taken unilateral measures in order to terminate trade with South Africa and Namibia and to limit other relations with South Africa to an absolute minimum. Our diplomacy is engaged in a systematic effort to encourage their countries to increase their contribution to reinforced and more effective international pressure against apartheid.\nIn March this year Denmark and its Nordic partners adopted a revised Nordic programme of Action against Apartheid. The Programme calls for increased assistance to South Africa's neighbouring countries in order to alleviate the factors of destabilization, to strengthen their power of resistance and to reduce their dependence on South Africa. Many of the countries of southern Africa are major recipients of Danish development assistance bilaterally as well as regionally through the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). Our joint efforts are geared towards promoting economic, social and human-resources development. Such\ndevelopment is also of prime importance to enable these countries to handle the racial problems of the region brought about by apartheid, political disturbance, and natural catastrophes.\nMy Government welcomes the successful conclusion of the Afghanistan talks with the signing of the Geneva agreements on 14 April, paving the way for the withdrawal s Soviet forces after more than eight years of occupation. We congratulate the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative on the success of their untiring his skilful efforts; and we pay a tribute to Pakistan for its readiness to accept \u0448 lions of Afghan refugees over the years. These agreements represent an important step towards a solution of the Afghanistan crisis. We hope this will lead to a comprehensive political settlement, including the voluntary return of the refugees, the opportunity for the Afghan people to exercise its right to self-determination, and the re-establishment of a sovereign, independent, neutral and non-aligned Afghanistan. Major aid efforts under United Nations auspices are under way, and Denmark will not fail to make its contribution in this regard.\nThe people of Kampuchea has suffered untold hardship, first at the hands of the notorious Pol Pot regime, then because of the Vietnamese occupation. Kampuchea must be free both from foreign troops and from any prospect of a return to the appalling brutality of the Khmer Rouge, The Jakarta Informal Meeting in July offers glimmerings of hope that all parties concerned now realize that a political solution is called for. We urge that the dialogue be vigorously pursued, and we hope that it will lead to the re-establishment of a sovereign, independent, neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea in accordance with resolutions of the United Nations. The right to self-determination of the Kampuchean people must be fully respected.\nWith regard to the Korean peninsula my Government has been encouraged by initiatives in recent months, in particular President Roh's declaration of 7 July and his proposal for a meeting of the Presidents of the North and the South. A resumption of the suspended direct dialogue between the two parties is the only way to reach a solution by peaceful means. Denmark is on record as being a firm supporter of the principle of universality; it is our hope that, in keeping with that principle, the people of Korea may soon gain full membership of the Organization. My Government extends its best wishes for the success of the Olympic Games in Seoul.\nA year ago there was a feeling of satisfaction and relief in the Assembly after the conclusion of the Guatemala peace plan. During the autumn of 1987 we saw a number of measures taken by the Central American countries in implementation of that agreement. However, genuine peace and true democracy have not yet been achieved in the whole of Central America. And recent developments, unfortunately, point in the wrong direction. Respect for freedom of information and opinion and other fundamental liberties, intended by the Guatemala accord to be the corner-stone of the process, are again being gravely infringed. Violence and disrespect for basic human rights go hand in hand with attempted coups and other disturbances. Genuine peace and true democracy again seem a distant hope.\nThe Danish Government continues to believe that without democracy, allowing for full public participation in the political systems, and without respect for basic human rights no lasting solutions to the manifold problems of the region can be found. Thus we remain convinced that it is vitally important for the countries of Central America to continue their efforts in accordance with the agreement reached in Guatemala. At the same time, all countries with links to and interests in the region must co-operate constructively in that process. Together with our partners in the European Community, we are ready to continue our active support for these efforts.\nDenmark's support of United Nations peace-keeping operations has always been an important part of our United Nations policy. We have actively demonstrated our support by participating in peace-keeping operations and observer missions in the Middle East, Kashmir and Cyprus, as well as in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Most recently, Denmark has placed officers at the disposal of the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group. We have also reiterated our willingness, in principle, to participate in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia. Denmark has time and again stressed that all United Nations Member States carry a joint responsibility for the peace-keeping activities o' the United Nations and for the financing of these activities. Regrettably, some peace-keeping operations are still faced with serious financial problems, especially the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the United Nations Force in Cyprus. In these two cases the financial burden is carried by the troop-contributing countries to an unreasonable degree. If the United Nations Transition Assistance Group is decided upon as planned, it will no doubt add a new and even more difficult dimension to the already existing problems.\nAgainst this background we find it imperative that agreement among Member States be found on the financing of ongoing and forthcoming peace-keeping operations in order that the financial burden will no longer be carried by the troop-contributing countries alone. Should efforts to this effect, however, prove fruitless, Denmark might feel compelled to reconsider how best to allocate its contributions to peace-keeping operations.\nTurning to international economic questions, I wish to emphasize the crucial importance of a common understanding of the challenges confronting us. Improved macro-economic co-ordination is necessary in order to correct the major imbalances. Another important element is the successful outcome of the Uruguay Round. We all share the responsibility for securing and strengthening the open, liberal, multilateral trading system. Protectionist tendencies must be curtailed, and solutions must be balanced with increased benefits to all participants, including the developing countries. While respecting the principle of differential and more favourable treatment, the newly industrialized countries should gradually and in accordance with their ability be encouraged to integrate themselves more fully into the open, multilateral systems of international trade and monetary and financial matters.\nIt is hardly possible to speak on a number of economic development problems without also underlining the necessity of such development being sustainable. Short-term solutions which undermine the environment and the natural resource base upon which longer-term economic and social development must build are - where at all avoidable - cynical and an affront to coming generations, which do not have a voice to speak out against today's decision-makers.\nRecent incidents of illegal exports of dangerous waste to other countries are but one of many examples of practices that have to be corrected. It is to be hoped that the ongoing process of study, review and implementation of recommendations set forth in the report of the World Commission for Environment and Development and in the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond will gradually take us a large step in the right direction. There is a need to strengthen the concessional assistance to the low-income countries in support of the efforts to revive social and economic development. Resources, however, remain scarce. It is of serious concern that the level of official development assistance lags far behind the internationally agreed targets. In fact the ratio of official development assistance to gross national product is declining, and I therefore urge all industrialized countries to increase their official development assistance.\nA few years ago Denmark decided on the basis of a broad political consensus to increase the development assistance gradually so that it will reach 1 per cent of the Danish gross national product in 1992. In 1988 our development assistance has reached 0.88 per cent of our gross national product.\nMany of the economically and socially strained developing countries are facing serious environmental disruption. The problems have assumed such dimensions that often they are beyond the financial and administrative capacity of those countries. Therefore it is important through multilateral and bilateral assistance to strengthen their capacity to solve the environmental problems so as to support sound and sustainable development. The United Nations system has a leading role to play in these efforts. Politically the need for action has been acknowledged. This understanding must be transferred into operational and concrete action.\nWomen play a decisive role in the development process. Therefore it is imperative to continue and to strengthen development efforts for the advancement of women economically, socially and legally.\nThe consensus adoption in 1986 of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development was a recognition of the need for strengthened and concerted efforts in tackling the problems of the sub-Saharan countries. The Programme has proved its success by the concrete initiatives which have been taken during recent years by the African countries themselves and by the international community. The outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on Review of the Programme of Action underlines the continued mutual commitment to the Programme of Action and clearly demonstrates the need for further action by all parties.\nWe are on the eve of a fourth United Nations development decade. Unforeseen changes in the international environment have drastically altered the realities of the present decade. We have learned that a strategy cannot address all development problems in general. A new development strategy for the fourth development decade should be flexible in its targets. A fresh approach is necessary, it must be pragmatic and realistic, committing developing as well as developed countries.\nThe fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which we shall all celebrate on 10 December this year, reminds us that one of the basic duties of this Organization is to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. After 40 years this duty is, unfortunately, still relevant.\nSince the adoption of the Universal Declaration this Organization has been engaged in intensive work of standard-setting. One of the important tasks for us in the years to come is to implement these standards. My Government is therefore concerned that the implementation of various instruments is weakened by the fact that some Governments do not fulfil their financial obligations under these instruments, thereby hampering the monitoring systems, if the United Nations is to be more effective in combating human rights violations, it is necessary that all States adhere to these instruments and meet their financial obligations.\nA sad consequence of the many abuses of human rights is that millions of people have been forced into fleeing their countries out of fear for their life or liberty. Although we have witnessed some encouraging developments in the world refugee situation over the past year, the international community is still faced with the enormous challenge of finding durable solutions to the plight of these millions of refugees. \nWe recognize and commend the efforts carried out by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but at the same time we realize that these efforts will succeed only if his Office can count on the full support of all members of this Assembly. Over the years my Government has been a staunch supporter of the Office and would like to see its role further strengthened and developed. To this end my Government launched two years ago in this Assembly some ideas aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, inter alia through a global scheme of resettlement places at the disposal of the Office and through additional financial resources to countries of first asylum. In Europe the outline of a structure to deal in a humanitarian spirit with this problem is beginning to emerge. My Government feels confident that only through such concrete action, and with the active involvement of the UNHCR, shall we be able to work towards a comprehensive approach to the international refugee problem.\nIt is my hope that the elements contained in this undertaking can be further developed and employed in other regions where the refugee situation is presenting an equally distressing picture.\nThis session of the General Assembly will have to deal with numerous complex issues of peace and human progress. Bearing in mind the important progress made on several questions over the past year, it is my earnest hope that further headway will be made in the months to come.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with much pleasure, Mr. President, that I extend to you my heartiest congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. Your well-known diplomatic skills and outstanding abilities will ensure that the deliberations of this session will be constructive and rewarding.\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, we owe a great debt of gratitude for his tireless devotion in presiding with consummate skill and infinite wisdom over the deliberations of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. To the Secretary-General, we offer our sincere felicitations on his outstanding contribution to the cause of world peace and security. My delegation also extends its congratulations, through the Secretary-General, to the United Nations peace-keeping forces on the award of the Nobel Peace Prize so fittingly bestowed upon them. The Nobel Peace Prize speaks eloquently as a tribute to the individuals from various States Members of the United Nations and those within the Organization who have so honourably discharged their duties in upholding the Principles embodied in the United Nations Charter.\nThe General Assembly meets this year at a propitious time indeed, world regard for the United Nations has taken a turn for the better, influenced as everyone is by the return of peace or the promise of peace to many flash-points\u00b7. Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, Namibia, Western Sahara, Kampuchea, and perhaps also to the Korean peninsula. In contrast to the cynicism and disillusionment that many had felt in the past about the United Nations, we are now witnessing a clear shift towards a better appreciation of the role of the United Nations and of its relevance to the aspirations of the community of nations. We would like to believe that at long last the United Nations is coming into its own and fulfilling its task of moving conflicts from the battlefield to the conference table.\nMalaysia's faith and confidence in the United Nations have never wavered, but we were saddened in the past to see the United Nations struggling to retain its relevance and credibility. Multilateralism had become a bad word as the powerful nations resorted to solving problems on their own. We are therefore pleased to welcome this change, this renewal of faith in the United Nations which we hope will mean the birth of a new era in multilateralism.\nAs an international organization, the United Nations must be perceived to be relevant in meeting the needs of its Members as a forum for multilateral diplomacy, an instrument for maintaining international peace and security and a catalyst for promoting international economic growth and development. The United Nations is at its most effective in the discharge of its functions when Member States fully support the course of action that it takes. The most telling example is the unanimous support given by the members of the Security Council to the Secretary-General to bring about an end to the Iran-Iraq war. The collective efforts of the Security Council, permanent and non-permanent members together, have raised clear hopes for the resolution of conflicts. For the first time in decades, we are witnessing a convergence of the interests and wills of Member States to effect solutions on major issues. This development, it is hoped, will fulfil the vision of the pioneers of the United Nations when they conferred upon the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.\nMalaysia stands for the full and effective discharge of the Council's conciliatory and mandatory powers and for universal compliance with and implementation of the Council's decisions. It is a matter of great reassurance to us all that the Security Council's increased effectiveness has been made possible by the convergences of interest and action of the United States and the Soviet Union. Conversely, it should be instructive to those two countries that they are drawing from the best of themselves when they counsel and collaborate together with the rest of the world on common objectives.\nWhen one extols the achievements of the United Nations, one is not refusing to recognize that the steady improvement of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union have helped significantly in bringing about progress on conflict resolutions. Those of us who have lived during periods of unease and uncertainty, when the two Powers stared at each other eyeball to eyeball, are greatly relieved that these two super-Powers are realistically discussing peace and construction between them.. They can make an enormous contribution to the realization of the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. It is our common appeal to both these countries that they seek recourse through all the institutions of the United Nations when attempting to defuse conflicts and in realizing a more equitable world order.\t,\nA United Nations functioning at its best will be in the interest Of all its members and will not simply serve the interests of certain Powers or groups of States. The time for United Nations bashing and the assault on multilateralism is over. If universal responsibility is a creed that this and future generations can believe in, then every country must provide full commitment to the United Nations. A revitalized United Nations, poised to assume even greater responsibility, must not be hampered by a lack financial resources. A sine qua non of its very survival is the timely payment by member countries of their assessed contributions. \nMalaysia welcomes the signing of the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan. There must be complete and faithful implementation of these Accords by all concerned parties if the sufferings of the people of Afghanistan, after eight years of bloody and brutal war, is to come to a definite conclusion and if Afghanistan is to regain its independence. At this juncture, may I pay tribute to the late President Zia Lil-Haq of Pakistan for his immense contribution towards the successful signing of the Geneva Accords. My country and many others will sadly miss the friendship\\\" and wise counsel of the last President.\nThe withdrawal of Soviet forces must continue and be completed within the agreed time-frame. It is our hope that the Accords will be fully implemented to enable the Afghan people to freely exercise their right to self-determination through the process of genuine reconciliation.\nMalaysia hopes that the United Nations humanitarian and economic assistance programmes relating to Afghanistan will be able to meet the immediate needs for relief and rehabilitation as well as the long-term requirements for reconstruction of the country. For full implementation of such assistance can be realized only under conditions of peace and stability in Afghanistan.\nThe acceptance by Iran and Iraq of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as the framework for the termination of the Iran-Iraq war is a source of satisfaction to us all. The world witnessed in horror and helplessness the terrible toll exacted by the conflict for eight long years. We are therefore thankful that the first crucial steps for a durable solution hove been taken. It is our hope and belief that the resolve of Iran and Iraq to embark on the path of peace is irrevocable and that they will now turn their full attention to making the creative energies and talents of their peoples to the urgent tasks of national reconstruction and development. \nDespite all efforts, the Middle East is still embroiled in an endless cycle of violence. Israel must beat responsibility for this tragic state of affairs as it remains the main stumbling-block to any peace attempts in the region. The United Nations has not been allowed to play its proper role in the search for a settlement primarily on account of Israel's intransigence. Israel is single-minded in the execution of its policies of aggression and expansion and brutal subjugation of the Palestinian people. It has defied the international community's call for a total withdrawal from all occupied territories. The Palestinian problem, the core of the Middle East conflict, remains unresolved due to the arrogant Israeli hubris and its continued refusal to recognize the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to an independent State.\nIsrael cannot continue to believe that it can ensure its security and survival by adherence to policies which seek to consign the Palestinian people to either permanent diaspora or permanent oppressive Israeli rule. The Holocaust cannot be flaunted by Israel as an excuse for treating Arabs under their rule in like manner.\nIsrael's policy of dictating to the Palestinians as to whom they should choose to speak for them has been an unmitigated failure. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) remains the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The best hope for a durable and comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian problem lies in the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all parties, including the PLO. Malaysia fully supports the convening of such a conference and calls upon those Powers that have been the strongest supporters of Israel to lend their influence to convince Israel that its vital interests are best served by dialogue and negotiations at a peace conference rather than by the mailed fiat. Indeed these supporters of Israel must share the moral responsibility for the injustice and inhumanity committed by Israel against the Palestinians. \nIn South Africa we are confronted with the challenge of a regime that seeks to dehumanise human beings on the basis of colour. The only response of good men to this crime against humanity and affront to the universal conscience must be to seek the total destruction of the evil system of apartheid. It is a delusion for anyone to believe that we can effect an evolution of the system into something more human and humane. The hideous manifestations of apartheid are seen daily in the atrocities inflicted on black South Africans.\nMalaysia has never been persuaded by the arguments advanced by some that it is in the interest of the blacks of South Africa that comprehensive sanctions should not be imposed against the Pretoria regime. We therefore reiterate our call for decisive action in the form of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\nConsistent with our stand, we have undertaken efforts to provide assistance to black South Africans and the front-line States to assist them in coping with the destabilisation caused by South Africa and to enable them to cope with the effects comprehensive sanctions could have on them. A total of $US 2 million has been pledged as Malaysia's contribution to the Africa Fund established for this purpose by the Non-Aligned Movement, tie wish to appeal for generous support by the international community for the Africa Fund, which must be seen as part of a universal battle to bring about the total elimination of the system of apartheid.\nThe agreement on the comprehensive settlement for South western Africa offers Namibia the promise of realising its freedom and independence. It is our hope that all parties to the agreement will enter into the spirit of the times and bring peace and freedom to the long-suffering people of Namibia. Familiar with the record of the Pretoria regime in exploiting every opportunity to permeate its iron grip on Namibia, we must continue to apply unrelenting international pressure on the equitable to honour its commitments. In the meantime, our support of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) must continue. We have seen how SWAPO's successes on the battlefields of Namibia have forced the hand of the Pretoria regime to agree reluctantly to a negotiated solution of the problem. Pressure must therefore be sustained on the ground to prevent South Africa from reneging on its promises.\nThe question of Kampuchea has been a subject for debate at every United Nations General Assembly session for the last nine years. With the support of a huge majority of its members, this Assembly has repeatedly called for the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces, restoration and preservation of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea, and reaffirmation of the right of its people to self-determination.\nThe fundamental issues of the Kampuchean problem have to be clearly addressed. Vietnam's forces in Kampuchea must withdraw. Vietnam should not be allowed to continue to cloud this issue. There cannot be any conditionality. The concerns of the international community and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to prevent the return of the universally condemned policies and practices of a recent past must be addressed. The Kampuchean people must be assured that they will be free from the horrors of the past. National reconciliation under the effective leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk will not only heal divisions between the various Kampuchean partners, but will also regain for that turbulent country its rightful sovereignty and independence. \nThe constant search by the ASEAN countries for a solution yielded a significant measure of success with the convening of the Jakarta Informal Meeting in July. This meeting was a regional initiative constituting an important milestone in the process of finding a comprehensive political solution to the Kampuchean problem. This initiative should be allowed to continue. The present international climate augurs well for allowing the parties concerned to come together in the near future to achieve agreement on the issues. Malaysia welcomes the efforts of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to complement the regional efforts on Kampuchea.\nPeace in Kampuchea will contribute tremendously to regional peace and security. It will facilitate the achievement of more co-operative relations among the States of South-East and particularly between the members of ASEAN and Viet Nam. It is our hope that the peace that we long for will bring about a climate of regional stability and co-operation which can then make possible the early realization of the regional aspiration for a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia-\nThe Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Kampuchea have resulted in the displacement of a large number of, people. Furthermore, the influx of boat people from Viet Nam seeking better opportunities elsewhere has for several, years brought further serious problems to countries such as Malaysia and Thailand and .others. Recently Malaysia has reached an understanding with the Government of Viet Nam under which the latter will accept the repatriation of those boat people in Malaysia who are not qualified for resettlement in third countries and also prevent fresh bursts. We are happy to note that Viet Nam has agreed to participate in the preparatory meeting which Malaysia hopes to host to prepare for the International Conference on Indochina's Refugees, including the boat people. \nIn Central America the high expectations raised by the regionally initiated Esquipalas peace agreement have not yet been fulfilled. The aspirations of the peoples of Central America for peace, freedom and justice remain in hostage to the dictates of international and external divisions in the region. Coercive measures from outside the area only compound the problems of the region and should not be allowed to continue. It is our hope that the peace process will be given renewed impetus by the very leaders whose vision and statesmanship led to the signing of the Esquipalas agreements.\nIn raising the issue of Antarctica at the United Nations, it was the intention of Malaysia and the other like-minded countries to draw attention to the considerable environmental, climatic and scientific significance of the continent to the world. We also earnestly seek an international instrument having universal validity and serving the interests of and for the benefit of mankind.\nIt is most regrettable that a Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources Activities has been concluded recently in total disregard for United Nations resolutions calling for a moratorium on all negotiations on a minerals regime until such time as all members of the international community can fully participate in such negotiations. We cannot understand the haste, because all the minerals that can possibly be found in Antarctica can be found in plentiful supply elsewhere.\nWe also regret that the General Assembly's appeals for urgent measures to exclude the racist regime of South Africa at the earliest possible date from participating in the meetings of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have not been acted upon.\nAntarctica represents to us a touchstone of the constancy of the adherence of the Consultative Parties to fundamental principles and norms which have evolved through common endeavours and have gained universal currency in the course of the democratizing process of international relations and institutions. We remain steadfast in our conviction that a regime for Antarctica built on such foundations will better reflect and respond to the needs of our age than one founded upon circumstances and considerations which are tainted with colonialist adventurism.\nThe issue of disarmament must remain high on the agenda of this Organization and must continue to receive the urgent attention of the international community. Threats to mankind derive not only from the stockpiling and continuous development of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction but also from the growing arsenals of sophisticated conventional weapons. We are now beset also with the problem of nuclear and toxic wastes dumped in the developing countries. Our efforts at arms control and disarmament must proceed on all fronts and a prerequisite for any success in this regard must be a general improvement in the climate of relations among States. An important start has been made with the signing of the Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces between the United States and the Soviet Union in May this year. This Treaty is an important breakthrough and should generate the necessary mutual confidence and trust to allow the concluding of negotiations on the reduction of strategic weapons and on the additional verification procedures required for a complete test-ban treaty.\nWhile the two super-Powers with the largest arsenals of nuclear weapons must carry the primary responsibility for bringing about progress in nuclear disarmament, multilateral approaches should make an important contribution to the attainment of mankind's objective of a safer world through arms control and disarmament.\nWe regret that the outcome of the General Assembly's third special session devoted to disarmament did not fulfil our highest expectations but we remain hopeful that the steady improvement in the international climate will generate the necessary political will for the success of such multilateral initiatives; which provide the best opportunity for a genuine harmonization and reconciliation of all interests. The resources released as a result of the successful achievement of the disarmament process would provide a source of much-needed funds for humanitarian work and productive investments in the economic development of the developing world\nOuter space, which, we reaffirm, is the common heritage of mankind, should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes, and we urge that negotiations on the prevention of the militarization of outer space should begin in earnest. Malaysia would also like to lend its strong support to the early conclusion of a convention for the complete prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons.\nThe economic issues before this Assembly may appear to be stale issues, for they have been debated repeatedly over the years but being stale does not make them any less relevant or less urgent. On the contrary, the resolution of these economic problems, such as the establishment of a fairer and more favourable international trading environment, a re-examination of the role and functions of , the multilateral financial institutions, a review and realignment of the international exchange rate regime and a resolution of the international debt problem would constitute positive beginnings in the United Nations work programme in the economic area. As a primary-commodities producer that is also heavily dependent on exports of manufactured goods, Malaysia attaches great importance to the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations. While the objective of the Uruguay Round is to retain an open international trading system and to promote increased trade liberalization, we are also concerned about the opposing trend of increasing integration, which brings about greater exclusion. It is our hope, therefore, that the intention of the European Economic Community to achieve an integrated internal market by 1992 does not obstruct efforts under United Nations auspices aimed at greater trade liberalization. To maintain effectively an open and liberal international trading environment the developed countries in particular must curb domestic pressures for protectionist policies that have historically proved to be myopic, leading to distortions in trade and stifling growth and expansion.\nAside from restraints on protectionist tendencies, the world's trading nations must also agree on a more realistic and broad-based action on their currency realignment. Agreements confined only to an exclusive group have proved disastrous to the poorer nations, whose currencies and small trade advantages have been seriously affected. The interests of the smaller nations are best served by their representation at such gatherings when issues that affect them are taken up.\nThe debt crisis is debilitating for the countries affected, diverting attention and energies away from domestic political, economic and social needs. While the crisis has deepened in the past year, we see hope in the initiatives of some commercial banks to write off their loans and of Governments which have converted some of their official loans into outright grants. The proposal by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) for a 30 per cent cut in commercial bad debts owed by the 15 most heavily indebted countries merits serious consideration. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must engage more actively in the design and creation of a debt-reconstruction facility. Proposals abound, but the international community must quickly study various modalities to relieve those countries that are carrying impossible burdens. The United Nations has provided the forum for detailed discussion on the debt crisis and has participated in the search for solutions. Malaysia fully supports the United Nations efforts in this regard and endorses the recent recommendations by the Africa Recovery Review Committee substantially to increase financial flews to Africa to ensure reform and development.\nTwo years ago, at the forty-first session of the Assembly, I spoke about the initiative of the developing countries to set up an independent South Commission. The Commission has since been set up to complement and supplement other efforts in making a fresh and objective analysis of the formidable economic, social and political challenges confronting the developing countries. It attempts to identify areas for practical and mutually beneficial South-South co-operation. It is heartening to note that since its inception in July last year the Commission has vigorously pursued the responsibilities entrusted to it.\nThe International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (ICDAIT) held at Vienna in June 1987 brought Lom\u00e9 to the 138 participating countries the extent and seriousness of the international drug problem. The seeming impotence of the international community to combat the drug threat brought the realization that without the manifest political will of nations to act, and to act in concert, to counter the drug problem there can be no effective solution. Thus, the adoption by the Conference of its political declaration and the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future Activities represents a collective struggle to eliminate drug abuse and illicit trafficking. Malaysia congratulates the United Nations and the Secretary-General for that success and important beginning. The momentum created by ICDAIT last year must be maintained.\nIn this connection Malaysia welcomes the convening of the plenipotentiary conference at Vienna from November to December of this year to adopt the new convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, which will plug an important loophole and provide for further action against illicit-drug traffickers.\nWe are always concerned when there is extreme disparity between rich and poor within any country, but in some countries there is no disparity - everyone is just poor. If asked to imagine what poverty is like in those poor nations, we should find it extremely difficult to visualize it accurately. But we need not imagine. Today, we see in colourful detail, accompanied by sound and motion, the extent and horror of human poverty. We see living children being literally devoured by flies we see skeletons hobbling around. We see people so ill that we wonder how they survive at all.\nEven if we have to spend billions on weapons, on preserving the beauty of nature, the trees and the forests, the rare insect species and other things that we claim will enhance the quality of our life, we have no excuse in this day and age to permit such misery to befall millions of fellow humans. .\nThe response of millions of ordinary people to the appeals for aid to the suffering poor is laudable. But the task is too big for ad hoc charitable efforts. The answer would lie in a full-time and fully manned authority to fight against the scourge of poverty. This civilization of ours will be condemned by posterity if we can put men on the Moon but we cannot,, at only a fraction of the cost, give enough help to the needy on earth. \n\nInequality is the bane o\u00a3 human society. Democracy, purportedly cherished by all, is associated with equality and equitability. While Governments are urged to be democratic, in affairs between nations democracy is noticeably absent. In the community of nations, the strongest and the richest take advantage of the weak and the poor. There is no equality there.\nThis does not harm only in the economic sense but also in the political sense. Ideologies and philosophies, as well as value systems, are forced upon weak nations in the name of democracy. Acting like fanatical religious proselytisers, the so-called champions of democracy are not averse to using undemocratic and coercive means to force their particular brand of democracy on the weak and the poor. Refusal to comply results in all kinds of economic and political arm-twisting.\nDemocracy must confer a freedom of choice. No one has a monopoly on the type of democracy that everyone should have. Certainly no one should force his own choice and interpretation on someone else. While harsh and even violent methods may be used to force a dictatorship to yield to democratic forces, it would be ' tragic if a working, prosperous, democratic nation were destroyed because some self-appointed democrat felt it was not democratic enough. This holier-than-thou attitude is out of tune with modern mores. \nThe democracies of the West were hundreds of years in the making. Do not expect colonial territories ruled autocratically for several centuries by Western democracies to become perfect democracies overnight.\nI have every confidence that this forty-third session of the General Assembly will prove to be deliberative and fruitful. The time and circumstances have never been more propitious. Our multilateral institution is riding a strong wave of credibility. If we can be weary of war and strife and ready to beat our swords into ploughshares then we can devote our collective energies to our economic and social advancement. The next, more formidable, challenge will be to see whether this institution can grapple with the issue of international economic imbalances in the context of the need for equitable resources management. It should be our concerted purpose to ensure that the last decade before we enter into the next millennium will be one of peace and construction for the benefit of all.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that we will all benefit from his experience and wisdom and that he will give our deliberations positive guidance.\nI also wish to express my appreciation to the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin, for his able presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly and the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\nOver the past few months we have seen peace initiatives in many parts of the world which have brought hope that there is a growing awareness that armed conflicts being \\\"bout only human suffering. It is generally thought that peace moves now stand a greater chance of success. This can be attributed to a large extent to the improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, \nThe signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles by the United States and the Soviet Union signalled the beginning of the peace initiatives. I should like to congratulate the leaders of both the United States and the Soviet Union on the positive lead they have given and on showing that problems and conflicts can be solved through negotiation.\nThe improvement in Soviet-American relations fostered the Accords on Afghanistan, which are a great step forward. We hope the Accords will enable the Afghan people to return from the refugee camps to Afghanistan to live in peace.\nThere has also been noticeable progress in other regions such as Cyprus, Western Sahara and New Caledonia. In southern Africa, progress towards ensuring the viable independence of Namibia must include the withdrawal of foreign troops.\nMy delegation was happy to hear the announcement by the Secretary-General of the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. We hope the difficulties in the peace negotiations can be overcome and the cease-fire will lead to a durable peace between the two countries ending the terrible bloodshed and destruction of the war, and will also ease international tension. We wish to congratulate the Secretary-General on his dedicated perseverance in the face of great difficulties in bringing about the cease-fire. We are happy that both Iran and Iraq realize the futility of continuing this senseless and tragic war.\nThe appearance of peace initiatives in many parts of the world has brought the United Nations once again to the centre of the stage where it rightly belongs. Through the personal dedication and untiring hard work of the Secretary-General, and the continued support of Members of this Organization, the United Nations flag is once again seen as a symbol of our hope for a future in which we can all enjoy peace and security. \nThis development pleases my delegation. The effectiveness of the United Nations depends on its Members, \\\"today we see the growing willingness of Member countries to turn to the United Nations to resolve their conflicts rather than to continue with armed hostility. We believe the United Nations can carry out its tasks as required by the Charter. It is of particular Importance to us, as a small country, that this pattern of resolving conflicts be followed peacefully through the United Nations rather than by military force. \nHowever, many long-standing problems still remain. The Palestinian people continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination and independence, which prevents them from returning to their homeland. Israel's policy of aggression and expansion in the occupied territories has further worsened the conflict. The ongoing uprising in the occupied territories should convince Israel that its occupation of the Palestinian lands can only bring insecurity and instability, both in the region and in Israel itself.\nIsrael cannot for ever deny the Palestinians their inalienable right to a homeland or remain hopeful that the Palestinians will one day just accept its ~ rule. For this reason, my delegation supports the convening of the International Conference on the Middle East with the participation of the P\u0141O as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The Conference will, we hope, find a just, lasting and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nIn South Africa, the apartheid system of the racist regime in Pretoria has yet to be dismantled, despite the many international condemnations of the inhuman racist policies involving terror and suffering for the black population of South Africa and the neighbouring countries, we therefore call upon the international community to continue to apply pressure - political and economic - on South Africa so that its apartheid policies can be dismantled and that justice may prevail.\nIn our region, there have been hopeful signs that the Kampuchean problem can be resolved. For the first time, the four Kampuchean factions and representatives of concerned countries in the region met face to face in Bogor, Indonesia. The Jakarta Informal Meeting was a breakthrough and we hope it will lead to further meetings in order that the question of the foreign occupation of Kampuchea may be resolved. My delegation has always maintained that a comprehensive political \nSettlement cannot be achieved as long as foreign forces still remain in Kampuchea. I therefore call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea so that the process of national reconciliation among all Kampucheans under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk can be promoted.\nFor 40 years the Korean Peninsula has remained tense owing to the conflict between the two Koreas. Brunei Darussalam is hopeful that the recent dialogue and initiatives by the two countries will bring about peace and stability leading eventually to national reunification. We also wish to renew our support for the admission of the Republic of Korea as a Member of the United Nations, if it so desires, in conformity with the principle of universal of membership of the United Nations.\nIt is tragic that this Organization should face severe financial problems at a time when it can make such a valuable contribution to peace. The financial crisis that threatens the United Nations is now having a crippling effect on its ability to perform.\nNone of us would like to see the United Nations reduced to bankruptcy and oblivion. On the contrary, we wish to see the United Nations strong and capable of meeting the challenges of today. A clear demonstration by all Members of their political support for the United Nations through the paying of their assessed contributions remains the only way of avoiding a position of weakness. In my delegation's view, we owe it to this and coming generations to sustain this Organization in order to ensure the survival of mankind in peace.\nToday the world situation is more hopeful than it was a year ago and one message is clear, namely, that all signatories to the United Nations Charter must adhere to its basic principles. Furthermore, at a time when there are greater chances for peace, it is important that we should let the voice of the United Nations be heard. Ms must ensure a peaceful world for all of us to live in.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first congratulate the President on his election  which was capable and well-deserved, it redounds as much to his own personal credit as to Argentina's contribution and role in the United Nations. I record also our deep appreciation of the resolute and efficient leadership provided to the forty-second session by his predecessor Kr. Peter Florin.\nOur tributes extend to our Secretary-General for his patient and persistent diplomacy, His single-minded efforts to forge \u0430 greater solidarity among nations and a convergence of interests on the vital issues of peace, stability and development deserve our praise.\nThe concrete manifestation of his contribution has been the decision of the Nobel Committee to award its Peace Prise to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. We join in the praise accorded to those courageous men and women, who have contributed so meaningfully to the cause of peace. Bangladesh is proud to be part of this process. I reiterate my Government\u2019s determination to continue to contribute to this noble endeavour.\nThe Charter was based on the yearning of mankind for a safer \u03bd more equitable and prosperous world bound together by the inherent interdependence and sense of humanity. For Bangladesh that vision remains real. We believe that it is achievable, and we reaffirm our total commitment to it. It is for this reason that we welcome the resurgent public interest in the United Nations. The solid achievement of the recent past - progress in regional security issues, advances towards nuclear-arms control provides hope for human dignity - are but some of the hard-won fruits of the painstaking efforts of the United Nations over the decades. Propelling them was the push to pursue, not individual, but global interests, to emphasize unequivocally that security is indivisible, that military solutions are not viable, that the self-perpetuating arms race is insupportable in cost and Incalculable In danger, and that prosperity cannot be achieved at the expense of others.\nThere is a collective awareness today that we have entered a new phase and pattern of international relations, promoted by dialogue and detente among the big Powers, by the emergence of a new multipolarity on the international economic plane, by a greater tolerance for diversity in socio-economic and political systems.\nIn the face of this convergence of Interests the United Nations must seize the Initiative to forge practical agreements through dialogue and negotiation. It must. Indeed, go beyond and expand its undertakings to bring together the capacities of nations from the good of mankind, for the common benefit of all. As the Prime Minister of Canada emphasized, in this still new age the differences dividing us are less important than the dangers we must face together. Concrete acts which make our world more secure must be matched by tangible commitment to reduce poverty in the developing world and to protect our common environment.\nThis potential for concentrating the combined efforts of the International community in the service of humanity has particular relevance for Bangladesh. The Inextricable link between poverty, environment, human health and the economy is best illustrated in our immediate predicament. The worst flood in living memory overran Bangladesh this year. It has come in the wake of the disaster cyclone of 1985 and the floods of 1987. These calamities have exposed the total vulnerability of our economy and environment to destructive forces of nature beyond our capacity to control or effectively mitigate. Their cause lies as much in the impact of nature as in the nature of poverty. The statistics of disaster in Bangladesh have always been terrifying in their intensity. They have literally anaesthetized belief in the true extent of their enormity. Nevertheless, they are real and compounded by cumulative accretion.\nThe international community's response has been one of heart-warming spontaneity. I express on behalf of the Government and the people of Bangladesh our deepest gratitude to all donor countries, to the heads of international organizations, as well as those of United Nations specialized agencies, to numerous non-governmental organizations and to those thousands of individuals and groups that rushed to our assistance in our hour of maximum need.\nOur particular thanks go to the Secretary-General, who acted quickly in sending his Special Representative, Mr. Muhamed Essaafi, to serve as co-ordinator of United Nations agencies in the field and to mobilize their activities for purposeful and unified intervention by the United Nations.\nThere was optimism this year that, despite the vicissitudes caused by last year's floods, genuine progress was being made towards the achievement of a 6 per cent growth target, in comparison to the 2.5 per cent flood-depressed growth reached in 1937. Significant recovery had taken place in the agricultural sector. Following the 1988 floods our plans have gone awry. Given the already stringent adjustments made in the Annual Development Plan, the ability to manoeuvre is severely constrained, accompanied by the continuing need to pare our deficit budget, realign our balance Of payments and reduce external debt, which now totals 311 billion. The overall macro-economic picture is one of uncertainty, with the projection of growth for this year dramatically scaled down from 6 per cent to 2 per cent.\nSeveral Important lessons emanate from our experience. The first is that such disasters hove long ceased to be viewed in the context of humanitarian relief. They constitute an insurmountable burden on the economy and development plans of a country, causing irrecoverable setbacks in growth and necessitating impossible adjustments. The need for sustained development assistance over the long term is vital. The second lesson is that the link between economic and social development and the need for environmental supportive growth strategies is no longer subject to academic debate. It has become a bounden reality, despite the recognized complexities in balancing priorities.\nMany of these catastrophes could not have been prevented now or in the immediate future in the absence of in-depth study of the cumulative factors that cause them and of massive investment over time to remedy them. It has now been widely acknowledged that there are too many aspects for any single country or even groups of countries to be able to deal with effectively. They need a global reach and outlook, supplemented by regional cooperative efforts.\nThe President of Bangladesh has appealed to the international community to assist Bangladesh in seeking a permanent solution to the problem. In doing so he has re-elaborated a comprehensive national programme to recuperate from the devastation caused by floods, cyclones and drought that now appear to have become a persistent visitation.\nThe programme includes, inter alia;\nBroad-based institutional arrangements and standing operational procedures to be activated throughout the country at the immediate onset of a disaster. They include contingency plans for pre-positioning stocks of essential supplies, in particular food grains, medicine, transport and construction materials.\nImmediate rehabilitation measures to restore flood-stricken people to normal life by concentration on such priority areas as agricultural recovery, supply of key inputs of seeds, fertilizer and irrigation; infrastructural repairs, particularly in communications and housing, and restoration of health and sanitation facilities.\n- Medium-term measures for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the economy and infrastructure, with special emphasis on disaster preparedness and preventive schemes. A factor requiring major adjustment would be to change the cropping pattern from dependence on the monsoon crop to emphasis on enhancing the winter crop.\nAs we grapple with the gigantic task of recovery we are conscious that remedies extend far beyond our individual capacity. Our location in the delta of a vast flood plan, on a parcel of land barely above sea-level, places us permanently on the receiving end of calamities caused as much by nature as the environmental depredations of man. Recurring floods in India and the devastation of earthquakes and landslides in Nepal compound the impact of these disasters on Bangladesh in the monsoon season as rampaging waters and billions of tons of silt are carried down by the rivers that criss-cross our country. In the dry season, scarce water resources needed by hundreds of millions of people along the Gangetic plain are squeezed to a trickle by the time they reach Bangladesh, exacerbating the consequences of drought and raising the annual spectre of famine.\nAs we look towards approaches for a permanent solution, the primary imperative will be to harness regional co-operation among all our concerned neighbours with a view to arriving at coherent and well co-ordinated policies and plans to our mutual benefit. This needs to be backed by international support and intervention. A vital necessity is the stimulation of expert studies and feasibility reports through collation and synthesis of existing materials and through collective exchange of ideas and forward projection of practical remedies. The President of Bangladesh has already initiated the process through direct contact with the leaders of our regional neighbours and through communications with the heads of international organizations and financial institutions, including those in the United Nations system.\nBangladesh has closely co-operated and co-ordinated its activities with Mr. M'haroed Essaafi and the United Nations agencies in the field in the preparation of a report to be submitted to the Secretary--General to elicit international assistance. We extend to him and his colleagues our heartfelt thanks for their dedication and commitment. It is our hope that a special meeting will be convened at this session of the Assembly of Member States, agencies and organs of the United Nations system and international economic and financial institutions to deal comprehensively with this issue.\nThe experience of Bangladesh serves dramatically to highlight a growing crisis affecting developed and developing countries alike. Desertification, soil erosion, deforestation, swollen cities and giant spill-off s of pollutants, acid rain and the dumping of toxic wastes are all symptoms of this crisis. Some are the consequences of poor people seeking to survive, others of the pursuit of economic growth at any cost.\nRemedial actions have been set in train, but much more needs to be done urgently. Conferences on various aspects have been convened or are under preparation. Formal instruments have been adopted, others are being formulated, including contemplated guidelines for environmental codes of conduct. This momentum has to be maintained. It is only fitting that the United Nations has declared the decade of the 19SOs as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. Bangladesh believes that the time is indeed ripe for the holding of an environmental summit at the highest level, perhaps as a special session of the General Assembly.\nIt is thus with a sense of acute foreboding that we turn to review the world economy. We share the growing anxiety over what appears to be a diminution of interest in the cause of economic development, a cause fuelled over three decades by the United Nations that embraces the twin objectives of promoting equitable growth and alleviating poverty.\nWe find today that the gap between the rich and the poor has inexorably widened. The critical motors for raising world standards of living ~ economic growth, finance, trade and resource transfers - are all stalling. Their dimensions have been spelled out in numerous reports of the United Nations and pin-pointed in the statements of speakers before me. This much is true\u00b7, that developing countries remain prisoners to a system where external markets, terms of trade and interest rates greatly influence their economic fate and remain outside their control.\nDeveloped countries continue to resist negotiation on the critical issues of trade, finance, debt and development in any forum controlled by the developing countries. The resulting stalemate has exacerbated the adverse international climate and is yet to be broken.\nThe impact on the poorest of the poor, the least developed countries, has been devastating. The main goals of the 1981 Substantial New Programme of Action remain a distant ideal with little hope of reaching the main target of increasing official development assistance to 0.15 per cent. Per capita incomes are continuing to fall. External indebtedness has increased dramatically. Agricultural productivity has fallen far below the 4 per cent growth targets envisaged. Given rapid population growth, this has meant a continuing decline in per capita food production, the most serious challenge facing these countries in the coming decade.\n\nThe African situation is a continuing case in point. Despite efforts to carry out adjustments in their national economic policies, most African countries have found little respite from hard climatic conditions and the adverse international economic environment. Sustained and timely commitment to the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 must be maintained.\nThe hope remains that we will be able to reverse the North-South polarization and reinvigorate the process of constructive dialogue. It arises from the practical reality that for as long as the socio-economic policies of the developed countries remain incompatible with the interests of the developing world, the goal of sustained and durable growth of the world economy will remain illusive. Significant opportunities to turn these hopes into practical reality in the years ahead the 1990 conference in Paris on the least developed countries, the formulation of the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade and the Montreal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Ministers to review the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are but a few examples. Equally important are follow-up measures for a growth-oriented debt strategy linking debt service to the creation of viable conditions for development, the convening of an international conference on money and finance for development, and efforts to stem the reverse transfers of resources that continue to impoverish the developing countries.\nWhile gaping holes continue to riddle the fabric of world peace, a painstaking patchwork process has begun. The rapprochement of the two major Powers has had a beneficial spin-off on a wide variety of problems areas hitherto anchored in attrition.\nThe cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the initiation of direct political talks under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General provide hope that a common understanding will be readied on the previsions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), opening the way for a just and lasting solution.\nForward  movement is discernible in Kampuchea following Viet Kan's announcement of the phased withdrawal of its troops. Regional efforts initiated by the Jakarta Informal Meeting to end the impasse have contributed to the feasibility of a comprehensive political settlement based on the declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea. Bangladesh looks forward to the time when we can see firmly established again a neutral, independent and non-aligned Afghanistan. We are already witnessing the phased withdrawal of foreign troops, and we support the strict and effective implementation of other aspects of the historic Geneva Accords of 14 April 1988. These constitute an essential prerequisite for a comprehensive settlement that would, inter alia, enable the return of Afghan refugees to their homeland in safety and honour, and allow the Afghan people to exercise their inherent right to determine their own destiny and choose their own Government.\nThere appears to be a more receptive climate in Western Sahara for an end to the conflict, with the acceptance by the parties of the peace plan submitted jointly by the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (0\u0428) and the Secretary-General. We hope that the essential modalities governing a cease-fire and a referendum will soon be worked out.\nThe leaders of the two Cypriot communities have also agreed to resume dialogue without pre-conditions and to attempt to achieve by June next year a negotiated settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus problem. We hail these developments, as we do the signs of the renewal of talks between the two Koreas, and progress towards peace in the Horn of Africa. The willingness of the leaders of Chad and Libya to resolve their dispute by peaceful means marks the end of acute tension in yet another area. We are encouraged by recent diplomatic activity in southern Africa and Angola, which has increased the prospects of early independence in Namibia. As a member of the Council for Namibia, Bangladesh has no need to reiterate its consistent stand. We have already indicated our willingness to participate directly in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia, for which contingency plans are already being drawn up, in pursuance of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nVital breakthroughs towards peace have thus been made. Many problems, however, remain mired in intractability.\nThe situation in the Middle East is intolerable. Continuation of the status quo is illegal and counter-productive with regard to peace. The Palestinian intifadah, in the teeth of brutal repression, is glaring testimony to its outright rejection. Peace in the Middle East can be guaranteed only by a comprehensive, just and lasting solution based on the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Bangladesh endorses the core conditions laid down in the Fez plan of 1982 and the decision adopted by the extraordinary Arab summit in Algiers in June this year. We fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to pursue the convening of an international peace conference, with the full and independent participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (\u0420LO) as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nThe human tragedy in South Africa continues to unfold in the vicious cycle of resistance, retaliation and oppression Imposed by the brutal apartheid regime. Its destructive consequences have spilled across the frontiers of South Africa and have been manifested by repeated acts of aggression, sabotage and destabilization. The front-line States which are the major victims need sustained support to counter the effect of economic strangulation and political disruption. We join in the call for the release of Nelson Mandela; a first step towards the inevitable \u2013 the dismantling of apartheid. In the face of South Africa's continued intransigence, we fully support the call for comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the racist regime.\nWe are meeting in the wake of the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. Though its outcome fell short of the adoption of a final document by consensus, it represented a significant advance in increasing awareness of the crucial issues involved and identifying areas for progress towards a negotiated settlement. Surrounding the session was the hope generated by the historic breakthrough in the field of nuclear-arms control by the signing and implementation of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and the understanding reached between the signatories that they would strive for a 50 per cent reduction of strategic nuclear weapons.\nBangladesh's position on these Issues was elaborated at length at the third special session on disarmament, and I wish merely to sum up its main content.\nThe overall goal of general and complete disarmament within a comprehensive framework of negotiations must be pursued simultaneously with efforts to resolve regional conflicts, promote socio-economic development, and build up confidence and trust among regional neighbours.\nDisarmament Is a joint undertaking of all States, and not the exclusive responsibility of the two biggest Powers. It is for this reason that we have strongly advocated an increase in the membership of the Conference on Disarmament to represent all shades of opinion. Further progress in nuclear disarmament remains an imperative, in recognition of the obvious truth that more weapons do not mean more security. Dependence on the doctrine of deterrence is misleading. Reliance on nuclear leverage can only perpetuate a community of fear.\nWe have rejected the nuclear alternative and have therefore adhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We support all measures, partial or otherwise, that could promote disarmament and deter the horizontal spread of the arms race, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Immediate priorities call for the completion of the convention banning the production and use of chemical weapons, the imperative necessity of a comprehensive test-ban treaty, control of conventional-arms transfer, particularly in conflict situations, and the means to strengthen verification, including an integrated multilateral verification system within the United Nations framework.\nWe remain convinced that what is really threatening peace and stability is the dice incidence of poverty, hunger and destitution existing in our world. This has been exacerbated by the channelling of vast resources for the purposes of destruction, not amelioration, of the well-being of peoples. The adverse environmental impact of those unnecessary arsenals, both in terms of materials and resources expended on their production and in terms of the dangerous consequences of their use, cannot be minimized. In the nuclear context it embraces the content of all life on our planet.\nWe have passed through an anxious phase when the very viability of the United Nations has been seriously questioned. The catch-phrase was \\\"the erosion of multilateralism.\\\" That loss of confidence in the United Nations was attributed to disparate reasons as much political as administrative and financial. Assertions of the so-called, tyranny of the majority, mutual accusations of repetitive and hardened postures, of outdated Illusions and outmoded attitudes and attempts to preserve privileged positions - all these confined to create a picture of multilateralism under concerted attack. Since then, there has been a fundamental re-examination of the United Nations functioning and role. Concentrated reforms have been affected with a view to improving administrative efficiency and to tightening financial stringency. Those steps were accompanied by measures to streamline the capacity of the United Nations to find integrated solutions to the problems of social and economic development. We believe that process must be continued in a spirit of practicability and accommodation.\nEven as the crucial peace-Making and peace-keeping role of the United Nations is beginning to win back essential credibility for the world body, a host of new and mushrooming problems such as drugs, terrorism, threats to the environment, problems that respect no international boundaries, have further underscored its relevance and importance. They are global problems that call for global solutions. They cannot be dealt with in isolation. The future is fast impacting on the present at a rate of acceleration that has rendered obsolete old values, old perceptions and concepts of space and time. Together, they pose new challenges; they call for new perspectives and for a radical change of outlook on the part of world leaders.\nThe United Nations remains the only viable repository for pooling the world's talent, intelligence, expertise and, most important of all, its concern and compassion. Support for the United Nations is no longer an exercise in idealism. It has become a practical necessity, a hard reality. It is in recognition of that fact that Bangladesh has reposed its total confidence and commitment in the world body.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt is with satisfaction, relief and also, justifiably, great expectations, that people are becoming aware of encouraging changes in the course of international events. Tensions and confrontation have diminished, and an auspicious trend has set in.\nFor the first time in history a start has been made with real disarmament in one area. With a sense of relief the world is experiencing the destruction of highly sophisticated nuclear weapons as a result of the Treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States of America.\nIt\u00b7 does indeed enhance confidence to see that political reason and a sense of political responsibility, as well as an awareness of the fact that the existence of nuclear weapons of mass destruction has changed the world, can overcome outmoded ways of thinking and acting dictated by deterrence, with all its attendant risks.\nPolitical dialogue has been revived, and is yielding encouraging results. There has been a noticeable upswing in efforts to settle peacefully the complex, protracted and costly regional conflicts and for the first time solutions are in sight. Even though they are only the beginning of a torn for the better, these processes open up greater opportunities for action by the United Nations.\nAll this indicates that efforts with a view to d\u00e9tente and disarmament are worthwhile, that a turn for the better is feasible. In this context, the highest representative of the German Democratic Republic, Erich Honaker, noted during his recent visit to the Soviet Union that through its predictable and constructive policies, and with much initiative, the German Democratic Republic had a share in the most recent encouraging developments. We went on to say that natters of particular concern to the German Democratic Republic, as regards the future, were a secure peace and a turning away from confrontation in international relations and towards co-operation. \nTo be realistic though, it should be noted that the situation in the world is still complex and contradictory. Mountains of weapons, both nuclear and conventional, keep on growing: nuclear-weapon tests are continuing, new types of arms are being tested and put into production. Plans for the weaponization of outer space have not been abandoned. Current military spending around the world amounts to a sum equivalent to the material damage caused by the two world wars put together.\nMany scourges, hunger, disease, illiteracy, pollution of the environment, and underdevelopment, to mention only a few, are increasingly assuming proportions that make them a threat to mankind. Global catastrophes, whether of a military, economic, ecological or other nature, continue to be conceivable as long as the means for their prevention fall victim to arms policies for the sake of profit. We subscribe to the view that, not only must no hiatus be allowed to occur now in the disarmament negotiations, but there is a real need for further results, for only in this way is it possible for immense resources to be released to help resolve, or at least mitigate, mankind's global problems.\nMore than 30 years ago, when the cold war was pushing the world to the brink of a \\\"hot\\\" war, Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein demanded, on the eve of the founding of the Pugwash Movement\u00b7.\n\\\"We must learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are such steps\u00b7, the question we have to ask ourselves is: What step can be taken to prevent a military contest of which the issue must be disaster for all parties?\\\"\nSince then, these perceptions have been shared worldwide. It is true that, in the nuclear age, violence, war and confrontation have become unsuitable means of politics. Security can no longer be based on mountains of weapons, or mutual deterrence. Deterrence means - otherwise it would not be credible - perpetuation of the arms race. Deterrence counts on fear, engenders distrust and it can fail - not only in the event of irrational action but also because it is becoming more and more difficult for man to manage the highly sophisticated weapons systems.\nThe alternative is a security that counts on political, economic, ecological, cultural and humanitarian co-operation, along with the systematic diminution of the military factor. This concept can transform the shared risk in which - like it or not - the international community finds itself at present, into a fabric of security shared by all nations.\nIt is encouraging that the debate of this vital question has begun in East and West, and North and South. Let me call to mind the proposal of socialist States for a comprehensive system of international peace and security, and the proposals and ideas presented here by the Foreign Minister of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Let me recall the Six-Nation Initiative to build a new concept of global security without nuclear weapons, India's initiative to create a system of comprehensive global security, and the ideas of many Western European politicians to establish co-operative security structures and co-operative solutions.\n, \u00b7\u00b7' -\nA\u00cd\u00cd these endeavours to introduce a new concept of international relations meet with the support of the socialist German State. The conditions have now become/mature enough to make it possible to push for results in the dialogue on -security policies in the United Nations.\nAdmittedly, \u0105 world without weapons is still a distant hope. But measures for arms limitation and disarmament are the only means towards this end. The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - has proved that this road is practicable. Relevant proposals to this end were submitted by the Warsaw Treaty States at the session of the Political Consultative Committee of the Alliance last July. They envisage the following priorities: conclusion of a treaty on a 50 per cent reduction in Soviet and American strategic offensive arsenals together with strict adherence to the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, to be followed by further steps to reduce the arsenals of nuclear weapons to the point of their elimination\u00b7, a complete and general ban on nuclear-weapon tests and, as a step towards this goal, agreements between the USSR and the United States on decreasing the yield and number of their nuclear explosions; prevention of an arms race in outer space - to this end, a ban on anti-satellite weapons, the establishment of an inspectorate to observe all space launches, and the creation of an organization for the protection of outer space; a ban on chemical weapons\u00b7, radical reductions in armed forces and in conventional armaments in Europe; the inclusion of naval forces in the disarmament negotiations; prevention of the military abuse of the latest scientific and technological achievements; establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace - wherever possible - as important steps on the road to general and complete disarmament; mutual observation of the implementation of commitments or of arms postures - which means real control through effective verification.\nThat will reduce mistrust, help gradually to overcome the image of the \\\"enemy\\\", and finally generate confidence and therewith a readiness for co-operation. The positive experiences resulting from the Stockholm Declaration are an encouragement in this regard.\nThe German Democratic Republic shares the view of the Six-Nation Initiative that it would be helpful to set up a multilateral verification system within the framework of the United Nations. \nRegrettably, peace cannot be taken for granted, least of all in Europe, a continent which has lived through more years of war than of peace. For that reason more than 40 years of peace - the longest period of peace in Europe to date - should not make us forget that this peace is fragile because it is built on arms. In Europe there is a concentration of destructive military capabilities unparalleled anywhere else in the world. For this continent, where two devastating world wars have begun in this century, disarmament is a vital question, indeed a question of survival. On the other hand, Europe is the continent where the Helsinki Final Act and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process show that peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems is feasible and of undisputed benefit to all the parties involved. \nAs for the remaining tactical nuclear weapons, their inclusion in the disarmament process in Europe should be called for most emphatically. The Berlin Conference on Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones, where the broadest spectrum of peace activists met for an all-embracing, equal and open dialogue, has strengthened our resolve to pursue the proposal, which we submitted jointly with the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, for denuclearization in Central Europe.\nAs for chemical weapons, a global ban should be instituted as soon as possible. Any methods - no matter who proposes them - will receive our support if they take us all closer to that goal with no further loss of time. In this respect, we welcome the new proposals put forward by President Francois Mitterrand. A chemical-weapon-free zone in Europe should be helpful in this context.\nI wish to recall here the offer made to the Federal Republic of Germany by the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia to make an immediate start on negotiations to free the territories of these States, or keep their territories free, from chemical weapons. The parts of the Convention on a comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapons that have already been agreed in Geneva - notably, those on verification - could be tested in a practical way in such a zone. Other steps conducive to a final agreement would be an exchange of data on chemicals to be banned under the Convention, as well as model inspections at production sites of the chemical industry. The German Democratic Republic has made relevant data available, and other States remain called upon to do the same.\nThe States parties to the Warsaw Treaty strongly support substantial reductions of armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe - that is, from the Atlantic to the Urals. The relevant three-stage proposal that they submitted in Warsaw takes account of the other side's ideas and could well provide a basis for negotiations, which could be opened as early as this year.\nThe Warsaw Treaty States desire a situation in which any surprise attack or operation would be impossible, only the forces and equipment required for defence would be retained. That presupposes that this is the very objective of the military doctrines of both alliances.\nThe plan to establish a zone of confidence and security in Central Europe, put forward by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Milos Jakes, like Vojciech Jaruzelski's memorandum on arms cuts in Central Europe, is an immediately practicable step, provided that there is a readiness in principle for confidence-building and arms limitation. The creation of a European centre to reduce the risk of war in Europe, or of a median ism for peaceful crisis management in Central Europe - the installation of a \\\"hot line\\\" between Berlin, Bonn and Prague - or of mixed observation posts at strategically important points, would promote confidence-building and disarmament.\nThis and other material is what we could use, beginning at once, to build, brick by brick, the house of Europe in the spirit of the Helsinki Final Act.\nIt is with this very goal in mind that we strive to conclude the Vienna follow-up meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers as soon as possible with a substantive document that is balanced in all parts. This would make it possible to start, as early as this year, the generally desired negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe and to agree on further confidence-building measures.\nThe existence of two sovereign German States, independent of each other and with different social systems, is a constituent element of a peaceful European order. As far as relations between them are concerned, there is something I wish to underline it is crucial that they be not a source of tensions and threats affecting the relationship between States in Europe, but rather a constructive factor in East-West relations. It is in the hands of the two German States to make their mutual relationship a desirable model of peaceful coexistence between States with different social systems. This should be possible if both sides take account of the existing realities and display political will, reason and realism. Such is the way to fulfil the obligation, undertaken by the two States, that never again must war, but only peace, start from German soil - an obligation reaffirmed by General Secretary Erich Honecker and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the joint communiqu\u00e9 published when the German Democratic Republic's highest representative paid an official visit to the Federal Republic about a year ago. The German Democratic Republic is ready to pursue this policy at any time.\nThanks to a calmer international situation, thanks to initial successes in arms limitation and disarmament, and, not least, thanks to the improved relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, conditions have become more favourable for the settlement of international conflicts as well. Progress on such problems, crucial as it is for world peace, is evident indeed. It confirms that dialogue, willingness to compromise, a sense of reality and perceptiveness are the only way towards just, comprehensive and lasting solutions. If positive results are to be achieved, all States should be committed to this aim, for all States, whether or not involved directly, are in any case directly affected. For these reasons it is both their right and their obligation to act rather than to remain aloof.\nAt the same time it has become obvious that the United Nations can assist in the peaceful settlement of international conflicts if and when all States, but chiefly the sides to the conflicts themselves, support the Organization in this effort. Our particular acknowledgement and gratitude go to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for the numerous initiatives he has taken. We extend to him our sincere congratulations on the high distinction of the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, and encourage him to persist in his efforts. \nThe Geneva agreements have been an important step towards bringing calm to the situation in and around Afghanistan. The Afghan people needs peace and national reconciliation to engage in reconstruction. For that, all sides must strictly fulfil the obligations they have undertaken. Externally supported terror and all kinds of foreign intervention must be discontinued.\nSecurity Council resolution 598 (1987) has proved to be a sound basis for settling the tragic and costly fighting between Iran and Iraq. The negotiations that have been started must now convert the truce into a lasting peace. Maximum restraint by the parties directly involved in the conflict and the withdrawal of foreign naval forces could have a favourable bearing on the peace process.\nAs far as the situation on the Korean peninsula is concerned, the German Democratic Republic supports the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for safeguarding peace and detente in that region.\nThe negotiations between Angola, Cuba and South Africa and the agreements reached so far in regard to attaining Independence for Namibia should be viewed as an important step towards a political solution to the conflict in southern Africa. Implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) continues to rank high on the agenda. But so long as apartheid persists in South Africa, destabilization and aggression will threaten the States of the region. Therefore, comprehensive and binding sanctions against the racist regime are a matter of necessity. Apartheid cannot be reformed: it must be abolished. Let me repeat on this Day of Solidarity with South African Political Prisoners: Nelson Mandela and all other patriots must be free at last.\t.\nWe welcome the positive developments on the Horn of Africa, above all the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Somalia and the understanding between Ethiopia and Sudan. \nThere is quasi-unanimity that an international Middle East conference would be the best way to find a comprehensive, just and hence lasting settlement to the protracted and extremely complex conflict in that region. It therefore would seem to be fitting for the Security Council to prepare a negotiating r ach an ism, at the level of foreign ministers if necessary. All interested parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO) and Israel, must of course participate in such a conference, to be held under the auspices of the United Nations. The Arabic \\\"salaam* should be answered with a \\\"shalom\\\" from Tel Aviv.\nThe German Democratic Republic emphatically supports the Guatemala plan for peace in Central America. The Nicaraguan Government has been doing all it can to implement that plan fully. It is for the contras and the Power that supports them to go their part of the way towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Outside interference in Nicaragua must come to an end. The same applies to Panama.\nThe Jakarta Informal Meeting should be viewed as an expression of the endeavours of the Indochinese States to settle the Kampuchean conflict by political means. May the agreed consultations and the forthcoming talks between Chairman Hun Sen of the Council of Ministers and Prince Norodom Sihanouk be successful.\nA source of hope is the resumption of negotiations between the leaders of the two communities towards resolving the Cyprus question. The efforts being made to achieve a peaceful settlement of the problems concerning Western Sahara also meet with our support.\nFor the improvement of international relations to be enduring, united efforts are repaired, mainly for the observance of the supreme human right - the right to a life of peace. The German Democratic Republic advocates stepped-up co-operation to eliminate mass violations of human rights and to ensure implementation of all human rights - economic  social, cultural, civil and political. The lessons of the past and the responsibility for the future should be perceived as a common obligation to act against fascism and neo-fascism in all its manifestations.\nToday more than 5 billion people live on earth, and by the turn of this century their number may well exceed 6 billion. They all need employment and food; they all have a right to shelter, health care and education. The solution of these formidable problems is becoming more and more an elementary condition for the maintenance of peace and security. The growth and prosperity enjoyed by some must no longer be attained at the expense and to the detriment of other States and peoples. There is an imperative need for co-operative solutions in overcoming underdevelopment, in the democratic restructuring of international economic relations, in international trade, monetary and financial relations, the environmental sector and many other fields of human activity. The United Nations constitutes the universal framework for efforts to achieve those ends.\nIt is necessary to draft expeditiously an international development strategy for the 1990s, the special session of the General Assembly on international economic issues, to be held in the year 1990, could be useful in that regard.\nThe external-debt problems of developing countries have to be solved globally and equitably - that is, in a manner that would guarantee a future of sustained growth and social progress for those countries.\nNo doubt, a system that would warn of risk factors in the world economy could strengthen economic security. A report on this subject should be submitted to the United Nations not later than 1989 - that is, next year.\nThe Warsaw Treaty States have put forward proposals in their declaration on \\\"The impact of the arms race on the natural environment and other aspects of ecological security\\\". The United Nations certainly has a special part to play in co-ordinating the efforts in the field of ecological security. Relevant proposals which have been submitted for holding meetings in this respect under United Nations auspices have our approval.\nFor the Garman Democratic Republic 1988 means 15 years of co-operation within the United Nations. I reiterate today what the then Foreign Minister, Otto Winzer, said I5 years ago - that the socialist German State respected without any reservations the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and desired that they guide the actions of States world-wide. This State remains committed to promoting the work of the United Nations. \nThe possibilities and mechanisms available to Member States and to the Organization are not yet fully utilized. It is also crucial for the effectiveness of the United Nations that co-operation among all States on an equal basis should not be hampered by discriminatory and unjustifiable restrictions Imposed on a certain number of permanent missions and reflected in the debates in the Committee on Relations with the Host Country.\nThe prestige and authority of the United Nations have been visibly enhanced through its latest peace-making efforts. That is an encouragement to redouble our efforts for the attainment of the lofty objectives of this world Organization. The German Democratic Republic, for its part, is ready to do that.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe hope placed in the United Nations, which for a time had given way to indifference and mistrust, if not scorn, is being reborn. There is a new course in international relations that bodes well fear the co-operation envisaged in the Charter. As the forty-third session of the General Assembly begins, ray country, the Central African Republic, cannot but welcome these developments.\nOur task is to consolidate and develop this new approach, and the international community has great need of the vast experience and personal qualities of the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Dante Caputo, who can count on the co-operation and support of the delegation of the Central African Republic. In addition to conveying to him the warm congratulations of His Excellency General Andre Kolingba, President of the Republic, Head of State and founding Chairman of the Central African Democratic Assembly, I wish to pay a tribute to his country, Argentina, with which the Central African Republic maintains excellent relations of co-operation.\nI wish also to express to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, my delegation's satisfaction at the way in which he fulfilled his responsibilities.\nThe rebirth of trust and of the prestige of our Organization is the result, of course, of the will of Member States, but also of the faith and the patient, persevering action of the Secretary-General. The developments with regard to certain conflicts confirm this. The Central African Republic reiterates its expression of encouragement to Mr. Perez de Cuellar. \nSimilarly my delegation welcomes the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations. That is eloquent proof of our Organization's decisive action for peace and of its regained credibility.\nThe present international situation and the work of the Organization are being evaluated now in the context of a certain element of detente and a new dynamic of dialogue and search for compromise. These developments, historic in themselves, should not be interpreted as being fortuitous - and here we agree with the Secretary-General, who makes this point in his report on the work of the Organization for this year. They are the result of an awakening on the part of Member States to their interdependence and community of interests, which commit them to exploiting to the utmost the Charter and what it contains in order to seek, together, solutions to their problems. They stem from the instinct of preservation - a salutary reflex which in times of danger requires that the common values essential to the cohesion and survival of the group be defended.\nIndeed, it is as if suddenly States, and particularly the great Powers, have finally realized that we were on the verge of catastrophe\u00b7, that we could not go on arming ourselves indefinitely without grave danger to mankind that freedom and the right of peoples to self-determination and development are common values and causes that are essential to all peoples, all States, and that cannot be constantly flouted or neglected.\nThese developments stem also from the failure of the way& and means to which States have hitherto resorted to find - in a fragmented or even selfish or unilateral way - overall solutions to problems that are, however, of common interest. A brief review of recent events on the international scene suffices to demonstrate that this new approach, which consists in real participation by Member \nStates in the search for solutions to the problem confronting the international community can bring about, if not a settlement, at least an easing of certain conflicts the persistence of which was rendering the balance of peace ever more precarious.\nIt is to this that we owe the felicitous outcome of the situation in the Gulf region between Iran and Iraq, and the Central African Republic welcomes this outcome. The negotiations now going on under the auspices of the Secretary-General with a view to guaranteeing the consolidation of this achievement, in accordance with the spirit and the letter of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), could not have any other outcome. My delegation hopes for the rapid success of these negotiations and the restoration of a climate of trust between the two brother countries: Iran and Iraq.\nWith regard to southern Africa, while no final agreement has yet been reached, we place a great deal of hope in the negotiations under way - in Brazzaville among other places - and in all the individual or concerned action being taken at the moment. Indeed, for the first time, there is now a momentum that could bring about peace in that region. The determination of the parties to find a compromise that honours justice and peace is welcomed by the Central African Republic, which very much hopes that this momentum will accelerate, through the implementation of Security Council resolution 43S (1978), the process of Namibia's accession to independence  will prevail upon South Africa to undertake the true democratization of South African society through the elimination of apartheid and the recognition of the political rights of the blade majority) and will make possible a climate of confidence among the States of the regime.\nFurthermore, we are pleased with the turn of events in the Western Saharan situation. That has been made possible by the concrete action of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, which has led to the adoption of a peace plan by the interested parties. My delegation very much hopes that the application of that plan will finally bring harmony to that part of Africa.\nSimilarly, the normalization of relations between Chad and Libya which has just led - to the satisfaction of the Government of the Central African Republic - to the restoration of diplomatic relations between them should be viewed as a milestone in the efforts undertaken in all quarters to establish the conditions for the return, at last, of genuine peace in that region. It is important, nevertheless, to continue to work for a broadening of this climate of restored confidence.\nThe same co-operation among Member States which was indispensable for the settlement of certain conflicts should also be shown with a view to putting an end to the situations prevailing in the Middle East, where it is now urgent to hold this international conference which, with the participation of all the interested parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, will deal with the situation in the region - in particular the question of Palestine, which is its core in Afghanistan, where, it is true, the withdrawal of foreign forces has begun and where, by the effective application in good faith of the Geneva agreements, the right of the Afghan people to decide their destiny in a neutral and non-aligned State must be recognized; in Kampuchea, where the principles of the United Nations on this question should lay the groundwork for any solution, including the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from that territory in Central America, where the Guatemala agreement, which could establish genuine conditions for peace in the region, should produce its full effects  in the Korean peninsula, where the renewed dialogue between the parties should continue and be encouraged, not only to promote the enjoyment by the Korean people of their legitimate aspirations to independent end peaceful reunification, but also to make it possible to consider the question of the accession of Korea to the United Nations.\nFrom what I have said so far it is dear that we must increasingly engage in efforts to encourage States to find genuine political will by co-operating within the framework of the machinery they have created, not only to ensure the maintenance of peace but also to promote the socio-economic development of all parts of the world - another condition for the balance of peace.\nThis new approach - in the economic field this time - can be reflected only in the support of States that Is indispensable to the work of the United Nations, which can thus contribute to the establishment of conditions for the co-operation that is essential to the economic recovery of the least-developed parts of the world,\nNow, the condition of those parts of the world and Africa in particular, are regularly placed on the agenda of the General Assembly, efforts have been made  it is true, under the auspices of the United Nations, to engage in reflection on this question. A Programme of Action was even adopted, on the basis of mutual responsibility. We have just had a mid-term review of that Programme. At this stage, the conclusions so laboriously reached by the Ad Hoc Committee that made the review - apart from any other comments on them - gives us an exact assessment of the situation two years after the adoption of the Programme.\nThey show that the African counties, whose responsibility for the application of the Programme of Action remains paramount, have kept their commitments they have accepted enormous sacrifices and have made genuine efforts for development - efforts that, by the way, have been recognised and supported, unequally it is true, by the International community. As the Ad Hoc Committee recognises, real obstacles have been impeding the development efforts that have been undertaken. These obstacles - which relate essentially to the impact of difficult climatic conditions the collapse of the prices of commodities on which the economy of the African countries largely depends, the increase in their external debt and also in the servicing of that debt, and the inadequacy of financial firms in their direction - must be removed otherwise, these countries cannot make any progress towards development.\nHowever, the fact that the Ad Hoc Committee, at this interim stage, was able to reach agreement on the measures to be taken for the full application of the Programme of Action demonstrates the will of the African countries as well as of the international community to achieve the objectives laid down in the Programme of Action. The prospects thus opened up can lead to results only if the developed countries change their attitude and help to create a new climate of confidence in co-operation among States, particularly by trying to remove the obstacles to the development sought by their African partners. In that regard, earnings from the export of commodities should be sufficiently guaranteed so that countries would not be constantly subjected to the deleterious effects of the fluctuation in the prices of those commodities.\nPriority should be given to the adoption of sound and flexible measures to alleviate the debt burden, because debt-servicing - which in some cases, such as in the Central African Republic, has attained one third of budgetary income - is a real impediment to the process of economic development, since no resources are available for investment. \nCalling for rescheduling debts, because of its limited scope, does not make it possible to solve the structural problems which affect most African economies. That is why the international community should demonstrate a spirit of greater co-operation and solidarity, so that the measures that emerge from the forthcoming international conference on Africa's external debt will take account of the reciprocal interests of States. The action taken by Member States to contribute, jointly with the United Nations, to creating conditions for better organized co-operation in various fields will be effective only if the human dimension is taken into account as its ultimate goal. A larger measure of security and a minimum of development must, above all, mean greater security and at least a minimum standard of living foe all.\nIn the Central African Republic, under the leadership of President Andre Kolingba, the democratic institutional process begun a short time ago is now being crowned by the restoration of democracy. My country has signed various international instruments which, within the framework of the Chi toed Nations or the Organisation of African Unity, organize, govern and guarantee human rights. The protection of human rights has now become an imperative duty for the State and an obligation for the nation, because we cannot appeal for development efforts, for harmony or for peace if we do not promise man a better life. It is for man that these values must be cultivated, fostered and extended, particularly at a time when we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the universal Declaration of Human Sights.\nYes, a new hope is emerging at the end of our century, a century of profound change, of phenomenal and prodigious advances in science and technology of universal recognition that every man has a unique identity and character with regard to the values of emancipation, freedom and equality) but also a century which does not yet fully promote the achievement of these values for the benefit of mankind as a whole, as was the dream of the founding fathers of our Organization.\nCan the renaissance of hope and the new trend towards dialogue and the search for com promise be the prelude to the attainment of a world of justice, tolerance and solidarity, a world in which together we can solve the problems affecting the human condition and together provide a solution?\nIt can if we continue to show the political will to safeguard the United Nations, the indispensable framework for working together, for co-operation, for a new era of trust among States, nations and peoples.\nIt is time for all men of goodwill to unite their genius and their efforts, to speak the same language, the language of peace. Let them say no to war and no to poverty. Let their faith in the Charter of the United Nations and in a better mankind become ever more manifest.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I should like to join the previous speakers in congratulating you on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. The confidence shown in you by this body is a tribute of the international community to your vast experience, as well as to Argentina, a friendly fellow non-aligned country.\nI also wish to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, for the impeccable manner in which he discharged his tasks.\nI should also like to express our esteem for and admiration of the Secretary-General for the way he has been conducting the affairs of the United Nations. We have read his latest report with great interest. It is a masterly exposition of present predicaments and the ways to resolve them. It highlights all the international moral imperatives of our time and it provides all the main signposts for our future course.\nThe United Nations is steadily becoming the universal conscience of mankind and is serving as the framework and, at times, the referee for settling international disputes. On the solid basis of the principles enshrined in its Charter the United Nations provides the foundation and the direction for solving or forestalling international crises.\nSmall States are particularly gratified by the growing achievements of the United Nations as they regard their participation in the collective security system envisaged under the Charter to be of vital importance to them.\nThe list of problems addressed by the United Nations and its specialized agencies is long and impressive and extends beyond the realm of peace-keeping and peace-making. Its contributions in the fields of decolonization, human rights, respect for international law, the protection of the environment, the rights of women and children, the care of refugees, the fight against disease, hunger or drug abuse, economic and technical assistance, the preservation of cultural heritage, and so on, constitute important steps forward in the history of our times.\nSpeaking for Cyprus, I should like to make special mention of the continuing contribution of the Organization, and of the Secretary-General in particular, to the search for a solution to the Cyprus problem. I also gratefully acknowledge the valour and sacrifice of the united Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus for over 20 years. We are delighted at the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. We consider it a well deserved tribute to their contribution to world peace.\nThe rise in the prestige and effectiveness of the United Nations is not fortuitous. ' It has been built on the work and dedication of a great number of people. It has also been the natural and inevitable consequence of the growing interdependence and globalisation of problems, the inability of individual countries to solve them and the relative contraction of the world as a result of the technological and information revolutions. \nThe existence of a strong, generally respected and more effective United Nations is an imperative of our time. This is dictated not only by idealism but also by the enlightened self-interest of each State. The choice before us is simple. Either we support and strengthen the United Nations and its Institutions and extend the domain of international law or we opt for international anarchy.\nIn view of the improved international political climate the current session of the General Assembly acquires added significance. We hope that the spirit of compromise and flexibility observed in the last session will prevail during our current deliberations.\nHistoric changes have indeed taken place since the last session of the General Assembly. In the first place, the rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Treaty on the Elimination of intermediate-range and Shorter-range Missiles - the INF Treaty - and their continuing dialogue have greatly improved the international political climate.\nThe Geneva Accords on Afghanistan would have been unthinkable without this new climate of co-operation and flexibility. We earnestly hope that they will be fully implemented. We welcome with relief the cease-fire agreement of 20 August 1988 between Iran and Iraq, secured in the context of the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We are confident that the direct negotiations initiated under the auspices of the Secretary-General will lead to a comprehensive, just, honourable and durable resolution of this tragic conflict, whatever the temporary setbacks.\nThe wind of change blows throughout the world from South-East Asia to southern Africa, Western Sahara and Chad, bringing with it promises of hope for peace and security. We look forward to the moment when we can embrace within our member ship an independent Namibia. \nWe are painfully aware that antagonism and threats to peace still persist. The world is replete with conventional and nuclear weapons. Nuclear tests are still being conducted, the prohibition of chemical and biological weapons still eludes us whilst the demilitarization of outer space is still hotly contested.\nIn South Africa, the repugnant structures of apartheid have not yet been dismantled and the front-line States live under the constant fear of destabilization. Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners have not yet been .freed. The Palestinian people are denied their inalienable national rights and are still subjected to unceasing oppression in the occupied areas. In Central America the hopes generated by the Guatemala agreements have not materialized and the situation remains unstable. A united response is most urgently needed for a just and durable resolution of all these problems.\nThe non-aligned countries, at their Ministerial Conference held last month in Nicosia, expressed their determination to work together with the United Nations in order to meet these challenges. The Conference which was, by general agreement, a remarkable success, helped cement the unit/ and cohesion of the non-aligned countries. The steps taken for increasing the effectiveness and relevance of the Non-Aligned may errant in today's world will be of great benefit to the international community as a whole, since there is a close relationship between the concerns and the challenges facing the non-aligned countries and the United Nations. I should like, in this connection, to highlight the adoption of the Nicosia Declaration and the decision to establish a Ministerial Committee in order to examine the structural, organizational and procedural aspects of the Movement.\nIn this, the fortieth anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; I should like to re-emphasize the dedication of the Government and people of Cyprus to the principles of the Declaration and our determination to see them applied to the whole of our country and to the benefit of all its inhabitants.\nIn their long struggle for independence and unity the people of Cyprus have been looking to the United Nations for support and vindication. Ti-s \u00a1resumed dialogue initiated by the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, between myself and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, Mr. Rauf Denktash, creates new opportunities for our country. The target is to achieve a just and lasting solution of the\\\" Cyprus problem by June 1989. Doubts have been expressed as to whether it is possible to achieve a solution by that date. I am convinced that all the Pain elements of the Cyprus problem could easily be solved by that date provided that the necessary political will and good faith were exhibited on all sides. WE, for our part, are determined to work hard and with constructive goodwill towards this objective despite any obstacles or disappointments on the way.\nTo facilitate the earliest possible solution, I have repeated in the past, and 1 reiterate now, our proposal for the demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus. We propose to dismantle the military forces of the Republic if all Turkish troops and settlers withdraw and if the armed elements they have fostered are disbanded. The proposal includes the establishment of an international peace force under the auspices of the United Nations, the composition and terms of reference of which would be agreed upon and endorsed by the Security Council. \nDemilitarization would create the conditions for resolving the Cyprus problem and would provide the answer to any security concern on the pact of the Turkish Cypriots. There would be additional benefits to them in another way. We undertake to use the funds which will be saved through demilitarization for the development of areas of Cyprus which have fallen behind economically and primarily for projects which will benefit mainly the Turkish Cypriots. Part of the savings could also be used for financing the international peace force to be established.\nA just and lasting solution of the Cyprus problem is not only in the interest of the whole population of Cyprus, it would also contribute to the strengthening of peace in the Mediterranean, Progress on a just solution of the problem of Cyprus is a key to the continuation of the dialogue between Greece and Turkey.\nThe solution of the Cyprus problem is clearly outlined in the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Such a solution implies that all foreign troops and settlers are withdrawn from the island, that basic human rights are respected, that no country has a unilateral right of intervention in our affairs and that the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus ace safeguarded. We believe that, in the future federal Republic of Cyprus that we envision, all Cypriots, whether Greek or Turkish, should enjoy equality of opportunity and fundamental freedoms, including the right to develop their distinctive cultural heritages.\nIn this new and delicate phase of the Cyprus problem the Increased Interest and support of the international community will greatly enhance the prospects for its early solution.\nThough the international political climate has been improving, the global economic outlook remains uncertain. Moet developing countries still suffer from the burden of underdevelopment, while in the leant developed countries basic needs \nThe development prospects for most developing countries are aggravated by minimal, and in some cases negative, rates of economic growth, trade imbalances, low commodity prices, the external debt problem and the associate net flow of resources to the developed countries. The situation is made worse by the deterioration of the level of international economic co-operation, the stagnation of official development aid, the obstacles to access to the markets of developed countries and a series of natural disasters.\nIn the overall efforts for a fairer development of the international economy the comprehensive package of economic measures incorporated in the Nicosia Document of the Non-Aligned Foreign Ministers Conference should be the object of serious negotiations with the developed countries within the spirit of understanding and co-operation that has become more evident in recent months.\nI should like to draw attention to the enormity and the disruptive effects of the problem of the external debt owed by developing countries. The burden of external debt servicing and the reluctance of commercial banks to provide new credit are factors severely retarding the development efforts of low-income countries. It is imperative that the external debt problem become a focal point of an international development strategy.\nWithin this context, we welcome the greater understanding of the debt problem shown recently by developed countries. Notable progress has been achieved through the case-by-case approach, the greater use of debt conversion and the increasing use of secondary debt markets.\nOne of the interesting aspects of the adjustment process in international financial markets has been the acceptance by bankers of secondary market prices as low as 50 cents per dollar of debt. This suggests that the time is ripe for agreement on substantial debt write-offs. There have also been some positive developments within the United Nations system and through intergovernmental agreements. I refer in particular to the results of the Toronto Western Economic Summit Meeting and the decisions of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to proceed with the general capital increase and the enhanced structural adjustment facility respectively. The emphasis given to the need to solve the international debt problem at the recent Berlin meetings of the World Bank and IMF is another welcome development. The French Government's decision for a 30 per cent debt write-off is a move in the right direction. The same can to said about the recent willingness on the part of Japan to recycle its payment surpluses in favour of developing countries. \nA few months ago, from this very rostrum, I presented a proposal to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, with the objective of ameliorating the external debt problem of developing countries. My proposal envisaged that a considerable part of the savings arising from reduction in military expenditure by developed creditor countries should be used to establish a national fund to buy at the present discounted market rates the outstanding loans owed to the commercial banks. The idea of utilizing the savings from disarmament measures to reduce the debt burden of developing countries is still valid. The debt problem, however, is urgent. It threatens every day the welfare and the future prospects of the world's poor, and its solution cannot wait for progress on disarmament.\nI therefore propose that a practical and realistic approach for tackling the debt problem, would be to take a cue from the international financial markets and to devise solutions which utilize the present mote favourable trends. In line with my previous proposal, I would suggest that the debt problem could be tackled by the urgent establishment by each developed creditor nation of a national fund for the purpose of buying back the debts owed to commercial banks and other lending agencies at discounted market rates. The cost of these national debt relief programmes would be minimal if they were coupled with an imaginative use of tax credits. It is implied that the fund would buy the debt with tax credits offered to the creditor banks over a number of years.\nAnother major and related challenge facing the world is the eradication of hunger and malnutrition, which affects 500 million people around the world. The annual death toll from hunger is estimated at 50 million. Tragically, more than 15 million of these deaths are of Innocent children. \nHunger in the world of plenty and a time of unprecedented technological progress is an unacceptable state of affairs. We are gratified that the name of Cyprus has been associated with efforts to alleviate this problem. The Cyprus Initiative Against Hunger in the World, which was adopted at the ministerial meeting of the World Food Council held in Nicosia in May this year, provides for an urgent review of the efforts made to date and for effective new measures. The underlying motive of the Initiative is the idea that the fight against hunger cannot be waged by means of food relief aid alone. It can be waged more effectively by helping the countries concerned to develop their agriculture and produce more food in order to feed their populations. The World Food Council is presently consulting Governments and international agencies with a view to presenting an action-oriented report on the Cyprus initiative to its next ministerial meeting in Cairo next year. We hope that this important initiative will receive the support it deserves from all nations.\nFew of the problems of our time are entirely local. The universal interconnection of problems demands concerted world-wide action if global catastrophes are to be averted. The problem of the protection of the environment is a good case in point. The threats posed by selfish, short-sighted or simply ignorant environmental policies are legion. The catalogue is daunting. Pollution of the seas, rivers and soil, deforestation, desertification, the widening gap in the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect, climatic changes, depletion of irreplaceable natural resources, dumping of toxic wastes, and acid rain are some of the modern scourges that have to be addressed before they become unmanageable and before their destructive consequences become irreversible.\nParticular mention should be made of the fact that some underdeveloped countries are being used as dumping grounds for the toxic wastes of industrialized countries. This unacceptable practice should not be allowed to continue. The unsightly spectacle of ships trying to discharge their deleterious cargo on the high seas or by the shores of unsuspecting countries should galvanise us all into action for the permanent prohibition of such obscene practices.\nWhat, can we do in the face of such dangers? Echoing the Secretary-General's warnings, we would suggest putting the ecological problem high on the agenda of the United Nations. The idea of convening an international conference on environment needs to be given priority. Such a conference, apart free raising public awareness on ecological dangers, could help devise new and practical measures for addressing all related issues. It could also point to the need for elaborating the necessary laws that could form the basis for more responsible international attitudes in this field and the possible creation of a world ecological council.\nThe preservation and upgrading of the environment is in the interest of the whole world and it should therefore involve an equitable sharing of the attendant costs. For this reason we suggest that the international community make much more substantial contributions to the existing Environmental Fund, so that it may be able to achieve the compelling aims that prompted its establishment. It should be noted that contributing to this Blind should not be taken as another form of aid to the developing countries.\nThe world community is beset with problems old and new. Our most fundamental task is, of course, the extension of the frontiers of peace, security and justice in the world. Universal peace and justice may be unattainable ideals, but a world without blatant injustices should be within our reach. What is most needed for this to materialise is a clearer perception of the dangers inherent in division and strife, a better understanding of the global nature of many of our problems, an extension of and greater respect for international law and a determined move from local to global morality. The best vehicle for such a vital move is the United Nations. The future of mankind, the very possibility of life on earth, depend on such a determined move on the part of us all.\n"

This is a historic moment. The whole world expects it to lead to a new era for the peoples concerned and for the whole international community.\nIn coming to this rostrum I am deeply conscious of the great honour that, the highest authorities of my country have done me in appointing me to speak on their behalf at the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\nIt is in the nature of nations to conceive of great designs; this memorable law, of course, did not take shape at the founding of the United Nations, but found in it satisfactory expression, and today its most exalting hour has come. Rising above threats and insults, after the cataclysm of a total world war, the United Nations has succeeded in pursuing what is clearly its goal of goals\u00b7, the search for and the maintenance of International peace.\nWe are glad to see that for 43 years this goal has been achieved, and that mankind as a whole has been preserved from a total o annihilation. But this year, 1988, our Organization bears within it a magnificent hope, and all nations of the world, in trust and in confidence; are looking towards it. That hope offers our Organisation new opportunities for constructive action.\nMy delegation wishes to express its gratitude and pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his readiness and perseverance in the area of peace and international security. When we read what he has written we see that the principal organs of the United Nations have been working more and more in the way the Charter intended. As he notes, the working relationship of the Security Council and the Secretary-General has rarely, if ever, been closer. \nThe events of recent months - in regard to which we feel we must express the Congo's appreciation and indicate what our country wants for the future - have highlighted the potential of our Organization and the legitimacy of the hopes that the peoples of the world have pinned on it and on multilateralism.\nBefore I begin, however, I wish to extend to the President the very warmest congratulations of the delegation of my country to the forty-third session. Argentina, which, thanks to Mr. Caputo's remarkable qualities and high diplomatic office, has recently acceded to the eminent place it now occupies in Latin America, belongs, like my country, the Congo, to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. I note, for example, that our two countries have recently taken an active part in ensuring the success of the first meeting of States of the Zone of Peace and Co-operation of the South Atlantic, which was held in Rio de Janeiro. My delegation cannot but be delighted to see Mr. Caputo presiding over the forty-third session of the General Assembly, which will be considering, among other things, the conclusions readied at that meeting. \nI should like also to express our sincere gratitude to his predecessor. Comrade Peter Florin, President of the forty-second session, for the competent manner in which he conducted the work of the Assembly.\nThe people of the People's Republic of the Congo, like all the peoples of the world that cherish peace, felt a sense of justified pride when it learnt that the Nobel Committee had decided must month to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces.\nI should like here to recall with satisfaction that a few months ago the People's Republic of the Congo held a non-permanent seat on the Security Council, and directly contributed, in that position of privilege, to the performance of the tasks of that most prestigious organ of the United Nations, which has very special responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and security.\nThe Congo is, then, well aware that the tribute thus paid by the Nobel Committee to those men and women, those guardians of peace, and to their bravery and courage as they work for peace in many, often dangerous, theatres of operations throughout the world, was well deserved.\nThis Prize, this most distinguished award, encourages the Secretary-General in his constant attitude of tireless patience and in the efforts he makes with a persistence rarely equalled today, particularly in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Western Sahara and Namibia. \nHow could my delegation not once again pay a tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for those achievements which strengthen our Organization and its role in the cause of peace? It is encouraging to see our Organization's name now closely linked to the settlement of complex conflicts that have been up to now stalemated. Most of the significant negotiations on them have been begun either within the United Nations or through its intervention. There is no doubt that there are still many hotbeds of tension in the world. A heavy toll in death, destruction and atrocities of all kinds continues to be taken, in particular in the occupied Arab territories, in Lebanon, in South Africa and in Latin America, where, despite the activities of the Contadora Group and the Lima group, the Esquipulas II Agreements, are being put to the severest tests, even though it is essential that they be respected and implemented.\nIn the case of South Africa, a country still governed by absurdity and still under the rod of a minority upholding the hateful regime of apartheid and its iniquitous laws, the black majority of the population continues, in the midst of the fiercest repression exacerbated by the state of emergency, courageously to seek its path and to struggle.\nThe illegal military occupation of Namibia by South African troops has not come to an end. It has for ten years been hindering the urgent and unconditional implementation of the United Nations peace plan contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) which is to lead Namibia to independence.\nSo we see how in many areas of the world the exercise of democracy and the enjoyment of fundamental human rights are still seriously hindered by dictatorial powers and practices. What is more, policies of confrontation have not disappeared. Tempered by political realities, we have learned that one cannot change the nature of things by simply recalling principles but only by translating\nthose principles into practical reality. \nAnd yet today the international situation does reflect several important changes and signs of detente.\nThe dialogue begun between the Soviet Union and the United States of America and the agreements reached by the two super-Powers have, with the help of the determined will of the peoples of the whole world for peace, generated this indispensable climate of detente.\nThe United Nations, taking the best advantage of this improvement in relations, has opened up new avenues for its own activity. Thus, thanks to this flowering of diplomacy, the process for settling various local or regional conflicts has been strengthened.\nBy way of example, the guns have really fallen silent between Iran and Iraq. The Congo is pleased that those two countries, which are among the eminent members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, should have agreed to begin direct talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General.\nThis exercise, certainly a difficult one, on which the parties embarked no later than last week in New York, shows that the chances for the establishment of a lasting peace are real and that the prospect of reconstruction is drawing closer.\nThis success is of considerable importance for the region. It does honour to the parties concerned, and my country invites them to persevere in this course and to continue to co-operate closely with the Secretary-General. Like the cease-fire established on 20 August last, the progress being made equally rewards the sustained efforts of the United Nations. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) - which the Congolese delegation knows well since as a member of the Security Council, it assisted at the time in its adoption - provided the basis for the current negotiations. Once again I would like to stress the role of wise mediator played by the Secretary-General in this process of settling the Iran-Iraq conflict. \nThe course of events with regard to the situation in Afghanistan is also promising. The allied troops have indeed withdrawn from that country in conformity with the Geneva Agreements of last April. My country welcomed those Agreements as a contribution to peace and a decisive step towards a solution that will enable all Afghans to exercise their right to self-determination. In regard to the Geneva Agreements, the Secretary-General stresses that this is the first time that the two most powerful States of our world have become guarantors of an agreement negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General.\nWhat is more, the genera, feeling with regard to situations of armed conflict is that the intensity of those conflicts has declined. The possibility of finding peaceful solutions to the situations in those troubled regions has thus been considerably strengthened.\nThe prospects for a settlement in South-East Asia, in particular in Kampuchea, in recent months have benefited from many initiatives, among them the recent talks in Indonesia. Diplomatic efforts should lead to the establishment of institutions with the broadest possible national representation.\nWe have noted many diplomatic efforts with a view to finding points of agreement on the question of Cyprus. The good offices of the Secretary-General, employed under a mandate from the Security Council, are beginning to give rise to favourable reactions. My country encourages the parties concerned in this course.\n< \u00b7 \\\" \u00b7\nThe number and variety of so many positive and important talks show how it is possible to build peace among nations that agree to enter into dialogue, and there are no conflicts or situations threatening international peace and security, however complex or acute they may be, that are irremediably stalemated.\nIn Africa, N'Djamena and Tripoli are irrefutable proof, if proof we need, of this. The two capitals have announced that they will begin to restore diplomatic relations between their two countries. Congo encourages the authorities of Chad and Libya to pursue their efforts and, in the interests of their two peoples and the neighbouring countries  to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the border conflict between them.\nThe Congo welcomes these prospects for peace and reasonableness, which observers unanimously agree they were unimaginable to some a few months ago. These prospects for peace consequently contribute to a particular strengthening of the peace ideals of our Organization, which so many nations support, and also the general role of the United Nations, which is becoming more and more active. \nThe improvement in the general climate of international relations and the areas of agreement now voluntarily acknowledged - for example, one on which we concur and which has been mentioned at this rostrum  the subject of chemical weapons - cannot hide the fact that there are conflicts yet unresolved and situations of tragic actuality that continue to affect developing countries. \nIn this regard my delegation would like to dwell first on the unbearable situation in southern Africa. Everything leads us to believe that Pretoria intends to uphold the system of apartheid and thus to continue its repression of the people and, what is more, its aggression against the front-line countries. The international community cannot forget that apartheid is a crime against humanity. Hence it must maintain and step up its pressure on South Africa and adopt comprehensive, binding sanctions against that country, particularly now that we are preparing to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. If South Africa wants peace it must recognize the most elementary rights of the majority of the people in the country. The banning by the ruling white minority in Pretoria of the activities of non-violent organizations and the arrest of all kinds of pacifists, including clergymen, betray the inherent incapacity of the apartheid regime for reform. In fact, that regime must be totally dismantled and it must give way to a democratic and multiracial system of Government,\nFurthermore, the international community must continue to exert all forms of pressure on the South African Government to ensure that the emergency measures now in force are lifted and to obtain the release of all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela.\nAngola, a country that is a friend and brother of the People's Republic of the Congo, has been deeply afflicted, but recently it obtained encouraging results in Geneva towards a cessation of hostilities in the war of aggression being waged against it by the apartheid regime of South Africa. The new prospects for peace now emerging must, however, be consolidated. My country, on the initiative of its President, Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso, actively supports the efforts being made in this regard. Thus Brazzaville, our wonderful capital, long known for its hospitality, is host to the latest series of quadripartite talks between Angola, Cuba and South Africa, with the mediation of the United States. After three rounds of negotiations, which produced some progress, ray country has high hopes of seeing the parties concluding their talks in Brazzaville very soon. No one will be surprised to see the People's Republic of the Congo playing such an active role in such an important process. This only reflects the customary policy of peace and international co-operation advocated and carried out by President Denis Sassou-Nguesao. \nIt gives me great pleasure to recall here that in April last year, in Brazzaville, the dialogue between the United States of America and the People's Republic of Angola was resumed. It was also in Brazzaville on 13 May that a bilateral meeting between Angola and South Africa was held.\nOur tradition of struggling against domination, colonialism and all forms of injustice, and our readiness for solidarity, as well as the commitment of the Congolese people to everything that concerns peace, progress and security in southern Africa, have combined with the efforts being made by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to create this climate which has led to our country's becoming the meeting point and place of dialogue the international community was seeking. Over and above the immense benefits expected from this event that we see in the quadripartite talks in Brazzaville, I can confirm that the spirit of Brazzaville will always remain a source of peace and security in our region.\nThe prospects for independence for the international Territory of Namibia, which is still under illegal military occupation by South Africa, are clearly improving in the light of current diplomatic contacts, and 1 November 1988 is a date we eagerly look forward to for the implementation of the United Nations peace plan for Namibia. It should open an exhilarating period in the lives of the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWA\u0413\u041e). Namibia would thus achieve independence.\nI turn now to the conflict in the Middle East, a conflict whose complexity has often been stressed. My country shares with others the conviction and the hope that only an international peace conference with the PLO taking part could create in the region chances for the establishment of a comprehensive, just and lasting solution. We are pleased that certain countries, which previously were openly hostile to such an international conference, now accept the principle. It is high time to make this conference more than merely the subject of talk.\nIn the Korean peninsula, the direct contacts that have been established between the two Koreas, despite the modesty of the results, contribute to the creation of favourable conditions for the establishment of a new climate free of tension and conducive to the unification of the Korean homeland.\nIn the Western Sahara, Morocco and the POLISARIO Front have accepted the peace plan of the CAO and the United Nations, which advocates a referendum on self-determination for the Sahraoui people. The Congo supports the joint efforts of the Acting Chairman of the OAU and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, which flow from the decisive action taken by President Denis Sassou-Nguesso when he was Chairman of the OAU.\nThe new era that is opening in Soviet-American relations and for peace in the world confers particular importance on the question of disarmament. Moscow and Washington have shown clearly their determination to call a halt to the arms race. The conclusion by the two Powers of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate- Range and shorter-Range Missiles, and the verification measures it contains open up interesting prospects for stability in the world. The developing countries, however, are aware of what was, after all, the minor Impact those prospects had at the time of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. It is unfortunate that the results of its work were so meagre. \nThe insupportable cost of the arms race not only threatens international peace and security, but also continues to swallow up colossal sums of money that could serve the goals of economic and social development, particularly the economic development of developing countries. Only a change in perceptions and attitudes, which we have heard described in contradiction one with mother during the course of the debate - which must, of course, continue - can lead to an eventual evolution in the situation. If the economic situation of the developing countries is to improve, such contributions are necessary. Immediate solutions are called for, of course, but they must be appropriate solutions that take into account the long-term development goals of our countries.\nThe major industrialized countries meeting in Toronto advocated various initiatives, among them the setting up of a multilateral fund to guarantee debt servicing. There was also discussion of measures to cancel a portion of public indebtedness. According to one eminent participant in the Toronto meeting, \\\"the international community must show greater realism and imagination\\\". We can agree with that, for the problem of foreign debt has served only to intensify the considerable pressure on the young and fragile economies of our countries, as well as to increase the uncertainty prevalent in the international financial system.\nThe mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 by the M Hoc Committee of the whole of the General Assembly concluded that the economic and social situation in Africa had deteriorated, notwithstanding the considerable sacrifices made by the African States in implementing the Programme. Lack of resources, indebtedness and the unfavourable external economic environment have been identified as the principal obstacles to recovery efforts.\nAt a time when the General Assembly is planning to declare the 1990s the fourth United Nations development decade and to prepare an international development strategy for that purpose, ray delegation cannot refrain from noting that the preceding decades so solemnly proclaimed from this rostrum have to a large extent remained a dead letter. The experience of the 1980s, the Third - or lost - Development Decade, which will soon draw to an end, corroborates that bitter acknowledgement, given the discouraging predictions for the world economy in 1989. The crisis is serious and deep-rooted. It calls for bold and lasting solutions, not mere cosmetic tinkering that leaves untouched the very foundations of relations based on gross injustice.\nThe 1990s are the doorway to the third millennium. If present adverse trends continue, the scope of the economic and social crisis in the developing countries is likely to mean the exclusion of the majority of mankind from the inexorable march towards the year 2000, which relies upon economic and technological capability, and to preclude their entering into that third millennium.\nNew efforts must therefore be made in our deliberations on international co-operation for development. For many reasons the thorny problem of nuclear and toxic waste being surreptitiously dumped in various parts of the world will be one of its aspects. Africa condemns the dumping of such wastes on the territories of its States. As a result, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has called for and obtained the inclusion of this item on the agenda of the present session.\nNot too long ago the convinced partisans of strengthening the United Nations role in world affairs were fearful - and quite, rightly - that the Organization might go down with all hands under the blows to its work and to its very principles by the advocates of a return to the values of individualism and triumphant bilateralism. \nFaced with that threat, but determined to survive r the United Nations embarked on a process of careful re-examination and healthy streamlining of its own bodies and their modus operandi. The Secretary-General spared no effort to awaken States Members to the seriousness of the situation and to obtain from them an active commitment to preserving the achievements of more than 40 years of efforts and experience   and renewed determination to ensure future success,\nToday we feel that we can see the dawn of better days for the Organization. That is what the delegation of the Congo has, in part, been saying in its present statement. Such cautious optimism can be justified by various events, in particular by the payment of part of the arrears owed by States Members who had fallen behind in their contributions to the regular working budget. Nothing, however, will have been truly accomplished if those optimistic signs do not survive beyond the present situation.\nThus, as the general debate at the forty-third session draws to a close, we are proud to note the strengthening of a fortunate overall trend of hope that the United Nations can continue to forge ahead in the service of mankind, for whom it is an indispensable tool.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with great pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. That election is a recognition of his own personal status, and also honours his country Argentina. Let me also convey our sincere thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, who presided so ably over the General Assembly at its forty-second session.\nA special tribute must also go to the Secretary-General. His untiring efforts to promote peace and international co-operation have been instrumental in the achievement of impressive breakthroughs in a number of regional conflicts. The Secretary-General's unflinching commitment to the principles and purposes of the Organization he has been called upon to lead ought to inspire all of us assembled here. Austria welcomes the turning-point in the perception of the United Nations, as it has always favoured the strengthening of the Organization and of the position of the Secretary-General as art essential factor not only in securing international peace but also in advancing the progress of mankind.\nRarely before have we seen a more lively demonstration of what the United Nations can in fact achieve, as it pursues at an accelerated pace its major goal, namely the establishment and preservation of peace. The merits of this world Organization and, in particular, its Secretary-General, have again been universally recognized. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces fills us as a major troop contributor, with joy, satisfaction and pride. That award is a tangible manifestation of current developments. Member States now expect the United Nations not only to continue but also to expand its peace-keeping and peace-making role. \nIt is therefore of paramount importance that the United Nations rests on a sound financial basis which in turn is an indispensable pre-condition for successful operations. A prolongation of the present financial crisis would cripple the prospects for new and more significant steps on the long and winding road towards reform and improvement of the Organization's procedures and practices. Reform is an ongoing and continuous process for which the Member States and the managers of the various programmes of the United Nations system are equally responsible. I am pleased to note that various measures taken by the Secretary-General have already perceptibly increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations.\nIn past years we heard a lot about the United Nations crisis. Some voices even went so far as to predict the end of voluntarism. Certainly, we have to admit that United Nations activities still lack the essential financial underpinning. But the political crisis seems to be over. We see today a resurgence of multilateral diplomacy under the auspices of the United Nations. The Secretary-General has skilfully taken advantage of the prevailing new international climate.\nWithin the time-span of a new months, agreements on Afghanistan were signed; a truce in the Gulf war was achieved; direct talks and negotiations between Iraq and Iran are under way; agreement was reached between the leaders of the two communities of Cyprus to reopening their dialogue; a solution of the question of Western Sahara was agreed upon in principle by those concerned; and, finally, the United Nations may well be about to play a vital part in the release of Namibia to independence. \nLet me state this unambiguously: Austria has always believed in the United Nations and its potential for the solution of international crises. My country is proud of the role the United Nations is playing today in peace-making and peace-keeping and will continue fully to support these activities in an internatic\u043b\u04301 scenario marked primarily by a new East-West relationship.\nPeace-keeping operations are among the success stories of the United Nations. I am deeply convinced that Austria's participation in, and commitment to, peace-keeping operations is one of the most effective ways in which a neutral country can make its contribution to the preservation of peace. More than 25,000 Austrians have worn the blue helmet. At present close to a thousand Austrian soldiers are serving in Cyprus, on the Golan Heights, at various locations in the Middle East and - since a few months ago - also in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as in Iran and Iraq.\nAustria did not hesitate to participate in peace-keeping activities when it was asked to do so. It is our experience, however, that in some cases troop contributors have to shoulder a disproportionately heavy financial burden. This is the case notably with the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). The participation in a peace-keeping operation always entails considerable cost for the troop contributors, as the compensation offered by the United Nations never covers all the cost the troop contributor incurs. It is simply unfair to continue to discriminate against the Cyprus operation merely for historical reasons and one has to accept, in that case, that the reimbursement is chronically insufficient. It is high time for a solution to be found to rectify this anomaly. We therefore hope that the Secretary-General's endeavours to have the financing of UNFICYP based on assessed contributions by the membership at large will be successful in the year to come. \nDespite continued outrageous violations of human rights in many parts of the world, progress was achieved in the promotion and protection of human rights.\nOften we restrain ourselves from pinpointing specific situations in order not to jeopardize the maintenance of a dialogue which is a prerequisite for further positive developments in this area.\nThe tenth of December will mark the fortieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human nights. The completion of the time-span of four decades since the adoption of that Magna Carta of all mankind is an appropriate moment for reflection on the remarkable achievements that have been made in the human rights field, the serious shortcomings that still persist in many areas and the challenges that lie ahead.\nLooking back to the origins of the Universal Declaration one must pay tribute to the courage and vision of its drafters, who were motivated by the ardent desire that the appalling disrespect for human life and dignity they had witnessed during their lifetime should never be repeated. Most regrettably, those rights are still violated to a large extent throughout the world.\nIn Austria's view the aim of the protection of human rights is to ensure the dignity of the human person, to safeguard his social and economic well-being and to allow for the free development of his entire personality. We hold the opinion that all human rights are indivisible and interrelated. The dignity of the human being cannot be guaranteed, if the necessary economic, social and cultural pre-conditions do not exist. However, adverse economic and social conditions can never justify the denial of civil and political rights.\nThe Declaration led to the adoption of a new approach concerning human rights whereby the community of nations recognized that respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the individual was no longer within the exclusive domain of national governments, but was a matter of concern for the international community at large. This conviction is shared by Austria: expressions of concern that human rights are not observed in a certain State cannot be considered as interference in the domestic affairs of that particular State. On the other hand issues of human rights ought not to be brought before United Nations organs to be used exclusively for political purposes.\nLet us now assess some of the major achievements of the United Nations in the human rights field: first, the \\\"common standard\\\" laid down by the Universal Declaration has been refined and elaborated in an impressive array of international instruments, for which the Declaration provided an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Important mechanisms have been developed within the Organization, or within special treaty bodies, in order to monitor the implementation of international human rights law. Suffice it to mention the International Covenants on human rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which have introduced sophisticated international control mechanisms.\nI wish to pay a special tribute to the Commission on Human Rights and its subsidiary organs - in particular, its special rapporteurs, who relentlessly endeavour to identify various violations of human rights and propose ways to improve particular situations. It is not the fault of the United Nations if the implementation of human rights norms remains imperfect.\t.\nLet me highlight only a few of the problems confronting us. The question of the human rights of all persons subjected to any form of detention or imprisonment is still of the greatest concern. It is precisely when a person is totally in the power of others that the worst human rights abuses occur: flagrant denial of all human values, ranging from disrespect for the individual's personal dignity through different stages of degrading, inhuman and cruel treatment to the most atrocious and sophisticated means of physical and mental abuse, and finally to the deliberate action of human life. The entry into force of the Convention against torture, to which Austria has become a party, is certainly a major step forward in combating that particularly serious and, regrettably, widespread violation of human dignity. A convention against torture has been elaborated within the Council of Europe providing for a system of periodic visits by independent experts to places of detention or imprisonment. Since we believe in the universality of human rights, I should like to suggest that such a system of preventive visits be created on a global basis.\nRegrettably, intolerance, discrimination and even persecution on the grounds of religion or belief, continue in today's world on a large scale. Freedom of religion and belief is, however, a central element in the freedom of the human being. Where this freedom is denied all other fundamental freedoms are in danger. In this context, we place a high value on and consider important the inter-confessional dialogue, based as it is on recognition of the inherent dignity of the human person, as a means further to strengthen human rights.\nIn order to facilitate concerted action by the international community in this field, the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief should be supplemented by a binding international instrument.\nThe freedom of minorities of all kinds - ethnic, religious or linguistic - to preserve their specific heritage is another important human rights issue. Such minorities should be regarded not as elements for friction within a State or between States, but, on the contrary, as an enrichment of the States in which they live, as bridges between nations.\nTo our most sincere regret there are cases - unfortunately, in Europe, too - where policies are put into effect which are designed to stifle the economic, social and, in particular, cultural development of persons belonging to minorities, leaving many of them no other choice than to seek refuge in foreign countries. Austria deplores such developments, which in fact are leading to the destruction of centuries-old cultures. Uprooting minorities, apart from the human suffering it entails, will further diminish our common cultural heritage. I wish to express the sincere hope of the Austrian Government that such policies will be reconsidered by those responsible for them, in the spirit of good-neighbourliness. We believe that the Third Committee ought to address this issue. \nRelated to the issue of human rights is the struggle against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking. In June of last year a World Conference on the issue was convened in Vienna. The participating States decided upon a comprehensive strategy document and issued a declaration. Work is at present under way on drafting a new convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The convention will be finalized at a conference of plenipotentiaries to be held in Vienna in December. Thus, important signals are being given that the international community considers the fight against drugs a priority area of international co-operation.\nAt the same time, however, we must take care that the United Nations bodies dealing with drug abuse control which have to take on additional responsibilities are adequately staffed. Similar considerations are valid in respect of the crime prevention and social research areas of the Secretariat.\nWe witness a growing awareness of global social dimensions, especially with regard to the interrelationship of economic and social progress. Social policies and social development must be at the heart of our concerns in the years to come. The capacity of the United Nations to respond to the increasingly important challenges of social concerns, the advancement of women, youth-related questions and questions of the elderly or disabled, must be further consolidated and strengthened.\nA further important topic at each session of the General Assembly is disarmament and arms control, issues which I addressed quite recently in my statement on 2 June this year at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. I shall therefore, restrict myself to one particularly urgent question: the conclusion of a chemical weapons convention. The co-operation of the chemical industries in all countries and the readiness of all States possessing chemical weapons to destroy their stocks under appropriate international verification and renounce their future production or acquisition, are essential elements in that endeavour. \nAustria attaches the highest priority to the comprehensive and verifiable elimination of chemical weapons. With a view to contributing to the realisation of that aim, I recall that Austria is ready and would be pleased to be the host to a new mechanism to be established by the chemical weapons convention. Vienna already hosts the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has at its disposal highly qualified experts in the field of monitoring and verification. We should take advantage of that.\nIn this context, I wish to refer to the statement I made on 14 April at the Conference on Disarmament. I referred to the need for all States to provide, at the earliest possible date, detailed Information on their actual arsenals, their chemical-weapons production facilities, and all other chemical-industry facilities that might fall under the future chemical weapons convention. The Austrian delegation, in consultation with other delegations, intends to pursue an initiative in that respect.\nThe Conference on Disarmament, in Geneva, has done essential work in drafting such a convention. Austria is actively following those efforts and is co-operating in the work of the Conference. I remind the Assembly that Austria is a candidate for membership of that important body, which, in disarmament matters, acts as the trustee of the international community. Finally, as a signatory to the Geneva Protocol of 1925, my country notes with interest the United States proposal to convene a meeting of all the signatories to that document. \nThe third follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, currently taking place in Vienna, has entered its final phase. By now, there is a realistic chance of consensus. In the coming weeks, among the 35 participating States on a substantial concluding document - consensus based on the important proposals offered by the neutral and non-aligned countries. \nWe hope that this opportunity will be seized. It would reinforce the credibility and dynamism of the Conference by contributing to fuller implementation of past commitments and by providing for a programme of new reforms and areas of co-operation. Concrete new provisions should make possible the removal of more of the barriers between the peoples of East and West. The enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the ability to meet and communicate freely with one another, continue to be vital to the attainment of the Europe we are aiming for.\nNegotiations on confidence- and security-building measures, as well as on conventional forces, are to be part of the outcome of the Vienna meeting. We are conscious of an increasing awareness of the urgent need to address the existing imbalances in conventional forces in Europe. In this respect a rapid conclusion of the Vienna meeting would also be of great importance.\nGiven its specific geopolitical position and its deeply rooted commitment to democracy and to the observance of human rights, Austria's European policy is guided by two priorities. On the one hand we pursue our traditional policy of good-neighbourliness towards our Eastern European friends, with whom we maintain close and friendly relations. On the other hand, Austria is traditionally deeply involved in the ongoing European integration process. Therefore we are striving for full participation in the emerging unified internal market of the European Communities. Moreover, we do not exclude the option of future membership, while maintaining our status of permanent neutrality.\nNow I would like to say some words on our relations with Italy. Our bilateral relations also have been deepening continuously during the last year, and their present state can be described as excellent. Following the tradition of past years, I would like, however, to state that the political importance of the South-Tyrol question in Austro-Italian relations remains unchanged. On the basis of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly adopted in I960 and 1961, Austria and Italy agreed, in 1969, on a new arrangement for South Tyrol's autonomy. Whereas, in past years, Austria was compelled to express its concern about the delays in the realization of the so-called \\\"package\\\" of 1969, I am now in a position to report important and substantial progress, which brings this long-lasting dispute closer to solution.\nOn 13 May 1988 the Italian Government approved certain measures to implement the package, including the granting of equal status for the use of the German language before court and police authorities, which is of fundamental importance for the protection of the German-speaking minority. Austria assumes that the relevant decree, and two other regulations that still require the approval of the Italian Parliament, will soon come into force.\nIf we succeed in solving the outstanding questions, with a view to completing and safeguarding the autonomy of South Tyrol, we will also further enhance the ability of all ethnic groups to live together in a small but sensitive part of Europe, which has suffered many conflicts throughout its history. The fact that the respective measures are being carried out in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI) underlines the importance of the United Nations as a peace-generating force.\nThis is a year of hope. We have witnessed a number of major and quite unexpected breakthroughs as regards the resolution of regional conflicts. I have already mentioned them. The United Nations has thus shown the world that it is not altogether unrealistic to hope for peaceful solutions to international conflicts. \nWhile there is promising progress in certain areas, the situation in the Middle East has unfortunately not improved since the last session of the General Assembly. On the contrary, the events in the occupied territories in recent months and the deplorable behaviour of the occupying Power have once again focused world attention on the urgent need to achieve a just and lasting settlement. The situation remains volatile. Stability in the region is further threatened by the continuous build-up and increasing sophistication of armaments. In order to decrease mutual fear and suspicion, all States in the area should accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and should submit all their nuclear facilities to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards regime. \nIn the view of my Government, the only way to arrive at a just and lasting solution is by convening an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, taking into account the necessity of withdrawal from occupied territories and the respect for the right of all States to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries. The recent developments in the area should bring new momentum into the search for peace and allow the Palestinian people, as represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization, finally to play its legitimate role in this endeavour. Forty years after the establishment of the State of Israel provided for in resolution 181 (II), we might finally witness the Palestinian Arab people create their own State.\nTen years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), the people of Namibia may well enter a new phase of their history, joining the community of sovereign nations. The independence of Namibia, for which the United Nations has accepted special responsibility, would be a prime achievement.\nAs far as the United Nations Transition Assistance Group is concerned, Austria is prepared to participate with a police contingent and would consider making additional personnel available for other tasks related to the transition of Namibia to independence.\nIn this connection, it is not necessary to reiterate that Austria remains fully committed to the cause of freedom and dignity for the people of southern Africa. Austria strongly rejects and firmly condemns apartheid. We are convinced that only the eradication of apartheid can lead to a peaceful solution.\nAs far as the situation in Kampuchea is concerned, 1988 brought some progress in the search for a political solution. The Jakarta informal meeting provided for the first time a framework for informal discussions among the parties directly involved and other concerned countries. There seems to be a sincere willingness on all sides to identify areas of common ground, and agreement to solve the Kampuchean problem through negotiations. Notwithstanding the progress made, there is however still a long way to go. Therefore, the International Conference on Kampuchea, chaired by Leopold Gratz, President of the Austrian Parliament, could be a useful forum for activities designed to assist the parties involved. \nThe situation in Central America has been on our agenda for a number of years. The problems of the area ate still far from any agreed comprehensive solution. We all know that only pluralistic democratic societies closely co-operating in the spirit of good-neighbourliness can successfully address the underlying social and economic problems of the region. The United Nations remains the only comprehensive international forum for co-operation on economic and interrelated matters. The effective potential of international economic co-operation has clearly been demonstrated by the success of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, where a comprehensive and far-reaching political consensus on guiding economic principles has been achieved. Although much of the work of implementing the principles still remains to be done, the common acceptance of these principles in itself constitutes important progress.\nA tangible expression of economic Interdependence is international trade. A large part of world trade has been liberalized in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The changing realities and the Impressive gain of importance of new trade flows and sectors, however, continue to pose considerable challenges. The ambitious goal of the Uruguay Round of opening up markets in a series of new fields and of effectively combating all forms of protectionism is highly valued by Austria. Protectionism is nothing less than the unjustifiable refusal to make necessary adjustments in current changes in the world economy, such as technical development, structural imbalances of demand and supply and, last but not least, the appearance of new prospects. The raid-term review of the Uruguay-Round will, we hope, enable ministers to spur on negotiations in this spirit.\nAs concerns the continuing debt problem of a large number of countries, Austria commends and further encourages measures such as improved debt rescheduling with official creditors, innovative debt arrangements with private creditors, and national policies vigorously mobilizing national and international resources by enhancing confidence, creditworthiness, market access and new investment. The recommendations of the Toronto summit meeting in favour of the poorest debtor countries constitute an important act of solidarity. Austria will fully support them.\nThe necessary adjustment in a changing world economy aggravated by the debt burden requires adequate financing. The international financial institutions are to be given credit for their pace-making role in this context. The capital increase of the World Bank and the African Development Bank, the establishment of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility and, roost recently, the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility of the International Monetary Fund, provide the needed financial basis for the most urgent remedies. In addition, they ate of utmost importance as a signal to private capital markets, encouraging them to join the common efforts. \nAustria attaches great importance to the success of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, 1986-1990, which is based on a new and realistic policy consensus. However, as the Secretary-General pointed out in his valuable report for the recent session of the Ad Hoc Committee which undertook a mid-term review of the Programme, the continuing gravity of the economic situation in Africa requires further urgent: measures. The successful outcome of this session should provide an important impetus for the future. Its assessment and recommendations reflect the urgent need as well as the willingness of its participants to undertake further efforts to implement the Programme and to assist African States, many of which have instituted commendable and courageous reform measures.\nThe environment has been a top-ranking issue on our agenda for many years. The rapid deterioration of our environment has created a new sense of responsibility for the environmental consequences of our activities. In the past year the report of the Brundtland Commission has been instrumental in raising the level of global consciousness of the interrelation of environment and development and the imperative need for making the transition towards sustainable development. Austria strongly supports an effective follow-up of this report within the global and regional framework of the United Nations system. We welcome in this context the initiative of the Norwegian Government concerning the holding in 1990, in co-operatic with the Economic Commission for Europe, of a regional conference at the ministerial level to review the process of the ongoing work in this field.\nDramatic changes in our environment - such as the depletion of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect, to mention only two of the most serious environmental problems of global dimension - may seriously threaten mankind's very existence. Concerted action is called for if we want to maintain or restore the ecological balance of our globe. I am pleased to recall at this point Austria's active contribution to the elaboration of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, which we have ratified, and of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the Ozone Layer, which we have signed recently. Austria has also hosted several high-ranking scientific meetings under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Programme, the World Meteorological Organization and the International Council for Scientific Unions on carbon dioxide emissions, which reflects our grave concern about the climatic changes. We hope that the elaboration of a protocol on the control and redaction of nitrogen oxide emissions will take us another important step forward in the implementation of the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.\nIt is our primary task to perform pragmatic and efficient day-to-day work.\nThis should not, however, preclude our having a vision of the future. We must combine our forces in order jointly to master the challenges of the future. Therefore I should like to end my statement with some appropriate lines by Alfred Lord Tennyson: \n\\\"We dip into the future, far as human eyes can see.\nSee the vision of the world and all the wonder that shall be.\nHear the war-drum throb no longer, see the battle flags all furled in the parliament of man, the federation of the world.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to begin my address by congratulating the United Nations and its Secretary-General upon the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the peace-keeping forces, as announced this morning. We welcome the fact that this award has been made to a body that is essential for the effective functioning of the United Nations. It symbolizes a clear recognition by the international community of the commendable work performed by the United Nations for the genuine security of all States.\nOn behalf of the Mexican Government, I extend my warmest congratulations to you, Mr. Caputo, the Secretary for External Relations of the Republic of Argentina, on your well-deserved election to the post of President of the General Assembly for this session. Sir, your diplomatic experience and ability will contribute to the success of our endeavours. In the performance of your delicate task, you may count upon the support of the Mexican delegation. The solid ties of friendship that unite our peoples and Governments allow us to renew and reaffirm shared aspirations that should ensure the success of this session of the General Assembly.\nI also wish to express our especial confidence and trust in Mr. Perez de Cuellar. The international community knows that the changes that we are experiencing in international affairs have been made possible to a large degree by his political contribution and his talent for negotiation. The work carried out by our Secretary-General renews our faith in the United Nations system, reinforces the Organization's prestige, and helps to overcome the crisis of multilateralism. We are proud that Mr. Perez de Cuellar, a Latin American politician and diplomat, has so commendably advanced the causes of peace, justice and international law. \nWhen President Miguel de la Madrid's Government was initiated in December 1982, the international situation was particularly difficult. Tension had increased among the great Powers, and disarmament negotiations had been suspended. The great Powers had also assumed antagonistic positions with respect to various trouble spots around the world. The East-West confrontation was making the international climate more tense. The United Nations was the target of criticism, because it seemed incapable of responding to the needs for peace and security.\nThe United Nations as a whole, including the specialized agencies, was the target of unfair criticism, which served to distort its true role. A number of countries attached importance to bilateral relations and demanded conduct in accordance with their own short-terra interests and strategic goals.\nThis served to weaken the multilateral system and that was compounded by a financial crisis, deliberately caused by those who sought to gain influence consistent with their foreign policy. The United Nations was the target of mean financial treatment as a result of that short-sightedness which we would all like to see overcome. Mexico never agreed to the unilateral decisions taken by the major contributing Powers, which refused to meet their obligations as a means of bringing pressure to bear upon the Member States and the Organization, breaking the rule of universality in one of the most important specialized agencies. The lesson is clear: without the political will on the part of Member States it is impossible to find a solution to the crisis of multilateralism and of the international Organization.\nTo the political and military confrontations was added the most serious problem in present-day international life, that of the great inequalities between the developing South and the industrialized North. The dialogue to establish a new international economic order was broken off. In the 1980s the aspirations of the South to negotiations that would lead to a better distribution of wealth and the resources so essential for well being and development were frustrated.\nThe results of that crisis afflicted above all the poorest nations. In this paradox of history, the poorest, those in greatest need to promote social development with new resources, became exporters of capital and wealth to the international financial centres - that is, to those that already enjoyed resources in abundance. \nWe are pleased that the Organization and the Secretary-General have played a leading role in these recent changes. We also welcome the progress that President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev have achieved in the field of disarmament. Paramount importance must be attached to the signing and ratifying of the Soviet-American Treaty on the elimination of their intermediate-range and shorter-range nuclear forces - the INF Treaty. We call for the rapid conclusion of other treaties on a significant reduction in strategic weapons and on the elimination of chemical weapons. The agreements prove that even the most difficult natters can be resolved with sufficient political will and determination. They also show that security and balance are not necessarily synonymous with the escalation of armaments and that diplomatic negotiations are essential for the solution of the most difficult problems, solutions that guarantee the legitimate rights and genuine national interests of all parties.\nIt is true that barely the first steps have been taken in the long road to free the world from the threat of nuclear war. It is imperative, therefore, to adhere strictly to the commitments made and to maintain the will to negotiate. Incidentally, the lack of results from the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament was not encouraging. In the field of disarmament the participation of the international community is necessary, through the agencies especially created for that purpose, otherwise we shall continue to be governed by the relations between the nuclear Powers - that is, we shall be subjected to criteria, views and interests that do not necessarily coincide with those of other men and countries which earnestly desire the elimination of weapons of destruction that could put an end to their very existence. \nPeace has been and will continue to be the fundamental goal pursued by Mexico in its foreign policy. Proof of this is to be found in President de la Madrid's participation in the Peace and Disarmament Initiative - referred to as the Group of Six - which contributed to the creation of an appropriate climate for negotiations between the great Powers. I emphasize, as the Group of Six has done/ the need for the complete cessation of nuclear tests and prevention of the extension of the arms race to outer space, and that the limitation of conventional weapons be seriously discussed.\nEvents of recent months prove that the role of the United Nations in achieving peace and development is irreplaceable. Within this climate of d\u00e9tente negotiated agreements must be consolidated and the disputes that still affect several regions and countries must be resolved. The Government of Mexico has steadfastly supported the peaceful settlement of international disputes with respect for the principles of self-determination and non-intervention. That is why optimism is aroused by the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and the fact that the exercise of the right to self-determination has been achieved, or by the attainment of a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq so that a war that divided the civilian populations of the two countries for eight years has been brought to an end. We must also welcome the four-party negotiations that led to a cease-fire between South Africa and Angola. The termination of hostilities will enable the Angolan people to advance towards independent economic and social development, free from external threats and interference.\nThe agreements to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978), on Namibian independence, are of special importance to us, Mexico, as a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, has always condemned the illegal occupation of that Territory. That is why we re-emphasize our commitment to the people of Namibia and to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), its clear organization, their right to exercise fully their sovereign rights.\nWe emphasize our rejection of the barbaric practice of apartheid, which has been consistently condemned by the United Nations. Peace in the region and respect for international law would be a utopian dream without an end to apartheid. It is imperative that we to continue to demand that South Africa put an end to its aggressive policies against the front-line States and its policies of regional destabilization.\nWe earnestly hope that the talks on the Kampuchean conflict will result in agreements guaranteeing the Kampuchean people's right to self-determination, free from genocidal factions and with respect for the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, which clearly necessitates the withdrawal of foreign troops.\nLasting peace in the Middle East entails recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. All the States in the region, including Israel, muse be able to live within secure and recognized borders. We roust once again call for the restitution of the territories occupied since 1967, accompanied by prohibition of conquest by military force and the provision of guarantees ensuring respect for the human rights of the Palestinian civilian population in the region. The convening of an international conference, with the participation of all parties and under the auspices of the United Nations, is consequently extremely important. We must foster all such contacts as might lead to the settlement of this, one of the most protracted conflicts of the post-war age. It is also encouraging that the conflict in Western Sahara is nearing a political resolution that will result in independence and self-determination for the Sahraoui people.\nOn the other hand- we are concerned that there has been a stalemate of the negotiations in Central America. To Mexico, respect for the self-determination of the Central American peoples and rejection of any outside interference and of the use of force or coercion continue to be central to the attainment of peace and development in the region.\nThe steps taken by Mexico to help bring about regional peace are well known. The Contadora and Support Groups advocated full respect in the region for the principles of non-intervention and self-determination for all the peoples in the isthmus, to enable these nations to attain the stability and co-operation that would make their economic, political and social development possible.\nIn August 1987, the Central American countries signed the Esquipulas accords. The political connection of these accords to the Contadora and Support Groups is quite clear. They also constitute a valid and practical basis for the restoration of peace in the area. These principles should be observed by the Central American countries and should be respected by all the States in the international community, particularly those which have links with, and interests in, the region.\nThe efforts of the Contadora and the Esquipulas accords deserve to meet with success, and so they will, to the degree that hegemonistic interpretations and a security policy that is not compatible with security or Latin American interests are abandoned. It is true that the peoples of the region desire security, peace and democracy - but peace, security and democracy that mean autonomy and freedom to determine their own destiny, free from external interference, development with no strings or preconditions attached, and co-operation between equals with full respect for sovereignty. \nContadora and its Support Group have struggled to avoid the spreading of this conflict, which could dash the hopes of the Central American peoples and spread to other parts of the continent. It was also our desire that democracy should be a genuine product of the peoples. Similarly, we made contacts with other regions and international organizations - I might mention in this respect the European Economic Community (EEC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) - which could help to eliminate poverty and underdevelopment in the region, which are really the underlying cause of the conflicts.\nIn Central America, peace will prevail over the gloomy prospect of a more protracted war. The rule of law must prevail in this region over military and ideological considerations, so that reason and the long-term interest of all the peoples of the continent may prevail over immediate tactical and military considerations.\nI am convinced that the most important question of modern life is the need to correct the unjust and unbalanced economic relations in the world. This is one of the great tasks currently facing the community of States and international organizations. \nThis decade, which is of such great political moment, has also been characterized by restraint on development 'and by the difficulties we have encountered in openly and constructively reviewing the economic situation of the non-industrialized countries. Misunderstanding, short-sightedness and selfish considerations have been the rule of the day. \nIt has been said that the 1980s were a lost opportunity for development. Our efforts notwithstanding, we have been unable to achieve a better and more effective role for our countries in the international economy. The lack of response to the debt problem is well known, as are the excessive rise in interest rates, trade restrictions, the fall in commodity prices, and the severe restrictions on financing for the development of our countries.\nThe philosophy pursued by the main industrialized countries notwithstanding, there was a tightening of trade protectionism, and we saw the emergence of what is being called the \\\"new protectionism\\\". These practices severely restrict our access to the markets of the industrialized countries and thus our prospects of meeting our internal and external obligations.\nUnilateral restraints on international trade are all the more deplorable if we consider that in practice they are contrary to the commitments made by the signatories of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on the occasion of the \\\"Uruguay Round\\\", and if we consider, furthermore, that they are prejudicial to the development potential of non-industrialized countries, and therefore have an adverse effect upon world economic growth.\nThe scale of debt-servicing among developing nations and the shortage of international financing represent a net transfer of resources to the outside world. This takes up a significant part of our export earnings. It severely restricts imports and makes the internal adjustment process less and less compatible with economic growth and an equitable distribution of social well-being. Restructuring of the debt has had some slight effect on the terms and conditions of payment, but it has not meant a real solution to the problem.\nThe developing world and Latin America in particular, is calling for long-term solutions, through just and reasonable negotiations with the industrialized countries, to resolve the problem of external debt, development financing and the reactivation of the international economy.\nWe have therefore argued that the debt servicing must in all cases be adapted to the real capacity of the debtor countries to pay, with recognition of the principle of shared responsibility and the need for equity in the distribution of costs. It is also necessary to have balanced negotiations to increase the volume and rate of exports from developing countries. Within GATT, there must be strict fulfilment of the commitments to suspend and dismantle trade restrictions that ace in violation of the obligations undertaken by the signatories to the General Agreement.\nThe major issues relate to the need for change in economic relations among States, so that the wealth created by the intelligence and efforts of mankind may no longer be concentrated within a small number of countries and a narrow strip of our planet. This is doubtless the major challenge before the modern community of States and before the United Nations.\nThe struggle for respect for fundamental rights and freedoms is one of the major attainments of the United Nations. Forty years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, life's dynamics have forced us to deepen, modulate and broaden its application and protection. Let us preserve the institutions created to safeguard these basic rights, including respect for groups of society and for matters that were barely understood a few years ago.\nOn the other hand, Mexico will continue to wage a head-on war against the terrible threat of drug trafficking. We support all multilateral steps taken in this area, because drug trafficking is an international phenomenon that can only be effectively confronted through a pooling of our resources. \nBut what we need is effective, constructive international co-operation that takes into account in a balanced way this criminal phenomenon so harmful to society, in all its aspects: production, trafficking and consumption. It should be an expression of world solidarity, not a cause for discord or manipulation. Mexico will continue its steadfast battle against this criminal epidemic, this threat to public health. But it calls upon all those plagued by this international crime to shoulder their responsibilities. The Governments of the major centres of consumption cannot use easy but ineffective solutions to avoid the fundamental burden of what is their problem.\nLet me reiterate Mexico's deep belief in the irreplaceable role of the United Nations. It is hard to think of a political settlement anywhere in the world without the presence and active co-operation of the Organization. Even where the initial negotiations are carried out by others, the United Nations is of decisive importance because on behalf of the international community it formalizes implements and monitors the fulfilment of agreements; in nearly all cases its organs have a general mandate to define a settlement.\nNo major co-operative project could be carried out without its support and its technical resources. Nor could there be peaceful coexistence among States, based on the rule of law and mutual respect, without the guarantees and political backing of the United Nations.\nAt San Francisco, peace and security among nations were entrusted to the Organization. This splendid project for our civilization, which followed a period of barbarism, continues to be fully valid, but only on one condition: that all States conform in their behaviour to the rules they themselves have imposed and to which they have committed themselves. For developing countries, the multilateral forums have been particularly valuable as a place to air our problems and fight to defend our interests. In a community of more than 160 sovereign countries we must, of course, have international democracy.\nThis does not mean a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", but rather a joining of problems, expressed in a united manner and considered by the community of States. Disarmament, the eradication of colonialism, respect for the sovereignty of peoples and for human rights, the elimination of apartheid, the settlement of regional conflicts and the goals of international co-operation have never, anywhere, been a senseless expression of tyranny, but a pre-condition for freedom, security and dignity for the majority of the world's population. Some of these purposes, indeed, ate now espoused by those who were once opposed to them.\nThere have been undeniable achievements which must be consolidated. There are also pending matters, such as world economic imbalances and the conflict in Central America. The solution of all these matters depends to a great extent on unified action by developing countries.\nThe international machinery for co-ordination and consultation must therefore be strengthened and made more effective. The Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 are committed to preparing for the future so that succeeding generations may have more and better food, housing, education and clothing. Regional bodies too have much to do here. There must be solidarity and organization, joint efforts and shared goals. \nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, we have strengthened political co-ordination and are making advances in the economic integration of our countries. The united mobilization of the considerable material and human resources of Latin America and the Caribbean will without question lend our countries greater capacity in external negotiations and new opportunities for internal co-operation and development.\nThe work of the group of eight Latin American Presidents is a clear manifestation of our determination to seek solutions to our problems and to redefine our links with the rest of the world, as is faithfully reflected in the Acapulco compromise, the basic charter of a system of political co-ordination in Latin America which opens the way for further regional integration. The crisis has at least had the positive effect of further bringing together the peoples of, Latin America. This has been possible thanks to democratic changes in our societies in recent years. Thus, we are approaching a stage where we shall strengthen our unity, make progress -\u0448 the path of economic complementarity, and consolidate our democratic institutions. He shall give fresh impetus to our economies and increase the well-being of our peoples.\nWe are coming to the end of the 1980s with feelings of optimism about the role of diplomacy and negotiation as political tools with a special place in relations among States. The atmosphere of confrontation and intolerance that began the decade has given way to detente. Disarmament, a crucial matter that went through a period of deep lethargy, is new engendering renewed hope, and there is progress in the settlement of regional conflicts. Nevertheless, we are concerned that we may see the return in a new form of the time when the majority of States were fated merely to accept and confirm agreement - or competition - between the Powers. We can have genuine peace and true security only with the active participation of a politically organized community of States acting within the United Nations and under its constitutional authority. \n\nThe great question in the coming years will inevitably focus on the economic development of the poorest nations. Advances in the solution of international conflicts are not matched by the poor performance with respect to the economic problems of non-industrialized nations. There can be no progress in international stability, peace and security unless effective steps are taken in the context of mechanisms where responsibility is shared by developed and developing countries, which would result in sustained economic growth for the latter. These mechanisms must turn their political attention to three points: new financial flews, debt and foreign trade.\nMexico reiterates its conviction that today a civilized international life can be attained only on the basis of respect for law, the sovereign dignity of all nations and the genuine economic and social well-being of their peoples. Only then will peace, development and democracy be possible. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, I extend my country's congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. His ability and experience are well-known and we look forward to his wise counsel.\nPermit me also to pay tribute to the former President, Mr, Peter Florin, for the skilful manner in which he directed our deliberations over the past year. His guidance was most encouraging as he manifested a keen commitment to international peace and worked with passion and zeal towards getting positive results.\nIn 1939, the  forking classes of Antigua and Barbuda formed an organization which has proved to be the catalyst of advancement and a leading force in securing our nation's independence. In January 1989 we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the labour movement and we are pledged to continue working for the betterment of all of our citizens, while emphasizing the specific needs of workers - workers who express themselves openly and frequently on both domestic and International matters, workers who recognize the significance and importance of the United Nations and who embrace and are dedicated to the principle of peace. On their behalf, and on behalf of all the citizens of our twin-island State, I should like to offer s interest congratulations to the United Nations peace-keeping forces on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, We also wish to acknowledge the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, in building the bridges for the establishment of peace, and for the further strengthening of the operational machinery of this Organization.\nIn this, our forty-third session of the General Assembly, Antigua and Barbuda is pleased that there is now a mood of optimism present in international affairs. Yet, small countries such as Antigua and Barbuda have watched with dismay as more and more emphasis is placed on bilateralism by the more powerful and more dominant countries. This retreat from multilateralism, if allowed to continue, can lead to a decline in the role of the United Nations. Matters of interest to the global community necessitate the participation of all countries, irrespective of size, ideology or financial solvency. We adhere to the principle enunciated in the Nassau Declaration of World Order emerging from the 1985 Commonwealth Summit held in the Bahamas, that \\\"in the world of today and tomorrow, international co-operation is not an option but a necessity\\\".\nWe must remind ourselves that multilateralism is an expression of solidarity among States endeavouring to promote their mutual interests and to resolve conflicts through peaceful means and methods. We believe that the strength of multilateralism can only be assessed by how well it serves the international community in times of crisis and tension. In short, to negate the principle of multilateralism is to retreat and to completely erode the role envisaged for the United Nations by its founders - that of promoting peace, security, economic development and the self-determination of peoples yet unfree. \nAntigua and Barbuda bemoans the affliction of the world-wide community by the internationalization of crime, particularly terrorism and trafficking in narcotics. Both are of deep concern to our twin-island community. It is essential that multilateral co-operation be strengthened in an effort to save our own and future generations from those scourges. In specific regard to drugs, we are encouraged that the international conference on drug abuse has assigned a greater responsibility to the United Nations. Drug abuse breaks down the framework of the society which earlier generations have worked so very hard to build. It destroys our youngsters and literally turns many into unrecognisable creatures. As transit points in the trafficking of drugs, our small nations can be put at the mercy of wealthy and powerful drug barons. The major market of consumption must therefore be called upon to apply greater initiative in co abetting the drug problem since a significant decline in consumption will do such to help eliminate production. It is evident, however, that only through concerted action between producing, transit and major consuming States, will the international community be able to put an end to this scourge.\nSince 1983, Antigua and Barbuda has been at the forefront on the question of Antarctica. It is therefore with deep regret that we learned of the decision of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties  (ATCP) to disregard totally and completely General Assembly resolution 42/46 of 30 November 1987 on the \\\"Question of Antarctica\\\". It is even further regretted that the racist regime of South Africa was allowed to participate in the ATCP negotiations held in Wellington from 2 Kay to 2 June 1988. Antigua and Barbuda was profoundly astonished when, during the general debate, one Member State declared that it is linked with Antarctica by its sovereignty, its history and continuity. The concept of sovereignty in regard to Antarctica is one that we cannot understand or consider. Antarctica must remain the heritage of all mankind, not the possession of a few large States. \nWe will continue to work dauntlessly and steadfastly for consensus on the question of Antarctica and we pledge to continue pressing for a moratorium on negotiations to establish a minerals regime until all members of the international community can participate fully in such negotiations. We further appeal to the ATCP States to have the Secretary-General or his representative attend all meetings of the Treaty Parties.\t'\nAntigua and Barbuda is but one of the many small voices expressing their concern over the Antarctic issue. A joint approach by developing countries and other countries not members of the consultative group is necessary to achieve positive results. The United Nations has not been able to produce a consensus resolution on Antarctica since the year it was first placed on the agenda. However, unless the ATCP States broaden representation of the decision-making process, the United Nations will continue to be used as the forum in which non-ATCP States express their concerns and gain support for their position.\nWe take this opportunity to outline another position that is of primary concern to the economic planners in my nation. Since the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly, island developing countries have emphasized that there has been a lack of sustained empirical work cm our development experience. Enough attention has certainly not been paid to the problems centred around transportation, communication and marine issues. More examination needs to be given to the relationship between imports and exports and the problems involved in attracting foreign investment.\nAntigua and Barbuda and other island developing States have repeatedly stressed that the use of traditional economic indicators in assessing our well-being are neither apt nor realistic. The overwhelming reliance on per capita gross national product presents major distortions. It does not reflect the fact that our island nations are too small to provide for our populations economically many services routinely afforded citizens of larger countries. It fails to reflect our inability to penetrate markets for our embryonic manufacturing industries, whose production levels reflect small size. It does not give an adequate representation of our vulnerability that a single hurricane can set back our development 10 years or more, destroy 50 per cent of our housing stock, and completely devastate our agriculture and tourism industries, witness Jamaica and the effects of hurricane Gilbert. Therefore we once again present a case for the use of more reliable economic performance indicators and for special assistance to island developing countries.\nWhile recognizing the outstanding role the United Nations is playing in bringing about solutions to international problems, it is impossible for this Organization to continue its efforts at the same level with its existing financial situation. Consequently it behoves Member States to contribute to its support on a reliable and permanent basis, we say this even though it is most apparent that many countries are experiencing severe financial difficulties.\nWell we know that the international community has to harness itself to tackle the difficulties posed by debt, by trade and commodity problems and by human resources development. The debt crisis can, however, be properly addressed only if debtor and creditor countries fully realize that our mutual interest lies in breaking the deadlock. We call for an environment that gives impetus to progress within developing countries and for a more vigorous and healthy growth in international trade.\nPublic anxiety has increased throughout the world with the knowledge that the greenhouse effect has begun to impact upon our planet and will cause even greater atmospheric changes in the years to come. The threat to the ozone layer has brought about the realization that no individual country acting alone can protect its own environment. We acclaim the adoption of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and hope that it will be followed by other measures to protect the atmosphere.\nThe threat to the ozone layer initially generated by affluent societies is inextricably linked with those of poverty, economic development and population growth. The reality is that the world's population will possibly double by the middle of the twenty-first century and that this growing population will be driven to use increasing amounts of irreplaceable natural resources which in turn will lead to the emission of higher levels of pollutants into the air by industry. In addition, the practice of trafficking in and the dumping of toxic wastes needs to be halted by immediate international action. We consequently join Norway in issuing a call for a strict international regime to protect developing countries from becoming a dumping ground for hazardous wastes. In the Caribbean, reliant as we are upon our natural beauty and cognizant of the fragility of our ecosystems, the dumping of hazardous wastes must not be allowed.\nIn this the fortieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we are appalled by the numerous violations of human rights in so many countries.\nWe are saddened by news of summary arrests and executions, the disappearance of individuals and the systematic practice of detention and killings of unarmed demonstrators. The protection of human rights is given high priority by my Government, and we firmly subscribe to the belief that human rights is for all people and all nations. To press for human rights is to join the struggle for democracy and advancement. \nSouth Africa, unfortunately, continues steadfastly with its evil policy of apartheid. The Secretary-General in his report stated that \\\"Developments in, or relating to, the continuance of a situation of racial discrimination, which is so repugnant to the spirit of our age, lend further for CG to the repeated - and hitherto unheeded - urgings of the international community that apartheid be dismantled\\\". (\u0414/43/1, p. 5)\nWe again call for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and all those incarcerated in South African gaols as a consequence of their struggle for their right to be free and to be liberated from all shackles of bondage in their own country.\nAntigua and Barbuda wishes to urge once again the adoption of mandatory sanctions of a comprehensive nature against the Pretoria regime.\nIt is important here to reaffirm that apartheid cannot be reformed\u00b7, it has to be abolished. The racist regime continues to stifle all opposition to its abhorrent practices, and this includes the insulation of South Africa from scrutiny by the international press and the banning of anti-apartheid organizations in that country. We consequently reaffirm our commitment to the just struggle of the oppressed people of South Africa and Namibia - people who remain undeterred despite the intensity of the brutality of the racist Pretoria regime. \nAntigua and Barbuda welcomes the prospect for peace in Angola and Namibia. Peace has evaded Angola since independence and the international community is looking forward to a withdrawal of all foreign troops from Angola's soil. Likewise, we look forward to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), in an effort to bring peace and ultimate independence to Namibia. We are understandably both hopeful and sceptical, for well we remember that five years ago the Lusaka Agreement was to have produced a cease-fire, a disengagement on the part of South Africa, and the establishment of a joint commission for the purpose of monitoring. This agreement, however, collapsed by the end of the year of its inception, be it recalled.\nIn Central America, we recognize that the momentum for peace has faltered since the signing of the Esquipulas II agreement; yet we are certain that the principal merit of the agreement lies in the democratization it brings to the area. Antigua and Barbuda urges full compliance by all the parties concerned. We are appalled by the devastation of national economies and the misery generated by civil conflicts. It is our firm belief that these conflicts are tooted in poverty. There is thus a need for a broader approach than is now evident in the solution of Central America's problems. In the same vein, our hearts go out to the Panamanian people in this period of extreme difficulty, and it is our hope that there will be a quick resolution of the crisis. \nIn Afghanistan, the determined efforts of the Secretary-General and of Diego Cordovez produced, through the Geneva Accords in April, a basis for all Afghans \u03bf exercise their right to self-determination. The fact that this is the first instance in which the two most powerful States have become co-guarantors of an agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Secretary-General is of particular importance, especially to those of us from developing countries. This approach signals the beginning of the end of proxy wars waged by nations whose material storages can ill afford the squandering of scarce resources brought on by wars. We therefore urge all parties involved to co-operate with the United Nations good offices mission.\nMy country welcomes the new atmosphere which has emerged between the French\nGovernment and the Malenesian Kanaks as much as we applaud the initiation of a dialogue over the past year between the parties to the Kampuchean conflict. The people of Kampuchea yearn for peace and the framework has to be established in which citizens of that country are able to have a government from among their own - a government which will guarantee basic and fundamental human rights. The yearning for peace is also evident in Cyprus. The fact that the two sides involved in the Cyprus conflict have expressed their desire to meet without pre-conditions and to attempt to reach a negotiated settlement on all aspects of their problems, augurs well for the future. We therefore encourage the\nSecretary-General to continue in his perseverance in obtaining a workable solution. \nI turn to the Middle East. The situation in the Middle East continues to have the propensity for generating repercussions in a far wider sphere. We therefore urge the United Nations to continue in its quest to find a lasting settlement to the Middle East question - a settlement which will guarantee the right of all States and peoples in the region to exist in peace within recognised and secure borders. The best hope for such a solution lies in the convening of an international peace conference specifically geared to problems of the Middle East. The interests of all concerned are best served through dialogue and negotiation in an atmosphere dedicated to peaceful resolution.\nA peaceful resolution in Lebanon is also desirable. The endless cycle of communal violence in Lebanon is most distressing. Antigua and Barbuda stands ready to endorse any proposal leading to full Lebanese sovereignty over the entire country which guarantees the withdrawal of foreign troops from the area.\nOne final word. In South-East Asia we acknowledge the existence of two Koreas as a consequence of the Second World War. We have, however, been pleased to hear of the new policy of the Republic of Korea as enunciated in the special declaration of President Roh Tae Woo on 7 July 1988. The President's statement embodies an epoch-making six-point policy on inter-Korean affairs and lays the basis for a reconciliation between the two countries.\nThe Republic of Korea is celebrating its fortieth anniversary. It has demonstrated full maturity, as evidenced by its hosting of the twenty-fourth summer Olympic Games in Seoul and the establishment of diplomatic relations with as many as 121 Member States of the United Nations. When we consider that there are other countries in the United Nations which had suffered the same divided fate as the Koreas, we can find no logical cause or explanation to deny the Republic of Korea membership in this body.\nWe are indeed thrilled that the United Nations has been an important participant in the easing of world tensions. We believe that the United Nations must continue to play an ever-increasing role in international affairs if peace and justice are to become universal. Small nation States like my own look increasingly to international law for protection, and we are keenly aware of the role of the United Nations in promoting respect for law.\nAs workers in Antigua and Barbuda prepare to celebrate 50 successful years of trade unionism, let us here commit ourselves in this forty-third session to securing for the world's peoples a greater degree of freedom and justice through this the parliament of parliaments.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nSir, permit me to extend to you my congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. I am confident that with your wisdom and diplomatic skills you will effectively guide the deliberations of this session to a successful conclusion. To this end, I assure you of my delegation's support and co-operation.\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, I convey the deep appreciation of my government for the excellent manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the last session.\nI also take this opportunity to thank our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for his commitment and for his endeavours towards the fulfilment of our common desire for international peace and security. The award of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prise to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is indeed a worthy tribute to those who have risked and are risking their lives for peace. \nSince last we gathered here a year ago there has been a dramatic change in the international political climate. The role of the United Nations as a peacemaker has been reaffirmed. My delegation is therefore encouraged by the recent positive developments, which have brought rays of hope and the promise of peace to the troubled regions of our world. \nWe are heartened that, after eight years of conflict the guns have fallen silent in the Persian Gulf and peace is being given a chance. The basis of that peace is Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We therefore earnestly appeal to Iran and Iraq, and all Member States of the United Nations, to co-operate with the Secretary-General in the effort to find a lasting solution to this conflict.\nThe situation in Afghanistan also shows signs of hope and the process of peace. Hence, we welcome the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan and urge all parties to respect the letter and the spirit of those Accords to ensure nothing is done to slow the progress towards peace.\nWe regard with optimism the apparent breakthrough in the 13-year war in Western Sahara. We note, particularly, the proposal by the Secretary-General in August whereby a cease-fire would be declared, followed by a referendum for the people of Western Sahara.\nMy Government also regards with equal optimism the tripartite, agreement which provides for the withdrawal of South African troops from Angola and the possible implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia. It is our earnest hope that South Africa will respect the tripartite agreement and proceed to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We have always supported the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia and take this opportunity to reaffirm this support.\nThe ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - by the two super-Powers is a major achievement of our tine. We commend the display of political will by the Soviet Union and the United States to reach an agreement calling for a 50 per cent reduction in their strategic nuclear arsenals. It is the hope of ay delegation that this achievement in disarmament will eventually lead to comprehensive disarmament, which includes not only nuclear weapons but conventional and chemical weapons a  well.\nSolomon Islands reaffirms its support for the principle of the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas, to be pursued without outside interference. We would welcome and support membership of the United Nations for both countries. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Republic of Korea on its role as host of the very successful XXIV summer Olympic Games.\nWhile we hail with gratification the developments in Afghanistan, the Western Sahara and the Persian Gulf, we are still gravely concerned about the atrocious situation in South Africa, where apartheid remains the root cause of conflict. Apartheid is institutionalised racism. In itself, it is evil. It must be eradicated - not reformed, but eradicated.\nWith many sanctions already imposed and with the Pretoria regime showing no signs of giving in, it is time for the international community to take the only option left that is, to apply comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  My delegation reiterates its abhorrence of apartheid and continues to support the call for comprehensive sanctions against South Africa.\nIn the Middle East, peace is still denied to peoples of the region. My Government shares the view that the convening of an international conference on the Middle East sponsored by the United Nations would pave the way for a peaceful, comprehensive and just settlement of this conflict. We urge the Secretary-General to continue his good efforts to ensure the convening of such a conference. \nThe situation in Kampuchea still requires surveillance by the international community. Hostilities have now entered their tenth year. My Government urges the' withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops so as to facilitate the settlement of the Kampuchean problem by the Kampuchean people themselves, free from outside interference.\nOn 2 December 1986 the Assembly adopted resolution 41/41 A inscribing New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. This, in effect, gave the United Nations a major role in the decolonisation process in New Caledonia. My Government reaffirms the stand that the United Nations, through its appropriate organ, must be actively involved in this process, as must all the people of New Caledonia, including the original inhabitants, the indigenous Kanak people. To continue turning a blind eye to the United Nations principles &s well as the wishes of the major communal group could certainly take us back to the sad events of the morning of 5 May 1988 on the island of Ouvea in New Caledonia. Therefore, we are encouraged that the new Prime Minister of France has reopened dialogue with all the parties in New Caledonia and is working towards a long-term solution of the problems in this Non-Self-Governing Territory.\nAt the nineteenth South Pacific Forum, which was held in Nufualofa, Tonga, last month and which my Prime Minister attended, the Forum leaders also welcomed the efforts of the administering Power to bring about a resumption of the dialogue between all the communities in New Caledonia. The Forum, inter alia, urged France to ensure that the proposed 1988 act of self-determination would be consistent with the established decolonisation practices and principles of the United Nations. The road to the resolution of the problems of New Caledonia is certainly not a smooth one. There are real problems to overcome. But with these new developments we look forward to an internationally accepted self-determination exercise in New Caledonia.\nI have already welcomed the ratification of the INF Treaty by the two super-Powers. This is a major step forward in the disarmament process. Another major step on the road to disarmament is the Treaty of Sarotonga, which declares the South Pacific region a nuclear-free zone. We are therefore deeply grateful to the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, which have ratified Protocols 2 and 3 of the Treaty. We are disappointed, however, that France, the United Kingdom and the United States have yet to sign and ratify Protocols 1, 2 and 3 of the Treaty  and we call on then to do so as a genuine demonstration of their goodwill towards the South Pacific region and its peoples, and the peoples of the world. \nNuclear testing in our region ha\u00b7 always been one of our major concerns. It remains a grave concern to us. Despite our numerous calls for the complete halting of these tests, France continues to carry out its nuclear-testing programme on Mururoa Atoll in Polynesia. I do not wish to insult the intelligence of this Assembly by giving a lecture on the effects of nuclear pollution. We all know the facts; it kills. Solomon Islands is totally opposed to nuclear testing, dumping and the use of nuclear weapons in our region. We again call on France to cease its nuclear-testing programme in our region.\nThe current trend in the world economy is another problem of enormous propositions for developing countries. Our efforts to increase our export capacity are being frustrated by the distorted policies characterising the current international trading system. Those policies force a standstill, or, yet worse, negative growth, in our fledgling economies.\nSolomon Islands is a primary commodities producer. Restricted entry into the world market for these commodities is a heavy burden on our already ailing economy. My Government, therefore, attaches special importance to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The question of reforming the agricultural and commodity trading systems must be resolved. We earnestly hope that the deliberations during the Uruguay Round will create greater opportunities for the developing countries to acquire a just share of the world's resources.\nIn this context, I must say that special consideration must be given to the unique problems of island developing countries. Small internal markets, limited resources, poor communications, distance and natural disasters are but a few of those problems. On behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands, convey to the Government and people of Jamaica our deepest sympathy on their country\u00b7 devastation by hurricane Gilbert. We understand and share their grief, for which\u00b7, on numerous occasions in the past, been through similar ordeals at nature's capricious hands.\nThe point is that when addressing our special needs there must be some flexibility in the aid policies of our aid donors and of the world's financial institutions. Having said that, I must add that when it comes to trade we in the Pacific suffer more than other island developing countries simply because of our isolation from the major world markets. I arrived from Brussels just a few hours ago. Brussels is 11,500 miles from Honiara. Our commodities, therefore, have to take the long and expensive route to the European Economic Community (EEC). Despite the various problems we encounter as an island economy, we have striven and will always strive to better the lives of our people. We have to learn to live within our means - our means being our available resources and the different forms of assistance we believe to be available to us from friendly nations and multinational institutions.\nIn this regard, we welcome the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty with the United States, which came into force during the year, so that benefits are already being received by the countries party to the Treaty, including my own. We look forward to achieving similar arrangements with other major fishing nations which fish in our waters. In this respect, my Government is very grateful to the Canadian Government and people for making available approximately $US 10 million to the Forum Fisheries Agency, which is based in Solomon Islands, for the development of the marine and ocean resources of the South Pacific region. \nEvery year there is a special occasion. Thin year, on 7 July, Solomon Islands celebrated its tenth independence anniversary. We are very grateful for the kind congratulatory messages sent to us during our anniversary celebrations. It was also 10 years ago that I stood here to bear witness to the admission of my country to the Membership's Midst as the 150th member. My pledge then was that Solomon Islands would accept the obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and undertake to fulfil them. Today, let me conclude by reaffirming that pledge and the commitment of my country to the lofty ideals of this body.\nFinally, I should like to thank you. Mr. President, and our fellow members of the United Nations for letting Solomon Islands have the last word in this general debate.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe Philippines greets you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. It is not only the votes of the membership of this body, but your own erudition, experience and diplomatic skills and your country's brilliant contributions to this Organization that have elevated you to that exalted office. My delegation awaits the impact of your shining leadership on the labours of the Assembly.\nYou succeed Mr. Peter Florin, the President at the forty-second session of the General Assembly, and the Philippines appreciates his performance in that capacity. It was a performance that was at once vigorous and unselfish. We recall that he returned to New York several times to preside over our resumed sessions and at one special session, which attests to his commitment as well as to his diplomacy \nI bring the General Assembly a message from the poor of my country. Why are many Filipinos poor?\nThey ate not poor because they come from an indolent race. Out countrymen now covet the earth - two million of us in the Americas, half a million in the Middle East, a quarter of a million in Europe, half a million in Asia and the Pacific - seekers all of toil and of life, teachers of nations, physicians of men, builders of industry, designers of modules that challenge the stars and settle on the moon, men and women of skill and diligence, like those of Europe who settled America and here built a new world.\nThey ate not poor because they do not know how to fight for their rights.\nThey were the first in Asia to shed their blood against Western colonialism and produce their own republic. Ninety years later, they were the first nation in the world to mass by the millions, to confront guns with rosaries and bring down a dictator without the shedding of blood. In those four bloodless, spectacular days of February, under the leadership of Corazon C. Aquino, they raised the new peaceful rallying cry of \\\"People power.\u00b7\\\" which even now resonates in the streets of nations in transition on more than one continent of this earth.\nThey are not poor because they multiply too fast. They try not to, against their own human instincts. And they know that in rich nations it is the building of cities and industries, not the extermination of human instincts, that has reduced this multiplication.\nThey are not poor because their nation does not grow. For our country does grow. Now that we are free again, although we remain harassed by the extremes of left and right, we have kept to our democratic course and our economy is growing again, last year by S.6 per cent, this year by 6.8.\nWhy, then, do so many of us remain poor?\nThirty years ago, our country was second in East Asia in economic development, next only to Japan. Twenty years ago, along with those developing countries you now call the South, we were growing faster than the developed countries of the North.\nThen one day the countries that produce oil decided to form a cartel. And why not? Other countries more powerful then they had deprived them of their just profits and it was time that they stood up, joined forces and assumed control of the wealth that God had given them.\nWe in the South who do not produce oil waited for the new oil alliance to share their profits with us. But they did not. The South was not ready with the mechanism to attract and absorb these profits.\nTherefore, the oil producers chose instead to store their gains in the bank vaults of the North. The petrodollar was born, and the bankers of the North opened their doors wide to the money-famished financial planners of the South, including those of my country. We started to borrow, borrow, borrow, enticed by abundant funds and low interest rates. Some countries learned to control themselves, to borrow just enough, to use their borrowed money wisely and begin to grow.\nBut for our leaders the lure of more and easy borrowing was too strong.\nThen one day a dictator seized power in our country. There was no more legal opposition, no free press to question enormous r hasty loans. Absolute power produced absolute corruption. The petrodollar was recycled back to the North in the bank deposits of the dictator and his friends.\nNo one warned us of the cataclysm that had to follow. Instead a banker of the North said to just \\\"Do not worry. Sovereign countries never go bankrupt.\\\"\nAnd so, indeed, they lent us more and more. These debts were at that time guaranteed by the Government of the debtors. And sovereign Governments never disappear. They just change hands.\nThus it was that in 1970, our country and those of the South owed only 100 billion dollars to the North. Ten years later we owed $500 billion. Now we owe 1 trillion.\nIt was our Mexican friends who were first to realize it could go no further. They produced oil but its value went down when the cartel collapsed and industry decided on other ways of fuelling itself. Mexico said \\\"We have no money. We cannot pay\\\" and the South woke up to the realities of borrowing.\nThe banks of the North began to say: \\\"We have been lending too much, even more than 20 times our capital.\\\" And so now we must pay more for every dollar we borrow, and there are less of those dollars to borrow. And so, after we were titillated into a borrowing pattern - nay, a borrowing spree - the spigot is turned off. Up to 1981 the money was coming into our countries: now it is going out. Now we of the South must together send out 320 billion more than we are receiving every year from our international creditors. Last year alone our country sent out 31.7 billion more than it received.\nOur country must now export much more and import mud\u00b7 less just to earn the money with which to pay our debt. Yet, what do some of our friends of the North do? They make it harder for us to export. When they decide that we are exporting enough, they want us to restrain ourselves. When our exports displease their labour, they cut them down. When we export the fruits of our soil, they demand health certificates. When we export what we manufacture, they decide that our products are not good enough. When they cannot say that our products are not good enough\u00a1, they say it is our packaging that is no good. And when we have done everything to please them, they inundate us with customs documentation.\nWhen the countries of the North want to export their service industries to us - their insurance, their banking, their finance - they ask us for market access, national treatment, right of establishment. Yet, are the market services of the North open to the South? If it is their services, they call it export. If it is our services, they call it immigration.\nSo many of our factories, unable to export more, to import enough of the raw material that they needed for their products, shut down many of their machines. By 1985, 600,000 in our country had lost their jobs this way. In despair many were tempted to join the rebels in the mountains} many who understood and who saw that death by bullet could be less painful than death by debt. But, though many are starving, they have faith in the ways of peace, which are the ways of the nations united in this Assembly. This then is the message I bring to the Assembly from the poor of my country. It is the same message from the poor of the world, the poor who suffer, but who want peace, not violence. It is a message of hope, not of despair. How do we respond?\nAs Polonius advised his son Laertes:\n\\\"Neither a borrower, nor a lender be,\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend.\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\\\" (Hamlet, 1: iii)\nShakespeare's admonition may have its relevance for an adolescent who is about to set out on his own, but it has no appeal for a young nation that must grow, must build, must stoke its furnaces with the resources of other nations.\nYet borrowing can be heady stuff for eager nations and avid lending houses, and the point of crisis is not difficult to reach. Debt crises are not new in this century, and they have not been beyond solution. In fact, when the crisis is bilateral and horizontal, between North and North, lessens have been learned in time and new disasters averted.\nAt Versailles in 1919 the victorious Allies of the First World War refused to condone the enervating obligations of the defeated Germans, and Germany went to the radical right for a solution. That solution produced the Second World War, The Allies, again victorious in 1945, remembered Versailles, and in London, forgave 70 per cent of the German debt. The same bold visionary leadership that executed that condemnation also conceived the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\nBut when it is a multilateral and vertical crisis, between North and South, the condemnations come much more swiftly and painfully. There was one such crisis in the 1930s. At that time the creditor countries refused and most debtor countries responded quickly and simply. They refused to pay their debts. A few did pay like Argentina, where British leverage could administer sanctions. But for the rest of the debtors no sanction was to be feared. There was no hegemonic Power to enforce international contracts. When most of the debtors refused to pay, the world economy did not collapse. The debtors could not pay and the creditor Governments chose to look the other way. There was only the impulse to create the institutions that would provide the framework for international economic relations.\nThere is one hegemonic Power today that could crack the whip: the united States of America. But the crisis is enormous and there are rising economic Powers with which the enforcer must co-ordinate if order and resolution are to be readied. This is not happening. Today the fund well is dry and there have followed recession and inflation. The response of most creditor countries has been to tighten monetary policy and reduce trade deficits. And so the cost of debt has increased.\nFor its part, the United States has opted for supply-side economics, continuing budget deficits, reducing tax rates and expanding the economy. In the North there has followed turmoil in interest rates as well as unemployment which is now being blamed on imports from the South.\nThe South is now being asked to undertake structural reforms and to rely more on the market and the private sector. But the North with all its technology could solve its unemployment problem# not by blaming imports from the South# but by getting out of economic activities in which the North has no economic advantage: textiles# garments, shoes.\nWe repeat our salute last week to President Ronald Reagan's veto of the protectionist textile Bill. That masterful act of principled determination was a signal of hope for justice in international free trade and of faith in international negotiations and institutions. We also applaud Japan which has offered to recycle $30 billion of its annual surplus by supporting export industries in developing countries. But for this strategy to succeed the developing countries must know what it would be profitable to pursue\u00b7, and to know this they must also know what structural transformations can take place in the North.\nThe debt crisis is not a problem only for the debtor\u00b7, it is a problem for the creditor; it is a problem for the world. Therefore, the solution cannot be sectoral; it must be total. It cannot be regional; it must be global. It cannot be technocratic; it must be political.\nEconomic and finance ministers of the world must confer. That is vital. But that is not sufficient. The men and women who make political policy - it is these who must agree on the final resolution of this global tragedy. In this last year, in many capitals of the world, political policy-makers of this stature have met and called for valiant responses but have not yet found formal decisive consensus: in Manila last December at the summit of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Toronto last June at the summit of the Seven, again, in Manila last June at the International Conference of Newly Restored Democracies; in Cyprus last month at the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement.\nHow shall we resolve debt? It is valuable to reschedule debt. But it is even more precious and human to forgive debt. The makers of policy must agree to resolve the question, who is entitled to debt relief and debt forgiveness? Is it possible to fix standards rather than leave the answer to the strengths and weaknesses of negotiators?\nThey must agree to alternative adjustment programmes to promote growth that will suit both planned and free economies. They must also develop new modes to carry out global solutions. For the present mechanisms are not equipped for such a momentous mission.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) approaches short-term problems, like balance of payments, with an average span of 18 months. But the structural and financial horizons of transnational debt can span a generation.\nThe World Bank has primarily concerned itself with financing projects, and, more recently, with programmes. Yet, it is only in the context of an aggregate panorama that the financial obligations of nations can be amply appreciated.\nIt is now seven years that the debt crisis has been thundering across our planet. The assault is overwhelming us because our defences are isolated and our strategies fragmented. I propose a global counter-attack by forces that will transcend geography and ideology. \nI propose an international debt and development commission. I propose that this commission be constituted of men and women whom the world recognizes for their redoubtable seasoning in foreign policy, diplomacy, finance, political economy, trade and development. I propose that the Commission be provided not with a new bureaucracy but with a staff seconded from outstanding multilateral agencies. I propose that the commission be rendered a life-span of five years.\nI propose that this commission be mandated to evaluate alternative schemes for global debt management, move to concrete action to rectify the trading system consistent with that global debt management, formulate institutional changes in international agencies so that they may discharge a more comprehensive role in the process, commend specific actions to member Governments to address alternative schemes, oversee and monitor its own output.\nI propose that the commission conduct its own study, but look into recent proposals on global debt management, including the report on an international debt management authority made by the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the United States House of Representatives, and the French plan announced by President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand.\nI propose that with this mandate the commission develop standards under which debtor countries nay qualify for debt relief or debt forgiveness; formulate alternative adjustment programmes that promote sustainable growth among nations accompanied by an expansion of their capacity to pay their debts; specify actions, such as the amending of bank laws, necessary for this growth; offer policy practices for industrial countries, newly industrializing economies, middle-income and low-income nations; identify precise interactions between debt, trade and growth which require multilateral response.\nI propose that this commission submit these measures to the United Nations for approval, proclamation and execution. The United Nations has been demonstrating an expanding genius for waging triumphant campaigns for disengagement - in Afghanistan, in the Middle East, even as it is now engaged in promising peaceful actions in Kampuchea, Western Sahara and Namibia.\nIt is a tribute to this General Assembly, to the Security Council, to the Headquarters and agencies, to the Secretariat and perhaps above all to Javier Perez de Cuellar, that the United Nations has at last become validated in its avowed designation, not only as the forum, but indeed as the engine par excellence for peace.\nYet what is this debt crisis but a monstrous threat to peace? Pope Paul VI once stood on this very podium and proclaimed that development is another word for peace.\nDebt, reasonable debt, even in the holy books, is sanctioned and is meant to develop man. But today the debt of nation to nation is not developing man. It is killing man.\nThe killing must be stopped, and only the nations of the world together can stop it. Stop it now on end the dream of peace in our time. Stop it now or answer to the generation of tomorrow for decimating the human number s of the generation of today. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me at the outset express our profound and sincere satisfaction over the fact that the helm of the current session of the General Assembly has been placed in hands as skilled and competent as those of Mr. Caputo. My delegation wishes to express to him its heartfelt congratulations on his election to this prestigious and demanding office. I am fully confident that he will not only live up to but significantly contribute to the tradition associating with his compatriots - Mr. Carlos Calvo and Mr. Louis Drago - and that he will guide the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly in such a way as to attain the meaningful results which we all seek. We wish also to express our warm greetings to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and to assure him of our unchanging respect and support for his indefatigable efforts.\nThe United Nations has recently proved its vitality and potential. The Polish delegation has come to the forty-third session strongly convinced of the urgent need for all Members of the United Nations assembled in this Hall to undertake yet another joint effort to further strengthen the role which this Organization has come to play in the world today, to promote positive experiences in its work while seeking to eliminate the lingering weaknesses. At present, we perceive auspicious tendencies in international affairs. They manifest themselves in reduced confrontation, the development of East-West\ndialogue, the resolve to settle regional conflicts but, above all, to halt the arms race. The Treaty signed at Washington entitles the international community to extend to the two signatories a fresh credit of confidence in respect of further disarmament measures, especially in the field of strategic arms, and the discharge of their singular responsibility for world peace and international security in the years to come. The Treaty has been instrumental in removing the psychological barrier that attaches to the view that the arms race is beyond man's control. \nPotentially the most profound changes have taken place in the philosophical aspect of international relations - an era where the new political thinking is making ever greater inroads. It signals, first of all, that effective and lasting resolution of the contemporary dilemmas cannot be accomplished except through political means, with equitable and democratic participation of all interested States, growing mutual confidence, and determination to seek compromise based on international law, with due account taken of the interests of all parties. Under the conditions prevailing today, security cannot be attained through military means alone.\nSecondly, it is encouraging that, as far as international affairs are concerned, the great humanist idea of the primacy, in international politics, of human values over group or class interests is reasserting itself.\nThe significance of these two phenomena cannot be confined to East-West relations alone; they are relevant to international relations at large and to the whole world, as is confirmed by the agreements concerning Afghanistan, the prospects of the termination of the Iran-Iraq conflict, the resolution of the Kampuchean problem, or the progress in regard to the Questions of the south of Africa,\nWe wish to place on record our great appreciation of the productive efforts of the Security Council, as well as of the Secretary-General, with a view to peaceful resolution of acute regional conflicts. We give these efforts our full support, as is manifested in Poland's decision to dispatch a group of army officers to the United Nations good offices missions in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as to those in Iran and Iraq.\nThe course of international events is also significantly influenced by the development of the internal situation in particular countries. The Polish case demonstrates all too clearly how difficult it is to reconstruct internal relations. In our profound democratic reforms we are guided by the principle of seeking political solutions based on a wide-ranging dialogue between all who stand on the firm ground of the Constitution and the legal order it established. We are seeking to create wide-ranging national understanding and to further democratize the methods of governing the country. We are undertaking these efforts in conditions of persisting economic difficulties and social impatience. We are fully aware that the transformations in Poland are being closely followed by the international community, for which what goes on in a State of 40 million people in the heart of Europe is not irrelevant.\nThe desire for undisturbed development of the positive tendencies in East-West relations is universal. Poland has irrevocably opted for profound socio-political and economic reform, aimed at increased effectiveness and export- and market-oriented restructuring of the economy. We want to take an active, broadly conceived part in the international division of labour, in keeping with the principle of mutual benefit. In this respect we count on the co-operation of all our partners, including creditor States, both on a bilateral basis and in the international financial organizations. We are confident that all States will have understood, and will lend their support to, the Polish Government's efforts with a view to reforms. We are confident that, given the ameliorating international climate and the increasing co-operation with all States, Poland will be able \u00bfo overcome its present difficulties and, as so far, will continue making its contribution to the consolidation of international security, detente and comprehensive international co-operation.\nThe world's primary integrating factor is the common fate of mankind. There is an urgent need to solve global problems and, unfortunately, global threats. There is a growing conviction that only together can we stand up to the challenges of the day, and only together can we hope to survive. \nThe United Nations must become to an ever greater extent the primary multilateral forum where solutions to the major world problems of our time can be worked out. Among such problems, the question of the consolidation of peace in international security remains the central one. Some three months ago, the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament concluded its debates in this Hall. Contrary to the expectations of world public opinion, of a majority of nations and Governments, including my own, the session failed to conclude its work with the adoption of a final document. The significance of the third special session consists, however, in the fact that it has demonstrated to the world the outer limits of compromise that are feasible at present. As will be recalled, out of a total of 67 paragraphs of the draft final document, agreement proved possible on 61. These considerable and valuable achievements must not be wasted. They must be consolidated and further developed by, among other things, resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly at its current session.\nThe Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty, which met in the capital of my country last July, has submitted a programme of concrete disarmament undertakings. The documents of the meetings, which, at Poland's request, have been circulated as official documents of the forty-third session of the General Assembly, reaffirm adherence to the ideals of a world rid of arms of mass destruction and all forms of violence, a world based on the principles of mutual and equal security, democratic coexistence and wide-ranging, equitable co-operation. \nThe States parties to the Warsaw Treaty have addressed an appeal to the international community at large, especially the States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the States participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, to increase efforts to bring about the early conclusion of meaningful agreements on the reduction of arms and armed forces and the consolidation of security and stability, as well as to refrain from any steps likely to make progress in that direction more difficult.\nThe Political Consultative Committee has recognized the following as priority objectives! a 50 per cent reduction of the strategic offensive arms of the USSR and the United States of America; the prohibition of nuclear weapon tests; the elimination of chemical weapons; and the reduction of armed forces and conventional arms in Europe, with a corresponding reduction of military expenditures.\nThe disarmament initiatives offered by the Warsaw Treaty and the Alliance's individual members, including Poland, over the past few years, also remain valid.\nThese issues, among other things, have for years been on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament. The General Assembly has also repeatedly issued appeals for the process of negotiations to be accelerated. For years we have found that the only progress scored at Geneva has related to chemical weapons. Yet even in that province, regrettably, one finds slow-downs and diverse impediments to the negotiating process piling up, relating, for instance, to the question of verification, despite the fact that the USSR and other socialist States are prepared to accept far-reaching compromise solutions.\nThe current session of the United Nations General Assembly offers a good opportunity to issue an appeal for a constructive reaction to the initiatives put forward by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. The need for concrete actions in the field of disarmament was similarly pointed out by the conference of non-aligned countries in Nicosia.\nThe reduction of military confrontation should begin where catastrophe could most easily occur. Inevitably, we arrive here at the problem of Europe. It was on that continent that deep divisions first emerged under the surveillance of the mightiest military potentials ever. It has, therefore, become the lightest risk area, but also one that offers singularly great opportunities.\nSpecific to Europe, and at the same time critically important for its security, is the sphere of conventional disarmament. The positive evolution of the international situation, announced in the Budapest appeal of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty, and the subsequent constructive response of the States members of NATO have led to substantive progress in preparations for the negotiating process of the 23 States. Poland and the other States parties to the Warsaw Treaty are prepared to do their utmost to ensure a constructive negotiating process, as they indicated in a special statement on negotiations concerning the reduction of armed forces and conventional arms in Europe adopted at the last meeting of the Political Consultative Committee, in Warsaw.\nThe socialist States have come out in favour of the commencement of new negotiations in 1988, stressing that the priority objective of such negotiations ought to be the achievement on the continent of Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals, of a situation in which the Warsaw Treaty and NATO States retain a level of armed forces and armaments indispensable for defence but far from sufficient to launch a surprise attack and conduct offensive operations.\nThe first stage of such negotiations should be concentrated on reaching equal and lower collective levels of manpower and conventional armaments for States members of the two alliances, the prevention of surprise attack and the establishment of an effective system of verification of compliance with future treaties, including mandatory on-site inspections. These proposals respect the principle of equal security for all the parties concerned. \nPoland has always attached great importance to the consolidation of peace and security in Europe and sought to make its own genuine and autonomous contribution to the European disarmament process. The Jaruzelski plan for decreasing armaments and increasing confidence in central Europe is only the latest manifestation of that policy. The various aspects of the implementation of the plan were addressed in detail in a message from Wojciech Jaruzelski to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. They were also dealt with in a statement by the Government of Poland containing an expanded version of the plan.\nI once again emphasize from this rostrum that, in view of the convergence of the proposed plan and the content of documents of the Political Consultative Committee adopted at its Warsaw meeting last July, and in the light of the views and comments of other Governments, our conviction has been strengthened that the plan fits perfectly the pattern of European disarmament undertakings, and represents their most timely and concrete manifestation, going a long way towards meeting the expectations of the broadest social strata, as well as those in many official circles. The plan offers a solution that responds positively to the requirement for the consolidation of security in central Europe, yet is not without a universal relevance owing to the distinct possibility of applying the ideas it advances to solutions on a Europe-wide scale and beyond. On behalf of the Government of Poland, I wish to reaffirm our readiness and determination to offer constructive co-operation to all interested Governments for the further development of the plan. \nWe are persuaded that reduction of the level of armed forces and armaments in Europe would be a major factor conducive to the construction of a common European home. Its corner-stone must be due respect for the post-war political and territorial order on our continent. Such a home should provide an ever greater possibility of promoting dialogue and mutually advantageous all-round co-operation, open to the world, in keeping with the process commenced some 13 years ago in Helsinki.\nThis explains the great importance that we attach to the CSCE meeting in Vienna. For our part, we shall spare no effort to bring it to a positive conclusion. Similarly, we consider economic co-operation in the European region most important, a fact borne out by the regional conference of the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) held at Cracow last August.\nDisarmament must be accompanied by the fostering of an appropriate social awareness and promotion of the involvement of public opinion in order to create a special moral sanction - that of universal condemnation of the use of force in international relations. Only in such a state of awareness can one understand Voltaire's observation that in the world there are only offensive wars, the defensive ones being mere resistance to armed robbery.\nIn a few weeks' time it will be 10 years since the adoption by the General Assembly, on the basis of a Polish initiative, of the Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace, a document whose overriding objective is, first and foremost, to \\\"demilitarize\\\" thinking and ensure that the seeds of the idea of peace fall on the fertile and well-prepared soil of the awareness of all people. The Declaration has not lost any of its topicality; on the contrary, the putting into effect of its recommendations is becoming an increasingly urgent task. Indeed, attempts to anchor the idea of peace firmly in people's minds make up a logical and indispensable supplement to the material infrastructure of peace.\nThe consolidation of peace and the strengthening of international security, disarmament and the growth of mutual confidence are among the conditions necessary to make possible the solution of many of the pressing problems of the day. Among these are global ecological and demographic threats, as well as those arising from external debt, all of which are growing in a snowball fashion. They defy solution by individual States and co-operation and combined efforts on a global scale ate necessary. This applies in the first place to relations between highly developed and developing countries, between creditors and debtors. \nThe tremendous external debt, especially dramatic for the poorest countries but also painful for those at the medium level of development which are highly indebted, undermines the basis for socio-economic development and international exchange of goods and services. The shortage of hard currency to finance imports cripples reforms, restructurization and modernization of industry. National efforts in respect of economic adjustment encounter barriers to the financing of development. A practical demonstration of the co-responsibility of creditor and debtor countries, with the appropriate involvement of banks and international financial institutions, in an effort to loosen and untangle the noose of indebtedness becomes absolutely indispensable. The General Assembly already has at its disposal resolutions adopted at its two previous sessions from which it clearly follows that an individual approach to solving sue- problems should be followed as soon as possible by multilateral measures. Such relief action should either precede or constitute a preliminary phase of agreed steps in favour of debtor countries, to stimulate effectiveness and make possible export-oriented restructuring of their economies - undertakings reinforcing the internal efforts of many debtor countries, which often involve acute social sacrifices. The Cracow Debt and Development Research Centre, which co-operates with the relevant United Nations institutions, is now concentrating its attention precisely on such problems.\nThe state of affairs is much the same as far as the protection of the environment is concerned. Poland values highly the United Nations record in this respect, especially the resolutions of the forty-second session of the General Assembly adopted on the basis of the Brundtland report and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) recommendations. None the less, there is a distinct and pressing need for major new, joint undertakings in regard to the protection of the environment. Our Organization should strive to do more than it has so far in that field. For instance, one can conceive of the establishment and implementation within its framework of a concept of international ecological security - a code of binding principles and norms of conduct of States in the field of protection of the environment. Appropriate proposals in that respect were formulated at the Warsaw meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty in a document entitled \\\"The implications of the arms race for the environment and other aspects of ecological security\\\".\nHowever, even the best international legal regulations will prove insufficient unless accompanied by material means for their implementation. Owing to the lack of financial and technical resources, ecology-safe development may well prove for some countries a luxury beyond their possibilities. This is the reason for the need for identification by appropriate international bodies, including those within the United Nations system, of areas of threat, where international aid should be forthcoming with a view to the application of recognized norms of protection of \\\"\\\"the environment. It need not be financial assistance. For instance, implementation of the principle of unrestricted transfer of experience, know-how and technology in the field of the environment, as proposed by Wojciech Jaruzelski at the fortieth anniversary session of the United Nations General Assembly, would be of considerable consequence.\nAs postulated by my delegation, the urgent need to expand international economic co-operation and strengthen constructive bonds and interdependency in the world economy requires that we proceed forthwith to promote confidence in international economic relations. The United Nations system, at both regional and global level, has a considerable role to play in that respect, a fact recognized in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. The strengthening of confidence in that sphere would promote a new and more just international economic order and the enhancement of international economic security.\nWe must note with satisfaction the marked improvement in the climate of international co-operation within the United Nations system also in respect of social and cultural problems and human rights. For mankind, the resolution of the most burning social questions is as critical as the prevention of an arms race or an economic crisis.\nOn Poland's initiative, the General Assembly at the previous session adopted a resolution calling for the examination of the possible proclamation by the United Nations of an International Year of the\u00b7 Family. Our initiative has met with the support of many States, which have made known their positive views in that regard. The conditions are increasingly favourable to the proclamation by the General Assembly of such an International Year of the Family at the outset of the next decade.\nThere exists a tremendous interest in humanitarian problems, especially those pertaining to human rights. Along with other States, Poland attaches considerable significance to the observance of the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We intend to take an active part in that important event.\nIt is with considerable satisfaction that we welcome the conclusion of the preliminary phase of the long work on the preparation of a draft convention on the rights of the child. Let us hope that in a year's time, at the next session of the General Assembly, the Member States will adopt the convention to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of the Child. \nThe problems I have commented upon can be solved provided we succeed in turning our Organization into \u0430 genuine centre of co-operation and co-decision exercised by all its Members. We have to strive together to enhance the performance of the United Nations and of its principal organs - the Security Council and the General Assembly - as well as to promote the role of the Secretary-General, including in the settlement of inter-State conflicts through negotiations, good offices, mediation or conciliation. It is indispensable to make use in a more effective manner of the entire United Nations system for the maintenance of peace and the consolidation of the primacy of international law. That is the objective of the initiative submitted by the socialist States, including Poland, to develop a comprehensive system of peace and international security.\nPoland is deeply convinced that a strong United Nations, faithful to its Charter, promoting the spirit of multilateral co-operation and successfully overcoming partisan interests, stands a very good chance of meeting the challenges of the day and the expectations of nations. We are fully prepared to make our contribution to the construction of such an Organization, in the belief that - in the words of the Charter - all nations ought to \\\"live together in peace with one another as good neighbours\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me at the outset, on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka, extend to Mr. Caputo of Argentina, our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-third session. My delegation would like to assure him of our support and full co-operation in the tasks ahead.\nOur appreciation is also due to Mr. Peter Florin, who discharged his duties as President of the forty-second session with skill, devotion and responsibility.\nWe applaud the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces as richly deserved recognition of the impressive record of the United Nations in keeping peace throughout the world. We congratulate the Secretary-General and his dedicated team on this fitting tribute. Three years ago, with considerable enthusiasm, we commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. A year later, hardly had the euphoria of that celebration evaporated than we were confronted with the prospect that the United Nations might not even be able to survive, because of budgetary constraints. International diplomacy, never at a loss for words, diagnosed this situation and described it as a crisis for multilateralism, a crisis brought about by unilateralism. Unilateralism seemed to be prevailing over multilateralism.\nMost dramatically, bilateralism, involving principally the Soviet Union and the United States, led to the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - widely accepted as the first real measure of disarmament, as distinct from the mere control or limitation of arms. The Moscow summit meeting also brought forth agreement that further bilateral efforts would be exerted towards the reduction by half of the super-Power strategic nuclear arsenals and towards a step-by-step halting of nuclear testing. The international community has welcomed these developments with enthusiasm.\nThe third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, a few months ago, offered the first major international forum for an assessment of international security and disarmament issues in the light of these new developments. Despite a greatly improved context of international relations in comparison with the first and second special sessions on disarmament, the third special session belied our expectations. The nexus between bilateral progress and multilateral advance did not prove to be automatic. The third special session's failure to produce a consensus final document seemed contrary to the hopeful developments of the time. In a sense, we have witnessed an encounter between bilateral approaches and multilateral demands, but the encounter has not been as discouraging as in the past. Nevertheless, the session recognized, but failed to document, the interdependent nature of the broad spectrum of global issues and the need for multilateral co-operation in their solution. If time ran out before a consensus document could be finalized, it must only mean that the exercise must continue on the basis of the many valuable proposals and ideas presented during the session.\nIn the Conference on Disarmament, the sole multilateral negotiating body of which Sri Lanka is a member, the hope of multilateral negotiations on a range of nuclear items has been frustrated. No progress is recorded in the report of the Conference, for example, on the priority issue of negotiating a total ban on nuclear testing. The purpose envisaged in the 1963 Partial Test-Ban Treaty is not to regulate and thereby condone testing below a certain threshold but to eliminate decisively all testing. As a parallel measure to discussions in the Conference on Disarmament Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and Yugoslavia have requested an amendment conference of States parties to the 1963 Treaty to consider its conversion into a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The Foreign Ministers of the countries members of the Non-Aligned Movement who met at Nicosia last month have endorsed that initiative.\nA collective approach has been sought in the Conference on the Prevention of an Arms race in Outer Space, the common heritage of mankind  which should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. The existing legal regime now applicable to outer space has played a significant role, but, given the rapidity of technological and strategic developments, it is insufficient to prevent the emplacement of weapons in outer space. My delegation will make every effort at this session of the General Assembly to continue with our initiatives to build the necessary consensus and move forward in this vital area. The recent use of chemicals weapons has been universally condemned, sustained negotiations have been pursued in the Conference on Disarmament towards the conclusion of a treaty banning the development, production, stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons. Some important issues remain unresolved, while the settlement of others has been delayed unduly. Considerable achievements have also been made in work between the two major chemical-weapons possessors, and we have noted the initiatives announced in this forum last week.\nThis session of the General Assembly will consider the question of preparing for the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons scheduled for 1990. As a State party to the Treaty, Sri Lanka naturally has a keen interest in facilitating a successful review of the obligations under that Treaty in all their aspects. We hope that agreement could be reached at this session to formulate a smooth preparatory process.\nA disarmament exercise that began as a Sri Lankan initiative with the support of non-aligned countries has long since acquired both regional and international dimensions. Following the 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, States of the region held a conference in 1979 that adopted seven principles of agreement for the implementation of the Declaration. Those included the non-use of force, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the freedom of peaceful navigation. Considerable work on issues of substance relating to the conference has already been accomplished by the Ad Hoc Committee. A consensus has been patiently built up now for the conference to be convened at Colombo at a date not later than 1990. Sri Lanka, particularly given the vastly improved international climate, expects that the concerned States will abide by the consensus. \nSince we last met the United Nations has succeeded in its negotiations in respect of Afghanistan, with the conclusion in April of this year of the Geneva Agreement. Sri Lanka congratulates the statesmanship displayed by all parties that made the agreement possible and hopes that that will remain in evidence during the implementation. We look forward to the conclusion of a comprehensive settlement of all issues to the satisfaction of all the people of the Afghan nation. \nSimilarly, in the Gulf conflict too the conciliatory mechanisms of the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, have proved their efficacy. It has been Sri Lanka's consistent position that that wasteful war should be ended, and a solution acceptable to both parties must be found. Therefore, Sri Lanka welcomes the decision of the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq to co-operate with the Secretary-General's representative to reach a comprehensive, honourable and enduring solution to that tragic conflict.\nThere are positive indications to be seen in the question of Cyprus as well, for which the United Nations once more can claim some credit. An essentially domestic inter-communal issue in Cyprus has been aggravated by the foreign occupation of part of its territory and by illegal unilateral actions towards separatism. However, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, talks have been resumed between the President of the Republic of Cyprus and the representative of the Turkish Cypriot community with a view to resolving the Cyprus problem in all its aspects.\nIn respect of Kampuchea, direct negotiations have brought hopes for an abatement of tensions infecting the entire region. The Djakarta meeting held in July this year brought together all parties concerned.. Sri Lanka is pledged to support and reinforce the Djakarta initiative.\nIn the Middle East the continued denial of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people persists as the root cause of the unrest in the region. The uprising in Israeli-occupied territory has acquired heroic proportions, and brutal attempts to suppress it have only strengthened the resistance to the occupation. A just, durable peace that guarantees security for all States and peoples in the region, including the Palestinians, can only be ensured by the withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. It is Sri Lanka's position that settlements illegally established must be dismantled and demographic changes thrust upon the occupied territories must be rendered null and void. Sri Lanka supports the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East called by the General Assembly in resolution 35/58 C as \u0430 means of a achieving a just and comprehensive solution to the complex of issues that is called the Middle East question.  It is essential that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, participate in the Conference on an equal footing with all other parties directly concerned in the Israeli-Arab conflict.\nThe path to Namibian independence has long since been charted by Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Sri Lanka salutes the Namibian people's struggle for self-determination and national independence in a united and undivided Namibia. It is our sincere hope that independent Namibia will occupy its seat in the community of nations in the near future. The recent developments, which have led to talks involving Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States are welcome in that they seek a negotiated and peaceful settlement of some issues of conflict in the region.\nAs in Namibia, so also in the entire southern African region, the apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa foster violence and conflict. Within South Africa the situation has deteriorated, with inhuman racist laws continuing to violate all norms of civilized behaviour, and with the ruthless security forces indulging in mass arrests and detention and causing injury and death to innocent civilians. Outside its borders, South African forces have committed acts of aggression against independent neighbouring African States whose only offence has been the defence of their sovereignty and freedom and the championing of the anti-apartheid cause. International pressure on the apartheid regime must continue to be increased. Comprehensive mandatory sanctions, to be imposed by the Security Council, have been declared the most effective peaceful means of dismantling apartheid.\nLet me now turn to the international economic scene. Global economic co-operation in real terms has been in a state of virtual atrophy. In roost developing countries the development process has been seriously handicapped, and in some even reversed. Real interest rates have swung upwards. Exchange rates have been fluctuating. The prices of primary commodities have drastically slumped and protectionist measures in certain import markets have aggravated their overall impact in developing countries. Development assistance has been reduced. The debt burden has had a debilitating impact on the economies of developing countries.\nOnly a rational concerted effort on the part of the entire global community can help re-order the prevailing insecure economic situation.\nIn respect of the debt issue, furthering the consensus achieved at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), it was proposed in the Conference's trade and development report that the current inadequate strategy of domestic adjustment and new lending be complemented by a wider recourse to consensual, orderly and systematic reduction of interest charges as stock of debt, in particular by debt forgiveness. The assumption behind those proposals is that countries benefiting from debt reduction could strengthen policies to improve efficiency of investment and achieve a substantial improvement in the export performance of indebted countries.\nAllied to this, and assuming great significance, are the complex trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round, which concern a variety of issues of crucial importance, particularly to developing countries. These include tropical and natural-resource-based products, tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and textiles and\nclothing. Unfortunately, the pursuit of unilateral trading gains has led to some trading entities callously bypassing the regulations and principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In sectors most crucial to developing countries seeking export markets, for example in the field of textiles and clothing, deviations from GATT principles are clearly evident. \n The commitment of major import markets to promoting easier access for the exports of developing countries is one which needs to be fulfilled with greater devotion and sincerity. Specifically, a measure o\u00a3 true understanding would be a rollback of current non-tariff barriers coupled with other measures to improve market access. Strict compliance with the standstill and rollback commitments reaffirmed at Punta del Este is vital to the success of the Uruguay Round. Developing countries should also be given credit in the Uruguay Round for unilateral measures of trade liberalization taken under programmes of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. A challenge for international economic co-operation is before us at the mid-term review of the Uruguay Round in Montreal this December by the ministerial session of the GATT's Trade Negotiations Committee.\nConcomitant with economic co-operation between developed and developing countries, economic co-operation among developing countries is also vital. The agreement on a global system of trade preferences reached recently is a step in the right direction, and could not only strengthen the base for economic development but also help reduce the existing over dependence on developed countries. The adoption of the agreement on the global system, signed by 48 countries, was a historic step, and it is important that those that have not yet signed and ratified the Belgrade agreement do so soon.\nPermit me at this stage to refer to two initiatives in the area of development co-operation in which Sri Lanka is deeply involved. Sri Lanka took an initiative in the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee in 1981 which called for a study of marine resources and their development potential in the Indian Ocean region. In January 1987, following careful study and preparation at expert level, the Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Conference was held at ministerial level in Sri Lanka to formulate a broad co-operative framework for developing the marine-affairs capabilities of the Indian Ocean States. A standing committee has since been established to guide its programme. We see this as an essential step in consolidating the benefits of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We believe that this venture could benefit further from the infusion of material and technical support from all sources.\nLast year the international community participated in observing the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless, declared by the United Nations on the initiative of the Honourable R. Premadasa, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. The proposal by the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) for a global strategy for shelter to the year 2000, formulated in response to a consensus call by this Assembly in resolution 42/191, is the next logical step in our collective endeavours to meet the shelter needs of deprived millions. \nThe widespread support enjoyed at the Economic and Social Council this summer is indicative of the political will to forge ahead with necessary material support. We look forward to the transformation of this political will into concrete action through a genuinely global venture as an exemplary exercise in multilateral co-operation.\nIn Sri Lanka where we have over the past few years had to withstand and overcome grave threats to our sovereignty and territorial integrity and face violent challenges to our cherished democratic institutions, we have still to banish the ugly phenomenon of violence and terrorism. The 13th Constitutional Amendment devolving a substantial measure of power from the centre to the provincial councils will have been fully implemented when elections to the North-Eastern Provinces take place in November. Thus, the fundamental restructuring of our post-colonial policy to accommodate the aspirations of all sections of our people for direct and active participation in the governing of our multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious nation will have been completed.\nIn the last few months, we have, in the tradition of our parliamentary democracy, held elections to seven of the eight Provincial Councils  In July four by-elections to Parliament were held, and this month another; and in December of this year a new President will be elected to succeed His Excellency President J. R. Jayewardene, who completes his constitutionally stipulated two terms of office. The democratic process is therefore as active in our small country as it has been since 1931, 57 years ago, when universal adult franchise was introduced in Sri Lanka.\nI am confident that with the innate wisdom of the people of Sri Lanka, enriched by a unique historical tradition of over 2,000 years and drawing on the religious philosophies flourishing in the country, Sri Lanka will press forward with the irreversible process of the healing of past wounds and the rehabilitation of the injury inflicted on our nation in human, political, social and economic terms. A period of peace and stability in which development can be accelerated is what our people richly deserve. And they will secure it for themselves through our democratic process, rejecting violence and anarchy.\nThe imperative of international co-operation, which is really what multilateralism is all about, applies to political and security issues, to economic and environmental issues and to social and humanitarian issues. Arguments and appeals based on justice, equity and human compassion have been advanced in this forum to bring peace where there is violence and conflict, security where there is tension and fear, development where there is deprivation and want. If then these arguments, backed as they are by the injunctions of the United Nations Charter, need further justification, there is the pragmatic logic of necessity - the compulsion of mutual interest. We are all links in a chain of human and national interdependence. The prospect for human survival and development will be only as strong as the weakest link in that chain.\nWhen we speak of the United Nations or multilateral approaches, we must project our vision beyond this building, beyond the delegates' desks and national name plates, beyond the microphones and earphones and beyond the resolutions and speeches, and focus on the impact of our work on the millions of people we represent. The fact is that the fate of each nation is intrinsically fused with the fate of the entire planet. This is not so merely in the negative sense in that a common nuclear threat hangs over all of us. In a positive sense, the political, economic and ecological well-being and development of each nation has to be pursued in co-operation, rather than at variance, with others. Our planet's resources are finite and even the most economically developed State cannot pursue unilateral policies in isolation from the rest of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Algerian delegation I should like to congratulate you, Sir, upon your election to the post of President of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. In so doing I extend to you my personal best wishes for success in the onerous but lofty task ahead of you. Your election is justified by the range of talents we have come to appreciate it is also a well-deserved tribute paid to the friendly nation of Argentina and a recognition of the great contribution made by Latin America to our joint endeavour for peace and co-operation among our peoples and nations.\nThe President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session,\nHr. Peter Florin, also earned the appreciation of the United Nations. We fulfilled his office skilfully, with devotion, ability and farsightedness. The Algerian delegation would like to join in the unanimous tribute paid to him.\nThe United Nations collectively, and our own nations individually, will remember Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar as the invaluable craftsman responsible for restoring the standing of the Organization and for winning it back its rightful place in contemporary international relations. 1 should like to express to him Algeria's congratulations and encouragement and assure him of its continuing and ,hole-hearted co-operation in any place and at any time that he may be engaged in the quest for peace, justice and co-operation, which he is pursuing in the name of and tot the better well-being of mankind.\nThe Organisation is emerging from a grave period of crisis, it has gone through a time of doubt, suspicion and dereliction, it has been afflicted by introspection and by the abandonment of multilateralism. \nHowever, in the darkest hours my country never ceased to believe, and to say, that the United Nations is the manifestation of an act of hope - and a strong, righteous hope never dies. The United Nations embodies this hope, which, in turn, represents the sustenance, the very well-spring, of the Organization.\nAre our joint endeavours geared now to the triumph of the values and ideals we set for ourselves when the Organization was founded?\nWe see the beginning of an improvement in international relations. Is this due to the dawning recognition that mankind is a whole and can have no future or destiny without understanding, co-operation and peace? Have we finally faced the fact that it is better to build together than to develop the tools for destruction - that mistrust and the thirst for domination are not inevitable, but rather that mankind has a collective genius in which are to be found the resources that can ensure well-being and happiness for all? Are we ready at last to use our ingenuity and ardour to construct a world of security for all, and to wage the real struggle, the struggle foe development?\nThese are the challenges, and they must be met.\nThere are already some portents of a better morrow for all. However limited they may be, these signs and developments are encouraging, and we hope that they will be matched by others of even greater scope and implication. In this respect Algeria once again hails the conclusion of the Treaty on the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear weapons. In so doing we hope that this first act of nuclear disarmament will be consolidated and expanded, and that negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons will follow the same path of wisdom and lead to a similarly welcome conclusion. \nDisarmament is an essential factor in the peaceful world order that we hope to build, and all of us have a contribution to make. Consequently, my country has always considered that bilateral measure in the disarmament field, measures we welcome and commend, should not rule out multilateral action, let alone be considered as a replacement for such action.\nThe regrettable failure of the third special session of the United Nations voted to disarmament  was an ill omen in this respect. We trust that this was simply an unfortunate incident on our route, a perverse development that will shortly be corrected. When the safety and peace of all mankind is at stake, unity in action and resolution is the order of the day.\nThe first disarmament measure too which I have just referred, as well as the other measures of which it is the forerunner, and to which we look forward, were possible only because of major changes that have taken place in the doctrines, policies and strategies underlying modern international relations. Heretofore these have been founded solely open the free exercise of the balance of forces and competition in pursuit of a decisive position in an arms race - to sum up: a view of the world and a logic both based en confrontation.\nThe Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries was founded at the time when this vision and this logic prevailed. It has constantly warned of the dangers end perils of such an approach for world peace. In the changes coming about today it cannot but find confirmation of the rightness of its arguments and of the positions it has taken at a time when there seemed to be no other alternative to the policy of strong-arm politics enshrined with the emergence of the two opposing alliances.\nWe have not yet seen the end of power-bloc politics, to which the movement of the Non-Aligned Countries was founded as an alternative 40 years ago, nor have we seen the end of great strategic rivalry. But we do see the first signs of change, and this suggests a possible alternatives an alternative of dialogue, trust and respect for the interests of others that offers the possibility of founding a new world balance upon a safer, stable and fairer set of relations.\nLet us find the wherewithal fear this alternative option. Let us have faith in it and find the political will-power that is required. Let us avoid the errors and miscalculations of the past, which suggested that a limited reshuffling of East-West relations would be sufficient for the establishment of a peaceful order. That faith did not stand up to the test. It was not enough to bring about a lasting relaxation of tensions between the two opposing military alliances. Rather, regional and local hotbeds of tension proliferated and grew worse.\nMankind is a single species, and peace must therefore also be indivisible. International relations will not be strengthened in terms of security, stability or duration unless all the countries in the world join in the task of building a peace that is unrestricted and has room for all. It is gratifying that today there is growing recognition of this vital need and that efforts are being made to improve East-West relations and to resolve regional and local conflicts, crises and tensions. That is the right approach, the only one to be followed, unswervingly, whatever the obstacles and whatever sacrifices have to be made. The road to peace will be long and difficult, whether we are dealing with disarmament, the establishment of trust and understanding between East and Hest or putting an end to the tragedies of the Middle East, the Gulf, southern Africa, Central America, Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Cyprus or Western Sahara, but there is no alternative to peace it is the only option.\nAs I told the Assembly last year, the contribution we intend to make to this collective enterprise for peace consists of the construction of the Great Arab Maghreb. Since I spoke last year this enterprise in which we are engaged with our partners in the region has been launched, and I think I can say that it has been well launched. The holding of the Maghreb summit in Algiers last June was the starting-point for the enterprise upon which we are setting out together P with imagination, determination, and whatever else it takes. Cur peoples and our countries have waited too long, and therefore our first concern now must be to make up for lost time. We are determined to do co, and we have the wherewithal. We are now working to equip the Maghreb entity we are establishing with the institutions, trained manpower and machinery which will then permit political co-ordination and economic integration on a rational, progressive basis, without thereby losing any opportunity to make further progress.\nA dynamic  and united Maghreb is therefore on the march. We are keeping the momentum going, thanks to a political resolve unaffected by ulterior motives or reservations. For the first time in its long history the greater Maghreb enjoys all the necessary conditions for unity. However, we are aware of the obstacles on the way ahead; We shall overcome them, because we have no other choice at a time when international events are calling for a pooling of efforts and resources. \nThere can be no doubt that the revolution of the conflict in Western Sahara will help speed up the construction of a united Maghreb. The acceptance in principle by Morocco and the POLISARIO Front of the proposals put to then by the current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAD) and the Secretary- General of the united Nations concerning the conditions for the holding of a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara is a good omen in this respect.\nIt is only just that a people that has shed its blood for freedom should have the right to choose its own future it is right that the people of Western Sahara should determine its own destiny\u00b7\nThe international community has understood that, and a consensus has emerged within the Organization of African Unity, the Non-Aligned Movement and this Assembly clearly spelling out the conditions for a resolution of the Western Sahara conflict. That consensus took the form of resolution 104 adopted in 1983 by the Conference of Heads of State or Government in Addis Ababa. Subsequently endorsed by the united Nations, it is the basis of the joint United Nations good offices. Direct negotiations to conclude a cease-fire and to organize a referendum on self-determination, free from administrative or military constraints, are the two key requirements for a just and lasting solution to the conflict in the Western Sahara.\nThose who are fighting each other today need to be able to talk together tomorrow, and it is a good thing for the Moroccans and Saharaouis to go to the referendum hand in hand rather than back to back. Fraternal dialogue will lead to brotherly reconciliation, and thus the Maghreb will gain in stability, security and unity. \nIn the Middle East there is still no end to the tragedy of the Palestinian people, which has missed out on the wave of peace affecting other crises conflicts and sources of tension. The tragedy of the Palestinian people continues to be the tragedy of this century.\nThe uprising in occupied Palestine reminds us that the Palestinian's national identity is still alive. It shows that the Palestinian people has not abdicated its national rights and that its claim to its own State on the land of which it was cobbled will not be defeated. The uprising serves to identify the requirements for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The extraordinary Arab Summit Conference held in Algiers in June defined the common Arab position on the nature competence and aims of the international peace conference on the Middle East and on who should participate. Because the question of Palestine lies at the heart of the conflict in the region the international peace conference would fail if it did not consider it as such and face up to the subject squarely. To seek to reduce the Arab-Zionist conflict to a succession of bilateral territorial or security disputes and hence to obscure the central Palestinian element in the conflict, would be to doom the conference to failure.\nBecause the Palestinian people has chosen those whom it wishes to speak on its behalf and to express its aspirations the Palestine Liberation Organization (\u0420LO) its sole and legitimate representative cannot be deprived of its place at the international peace conference. Attempts to find other representatives will be unsuccessful. \nLastly, we know of the fete that has befallen the search for an alternative hone for the Palestinian people. We have to recognise that the destiny of the Palestinian people is only going to be fashioned on the soil of its own historic land, Palestine.\nIn the same region, Lebanon has suffered setback after setback. Occupation has followed by fratricidal divisions, and today its very institutions are under threat. We are firmly devoted to the independence, unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of that brother country. Lebanon has other battles to fight. It cannot allow itself to be divided against itself, rational reconciliation is vital, and it is the first battle that will determine its victory in the other fights ahead. It must win it and win it with our assistance. It can rely upon my country's aid in this respect.\nIn the Gulf the noise of battle has died down, giving way to dialogue and negotiation. We congratulate Iraq and Iran in a brotherly fashion. Eight years of conflict have left too much suffering, misunderstanding and distrust for us to imagine that the path to peace will be an easy one to follow, but we do trust that courage, a sense of responsibility and wisdom will finally prevail.\nThe apartheid system lies at the heart of all the tragedies in southern Africa. Its full and complete dismantling will be the only way to bring peace back to that long-suffering region. The independence of Namibia, the restoration of all the rights of the South African people and a guarantee for the security, stability and territorial integrity of the front-line States are a collective responsibility which we must all fully live up to. My country, for its part, wishes to assure the South West Africa People's Organisation, the African National Congress and the front-line States of its solidarity and support until the triumph of the causes of justice and freedom which they defend. In Central America the hopes aroused by the Arias plan and the Esquipulas and Sopoa agreements are proving sadly slow to bear fruit. The Contadora and Lima Groups are making a valuable contribution to the cause of peace in the region.\nThey deserve our full support. The peoples and the States in the region must be able to live in understanding, co-operation and mutual respect, free from outside interference and with respect for each other's political, economic and political choices.\nIn the Group of 77 a few days ago I expressed a few thoughts on the subject of international economic relations, thoughts which I should like to share with the Assembly today.\nI observed that the real path to genuine peace must be one whereby all the peoples of the world enjoy not only their right to equal security but also their right to development. I observed that the genuine peaceful order we aspire to should not simply spare mankind from destruction it must ensure his fit and proper survival once and for all. I observed that humanity would one day have had enough of gambling with death and would build for its future, that development would become the new name for peace and be its key ingredient.\nIn the light of those comments I made a number of observations and drew some conclusions.\nFirst of all, underdevelopment is the worst of the wars which mankind is currently waging against itself. Are not more people dying of famine, malnutrition, epidemics and the lack of a medical infrastructure, than as a result of open, armed conflict? Clearly, more people are dying from underdevelopment than from war. Secondly, underdevelopment is - and if no solution is found it will continue to represent - a threat to international peace and security just as much as open armed conflict. Surely the international community has a duty to put an end to a process which is so menacing to mankind\u2019s future. Thirdly, the  international community must mobilize for the triumph  of human rights. We must mobilize to ensure that no citizen of the planet is deprived of his civil rights, his rights to express an opinion, his right of assembly, his right to be heard and his right to defend himself in the name of all the rights which he legally enjoys. Yes, we must mobilize so that no citizen of our planet dies from the denial of his rights. I might add, however, that besides these rights we have a duty, and it is one which has not yet been fulfilled: the duty to ensure that no citizen dies or suffers from neglect of his vital needs. We have acted together so that development is considered in terms of rights fog our peoples. I night say today that the right to the development of peoples is a key element in human rights, because when one talks of underdevelopment one is talking of matters of life and death. This calls for collective solidarity and a collective sense of responsibility. Lastly, at a time when we are welcoming the fact that mankind has begun to tread the path of disarmament, let us not forget that, that much remains to be done under this heading, the hardest task ahead of us is the challenge of underdevelopment, and everything that that implies.\nMy conclusions, therefore, would be as follows.\nFirst, a crisis in international economic relations does exist and is a reality. The developed world felt that it had found its own short-term remedies, but those remedies are the product of short-sightedness.  Real interdependence proves daily that development and underdevelopment are interrelated in many aspects and that the panaceas advocated heretofore are no longer affective. To separate development from underdevelopment, to portray the first as a result of the ability of one group of countries and the second as a result of the fecklessness of others, is not acceptable. There is a system operating today which serves to nurture the developed countries at the cost of the underdeveloped nations.\nSecondly, changes are taking place, and an alternative is being pursued so that the underdevelopment of our countries does not serve to foster the development of nations which established the prevailing system, and which led the, to act in pursuance of the objectives they set for themselves in the past. That was short-sighted. The North-South split is intolerable and will become more so. As East and Hest are brought together, it will become increasingly clear that a peaceful future depends upon development.\nThirdly, underdevelopment corns with an economic price, but still more with a political and social price, and it is one we have to pay. But how long can this go on? This is a matter that must be of concern to all. As member s of the international community we have assumed the \u00a1responsibility to put our houses in order. We recognize this and it is proving beneficial, but it is not enough far from it. Structural adjustments which have been advised or imposed upon our countries are not the remedy for underdevelopment, far from it.\nfourthly, in the formation of underdevelopment, factors beyond the control of our countries were at play, The international environment was - and still is - a handicap for us. Internal structural adjustments will only work if the same structural adjustments are made at the global level. Whether with reference to the budgetary health of our countries, a fair price for our commodity exports, access to international trade, currencies and finances or technology, the present system of international economic relations frustrates all our hard efforts. \nThe system must change. Such a change must be part of an overall change in global and regional relations. Global peace can no longer continue with a two-tier system in which the question of international security has priority and development is relented to a secondary place. An overall approach is required and we must seek to correct all the existing imbalances.\nDo the encouraging notes which we are hearing from so many directions now herald a new age of reason? They say, if mankind can finally meet the overriding requirement: a sense of global conscience.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMay I begin by congratulating you warmly, Sir, on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I am sure that, with your remarkable ability and rich experience and the concerted efforts of representatives from various countries, this session will be a success. I also wish to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, for his outstanding contribution in fulfilling the high mission of President of the last session.\nWhen the forty-second session of the General Assembly opened here a year ago people already saw signs of relaxation in the prolonged international tension. Now, a year later, when we look at the world situation again, the trend towards relaxation is definitely gaining greater momentum. Some problems that have long been a cause of concern are heading towards solution. The Soviet-United States Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - signed last December after many years of negotiations, is being implemented. \nAgreement was finally reached in April tills year on the Afghan question, which has been a cause of grave concern to the international community for more than eight years, and the Soviet troop withdrawal is now under way.\nAnother issue of grave international concern is the eight-year-long war between Iran and Iraq, but the situation has at last taken a Favourable turn thanks to acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) by the two sides. The two countries have agreed to a cease-fire and are on the way to a negotiated peace. In south-west Africa, after long years of war and upheaval, the parties concerned have reached agreement in principle on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and on the initial steps to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978) regarding the independence of Namibia. There have also been positive developments in the Horn of Africa, Western Sahara and the eastern Mediterranean. Efforts towards a settlement of the Middle East and Central American questions are also being made.\nDialogue is playing an increasingly prominent role in improving the international situation. There has been frequent dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union, and also fairly active dialogue between the parties concerned on questions of regional conflicts. In various regional organizations and conferences in Asia, Africa and Latin America, in the Non-Aligned Movement and in many bilateral contacts, countries are seeking settlement of international, regional or bilateral issues through dialogue. This year saw the first meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Balkan region, which was aimed at boosting co-operation among the Balkan countries. In order to ease the situation on the Korean peninsula and promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, the north and the south of Korea are making contacts. Facts show fully that in today's world dialogue is taking the place of confrontation, and the tendency to seek the peaceful settlement of international disputes is growing. This is a striking feature of the present international situation. Obviously, it is the outcome of the common efforts of all countries and is deeply rooted in the events of the time.\nIn the past 40 years or more since the Second World War history has made giant strides forward. The colonial system is now a thing of the past. Former colonies and, dependencies have become sovereign States one after another and stand on their own feet in the family of nations. Respect for each other's independence and sovereignty and opposition to foreign aggression and oppression has become a most important feature in the international politics of the day. The power politics that prevailed in former days are becoming less and less operative. Facts have shown time and time again that even the super-Powers, which possess strength unmatched anywhere in the world, cannot conquer weaker and smaller nations by force and impose their will on others. All their attempts have inevitably failed because of the resolute resistance of the peoples subjected to aggression and the widespread condemnation by the international community. This is thought-provoking.\nWhile the danger of war still exists, the forces of peace are steadily growing. People all over the world have voiced an increasingly strong demand for peace and against war. None of the third-world. East European or West European countries or other developed countries want to go through the holocaust of another world war. Even the super-Powers, which possess sufficient nuclear armaments to destroy the Earth several times over, do not believe that they could win a nuclear war. All these factors have helped to check the outbreak of another world war.\nProblems among developing countries ought to be settled through negotiation. Unfortunately, some differences have given rise to armed conflicts. There is a growing trend in developing countries towards seeking the peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue. This indicates that they are becoming more and more aware that their major historical task is to develop their national economies and improve the quality of people's lives, and that armed conflicts among themselves can only deplete their national strength, to the detriment of their fundamental interests. War means mutual disaster, while peace brings mutual benefit. If the third-world countries handle their relations in this spirit, it will greatly hasten their development and enable them to play a more effective role in the cause of maintaining regional and global peace. \nRapidly developing science and technology, which is being translated into unprecedented great productive forces, spurs the development of the economy and is changing the face of human society. This is a salient feature of the present era. The aggregate strength of a country depends more and more on its economic, scientific and technological level. A review of post-war history clearly indicates that countries which practise hegemonism and engage in the arms race, foreign expansion and military conflicts have found their national strength seriously weakened, while those countries which devote themselves to the development of science, technology, the economy and education have rapidly grown strong. Some have even risen in the world as great economic Powers with advanced science and technology. Meanwhile, the third world is very active in the international arena as a growing political force. Many regional political and economic organizations are also playing an ever more important part in international affairs. With the combination of these elements, the world is moving from bipolarization to multipolarization, which, in our view, is conducive to peace.\nIt is against such a backdrop that there emerges the trend of dialogue replacing confrontation and of the peaceful settlement of international disputes. These developments are a source of encouragement to the people of all countries.\nHowever, is the present world free from troubles? Obviously it is not. The root cause of turbulence in the world has not yet been removed. The peoples of all countries must make unremitting efforts to safeguard world peace.\nThe world's peoples are faced with the common task of halting the arms race and striving for disarmament in order to preserve peace. The recently concluded third special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament represented a major effort by the international community to push forward the process of disarmament. Although the special session failed to achieve specific results because of the rigid positions taken by one or two countries, in disregard\n  \n\nof the reasonable demand of the vast majority of countries, the statements made by representatives of many countries and non-governmental organizations and the suggestions and propositions that they put forward mirrored the universal desire of the international community for peace and disarmament. The powerful public opinion arising there from has a positive impact on the promotion of the disarmament process. The special session enabled people to have a clearer picture of the present state of the arms race and the correct orientation of and approach to disarmament. On the question of disarmament, the Chinese delegation deems it necessary to expound the following three points at this session of the General Assembly.\nFirst, it is a welcome development that the United States and the Soviet Union have taken a step forward on the road to disarmament. However, we cannot but note that the huge nuclear arsenals they possess still pose a threat to world peace. The arms race between them is still going on. They are trying greatly to improve and upgrade the quality and function of their respective nuclear weapons, vying with each other to develop high-tech weaponry and extending the arms race to outer space. Hence, the disarmament task remains arduous and formidable.\nSecondly, countries across the world have repeatedly reaffirmed the important principle that the super-Powers, which possess the largest and most sophisticated arsenals, bear a special responsibility for disarmament and should take the lead in drastically cutting their arms. This is a correct direction and an effective approach for the realization of disarmament. We hope that the super-Powers will, in conformity with the trend of the times, quicken their pace on the road to disarmament and reach agreement on a drastic reduction of nuclear weapons at an early date, starting with a 50 per cent cut in strategic nuclear weapons. Their talks on conventional disarmament should also be speeded up and the arms race in outer space, in all its forms, should be halted. \nThirdly, the question of disarmament concerns the security interests of all countries. Countries, big or small, strong or weak, all have the right to participate in the discussion and settlement of the disarmament question on an equal footing, and can each play a positive role. The super-Powers should respect and take seriously into consideration the reasonable demands and propositions set forth by the small and medium-sized countries. The United Nations and other multilateral disarmament agencies are important venues for the discussion and solution of this question by all parties on an equal basis. Their role should be strengthened. Multilateral and bilateral disarmament negotiations should complement and promote each other.\nThe third special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament showed that most countries have identical or similar views on the aforementioned questions. We hope that the current session of the General Assembly will give full expression to the strong desire of these countries, and make significant progress towards disarmament. While there is greater effort to seek the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts through dialogue, the Flames of war in quite a Few conflict-ridden areas are yet to be extinguished. Dialogue on a number of issues has failed to make substantive progress. On some other issues, although agreements have been reached, the successful implementation of those agreements requires continued efforts by the parties concerned. In international relations the Chinese Government has all along advocated the observance of the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. As regards regional conflicts, it has always stood for a fair and reasonable political settlement; therefore aggression must be stopped, foreign troops withdrawn and the sovereignty of all countries respected. Differences among developing countries should all the more be settled appropriately through peaceful negotiations on mutually acceptable terms.\nThe Chinese Government has consistently opposed Israel's policy of aggression and expansion and supported the just struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples and the efforts of the Arab countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization (\u0420LO) to seek a solution to the Middle East question. We hope to see an early, fair and comprehensive solution to the question and an end to the turmoil caused by four decades of war, so that the people of the Middle East may enjoy peace again.\nWe are concerned about peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. China supports the reasonable proposition of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country through consultation and dialogue and opposes any action that adds to tension on the peninsula.\nFollowing the decision of the Soviet Union to pull out lt4 troops from Afghanistan, the international community has voiced an even stronger demand for Vietnamese troop withdrawal from Kampuchea and for an end to the war of aggression. Regrettably, however, what the Vietnamese authorities have been doing runs counter to the desire and demand of the international community. While professing their readiness to withdraw their troops, they have put forward unreasonable demands in an attempt to delay their troop withdrawal and legalize the results of their aggression, so as to get what they have failed to achieve in their 10-year war of aggression. It should be stressed that on the Kampuchean question Viet Nam is the aggressor and the Vietnamese troops are the only foreign troops on Kampuchean territory. It is explicitly and solemnly stated in the very first Article of the United Nations Charter that to maintain international peace and security it is essential to take effective measures for the suppression of acts of aggression. Since the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea, the General Assembly has for nine successive years adopted resolutions calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea so as to facilitate the settlement of the Kampuchean problem by the Kampuchean people themselves, free from outside interference. All this shows that the international community brooks no legalization of the results of aggression. The Chinese Government considers it necessary for the current session of the General Assembly to reiterate those just demands and to uphold the sanctity of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\nThe Chinese Government has for the past decade worked hard towards a fair and reasonable settlement of the Kampuchean question. Recently it has further elaborated its position on the question, which can be summed up in the following five points.\nFirst, a complete withdrawal by Viet Nam of its troops from Kampuchea is the key to a settlement of the Kampuchean question. The Vietnamese side should produce, as soon as possible, a timetable for its troop withdrawal from Kampuchea within a short period of time. \nSecondly, we favour the establishment, with Prince Norodom Sihanouk in charge, of a provisional quadripartite coalition government in Kampuchea as Viet Nam withdraws its troops from the country. Each faction's candidates for the provisional government should be proposed by the faction itself but should be acceptable to the other parties concerned. We stand for a quadripartite coalition in Kampuchea. We are against the exclusion of any of the four factions from it or the exercise of power by any one faction alone.\nThirdly, upon the establishment of the provisional quadripartite coalition government of Kampuchea, a freeze should be imposed on the activities of the Kampuchean armed forces of all factions. They should refrain from becoming involved in politics and interfering in the general election, so that the Kampuchean people may conduct a free election in the absence of outside interference and the threat of force. To prevent a civil war in Kampuchea the existing armed forces of all factions might be disbanded, to facilitate the creation of a unified national defence force composed of an equal number of officers and men from each of the four factions, under a unified command.\nFourthly, practical and effective international supervision should be instituted over Viet Nam's troop withdrawal, the maintenance of peace in Kampuchea and the conduct of a free election there. To that end the Chinese Government supports the proposition for the sending to Kampuchea of an international peace-keeping force and an international control committee.\nFifthly, when the parties concerned have reached agreement on a political settlement of the Kampuchean question, China will be ready to join other countries in an international guarantee for an independent, neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea.\nIt must be clear to all that China seeks no self-interest in Kampuchea as in any other region of the world. The Chinese Government's position is based entirely on the principle of opposing aggression, upholding justice and safeguarding the United Nations Charter and the norms governing international relations. It is our hope that the international community will continue to work under this principle for a fair and just settlement of the Kampuchean question.\nWe should attach adequate importance to world economic problems while paying attention to the international political situation. The current world economic development is extremely uneven, despite the presence of a few positive factors. Worrisome problems still exist and some have even gone from bad to worse. While developed countries have enjoyed economic growth for six successive years, developing countries have suffered severe economic setbacks. Many of them have witnessed increasing signs of stagnation in the process of development. The economic difficulties of African countries have aroused wide concern. The heavy debt burden, reduced inflow of funds, worsening trade terms and growing protectionism have all seriously hampered the economic growth of developing countries. All this demonstrates that present international economic relations are becoming increasingly out of accord with the needs of economic growth in the world and of developing countries in particular.\nIn the present-day world there is even greater economic interdependence among countries. Developed countries will find it difficult to sustain their economic growth if developing countries long remain in difficulties and their economies cannot move ahead. It is an urgent task in the international economic sphere to improve, by effective measures, the external environment of developing countries in such fields as commodities, trade, debt, capital, currency and finance. That would contribute not only to resumed growth and development of developing countries but also to the stability and growth of the world economy. Recently the Group of 77 has proposed the convening of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to economic matters. The United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, has also proposed a summit meeting similar to the Cancun Meeting. The Chinese Government seconds those proposals and hopes to see increased North-South co-operation through dialogue and the invigoration of the world economy.\nOver the past few years, regional economic co-operation has increased markedly, which is an important trend in international economic relations. We believe that regional co-operation based on equality and mutual benefit is of positive significance, for it helps the development of different regions. At the same time I should like to emphasize that in the present world economic conditions neither a country nor a region can achieve development and prosperity behind closed doors. It has to open itself to the outside world. Trade protectionism, while harming others, is in the final analysis detrimental to the initiator as well. It is our hope that countries and regions across the world will open up to and complement one another, to the benefit of their common development and prosperity.\nAs there is growing regional co-operation in the world, co-operation and development in the Asia-Pacific region have attracted more and more attention in recent years. This region is indeed making rapid economic progress and has tremendous potential. However, the development level varies with different countries in the region, where many countries remain underdeveloped or even impoverished. As a large country in the region, China supports regional economic co-operation. China's development is closely linked with that of the Asia-Pacific region. We hope to see closer co-operation and the common prosperity of all countries in the region. \nChina will implement unswervingly the policy of deepening reform and wider opening to the outside world. It is opening itself to the whole world, including the developed and developing countries, countries whose social systems are similar to or different from the system of China. Recently, we have adopted new measures in an effort to restructure our foreign trade and improve our investment environment. Most important, we have mapped out an economic development strategy for China's coastal regions. Those regions, which cover an area of about 320,000 square kilometres with a population of 160 million, boast a better infrastructure, greater economic and technological strength and higher quality of labour force. Accelerating their opening-up and strengthening their multi faceted, multi channel and multiform economic and technological co-operation with the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world will not only speed up China's economic development but also make positive contributions to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and that of the world as a whole.\nThis year marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Forty years ago the people and Governments of various countries that had suffered from the catastrophe of the two world wars worked out and adopted that Declaration through their joint efforts. It is the first international instrument that systematically and specifically sets forth respect for and protection of fundamental human rights. Despite its historical limitations, the Declaration has exerted a Far-reaching influence on the development of post-war international human rights activities and has played a positive role in that regard. In the past four decades the concept of human rights has continuously developed, and its content has been enriched and its theory improved. A series of subsequent declarations and conventions concerning human rights has further developed and stipulated in detail the specific content of each human right. In this connection particular mention should be made of such important items as the right to national self-determination, the right to racial equality, the permanent sovereign right over natural wealth and resources and the right to development. All those are of great significance to the fight for equality, freedom and liberation waged by the nations and peoples under the apartheid system of foreign aggression and oppression, to the efforts made by countries newly independent in the post-war period to preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity and to the demands of the developing countries for restructuring the irrational international economic situation. The Chinese Government has always appreciated and supported the United Nations efforts to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\nThree years ago, from this solemn rostrum, the Chinese leader Zhao Ziyang pointed out that the world needs the United Nations, while the United Nations needs the support of the world. Events have repeatedly testified to that important thesis. With the passage of time the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, which are increasingly recognized as norms governing international relations and as an embodiment of the lofty ideals of mankind, are playing an ever greater role in the international community.\nDespite its inadequacies the United Nations is irreplaceable in its role as the most broadly representative and most influential international organization in the world. Gone are the days when a few big Powers could manipulate world affairs. The United Nations is the proper forum in which countries meet to discuss world affairs. It has proved itself capable of doing important work, and it has great potential for solving questions facing mankind, questions such as those of the environment, population, public health and scientific and technological development. Above all, it should be pointed out that in recent years the Security Council and the Secretary-General, with the support o\u00a3 Member States, must be credited with achievements in promoting the settlement of major international disputes. Here, I want to present my compliments to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and to wish him continued successes in his peace mission. The importance of the United Nations role is on the rise, in keeping with the expectations of our time. The people of the world expect the United Nations to play a greater role in maintaining world peace, in spurring development and in strengthening international co-operation. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China is ready to continue to work with other Member States for the realization of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. I particularly want to express, on behalf of Portugal and on my own behalf, all the confidence we have in you and our conviction that positive results will be achieved owing to your professional skills and total commitment.\nSimilarly, I wish to express my gratitude and that of my country for the generous and serious work carried out by the President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session, Mr. Peter Florin, to whom I address ray warmest greetings.\n1 should also like to join all those who have praised the outstanding performance of the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and the commitment and dedication he has shown in resolving the problems which have been of such concern to us. His actions have certainly contributed to the recent awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations.\nPortugal as the current President of the European Community, has wide a statement on behalf of the 12 member States in which it addressed the most Important and relevant issues in the present international situation. I reaffirm our support for that statement. However, I should like to recall the importance which my Government attaches to some of those issues. It will surprise nobody if I single out first the question of East Timor,\nAs the United Nations seems to be resuming its role in the peaceful solution of conflicts, while we welcome the successes registered in the solution of several international problems of the  outmost gravity and the effective progress achieved in settling others that until now have apparently defied solution, I regret to have to refer to a question which has dragged on for years without any meaningful progress towards a just solution in accordance with the principles and fundamental resolutions of the United Nations.\nThe question of the decolonization of East Timor is a thorn in the international conscience and a challenge to the consistency with which the essential principles of decolonization, so often invoked and reaffirmed as \u03b2 fundamental part of the heritage of the Organization, are applied and observed. It is sad to see in the case of East Timor the flagrant and direct violation of such principles perpetrated by a country which was also subjected to colonialism and which performed such an important role in the struggle for emancipation of the colonized peoples.\nIt is 13 years since the Non-Self-Governing Territory of East Timor, then under Portuguese administration, saw its process of decolonization interrupted when it was invaded and occupied by its powerful neighbour. Portugal does not deny its share of the responsibility for the difficulties and troubles that have affected that process since its beginnings, but we cannot accept that such events legitimise its invasion and occupation by Indonesia and the subsequent denegation of the fundamental rights and freedoms of its people, including its inalienable right to self-determination. No circumstances whatsoever could legitimise the ruthless way in which repression was waged in the Territory, with an intolerable price in human life and sacrifice.\nA people, numbering a few hundred thousand, which saw a fourth of its citizens killed, which is subject to an authority it did not choose and whose rights, freedoms and fundamental guarantees are restricted, demands an opportunity to choose its own political destiny.\nPortugal - I repeat once again - has no claim to sovereignty over the Territory of East Timor. We uphold the right to self-determination of East Timor, and we cannot understand why the occupying force, which constantly invokes the benefits brought by its administration to the well-being of the inhabitants, fears to face the result of a free act of self-determination. If, as has been argued, hearts and minds are already won over to its cause, why fear the expression of the will of the people?\nEast Timor is for us a moral, historical and legal responsibility. The defence of the rights, freedoms and specific identity of its people - so often proclaimed in this forum as an imperative for the international community as a whole when referring to other colonial Territories - is also the collective responsibility of us all as Members of this Organization committed to the observance of its fundamental principles. We cannot ignore the drama of East Timor without becoming accomplices in an intolerable policy of fait accompli imposed by force.\nPortugal will do its utmost to find through dialogue a just and comprehensive solution acceptable to the international community. We are fully committed to collaborating with the Secretary-General, whose mediation efforts I acknowledge with gratitude. It is in a constructive spirit, and having in mind primarily respect \u00a1for the legitimate rights and aspirations of the people of East Timor, that we envisage the continuance of this mediation process. We sincerely hope that \u2116at spirit will also prevail on the part of Indonesia.\nThe international community views with justified apprehension the continuing deterioration of economic conditions in a great number of countries, especially on the African continent. This situation - to which the inadequacies of prevailing models of development, the seriousness of certain structural and conjectural imbalances in the international economic order and the extreme vulnerability to natural catastrophes of many African societies, often contribute - is characterized by the stagnation of growth, high rates of inflation and a disturbing level of external indebtedness. \nThis question was dealt with here during the session which analysed the implementation of the United Nations special Programme of Action for Africa. Without ignoring the responsibilities which primarily rest with the Africans themselves, that is only fair to recall that the member countries of the European Community have tried to create efficient schemes of aid to least developed countries. The successive Lom\u00e9 Conventions must be singled out, because they have established a relationship of co-operation, outlined in a freely agreed legal framework. They associate the interested countries in a structure of permanent consultation which is an important forum for the development of the North-South dialogue.\nI should like in this context to draw attention to my country's commitment to and interest in the preparation, within the framework of the Community, of the negotiations on a new convention between the European Economic Community (EEC) and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. We believe that the relations fostered between the Community and its 66 partners in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific are an important example in the area of co-operation and aid for development.\nThe perspective being defined at the Community level is that sectoral interventions should be complementary to the process of development, and not mere emergency operations lacking long-term effectiveness. This is, in our view, the most effective and responsible path to pursue to aim for a progressive balance of the system of exchange so as to achieve the harmonious development of international trade. I believe that the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) deserves the continuing support of the international community, being an experiment in regional co-operation with practical achievements of major importance for the economic self-reliance of the countries of the area.\nThe processes of structural adjustment which are being implemented by several developing countries, in a courageous way and at an obvious political and social cost, deserve growing support from the industrialized countries, through integrated actions in co-ordination with all entities taking part in financing and in an active dialogue with the beneficiary countries.\nFor historical and cultural reasons known to all, my country pays very special attention to the question of development assistance. That serious problem now affecting the peoples and countries of the so-called third world is of great concern to us, and we are deeply committed to the search for means to solve it.\nHere I wish to recall the proposal made last May by the Prime Minister of Portugal in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to create in Lisbon a North-South centre, with a flexible structure, to work as a forum for a permanent exchange of views with the objective of encouraging a climate of understanding and confidence between North and South. We hope to have the support and participation of all States represented them.\nMy country acknowledges with appreciation the increasing value which is being attached to this aspect of international relations, because that is in line with the historical role that Portugal has played in the world and corresponds fully to the way in which we envisage our place in the community of nations.\nAfrica is of special importance to Portugal because of the historical and cultural ties which bin-l us together and which we continue to strengthen today, co-operating to the mutual benefit of and in the interest of the socio-economic progress of the countries involved. This co-operation, as the practical expression of an active political relationship, is definitely more visible in bilateral actions with the African countries whose official language is Portuguese: Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe, Angola and Mozambique. But I am pleased to note that every year Portuguese participation in the structure of multilateral machinery of great importance - namely, the Lom\u00e9 Convention and the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference - assumes a wider expression of political and economic solidarity specially geared to realistic development priorities.\nIn this context I believe then we can emphasize the United Nations special Programme of Action for Africa, which is clear evidence of the attention and commitment of the Organization in the quest for a solution to this problem, to which none of us can remain indifferent.\nIn the last two months we have seen historic developments which have opened up new horizons to the peoples of Angola and Namibia, who, I believe, will overcome the long years of suffering and enjoy in the future conditions of development and progress in a climate of peace, with due respect for territorial integrity.\nI congratulate all those who, by their pragmatism, commitment to dialogue and readiness to yield on accessory matters to guarantee the essentials, made possible the achievement of a breakthrough in a process that dragged on for so long.\nIn this context I wish to send a very special message of greetings and solidarity to the Angolan people and to reaffirm Portugal's readiness to do everything possible, at both the bilateral and the multilateral level, to help the People's Republic of Angola in its difficult task of achieving the reconstruction and development to which it is justly entitled. As for Mozambique, I take this opportunity to condemn once again the intolerable situation of insecurity created by a guerrilla movement supported from outside. It is high time to allow the martyred people of that country to work in peace towards a better future. Mozambique also deserves the solidarity of the international community in its struggle for peace and development.\nHowever, it is really up to the Government of South Africa to shoulder its responsibilities and give evidence of a true willingness to pursue dialogue and good-neighbourliness. This would prove that it remains faithful to the spirit and the letter of the historic Nkomati Agreement, which was recently reaffirmed at the Songo meeting. Nevertheless, I wish to reaffirm my country's conviction that complete detente in the region can be attained only through the elimination of internal tensions in the Republic of South Africa.\nPortugal has denounced and condemned, not only in the United Nations but also on many other occasions, the immorality and injustice that are the main features of the apartheid and bantustanization systems aimed at perpetuation of the political, economic, social and cultural discrimination that is at the heart of the continually worsening internal situation in that country. Here again we appeal to the Government in Pretoria to deal with its internal problems with the open-mindedness recently shown in the Namibia negotiations and the pursuit of peace in Angola.\nAny progress towards the definitive breaking-up of the apartheid system is, in this framework, a fundamental and high-priority matter. Only the eradication of apartheid will give all communities of that country access to political participation, work, security and social well-being. It is in the hands of the South African authorities, had they the political courage and awareness of the irreversibility of history, to make of the Republic a multiracial, economically advanced country, a revealing-pot of all its communities - in short, a real focal point for the development and progress that would undoubtedly have a positive impact on all southern Africa.\nIndeed, it is up to the South Africans - all South Africans - to decide on the best way to implement reforms, the need for which is incontrovertible. But it is clear to me that freer political expression by the black majority would undoubtedly contribute to the creation of the climate of mutual confidence indispensable for the transformation of the South African society. I cannot leave this subject without referring to the deep concern in my country at the situations of Nelson Mandela, whose seventieth birthday was recently celebrated by the international community, and the Sharpeville Six - both crying examples of injustice.\nPortugal, a member of the European Community and of the Atlantic Alliance, and a participant in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), has followed East-West developments with particular attention. I note with satisfaction and confidence the clear improvement in recent months in the relations between the two super-Powers. Today, after the Washington and Moscow summits, there is a positive spirit} dialogue is more open and frequent, and decisive steps have been taken, specifically in the areas of arms control and disarmament.\nMy country welcomed the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - as a positive and important step towards international detente, and therefore towards peace. In this connection we support the objectives already set by both parties of a 50 per cent reduction in the strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union.  Portugal is confident that in the near future decisive moves will be made on conventional arms. Specifically, we hope that the existing imbalances between East and West will be corrected through a process of negotiation. This would eliminate the disproportion, thus making possible stability and security at the lowest level of armaments. He therefore have the greatest hopes of the CSC\u00a3 process. My country is confident that a quick settlement at the Vienna meeting will permit the approval of a final, substantive and well-balanced document that will make possible the beginning of negotiations on conventional-weapons stability and the renewal of talks on confidence- and security-building measures.\nNuclear and conventional disarmament - the guarantee of peace and security - is the indissoluble condition of the establishment of universal peace. We therefore welcome the significant progress registered in this area. However, we view with great concern the recent upsurge in the use of chemical weapons. My country, which is a signatory to the 1925 Geneva Protocol, is firmly committed to efficient, global and verifiable implementation of a convention that will ensure the total elimination of this type of weapon. It is our imperative duty to arrive expeditiously at the consensus needed to fulfil that requirement. In this context Portugal supports without reservation the proposal made in this Assembly several days ago by the President of the United States for a concerted international effort to ensure the elimination of chemical weapons.\nI wish to express my country's satisfaction at the cease-fire recently signed between Iran and Iraq, which should allow for a just and lasting solution of that long conflict, which has claimed so many victims. I therefore pay a tribute to the endeavours of the United Nations in persuading the parties involved to abide by Security Council resolution 598 (1987).  \nAs for the Israeli-Arab conflict, we note with regret that the present situation is not encouraging. The serious events in the occupied territories demonstrate the fragility of previous solutions. Any lasting solution will have to take account of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and recognise the right to exist of all countries of the region. Portugal together with its European partners, believes that the expeditious convening of an international conference would provide the appropriate framework for the essential negotiations between the parties directly involved.\nAs for Latin America, I wish to reaffirm our fraternal solidarity with the countries of that vast region, and our total readiness to contribute actively to their efforts to overcome their difficulties. 1 am convinced that the developed countries can help significantly in ameliorating these problems and in the search, together with the countries of the region, for new and imaginative forms of co-operation. The question of external indebtedness, in particular, must be seen in the context of economic growth, given that it is important to reduce the social burden that it imposes.\nI must also make a special reference to the situation in Central America, where the hope generated by the signing of the Esquipulas Agreement was followed by a stalemate in the peace process. Portugal believes that the solution to this situation should be sought, in the first instance, at the regional level, in a climate of mutual trust and within the framework of strict respect for human rights, pluralist democracy and the principle of the inviolability of frontiers. He have always taken into consideration the unjust and unfavourable social conditions that have contributed to the present state of affairs in that region and we therefore believe that economic co-operation among the countries of the region and the industrialized countries will also have a determining influence in achieving the desired peace and progress for the region.\nReaching a political solution for Cambodia is also an imperative necessity for the international community and one which is daily becoming more pressing. It is time to restore peace, dignity and hope to a country that has been successively martyrized by the intolerance of a minority that shows disrespect for the most elementary human rights and by a foreign military occupation that cannot be legitimised under any pretext.\nOn the other hand, the Geneva agreements on Afghanistan constitute a significant stride towards solution of a conflict which, for almost a decade, sowed suffering and misery among the Afghan people. I cannot but note the courage and spirit of self-sacrifice of the Afghan resistance and the humanitarian solidarity displayed by Pakistan in receiving millions of refugees displaced by the conflict.\nPeace among nations and respect for human rights are the aspiration of us all and are inseparable from the well-being of each and every individual in the world community. That well-being is closely linked to economic development and is based on sound international trade, free of protectionism, be it open or concealed.\nThis has been the position which ray country has clearly assumed. As a member of the European Community, Portugal considers it indispensable to have reciprocity in the opening up of markets. That is our practice and a fundamental feature of the Community's trade policy. My Government firmly believes that we are in the final stage of the setting up of the institutions necessary for the full participation of Portugal in the world market, in accordance with the objectives of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\nIn this perspective we recognize the importance and the opportunities provided by the Uruguay Round, the satisfactory outcome of which would, without any doubt, contribute to a better balance in the world's trade relations. I reaffirm that the goal of those negotiations will be reached only if the principle of globality is strictly upheld.\nThe joint declaration by the European Economic Community (EEC) and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) establishing official acknowledgement between the two organizations, issued in Luxembourg on 25 June 1988, ended 30 years of non-recognition of each other by the two Europes.\nAware of the historical significance of this event and of its implications for the future relationship between the two organizations and the respective member States, Portugal welcomed it and believes that a major step has been taken towards a new era of international co-operation extending to the most diverse fields. Ws trust that multilateral co-operation, reflected also in the relations between the EEC and the European Free Trade Association, the Association of South-East Asian Nations and the Gulf Co-operation Council, will be expanded and intensified.\nThe commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should provide support to the efforts of the international community to ensure the exercise of the rights and fundamental freedoms inherent in the human person everywhere in the world. Now that the United Nations already has available to it several international instruments for defining and guaranteeing such rights, it is therefore important to ensure their effective implementation and the strengthening of international control mechanisms. \nAs a priority of its foreign policy, Portugal contributes to the promotion and protection of human rights. In the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, my country has striven to comply with the mandate entrusted to it, rejecting duplicity of criteria and working towards the strengthening of the effectiveness of existing mechanisms. To achieve full enjoyment of the fundamental freedoms of each individual, it is indispensable to keep in mind the complementary nature of civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights.\nThroughout the past five centuries, Portugal has enriched its history, its culture and its language in all parts of the world. That would be enough to justify its interest in the international scene. Such an interest acquires a new and powerful thrust when one consider the committed and active participation of my country in many international organizations - from the United Nations to the EEC, from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Council of Europe, to mention only a few.\nWe are aware, however, that it is not enough simply to observe the international scene and to react to events. Together with other countries of good will Portugal has a part to play in combating situations of injustice and war which, unfortunately, still occur. We have to overcome inertia and mobilize wills in order to change ineffective practices of co-operation. Above all, we must work hard to co-ordinate efforts to ensure that existing or potentially dangerous situations do not prevail. And, if present solutions do not work, we must search with daring and creativity for new ones.\nPortugal once again reiterates its availability and willingness to contribute to efforts to ensure that we may all enjoy more peace in security, more freedom in democracy, more solidarity in prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt gives me particular pleasure to welcome the election of Mr. Dante Caputo to preside over this forty-third session. I sincerely congratulate him and wish him every success. His Qualities as a seasoned diplomat guarantee that our work will proceed smoothly. I also congratulate the other officers of the General Assembly and assure them, as well as the President, of my delegation's active support.\nI should also like to express our satisfaction with the excellent work accomplished at the forty-second session under the presidency of Mr. Peter Florin.\nI wish to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General, both for his tireless devotion to promoting international co-operation and for his perseverance in the search for peace. We are all familiar with the personal part he played in the resolution of certain conflicts. I wish to express renewed appreciation of his exemplary faith in our Organization and of his courageous efforts to preserve its prestige and credibility, despite financial difficulties.\nI have been instructed by our Head of State, Comrade Blase Compaor\u00e9, to deliver to the Assembly on his behalf a message of friendship and peace from the Popular Front Government and the people of Burkina Faso. \nIt will be recalled that last year, during the forty-second session, the people of Burkina Faso were having to deal with one of the most serious crises in their history. We are a peaceful people; the world was not used to seeing bloodshed in our country, therefore the confusion felt by some people was understandable. What we did not understand, and are not prepared to accept, was that, because of the charisma of a man who knew how to look after his image, the regime that replaced his and the whole people were condemned in certain circles.\nBurkina Faso has made great strides since during the past year; it has staunched its wounds and embarked resolutely, with the Popular Front, on the road to recovery.\nOn 15 October 1987 an era ended, an era of repeated deviations from our revolution. We had to restore the socio-political and economic balance nationally and re-establish a basis for co-operation at the international level. It was essential that our people, who had made great sacrifices in supporting our revolutionary construction, should be able to achieve their legitimate aspirations without being submitted to the terror of a police regime or the economic reverses that would inevitably result from the autocratic system imposed upon them. It was high time our neighbours were reassured and our partners' fears allayed. To our neighbours above all, we had to give proof of our desire to practise with them the virtues of good neighbourliness and non-interference. Here I should like to say that we succeeded better than we had hoped in restoring confidence and the basis for subregional co-operation so necessary for our fragile and vulnerable economies.\nAlthough I have stated this in other international bodies, I should like to restate here the desire of the Burkina Faso Government to live in peace with its neighbours and with all peoples of the world, to seek with them solutions to the innumerable scourges which overwhelm the international community and to build a world of justice and progress.\nI should like to repeat our devotion to the principles and ideals of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, and the United Nations.\nArmed with this determination we shall participate in this general debate.\nThe excellent report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization gives a striking picture of our world in flux.\nIt is also a stark reminder of our responsibilities to future generations that we are in the last stretch of the twentieth century, which has been so eventful.\nAt this moment of truth there have been few successes. This is true in particular of the decades proclaimed by this Assembly, whether of disarmament or development.\nWith regard to development the third world countries have paid and continue to pay a steep price for the structural crisis of the world economy. Our countries have impotently witnessed an increasing deterioration year after year in their terms of trade with the rich countries. It is regrettable that speculation has further distorted the normal conditions of international trade which were at the outset certainly not satisfactory for any one. It is indeed difficult otherwise to explain the fact that the developed countries have succeeded in exercising their systematic control over the commodity markets. Neither the old capitalist law of supply and demand nor the accords of guarantee in the case of specific commodities ate any longer reliable mechanisms. The only thing that now counts is the will of the cartel which has been established for a particular commodity or group of producers, and always pressure is exercised to lower prices. \nOne year after the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and despite the entry into force of the Commodities Funds there is little chance that the rules of the game will change so that the countries which produce these raw materials can derive income to finance their development projects. Far from it. They are trapped in machinery that will inevitably lead them to borrow more to make up for lost export earnings, to invest not in efforts at development but in efforts for sheer survival. \nTherefore the North-South dialogue which was so encouraging has become a well-oiled machine designed to drain economic flows and cause a reverse transfer of resources. Thus debt has become for all developing countries a nightmare, and its solution, the squaring of the circle - doubtless - \u0430 monstrous concept which neither the debtors nor their creditors want to tackle head on, still less together. Each side simply sizes up the situation and proposes solutions that are more or less realistic, more or less radical, all under the paternalistic eye of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nAfrica has an opportunity to speak with a single voice because States composing it have collectively confronted the monster. I refer here to the extraordinary summit conference of the OAU on African debt held last November. Rut it is clear that the debt problem cannot be taken out of context. It should be considered from the standpoint of international economic relations. Together with Africa, we roust tackle the Question whether the developed countries want to have economic partners worthy of the name or simply zones of influence. I leave the question open.\nIn order to resolve the crisis, Africa has, in its Priority Programme, chosen discipline with sacrifice. The international community has responded by adopting the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. This Programme of Action, which is now at mid-point, and whose review has now been going on for a few weeks, is one of our major concerns. I wish to \u201e salute the meritorious efforts of the Secretary-General to ensure implementation of this plan by agencies of the United Nations system.\nBut it is no secret that implementation of the programme has fallen short of expectations and that everywhere Africa has been disappointed in its hopes and in its desire for co-operation.  The debates that took place in this forum a few days ago enabled us to take stock of what has been done and to comprehend what remains to be done. As long as some of our partners, States and international organizations alike, do not admit that the pressure exercised on our economies and societies by structural adjustment efforts may certainly have beneficial effects, but equally disastrous consequences, we will not transcend the bottle-necks and the present lack of understanding.\nWe hope that the international community will take a salutary initiative so that by 199U the Programme of Action and the Priority Programme can be implemented in full. The survival of an entire continent is at stake and at the end of this twentieth century hunger, endemic diseases and despair are the daily lot of its peoples. Africa needs, for its survival, assistance in its efforts to rehabilitate its environment sorely tested by drought and other natural disasters. Right now I refer to locust invasions which could, in particular in the Sahel region, wipe out the efforts of almost 15 years at reforestation and soil rehabilitation.\nNo individual country, nor region acting in isolation can stop desertification or the invasion of locusts. Looking at Burkina Paso, although having a national environment safeguards programme, it has, with its partners in the Permanent Inter-State Committee to Combat Drought in the Sahel and other organizations in the subregion and with the assistance of the international community, been carrying out action on the basis of solidarity of an integrated kind. Here the United Nations Sahel Office has an irreplaceable role to play.\nOur world may live to see the day when people with an acute awareness of the problems facing mankind and the intellectual and technological means to analyse them can resolve them. Safeguarding the environment is one of these problems. The outstanding work done by the Brundtland Commission two years ago, but whose conclusions are still valid, is one such analysis. Unfortunately, when we talk about mobilizing ourselves and fighting these scourges, even for our survival, our world seems to be impotent. We can only hope that humanity will soon find the collective means to confront adversity and mend its ways.\nAt this stage, I should like to voice the indignation of my country at the scorn shown by industrial societies for the lives of our peoples by transforming Africa into a cheap dumping ground for their refuse, whether radioactive or not, but certainly harmful. We appeal to the conscience of the rich States to consider with us those practices as being crimes bearing the seed of long-term genocide.\nAlready, uncontrolled nuclear tests have disrupted our ecosystems, attacked the ozone layer that protects our earth. Right now terrible and unnecessary numbers of weapons continue to be buried under innocent feet, transported by air and sea, ready to take off into outer space. The children of the twentieth century and the people of the twenty-first are condemned to experience the nightmares of the apocalypse unless the big Powers bring this to the inevitable end for which we have been waiting since Hiroshima.\nThe developments in the negotiations between the two super-Powers and the limited agreements they have reached are promising. Nevertheless, these negotiations must be pursued further and in other directions. At this stage and in this context we cannot but regret that the hopes of the international community were dashed-by the failure of the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly, the third such session devoted to disarmament.\nBurkina Faso, for its part, will welcome every bilateral or multilateral effort to bring about disarmament. It is high time that our intellectual and material resources were used in a way more in keeping with the aspirations of the people of our time for development, greater well-being and a better quality of life.\nJust as we welcomed the progress made in detente, so also we welcomed with relief the announcement of the signature of the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan, the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the promise of a solution to the Kampuchean and southern African problems.\nI\t.\nWe reiterate our appeal to our friends in Afghanistan for national reconciliation, which is a prerequisite for any consistent effort at reconstruction. The welcome development regarding the Iran-Iraq conflict is a tribute to the two belligerents, which have spared the world the holocaust to which the greater involvement of the foreign Powers in the Gulf region would inevitably have led. We hope that the cease-fire clauses will be respected and that negotiations on pending issues will be concluded, so that lasting peace may be established. \nAs an active member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, we exhort the two brother States, Iraq and Iran, to strive without delay at a complete reconciliation.\nWe have been following with great interest negotiations at all levels aimed at putting an end, after more than a decade to the tragedy of Kampuchea. We hope that the Cambodian people will soon be reconciled and will rebuild their beautiful country amid the friendly interest of their neighbours and with the assistance of the international community as a whole.\nFor us, the situation in southern Africa arouses mixed feelings. Of course, we are pleased that quadripartite talks between Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States have taken place in the last few months without any major break. Similarly, we welcome the results that the protagonists have reached, because we are aware of the determination of our Angolan brothers to safeguard African interests in the region, in particular those of Namibia.\nIf we have mixed feelings, it is because we are thinking about the road that remains to be travelled to arrive at a final solution to the problem. South Africa, which seems to be responding to pressure by the international community to begin to accept Security Council resolution 435 (1978), on the independence of Namibia, continues to burn schools in that Territory, persists in its refusal to recognize the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO), the authentic representative of the Namibian people, and practice the terrorism of apartheid against the people of South Africa.\nI have been to southern Africa. A few months ago I had an opportunity to visit some of the front-line States. Already there, at the gates of the South African hell, one could not help doubting that the accursed regime of apartheid could ever reform itself - if, indeed, one was not certain that it could not. Only the determination, courage and unselfishness of the front-line States and the faith of the South African people in their future and the inevitable victory of their struggle strengthened my feeling that all was not lost.\nAll is not lost if Pretoria's friends finally make possible the realization of the unanimous aspiration of the peoples that make up this Organization. Only those countries hold the key to the problem, which is to decide to impose on racist South Africa mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter. This would do them honour and allay doubts about violation of the cardinal principles of our Organization by the nations that are responsible for peace and security in the world and that defend human rights.\nThe General Assembly has decided that apartheid is a crime against humanity. It must be dealt with as such. Apart from apartheid, the Palestinian tragedy is the major political question concerning the solution of which our Organization has already disappointed two generations of people.\nThe successive wars in the Middle East since the State of Israel was established, the gradual disintegration of Lebanon, and in particular the plunder of the Palestinian people and its reduction to statelessness, are a black mark against the United Nations.\nWe therefore welcome, as the last chance for the United Nations to play a decisive role in the settlement of this problem, the idea, which is gaining ground, regarding the convening, under United Nations auspices, of an international conference on the Middle East. The success of that Conference can be guaranteed only if the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole representative of the Palestinian people, is admitted as a fully-fledged participant on the same footing as Israel. I cannot conclude without mentioning the concern that my country, as a member of the Non-Aligned movement, feels about the problem of the reconciliation of the two communities in Cyprus, the independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula, and the process of peace and integration in Central America.\nAll the peoples concerned wish to live free of foreign interference and hegemonistic designs; some to forge a national identity, others to forge a regional entity. The fulfilment of these noble aspirations can only benefit our Organization and the international community.\nI think it is right to say that the international situation, despite the persistence of the economic crisis, seems better this year than it was at the same time last year. There has been a relaxation of the most acute tensions and nations are engaging resolutely in the search for peace and the building of a better future.\nOn the strength of this, I venture to hope that at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly the last guns will have been silenced on the last battlefields of the world, the Palestinians will be back in their land building a future together with the Israelis, the state of emergency will have been lifted in South Africa, Nelson Mandela will have been released from the apartheid gaol and, finally, Namibia will occupy in this Hall, somewhere between Mozambique and Nepal, the place that has been its by right for so long, and for which it has waited far too long.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, my dear friend and colleague, I take especial pleasure in telling you how gratified we Costa Ricans feel to see you presiding over the General Assembly. Your gifts as a statesman, your breadth of diplomatic experience and your profound faith in democracy, all of which have been proven by your record in brotherly Argentina, are a guarantee of success in the conduct of our debates.\nI should like also to express appreciation of the part played in the recent election by Dams Nita Barrow, the Ambassador of Barbados, who enhanced the great traditions of this Organization.\nThrough the dedication of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and that of his distinguished associates to the cause of peace, the effectiveness of the United Nations in promoting understanding among peoples has been demonstrated. But let it be said that without his tact, experience, wisdom and culture, these accomplishments would not have been possible. Such successes renew the confidence placed in our Organization and help to strengthen it, as the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces shows. Costa Rica, which has no army, was deeply moved at this well deserved award of the Prize and the recognition that it represents of the forces and arms that silence war, save lives and protect peoples. We congratulate them sincerely.\nThe very essence of the work of this Organization is to apply a body of international law that was conceived while humanity was suffering the ravages of the most bloody conflict in history. The Charter signed at San Francisco outlawed the use of force in international relations and formulated the hope that the history of the world would not be the history of the wars of mankind. To make this hope a reality, peoples must live and act in accordance with the principles of the Charter. Double standards of ethics in our Organization, whereby acts are forgiven or condemned according to the sympathies or interests of the moment, erode faith in the Organization. Today's renewed confidence in the Organization resulting from its successful efforts in bringing about a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, in finding solutions to the conflicts in Afghanistan, Kampuchea and Western Sahara, in seeking reconciliation in Cyprus and promoting the independence of Namibia should put an end to any temptation to return to those practices which negate the very essence of this Organization.\nThis opens up a new phase of well-founded hopes - hopes that were more than confirmed by the positive talks between the President of the United States, Mr. Ronald Reagan, and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev, the outcome of which proves the effectiveness of dialogue in achieving the most noble goals. The step taken towards disarmament is a small one by comparison with the long path that lies ahead\u00b7, but let us hope that it signals the dawn of a world free from hatred and fear.\nAs Costa Rica has outlawed the army as a permanent institution, it has supported with special emphasis and moral authority the efforts made by the United Nations to halt the arms race. Costa Rica calls for full awareness of the need for world-wide disarmament, for definite action to ban nuclear tests and reduce nuclear arsenals, to initiate conventional disarmament and to stop the transfer of weapons to underdeveloped nations.\nThe countries of the third world have often had the misfortune to suffer the tragic fate of being the setting for confrontation between the great Powers. Strategic, political and economic conflicts which escalate into war take place in peaceful regions and take their deadly toll among the sons of those peoples. \nIt is alarming to know that world military spending amounts to a trillion dollars a year - an amount 20 times more than the total amount of the co-operation extended to the developing world. It is a source of shame to know that, in the first 12 hours of today, more than 14,000 children have died somewhere in the world for lack of food and medical attention, while in those same 12 hours more than $136 billion has been spent on armaments, an amount which any intelligent person will realize far exceeds the sum needed to avoid that tragedy.\nIf the agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States were to lead to complete disarmament, we, along with all the peoples of the world, would joyfully trust that, having averted the threat of a new holocaust, the resources previously allocated to weapons would now be used for education and health, economic development and culture throughout the world. In other words, we would live in accordance with the principle which upholds nature itself, destruction would end and creation would begin. That is why the small developing countries urgently need to convince all the military Powers that peace is in the best interests of all.\nThe community of nations has witnessed with deep concern the continuing crisis in Central America. The desolation of vast areas of land, the devastation of some economies, the appalling misery and imprisonment, the persecution or death of those who disagree with their rulers are serious ills which Esquipulas II sought to resolve within a given time frame, but which persist because Governments lack the political will to carry out the process of democratization to which they agreed. For Esquipulas II is, above all, the final stage of the plan presented by President Arias which, in turn, embodied all the efforts of the Contadora Group and its Contact Group. It is an unswerving commitment to democracy. \n\u0386 thorough consideration of the obligations entered into in the Guatemala procedures would lead to the conclusion that, to a greater or lesser degree, none of the States that signed the procedure has complied fully with the terms of the agreement. This applies also to Costa Rica, because our Legislative Assembly has delayed ratification of the treaty establishing the Centred American parliament. None the less, when the Esquipulas II agreement was signed, our country had already for some decades been doing far more than carrying out the fundaments, objectives of the plan. For more than 40 years there have not been any military hostilities in Costa Rica and within the uninterrupted existence of its pluralistic democracy there has been permanent and intensive national dialogue. Since 1948 we have outlawed the army and there are no forces threatening the stability of our institutions. No Costa Rican has ever been imprisoned or exiled for political reasons, human rights are respected and we enjoy our freedom in peace.\nReturning now to Central America, the reality is that the progression of that peace process has been halted and the international community, though encouraged by the trend towards dialogue and detente evident in other hemispheres, anxiously wonders why that crisis has not been resolved, since it is much smaller than certain others in which a solution is beginning to be found. There is a lack of genuine political will among some of the principal parties concerned. Although we can record progress in some areas, the fundamental commitments leading to democracy, national reconciliation, the sacrosanct protection of human rights and the non-use of territories as military sanctuaries have not been fulfilled. In the midst of all this, unfortunately, we must note that as the months have gone by we have seen the Nicaraguan Government step up its repression, fail to fulfil its commitments and attempt to reduce the crisis to a problem of security, showing obvious contempt for democratic values. \nPerhaps in no other country of the region is the situation so chaotic; and perhaps no other Government has shown less will to solve it. But, what is worse, that situation has serious repercussions on neighbouring countries, which have to take in the thousands of persons who are fleeing in an attempt to find freedom, food and shelter. I appeal to the States Members of the United Nations to provide relief to the countries of refuge for the tremendous burden now weighing on us. Our greatest concern, however, is that the international community should renew its interest in peace and democracy in Central America.\nI recognize that many States have stood by Central America in this long night of self-destruction. Similarly, the Secretaries-General of this Organization and the Organization of American States have shown a special interest in helping us solve our problems. Nevertheless, I have come here to ask that the democracies that share this concern should join together in a movement to support democracy in Central America, thereby renovating, strengthening and carrying out the Esquipulas II agreements, which aroused such well-founded optimism in the international community.\nThis effort to ensure democracy in Central America would be incomplete if we did not take into account the challenges involved in actually building and improving that democracy. Now more than ever before the industrialized countries must increase their co-operation in support of development, which of necessity has to respect the freedom and dignity of citizens, and they must help to give concrete shape to the special plan of economic assistance for Central America adopted by the General Assembly at its last session.\nThat is all the more urgent when we bear in mind the critical situation which the foreign-debt problem has created for the Central American nations. We are the victims of poverty and of a crushing financial commitment which has only rarely produced an improvement in our economic and social conditions. We recognize our commitment and, like most debtor countries, are staking tremendous sacrifices to honour it. We believe, however, that our creditors must fully understand the extent of these sacrifices. So far the international community does not appear to have clearly realized that the present situation cannot go on much longer. We see that debt servicing is swallowing up the foreign exchange we need for the health, education and development of our peoples and, incredibly, our creditors' strategy disregards the very high social and political costs involved in the debt servicing.\nWe are not, of course, asking that our entire debt be cancelled but, rather, that our creditors agree to share the responsibility and to negotiate realistic formulas to alleviate our debt burden. We recognize our responsibilities, but we ask our creditors to recognize theirs. The consequences of the present situation will be fatal in the short- or medium-term, and our creditors will be among the victims. That is why we ask that international financial policy should take into account the threat which this situation poses to the future of democracy in the world. In Latin America, where the building of democracy has gained strength, slowly and arduously, the conditions for the repayment of the debt and the social costs involved have started to undermine our democratic institutions.\nWe cannot disregard the fact that the sacrifices which the debt is demanding of the Latin American democracies might become a new pretext for succumbing to the temptation of totalitarianism. The danger which this situation poses to Central America strengthens our hope that the international financial community will realize that, because the countries of our region are very small and have barely begun their development and because some of them have suffered the ravages of nature and of violence, the region needs to be rebuilt and to grow in order to overcome subhuman conditions  Therefore we hope that the creditors will take an especially broad view of the situation, and we trust that that hope will not be in, vain.\nIn the past four decades most members of the international community have made a joint effort to establish a new international economic order that would narrow the gap between the developed and the developing States. The results, however, have been discouraging. We still have an economic system in which a handful of powerful beneficiaries are surrounded by the two thirds of the population of the world that live in poverty. That system is without any ethical basis it disavows man\u2019s solidarity with his fellow men and prevents all countries and all individuals from exacting their right to development, to the progress brought about by science and technology, to culture and well-being.\nThe third millennium of our era is about to begin, and the countries of the world - whether in the North or in the South, in the Eastern or in the Western Hemisphere, in the Caribbean basin or in the Pacific basin - should be able to provide all their citizens with a life of prosperity and freedom. What other meaning can one attach to roan's time on earth if it is not to turn the world into a place befitting the advanced status of the human species?\nI believe that the United Nations must make an extraordinary effort to discuss ideas and promote initiatives and, above all, to awaken in the statesman of the world a spirit of creative solidarity which will gradually shape for the twenty-first century the universe of peace and prosperity we all desire.\nThe Government of Costa Rica proposed the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of the item on science and peace; we want science to be applied more fully in the quest for peace and development. We want to encourage the scientific community to work towards the attainment of constructive social and economic goals. The link between science and technology must have an impact on the interdependence of technology and development, and not of technology and domination. It is a source of great concern to the Government of Costa Rica that the well being derived from scientific and technological discoveries is narrowly focused on a small group of inhabitants of the earth and, at the same time, a considerable share of science and technology is devoted to promoting, not man's well being, but his extermination and the destruction of his property. Above all, however, we are concerned and indignant that it is technological progress in the military sphere which is made available to the developing world on the most favourable terms and that countries which do not have what they need to feed their peoples incur military expenditures out of all proportion to the size of their impoverished economies and incomparably larger than the tiny sums they spend on education or health - to mention only the essentials.\nScience, which records and synthesizes thousands of human experiences, which draws its sustenance from the knowledge of many, which is the result essentially of the most noble exercise of the human mind, should become the common heritage of mankind in order to enlighten and ennoble rather than to produce wealth and well being for a few at the cost of the hunger, the destruction and the death of the rest.\nOn 10 December we shall be commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. With the sitting of that charter of freedoms, human rights became a universal concern, and all States entered into a solemn commitment to observe them strictly. But genuine respect for those rights is still far from being A universal reality. Although it is recognized that frontiers must not be obstacles to respect for and full exercise of human rights, the safeguards which ensure their effectiveness are difficult to apply and are of questionable usefulness.\nWhen Costa Rica signed the Universal Declaration of Hunan Rights, it already had a long tradition of respect for those rights. As early as 1908 my country had been the headquarters of the Central American Court of Justice, the first international court to recognize the individual as a subject of international law. That was the principle we reiterated in 1948 in signing the Declaration. \nThat is why this must not be just another anniversary. The proximity of this fortieth anniversary of the Declaration should make us  ore aware that the framework of international backing designed to ensure the genuine and effective exercise of all the rights set forth in the Declaration remains ineffective. Costa Rica therefore reiterates its proposal for the appointment of a high commissioner for human rights who by his efforts would help to improve the discouraging situation of human rights in this world. We have here an excellent opportunity to reconsider this idea and put it into practice, otherwise obnoxious departures from the basic minimum norms establishing those rights will continue to be appalling challenges and to shock international public opinion. Because of its selectiveness, the present system of appointing special rapporteurs ignores the violations that occur in States which are not subject to United Nations vigilance and are thus not subject to the beneficial scrutiny of special rapporteurs.\nEighty-six States have ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 38 are parties to its Optional Protocol, while 99 States are parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Costa Rica was the first country to ratify both Covenants and strongly urges those countries which have not yet done so to adhere to them as the roost effective and genuine way of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n1 cannot end my discussion of this topic without expressing the profound indignation of the people and Government of Costa Rica at the continued daily violation of human rights by the Government of South Africa. Costa Rica, in order to place on record its repudiation of such conduct in deeds rather than words, broke off relations with the South African regime in 1986 and, like the vast majority of member s of this Assembly, demands an end to that abominable system of segregation, which is contrary to all the basic natural rules of human coexistence. A few days ago a call was made here for the release of all political prisoners held by that regime. We take this opportunity to join in the appeal and to demand support for the efforts of President Mobutu of Zaire to help bring about the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and all those who have been imprisoned in South Africa simply for having asserted their own humanity. This situation shocks the conscience of all free men.\nI must also express our concern at the difficulties currently being experienced by Lebanon. As the President of France, Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, so eloquently put it, a peaceful and reconciled Lebanon is a threat to no one. A Lebanon torn apart by violence will continue to be an aura of insecurity for everyone. Let us hope that peace will return to that country.\nMy Government is concerned, too, by the scourge of illicit drug trafficking, which corrupts with its millions people from all economic and social backgrounds and regions. It threatens the stability of Governments and undermines the ethical and moral values on which our societies are based. Costa Rica has recently adopted new, stringent legislation against illicit trafficking and the abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and it proposes that more effective international machinery be established for both the prevention and the punishment of drug trafficking and to help producer countries replace such crops by new and lucrative ones in order effectively to dissuade farmers from taking part in the initial processes of the production of narcotic drugs.\nThe feelings of satisfaction which the United Nations is at present enjoying should make us reflect on the Organization's role as a forum for the universality of States. We hope therefore that progress towards the goal of universality will be made in the not too distant future so that we may welcome the admission of Namibia to the United Nations. We also hope soon to receive representatives from Korea, whether delegations from the two Republics that now exist or one delegation representing a unified Korea with a democratically elected Government. The fortieth anniversary of the Republic of Korea and the holding of the summer Olympic Games at Seoul - a world gathering of harmony and brotherhood - provide an auspicious opportunity for us to work for the admission of that country to our Organization. The new policy of co-operation and dialogue pursued by the Republic of Korea strengthens our hope that progress will be made in the reunification process.\nIt is our hope that the principle of universality will be fully realized and that the other States of the world which, of their own volition or because of other circumstances, remain outside the United Nations will soon join in the efforts being made for the progress of the human race.\nLet us do our utmost to ensure that this Organization and all its Member States strive whole-heartedly to achieve the goals set forth in 1945. Let us not be deterred by disappointments or difficulties. Let there be no force capable of making us stray from the truth, from honest and objective compliance with the principles and mandates set forth in the San Francisco Charter, which embodied a dream that we must all make a reality.\nAt a difficult moment, when he had doubts as to what course to follow, Abu Talib asked Mohammed whether he should support a cause even if it departed from the course that his conscience told him was right. The Prophet answered him:\n\\\"Though they might give me the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left, even then I would not let myself stray from the truth.\\\"\nLet those be our words too. Let us live according to the principles that we have sworn to uphold. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe are proud that Foreign Minister Dante Caputo of Argentina is presiding over the General Assembly- Argentina and Ecuador are States linked by brotherly ties in the past and by solidarity in the present. Apart from his great qualities as a statesman, he firmly believes in democracy and his presence here leading our debate is therefore a guarantee of success. .\u0142\nThrough the Secretary-General, we wish to reaffirm our adherence to and support for the world Organization. It seems that at long last the value and t usefulness of this visionary instrument of mankind are being understood. \nA few weeks ago we Ecuadorians elected a new government. We see this election as an important step in our effort to consolidate democracy. The Government proclaims social justice with freedom, and on this its first attendance at the highest international gathering, it wishes to express its determined support for the principles and commitments of the international community. A legal order was established in San Francisco which is a guarantee for all nations, to the extent that all of us respect it and to the extent that all of us contribute to strengthening it. Our attitude and our foreign policy are consonant with that purpose. They were clearly defined by President Rodrigo Borja on his assumption of office. They are aimed at closer ties of friendship and co-operation with all the countries of the world. We shall seek peace, security and development in our foreign endeavours. Without peace there is no freedom nor can there be development. Without security and without development we cannot speak of co-operation or of international social justice.\nWe firmly believe, therefore, in the need to defend peace wherever it may be threatened. We have faith in the spirit of understanding and solidarity which is giving new hope to mankind.\nWe believe in the possibility of building a community of nations which in their domestic and international life will give practical and real effect to the vocation of free men\u00b7\nWe believe in the freedoms. We uphold them and advocate them as the framework and basis of all human rights. We link these rights to the possibilities and requirements of well-being and respect for man as an individual and for peoples as nations.\nOur conviction leads us to seek fervently the development of our people: an integrated development which goes beyond mere growth and provides opportunities for all, justice with freedom and harmonious coexistence.\nWe feel confident that we can thus advance the national effort, appropriately uniting all interests. We are aware of the magnitude of our shortcomings and of the seriousness and urgency of the problems. We know that we must make a gigantic national effort. In order to do so we are counting on resolute action from all sectors of the country and we shall ensure respect and security for their legitimate activities. We are counting also on co-operation from international bodies and friendly countries which we invite to join in the crusade we are launching to create the well-being our people demand.\nThe world we all want, therefore, is a world of peace, solidarity, justice and freedom. In that spirit, we advocate a climate of harmony and of trust in our relations and in those of all countries, so that our borders and all borders will be places to meet in friendship and co-operation and not places of misunderstanding and incidents. That is why we firmly support processes to disarm morally, to reduce military spending and to end the nuclear race; that is why we strongly support the Latin American processes of integration; and that is why we advocate a peaceful solution to conflicts and disputes which poison relations among peoples, forcing them to divert resources to defence by reducing investment in urgently needed development projects.\nThe stockpiling of weapons does not lead to greater security. Armed peace is not safe peace. It never was, nor will it ever be. World peace is indissolubly linked to general and complete disarmament. We welcome the fact, therefore, that the United States and the Soviet Union have concluded a treaty on the elimination of short- and intermediate-range nuclear missiles, it is important that the first true disarmament measure has been adopted, but new commitments in the same direction must also be adopted and resources that today are devoted to the construction of means of mass destruction must be released in order to meet urgent social needs in the third world.\nIt has also become imperative to ban immediately chemical weapons, nuclear-weapon tests, the use of outer space for warlike purposes and the illegal and covert transfer of conventional weapons. The enormous sums spent on the arms race are ethically wrong and morally condemnable. The process of disarmament and arms limitation is closely linked with the duty of States to resolve their international disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, with equity and with the norms and principles of international law. Ecuador has traditionally complied with these cardinal rules of international relations. That is why we welcome the fact that the negotiating process which led to the signing of the Geneva accords on Afghanistan has initiated what we hope will be a step towards a different world, in which war, solutions based on force, indirect confrontation and mutual mistrust will be eliminated. It would appear that, thanks to the efforts of the United Nations and of the Secretary-General, in the Persian Gulf, in southern Africa, in Kampuchea, in Western Sahara and Cyprus we are reaching the stage of the triumph of diplomacy over intolerance, the victory of reason over force, the supremacy of dialogue and ideas over the lethal confrontation of the cannons.\nWe hope that this halo of hope will also surround the Middle East and Central America. We are particularly concerned about the conflict in the Central American region. We call upon all the parties involved to show the political will needed to implement and set in motion the formulas for a settlement which were so painstakingly drawn up and which are rightly based on respect for the sovereignty of States on the right freely to elect a certain form of government without foreign interference; on the exercise of true expressions of democracy, pluralism, social justice, individual freedoms and human rights.\nEcuador supports the various initiatives and constructive proposals for a solution to the serious Central American crisis. In particular, we stress the need to preserve and carry forward the important negotiating process that has corns from the valuable initiatives of President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and that is enshrined in the Esquipulas II agreement. He took great care to recognize the particular interests and situations of all the parties involved in the conflict. At this critical moment it has once again become urgent and necessary to remove immediately the obstacles which have arisen in the implementation of the Arias plan. Perhaps it can be reactivated by the holding of meetings between the parties in order to examine certain items or groups of items in a practical manner and with political foresight.\nWe most recall, furthermore, that the international community owes a debt to Central America. After the political settlement, an intensive development programme must be implemented with a high degree of international co-operation. Unfortunately, the positive aspects which can be discerned on the international political scene are not matched in economic, financial and monetary relations. We shall not have a harmonious and stable international order unless we devise an equitable international system which consolidates the best aspects of external trade, reverses the unfavourable terms of exchange, provides just and remunerative payment for the goods we export, facilitates the transfer of science and technology and contributes to a positive net flow of capital for development. The North-South dialogue is deadlocked. That is unacceptable, and the dialogue must therefore be resumed. \nFor Latin America the 1980s have been a period of economic stagnation and deterioration of the standard of living of its inhabitant. The consensus at present is that external debt and the manner in which it has been handled are perhaps the main element of the crisis afflicting the region today. However, the external debt of the countries is not an isolated event which arose spontaneously during the previous decade. To a great extent it is a result of the unjust international economic order, which is detrimental to the poorest countries and has limited the possibility of financing the growth of their economies.\nTherefore, the overcoming of the crisis in Latin America, which has lasted for almost a decade, depends, on the one hand, on the establishment of more just international economic relations and, on the other, on an understanding between debtors and creditors. For many years now the developing countries have called for acceptance of the conditions needed to achieve stable development of international economic activity for the benefit of both industrialized countries and developing countries.\nWe wish to reaffirm here that Ecuador recognizes the legitimacy of the debt incurred and will see to it that its commitments are honoured, without requiring, to that end, greater sacrifices from a people that has already suffered for almost seven years. We advocate an attitude favouring dialogue and not confrontation. I reiterate that we cannot continue to lay the full costs upon the debtors alone, ignoring the responsibility incumbent upon those who at one time approached them and offered huge loans without stopping to assess the risks entailed in such operations.\nIn other words, it is essential and urgent to promote understanding between the parties on the basis of mutual respect, seeking equitable solutions on the basis of which costs are shared for the sake of the resumption of the growth of the economics of the debtor countries. This would of course enable these countries to discharge their obligations more completely.\nIn this task, it is up to the multilateral credit organizations to increase financial flows to the developing countries - favouring the objective of social well-being and reducing conditionality on the basis of strict economic and financial criteria. In order to achieve this objective, the industrialized countries must honour their commitments with regard to the capitalization of these credit institutions.\nThese thoughts lead us to a conclusion that should be stated in this pre-eminent political forum. It is time for us to understand fully the close link between improving the standard of living of peoples and consolidating democratic regimes based on principles of freedom and justice.\nThe Government of Ecuador has chosen a serious, responsible and democratic path in order to overcome the economic crisis and place the country within sight of development. We have drawn up plans to stimulate the activities of all Ecuadorians and ensure the success of their efforts. We want a society based on respect for the law and inspired by broad solidarity on the basis of justice and with a strong social imprint. In this effort, we welcome international contributions, within rules governed by equity, realism and due regard for national interests, made in such a way that they will serve our purpose of overcoming underdevelopment, creating sources of employment and ensuring the prosperity of our people.\nThe delegation of Ecuador will indicate the position of my Government on the various agenda items in greater detail at the working sessions of this Assembly. I have mentioned the Government of Ecuador's concern and support for items of great importance such as disarmament and external debt. There are several other items, such as drug trafficking, that hold the special attention of my Government which, along with other Governments of the Americas, has pledged its unshakeable support for the struggle to combat this scourge of mankind.\nInternational co-operation and the political, economic, social and humanitarian work of this Organization are of prime importance to us. Our contribution will always be that of a country which looks with hope towards the changes taking place in the international community, which at the edge of the abyss and of a nuclear holocaust proved itself able to reflect and let the light of reason and common sense prevail. The new spirit that can be discerned in the super-Powers must open doors of understanding and comprehension, with vast possibilities for peace and friendship among peoples. It must also promote fulfilment of the just and heartfelt demands of the third world and those for the establishment of a true international legal order.\n'The relaxation of tension has been and must continue to be of invaluable importance for harmonious international coexistence. It is, without doubt, an essential factor in liberating minds from the spirit of confrontation and promoting dialogue and co-operation. The present economic crisis, with its tremendous weight of frustration for poor countries, has begun to awaken the world's conscience and its repercussions are becoming apparent in all countries. The United Nations has already shown its ability to adapt to new circumstances; the winds of change must lead to more adjustments and new approaches which will enable us all to respond to the new requirements of the time and of the peoples.\nIn this spirit and with this conviction, Ecuador pledges its support for the efforts required of us all to make this the world we want to pass on to our children. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nSir, may I offer you my congratulations on taking up the presidency of the General Assembly and send my warm thanks to the outgoing President, the Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic.\nThis has been a year of unprecedented natural disaster. No outsider can fully share the tragedy of the flooding in Bangladesh. The hurricane devastation in the Caribbean and Mexico has horrified us all. From South Asia, through Africa, to the Caribbean and even to the grain belt of America, we have seen destruction on a scale rarely equalled before.\nLast week I was in Africa. I went first to the Sudan. I saw there the devastation caused by the recent floods and the brave efforts of the Sudanese Government and people to cope with that crisis. I visited a refugee camp of 500 tents supplied by Britain, made in Malta. Alongside them were tents from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Nations from all over the world had come to Sudan's aid. The following day I flew to Kenya, where pictures of the famine and suffering in southern Sudan were front-page news in the Nairobi press.\nThe tragedies that have been occurring this year are seen and felt by people in towns and cities around the globe, and the world community has responded with rarely equalled sympathy and generosity. My own country alone has this year contributed some \u00a380 million to disaster relief around the world. The total contributed by the Western democracies is likely to have been at least 10 times that amount.\nThese immediate natural disasters are a poignant reminder of the need to tackle an issue that is of longer term but crucial for us all; the health of our planet as a whole. Some of its present transformation is good. Its resources are being better used for the benefit of mankind. But other elements are leading to a progressive pollution of the land, the sea and the air.\nThere has already been some disruption of natural patterns. Damage to the ozone layer, first identified by the British Antarctic Survey in 1985, caused instant international alarm. That concern has already led to agreement to limit the production of certain industrial chemicals.\nThe possibility of climatic change caused by the increase in the greenhouse gases, leading to a global heat trap, has become a real concern. The increases predicted in global temperatures would have substantial effects, within the next few decades, on life and human society. Even small variations would have great consequences in a crowded world.\nWe are totally dependent on climate. Damage it beyond repair, and the earth becomes a Lifeless desert spinning in space. We cannot leave a problem of this magnitude to technical bodies. Britain is among those who have pressed for a serious debate on the subject within the United Nations. Last year we welcomed the Brundtland report, the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. We want to carry forward its work. So we welcome the forthcoming discussion in the Second Committee. The problem must command an urgent place on the world agenda.\nIt is in the face of natural disaster that we are made most vividly aware of the fragility and interdependence of human existence. Faced with the enormity of the difficulties, the speed and universality of response are extraordinary. Yet sadly, in the face of man-made disasters we have not so far been able to respond in such a United and effective way. Their causes are more complex, their effects are equally devastating, and they too demand our utmost and our urgent energy and ingenuity. This year we have broken the pattern of the past by applying the principles of the Charter to the resolution of a lengthy and bloody dispute, the conflict between Iran and Iraq.\nEach one of us here is committed, bindingly committed, to the Charter of the United Nations; not just to words on a page, but to fundamental principles of\u00b7' justice and international law. It was those principles that I had in mind when I spoke here a year ago at the height of the Iran-Iraq war. I said then: \\\"The blunt truth is that the way in which the United Nations handles the conflict between Iran and Iraq must have a decisive effect upon its reputation in the eyes of all the peoples whom we represent.\\\" (A/42/PV.8, p. 58) I called then for a degree of unity which the international community had rarely been able to achieve, and a year later the scene that then seemed so dark and hopeless has been lighted by the united efforts of the international community.\nMany factors have helped to foster this change; the realization by Iran and Iraq that war to the death would mean mutual destruction the spirit and resolve of the Secretary-General and his dedicated staff; and, perhaps above all, the part played by the Security Council and its five permanent members.\nThe permanent members are given a unique power under the Charter. That power, the power of veto, carries with it a special responsibility, a responsibility that has rarely been exercised. But the last year has witnessed the development of a new co-operation among the five. It began tentatively; it was pursued pragmatically; but it was born of principle as well as pragmatism, of a combined determination to do all we could together to bring an end to the devastation of a senseless war.  \nThat determination, coupled with the skill, patience and persistence of the Secretary-General, culminated in the successful achievement of a cease-fire. Now the action has switched from the battleground to the negotiating table, from the banks of the Tigris to the banks of the East River. The Secretary-General must be allowed to build on the cease-fire so as to arrange the withdrawal of forces and the repatriation of prisoners of war. The framework for peace is Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which provides for negotiations under the auspices of the Security Council. Britain will do all in its power to sustain the spirit of co-operation and to contribute to a peaceful settlement.\nIf the international community can find a way forward on the dispute between Iran and Iraq it cannot ignore the plight of the Kurds, driven from their homes not by natural disaster but by unnatural force and brutality. The containment of conflict in one form must not lead to its prosecution in another.\nThe charge that Iraq has used chemical weapons against the Kurds adds gravity to the situation. Under Security Council resolution 620 (1988), the Secretary-General can conduct a prompt and independent inquiry. The need for such an inquiry is evident. The refusal of Iraq to co-operate in such an inquiry is all the more to be deplored, because the spread of chemical weapons is one of the most disturbing of recent developments.\nAs more countries develop a chemical-weapons capability, the risk of the increased use of these weapons as an instrument of war and terror multiplies. It is for that reason that Britain has taken a lead in preparing an international convention for the world-wide suppression of chemical weapons and in pressing the crucial case for greater openness in this field. Nowhere is glasnost more necessary. At the special session in June I made important proposals to strengthen the international standards of the 1925 Geneva Protocol. So today I welcome President Reagan's proposal to reconvene the 1925 Geneva Conference to mobilize the international community behind the search for a convention on chemical weapons which would outlaw their use.\nCo-operation on the resolution of the Iran-Iraq conflict has been unique. But it must not be the only example of the constructive exercise of shared responsibility among the permanent members of the Security Council. There are grounds for hoping that will not be the case, for we have also been witnessing this year a change in the atmosphere which increases the scope for such co-operation.\nEast-West relations themselves have moved on to a new footing. The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - the Washington and Moscow summits and the Moscow Party Conference have all been remarkable in their separate ways.\nPerhaps just as significant has been the recent acknowledgement by Mr. Shevardnadze that foreign policy is no longer to be seen in Moscow as a special form of class struggle. \\\"The struggle between the opposing systems\\\", he said, \\\"is no longer a determining tendency of the present era\\\". I believe that most of the members of this Assembly will say \\\"amen\\\" to that. No longer, to paraphrase Clausewitz, need foreign policy be the continuation of class warfare by other means.\nEven so, progress on arms-control talks would not have been made without the constant and united determination of the members of the North Atlantic alliance. Of course we want to see success in the negotiations between Washington and Moscow for a reduction in strategic weapons, but we want to see early progress as well in cutting the conventional imbalances in Europe, which prejudice the security of millions of people. \nArms-control negotiations no longer bear the full burden of East-West relations. They remain a vital component in the creation of a climate of confidence. So too does the search for a world-wide pattern of respect for human rights and freedom. In Europe we look for further progress in this regard from an early conclusion of the Vienna Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The fundamental principle, which we have long proclaimed and which Mr. Shevardnadze endorsed in his statement yesterday, is that the rule of law and the right of the individual to determine his own future are inseparable.\nMore widely than that, if we can establish confidence in East-West relations we can harness energies which have too often pulled in different directions, and put them to constructive work. The place to do that is the United Nations.\nThere are many tasks, many regional conflicts, but also growing signs that progress is possible.\nRecent developments over Afghanistan are one example. Eight years after its forces invaded Afghanistan the Soviet Union has finally begun to take them home. Over half have now left. This may well reflect a new realism in Moscow, but it is also a consequence of the courage and determination of the Afghan people and of the sustained and overwhelming support of this General Assembly. Tens of thousands of Afghans have died. Millions have been driven from their homes. That is why we now look forward to the complete and prompt withdrawal of Soviet troops. The Afghan people as a whole must then be given the chance to select a truly representative government by a genuine act of self-determination. Only then can Afghanistan start to live again.\nIt is possible now to perceive as well that universal condemnation of Viet Nam's illegal occupation of Cambodia is also having its effect. Britain was among the first to insist that Viet Nam must withdraw from Cambodia unconditionally and quickly. Viet Nam cannot by itself sustain its occupation; its own economy is in ruins. \nOne consequence of Viet Nam's policy has been the huge exodus of its own people in boats to Hong Kong and other destinations. It is time for this tragic migration to cease, time for Viet Nam to take back its own people in humane fashion. Hong Kong's policy of seeking to return those people who are not genuine refugees is the only way to cope with what would otherwise be an unmanageable influx.\nWe also think the time is now right to look closely at ways of promoting a settlement in Cambodia. The aim should be to secure the early and unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and a political settlement to give Cambodia a stable and secure Government, that must by definition preclude a return to the horrors of the Pol Pot regime.\nJust as in the Gulf one resolution of the Security Council offers the prospect of peace, so in southern Africa another resolution offers similar hope of a peaceful end to an old dispute. Ten years ago tomorrow Security Council resolution 435 (1978) was adopted. It remains the best framework for independence for Namibia.  The first crucial step has been taken in South Africa's withdrawal from Angola and the establishment of an effective cease-fire. The next task is to achieve the withdrawal of South African forces from Namibia; and all Cuban forces from Angola and free- elections in Namibia, leading to independence. That will require enormous ingenuity, perseverance and compromise.\nIt will require from South Africa a new respect for the integrity of its independent neighbours. We hope the recent reaffirmation of the Nkomati accord represents a commitment by South Africa to the stability of the region as a whole.\nIt will require from Angola a determined effort to achieve reconciliation within Angola, where the Cuban presence has helped to make an international issue of what is essentially a matter for internal resolution.\nJust as Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has stood the test of time, so too has the British Government's commitment to act in its support. We long ago offered to provide a signals unit to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). We remain ready to play our part, and are ready, with our partners in the European Community, to offer assistance to an independent Namibia.\nA settlement in Angola and the independence of Namibia would not in themselves resolve the intractable problems of South Africa. The principle at stake there is a simple one; the liberty and dignity of the individual. We are committed to the abolition of the system of apartheid, which stifles liberty and denies dignity. We have to find the lever that will effect that change. We do not believe that comprehensive sanctions are that lever. Some see sanctions as a political gesture which should be made almost for its own sake, but it would be an empty gesture. It would be a gesture with too high a price attached; too high a price in terms of the millions of black jobs, black livelihoods, which would be at stake. Our goal is the same as that of our friends in Africa. We are doing all we can to bring apartheid to an end.\nOur aid to South Africa's neighbours since 1980 is worth well over \u00a31 billion. We supply defence assistance to Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The Limpopo railway is being repaired with British help and defended by Mozambican troops trained in Zimbabwe by British army officers.\nWe give aid to black groups and individuals within South Africa so that they can educate themselves, build their own enterprises and free themselves from the oppression of apartheid.\nIn southern Africa, the parties to a longstanding dispute seem at last to be seeking agreement within the framework of a Security Council resolution.\nThe principles of a settlement in the Middle East were similarly laid down in a Security Council resolution 21 years ago. They are no less valid today. Israel and the Palestinians have a historic sense of injustice. That injustice is aggravated, not alleviated, by terrorist attacks against Israel. And the violent suppression of Palestinian aspirations jeopardizes the search for a peaceful settlement.\nThe international community cannot afford to give up the search for peace. The need for an international conference involving the five permanent members of the Security Council is more vital than ever. We shall be persistent in our efforts to help create the conditions in which such a conference can be held.\nIn Western Sahara, we have been the two sides to a dispute brought together by the commendable efforts of the Secretary-General. They have accepted that a referendum is the only way of resolving their differences. \nI hope that this new willingness to seek peaceful solutions will prove contagious. Regarding one dispute with which Britain itself is concerned, let me just say one thing; the right of the Falkland islanders to self-determination cannot be compromised, hat my country will continue energetically to seek ways of restoring more normal relations with Argentina.\nRegional disputes around the world are by no means all or even the worst of our problems today. Conflicts within a nation pose some of the most complicated and intractable problems facing the international community. Often they are at a level deeper than a dispute between one nation State and the next. Often they escape the procedures and the mechanisms by which we are accustomed to operate. Yet the way in which they dislocate the very fabric of nationhood is itself a cause of tension and a challenge for the international community.\nThe tragedy of the Lebanon is an example of such sub-national conflict that divides a country down the middle and at the same time extends beyond its borders. We can think of other examples. Earlier this month, in Sudan, I saw the tragic consequences of an internal conflict unresolved. And the conflict in Ethiopia has exacerbated the horrors of famine and starvation in that country.\nIn Burma, we have been appalled at the killing of unarmed demonstrators, women and children, which has taken place over the past three months. Such violence will solve nothing. The Burmese authorities must recognize that the only way to a lasting solution to the country's internal crisis lies in meeting the desire of the Burmese people for greater freedom and multi-party democracy.\nThis type of internal problem poses particular difficulties for the international community. We must work hard to find answers.\nI welcome the resumption of the peace process in Cyprus. The Secretary-General has met the leaders of the two communities on the island. Agreement has been created on negotiating a just and lasting settlement by 1 June next year. As we meet here, another international event is under way on the far side of the world. In Seoul, in Korea, the hosting of the Olympic Games is a tribute to the remarkable political and economic progress made in that country. We welcome the recent contacts between North and South: we hope that they will contribute to the improvement in atmosphere that will one day lead to the Korean people being properly represented with us here in this institution.\nWe can extend our co-operation into new areas to deal with new challenges to international peace and stability, challenges which postdate the creation of the United Nations itself.\nThe battle against international terrorism is one such. Following the hijacking of KU 422 in April, Britain launched an initiative which led to an agreement in the International Civil Aviation Organization on the detaining of hijacked aircraft so as to contain the spreading of a hijack crisis from one country to another. We must build on that measure to strengthen international protection against future hijackings.\nThe evil of drug-related crime also challenges us to a united response. In some parts of the world the malevolent forces of drug trafficking do as much damage as traditional armed conflict. Individually, many nations may feel they are victims of forces beyond their control. Together, the international community has a power immeasurably greater than the greatest threat. We must create powerful weapons for ourselves, above all by denying the use of the financial system to those that profit from this trade and by preventing funds from being ploughed back into that trade, through co-operation to seize drug traffickers' assets wherever they are. My own country has adopted legal powers to help do this. We cannot act alone. We urge the international community to consider similar action. \nWith the terrorist, the hijacker, the drug trafficker, we have to find ways of directly attacking the environment which sustains him. We must deny him the life support of finance or the comfort of a bolt hole on the other side of a frontier. Drugs and terror are partners in crime. We must be partners within this Organization in fighting them.\nWe must be partners, too, in fighting afflictions which are not man-made but which require human resource to solve. When AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) first started, there was a tendency to put up moral barricades, maximize blame and minimize action. Now we know better. In January, Ministers of Health from all over the world met in London to discuss the problem openly, compare our experience and co-operate in finding solutions. In the face of such disparate and complex issues it is not always easy for the international community to act. None the less, the greater the degree of unity we can display, the greater our chances of finding solutions.\nIn the face of such disparate and complex issues it is not always easy for the international community to act. None the less, the greater the degree of unity we can display, the greater our chances of finding solutions. I am convinced that we can go further together.\nI began by speaking about my recent visit to Africa and of how different countries, helped by the international community, are coping with man-made as well as natural hazards. In each of the five African countries I visited I was enormously conscious of the economic problems with which they are grappling. Their experience is mirrored in other continents. \nSo we warmly welcomed the positive conclusion last weekend of the meeting under United Nations auspices which reviewed the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. We will continue to do all we can to help. We can now build further on our partnership with the countries concerned,\nDisparities between rich and poor cannot be reduced overnight. It will be a long process. Aid can help. So, too, can the creation of more open conditions for international trade, and likewise internal economic reform, within the framework of structural adjustment and with adequate support from other countries. That is the importance of relieving the burden of debt on those least able to bear it. These are all matters in which Britain will continue to play a prominent, and in many respects a catalytic, role.\nThe proposals on debt relief which we launched over a year ago are now coming to fruition. This opens the way for a number of countries to benefit from rescheduling on concessional terms before the end of the year. But in the last resort it is the Governments and peoples of the countries concerned that must work out their own destiny. We support their own strong determination to that end and we will work to sustain our own partnership with them.\nThere is a new spirit throughout the world in seeking to live up to the undertakings which we have all given under the United Nations Charter. There is a new resolve to put this Organization to work for our common good. We must sustain that spirit and that resolve in the year ahead.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like to congratulate Ambassador Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am convinced that under his guidance, the Assembly will achieve results that will further enhance the authority of the United Nations.\nI wish also to acknowledge the outstanding presidency of his predecessor, Comrade Peter Florin. Each session of the General Assembly begins with a review of the international situation. At the forty-third session too we have heard every speaker pose the same questions in different ways, namely; what is happening in the world? Are we capable of staving off the nuclear threat and putting an end to conflict? Are we securely embarked on the course of strengthening peace and security?\nAlthough it would be hard to provide a simple answer to those questions, the facts show that there has indeed been progress. The world is changing for the better. We can see the emergence of a qualitatively new situation that does not conform to the usual stereotypes of the balance of power, two camps, the class struggle or other concepts based on strength. What has changed? For the first time in history, we have begun to see that mankind is a single, hole united by its common efforts to survive and continue to develop towards progress and civilization.\nSome examples of the changes taking place in the world are the move in Soviet-United States relations from confrontation to dialogue, the greater positive contribution made in world affairs by the Non-Aligned Movement, and the active impact of public opinion on international policy.\nThese trends are no mere accident. They result from the general course of world events. The deepening of mankind's self-awareness has coincided with the processes of restructuring and renewal taking place in socialist countries. The technological and scientific revolution, the increasing importance of moral and democratic factors in public life, and an overall improvement in the political education of peoples have helped bring about a reassessment of the problems of human coexistence.\nThe philosophy of a new political thinking has thus arisen. At its core lies the primacy of universal human values over bloc and ideological considerations. That philosophy has inspired a new diplomacy in search of sensible and mutually acceptable solutions to international problems. A broad consensus is developing on the need for a comprehensive approach to security issues, taking into account both the military-political and the economic, humanitarian, ecological and other factors.\nIn his address to the eightieth conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which ended three weeks ago in Sofia, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and President of the State Council of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Comrade Zhivkov, stated that\n\\\"The new realities require new political action on the part of the people. The threat of ecological catastrophe, economic underdevelopment, widespread disease, the terrible infant-mortality rate and growing illiteracy are global problems that can be resolved only through the common efforts of mankind, with a thorough restructuring of international relations on the basis of a balance of interests.\\\"\nThe international community's desire to break the vicious circle of military rivalry and confrontation and to guarantee security by political means through consolidating the primacy of international law is increasingly reflected in a new understanding of the international role of the United Nations.\nBulgaria has always attached great importance to strengthening the role and effectiveness of the United Nations. Along with other countries, Bulgaria believes the Organization should become a genuine, effective instrument for maintaining international peace and security, developing international co-operation and settling conflicts and crises. We support proposals made here that the working methods and approach of the General Assembly and the Security Council be updated to \nmake better use of the Organization's peace-keeping potential. Bulgaria will continue to contribute to the noble, all-embracing work of the United Nations. \nI take particular note today of the Organization's contribution to the settlement of a number of international disputes, and in particular of the important role played by the esteemed Secretary-General, Mr, Javier Perez de Cuellar.\nIt is a fact that positive developments can be seen throughout the entire spectrum of world problems, regional disputes and sources of tension. Slowly and somewhat hesitantly foe the present, a situation is emerging which favours the collective search for solutions. It would be wrong to draw general conclusions for the entire world, but there appears to be a clear desire to find national and regional agreement with the assistance of the international community. \nThe Geneva Agreements en Afghanistan were a milestone in the struggle to improve the international climate. Unswerving compliance with them is the only guarantee of restoring peace in that country and the region. We support the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Afghanistan to overcome that crisis by democratic means.\nWe were very pleased to hear of the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq. As a State that took part in the drafting and adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), we support the peace process and the mediation work done by the United Nations.\nIn the Middle East, the essence of the problem there has not yet been resolved. The struggle of the Palestinian people for its freedom and self-determination continues. A positive factor is the almost complete agreement on the need to convene an international conference on the matter,. We believe that it should be held on the basis of existing United Nations resolutions with the participation of all interested parties, including the five permanent members of the Security Council and the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole, authentic representative of the Palestine Arabs.\nMultilateral dialogue is taking place on questions relating to southern Africa. We hope that the decisions of the Organisation will finally be implemented and that Angola and other States of the region will attain peace, so long awaited, that Namibia will attain its independence and that the apartheid system will be abolished.\nBulgaria sees great potential in the policy of national reconciliation proclaimed by Kampuchea. We are glad to see that prospects are being opened up through the efforts of Viet Nam and other peace-loving States. We welcome the policy of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful democratic unification of the country, to demilitarize the peninsula and to turn it into a nuclear-free zone.\nWe support the consistent efforts of Nicaragua and other Latin American countries to provide a peaceful solution to the problems of the region through dialogue and strict compliance with the principles of the Charter. We have been following very closely the development of the Cyprus problem. Certain progress is evident in the island, and we hope that, through political means and with United Nations assistance, the source of tension will finally be defused.\nNaturally it is impossible to achieve complete harmony between opposing forces and parties, but opponents must re-think contradictions from the standpoint of greater realism. They must agree to sensible compromises, from which all sides stand to gain. Accordingly, we believe that participants in conflicts should more carefully heed the collective wisdom of the world community. It alone has the moral right to judge the norms and rules of international coexistence. In all cases, an abiding condition of the peace process is recognition of every people's right to freedom of choice, without which it is impossible to resolve a conflict or achieve just and lasting peace.\nBulgaria is located in the Balkans, a region with a difficult and complex history. That is why we are sincerely delighted at the steps towards detente and co-operation taken by Balkan States. They are in keeping with the spirit of the time and the aspirations of the Balkan peoples.\nThe emergence of new thinking in the Balkans was expressed with increasing clarity at the Belgrade meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries, which was held in a constructive and businesslike atmosphere. All of us who participated in that meeting sought to find a common language and stressed common interests, not confrontation or grievances. We commend the holding of that forum and the Balkan process it started.\nThe Balkans are a priority in Bulgaria's foreign policy. In 1981 we started working out and we are now implementing, a set of measures and initiatives to strengthen good-neighbourliness and improve the overall atmosphere in the region. Despite any vicissitudes of fate, the constant goal of our policy has always been, and will continue to co-operation, peace and security in the Balkans.\nBasing ourselves on that goal, we will continue to work together with all Balkan States on a very broad, equitable footing. Our guiding light will be the legitimate interests of states, historical realities and the peace imperatives of our time. We believe that the key link in the joint efforts to promote peace could be to turn the peninsula into a zone free from weapons of mass destruction, which would certainly help to reduce confrontation, mistrust and hostility in the broader gees strategic context as well.\nI note with satisfaction that our discussion of urgent issues relating to disarmament today is reflecting the impact of new political thinking. The image of \\\"the enemy\\\" preparing for a nuclear strike or an attack using conventional weapons is gradually being replaced by the image of a normal person sincerely concerned about his or her security. Increasingly, there is a desire to understand one's partner, his way of thinking, his concerns. Without a doubt, not all remnants of the past have been removed, and not all stereotypes have been overcome, but ridding dialogue of futile rhetoric and propagandistic clich\u00e9s, which has started to happen, is a major prerequisite for the strengthening of mutual understanding. Today, the most important task is the conclusion of an agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States on the reduction by 50 per cent of strategic offensive weapons. This should become a milestone in the achieving of strategic stability as we move towards the twenty-first century, and towards the complete elimination of nuclear arsenals.\nProgress is being made on the halting of nuclear tests. A complete ban on chemical weapons will become a reality in the near future. I should like to recall that although the Soviet-United States talks provide the main impetus in the disarmament process, the process, should become multilateral. No one can escape responsibility in this regard. We believe that lowering the level of military confrontation between the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) which started with the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles will be continued as a result of negotiations to reduce armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe. The July 1988 statement of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty set the goal of these negotiations as effecting radical reductions in the military potential of the two alliances, achieving a situation on the continent whereby they would have at their disposal the forces and facilities adequate for their defence but insufficient to conduct surprise attacks or to carry out offensive operations. Such reductions should be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in military expenditures. The functions and tasks of these forces should be determined by non-aggressive, defensive military doctrines, the core of which is the principle of reasonable sufficiency.\nAt the same time, it is clear even to the uninitiated that progress in disarmament in certain areas has been accompanied by a specific shifting of resources to other areas. Naval armaments are still immune to disarmament efforts. The situation urgently requires the adoption of political decisions to reduce naval forces, bearing in mind mutual interests. For several years now, Bulgaria has been calling for the adoption of such a decision and working to that end. As a first step, we think it would be a good idea to discuss and adopt confidence-building measures on the seas and oceans and on maritime routes.\nThe problems of verification, openness and predictability in the military sphere are acquiring growing significance. A United Nations comprehensive machinery for verification - as suggested by a number of countries, including Bulgaria - would make it possible to exercise proper control not only over arms reductions but also over regional conflicts so that they could be prevented. \nOuter space, like Earth, should be free of weapons. Broad international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space rather than space-based weapons would help us in building confidence and eliminating the threat of nuclear catastrophe.\nA major aspect of the disarmament problem is that it is intrinsically linked with development issues. Reducing military potential would allow the mobilization of the necessary resources to overcome underdevelopment and promote social and economic progress.\nThe growing awareness of global Interdependence, positive trends in various parts of the world and the normalization of East-West relations have given us grounds to hope for positive changes in international economic relations. The time has come to restructure these relations on a just and democratic basis. The economic situation of the developing countries, and in particular their heavy foreign debt burden, is a serious problem for the entire International community. A just solution of that problem will require the concerted efforts of the world community, bearing in mind the interests of and prevailing conditions in the debtor countries and the basic goals of their socio-economic development. The United Nations can and should make a contribution to resolving this issue.\nThe establishment of official relations between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the European Economic Community was a major positive event. The development of relations between these two organizations on a mutually advantageous basis will significantly promote peaceful coexistence in Europe and throughout the world. Bulgaria will make its contribution towards developing that co-operation for the security and prosperity of all peoples. The common interests of all States and peoples are clearly reflected in the problem of the protection of the environment. Economic activity carried out without due attention being paid to ecological factors is destroying nature, just as the arms race and military conflicts destroy nature. The world is being suffocated by chemicals, the soil is deteriorating, the climate is changing and the flora and fauna are disappearing. A collective effort by all countries and peoples is required. The effective guaranteeing of international ecological security should become a primary goal in the work of the United Nations, which has already done much to protect the environment. A concrete contribution in this respect has been made by the report of the Brundtland Commission. The ideas it contains are of fundamental Importance In protecting nature and man's environment.\nIn keeping with its position of principle, Bulgaria supports the working out of broad measures to conserve nature at both regional and subregional levels. We have proposed the conclusion of a treaty for the ecological protection of the Balkan peninsula. We have also suggested the holding in Sofia of an ecological forum within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Active work is going on in Bulgaria on a broad set of practical measures in this area.\nThe current Issues of peace, security and co-operation are characteristically intertwined in Europe. On the Old Continent, truly non-traditional and Innovative views are struggling against the canons of out-dated thinking. Those who favour the division of Europe into blocs are unrelenting. But at the same time the noble idea of a common European home is emerging, a concept reflecting the historic, cultural, political and economic community of the countries of Europe, the United States and Canada. The dogmas of the past are being slowly overcome. The Vienna meeting of the States of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will soon be concluded. We hope that it will provide new dynamism to the process of equal and mutually advantageous dialogue in Europe.\nThe problems in international affairs and their interrelationship are being discussed at a number of international forums. This is a new and hitherto untried methodology, but it is in keeping with the spirit of our times. These discussions are focusing increasingly on social and humanitarian problems.\nForty years ago the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That was the first step towards the establishment of today's solid legal basis for international co-operation on social and humanitarian problems. At present practically no State is outside the world consensus in this area. That is quite natural, since the human person is a universal value, the centre of evolution and the focal point of attention in domestic and foreign policies. The creation of favourable conditions for a free, dignified and creative life for the individual is not State charity but the State's main obligation, so as to ensure that society and civilization in general will flourish. Bulgaria welcomes the expanding role of the United Nations in the social and humanitarian spheres. We will work for the democratization of international relations and the establishment of moral guarantees of peace and security.\nAn eminent public figure and humanist, Aurelio Pecci, said that the current stage of evolution requires that people stop merely looking into the future and start building that future. For the sake of objectivity it must be noted that we are just at the beginning of this great demilitarisation and humanisation of international affairs. We realize that a lot remains to be changed in ourselves, too, in order to move towards an irreversibly non-violent world, to build a new global international order under which every country, every people and every person can feel confident about the future. There is no possible alternative.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThere is a universal consensus today as to the far-reaching changes that are taking place in the world, changes that carry with them great hopes for a better future. This explains what is most special about this session of the General Assembly which, more them drawing up a diagnosis of the present international situation, should gear Its work to optimising and rendering irreversible the positive developments that now characterize the state of international relations. The progress made in the field of disarmament, in the process of the normalising of relations between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and towards the peaceful settlement of the various conflicts in different parts of the world do seem to indicate that mankind is turning a new corner in an optimistic spirit. The Secretary-General of the Organization# Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar# expresses this situation in his report very ably and clearly# interpreting the feelings of the international community with the insight and political vision he has always shown in the exercise of his lofty duties. This is an opportunity for us to encourage him and to assure him of our steadfast support and appreciation.\nThe changes under way are not the result of chance. It would be illusory to believe that the process we are witnessing is simply the result of isolated phenomena or intrinsic mechanisms.\nThe rejection of the deterministic view by the community of nations is evident in the constant efforts of our universal Organization not only to preserve the world from destruction and the various ills that beset it politically, economically and socially, but also to build the foundations of the future. Our common future depends on the individual and collective attitudes we assume today, the maturity and good sense we bring to our actions, the conscience and interaction of our activities and the complementarily of our interests.\nThe progress made over the last two years on the way to detente and in the settlement of regional conflicts in particular are encouraging indications that awareness of this is beginning to emerge. The time is ripe, then# for action to give a new direction to international relations. Will we be able to rise to this historic occasion?\nIt is urgent that substantial steps be taken especially in the field of disarmament in line with the historic Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - between the United States and the Soviet Union. We feel, moreover, that the negotiations under way should soon produce tangible results leading to the elimination and complete prohibition of chemical weapons and the reduction of conventional weapons at the lowest possible level.\nNever since the end of the Second World War has mankind accumulated so much goodwill and success along the way to peace, mutual understanding and the creation of conditions favourable to peace and to more human international relations.\nIn the present trends and the prospects they are opening up we see the expression of a humanism justified and stimulated by growing world interdependence and mutual contacts between peoples, cultures and development processes. But there can be no real prosperity so long as it remains the privilege of a few, so long as it is confined to certain areas of the planet and factors of progress and backwardness, stability and confrontation, continue to exist side by side.\nThe debt crisis, the fall in exports, the stagnation and decline in the growth rate of developing countries, the continuous deterioration in the terms of trade and the decline in real terms of Official Development Assistance are some of the principal features of the present international economic order that stand in sharp contradiction to the growing interdependence of nations.\nAgainst that background, the economic situation of Africa is especially affected by the repercussions of the world economic crisis which are aggravated by the devastating effects of prolonged drought and other natural disasters. The correction of imbalances and the reversing of trends in the present international economic situation requires the introduction of vigorous structural reforms throughout the system, especially as regards its monetary and financial aspects, if we wish to prevent the development of some States taking place at the expense of others.\nThe struggle to introduce a new international economic order is thus as relevant and urgent as ever. In recent years there have been many initiatives to eliminate imbalances and their harmful effects on the developing countries, which indicates the dawning awareness of the need to identify the causes of these ills and to unite in our efforts to eradicate them.\nThe adoption at the twelfth special session of the General Assembly of the Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990, in the mid-term review of which we are now engaged, the platform adopted for settlement of the urgent problem of debt, and the results of the International Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development illustrate the growing concern of the international community with regard to development problems.\nWe must, however, recognize that practical and comprehensive initiatives to give substance to our will to build a new world economic system based on justice and equity are still lacking. \nThe failure to meet the target foe official development assistance set in the United Nations International Development Strategy is a clear illustration of this fact and indicates the need to consider carefully the objectives and priorities with respect to international co-operation.\nAt the beginning of my statement 1 referred to the universal consensus that is emerging with regard to the changes now occurring in international relations. The broad prospects opened up through the peaceful settlement of disputes and the elimination of tensions in regions such as southern Africa, South-East Asia and Central America give us hope that these indications are not just temporary ones. In Afghanistan, in Kampuchea, in Central America, Chad, Western Sahara, Cyprus and the Gulf, we are seeing signs of hope that prove that peace is possible when there is a real will to make use of dialogue and co-operation in settling problems between States. We hope that the political realism shown by the different parties involved in these matters will become ever stranger and permit the definitive removal of the obstacles that continue to prevent a return to peace, stability and understanding in these regions.\nNevertheless, we cannot fail to be concerned over the lack of progress in the search for a peaceful and lasting solution to the questions of the Middle East, the Korean peninsula and East Timor in particular.\nOf all the conflicts that have shaken the world over the last four decades, the conflict that persists in the Middle East is certainly one of the most complex and dangerous for world stability.\nTo be just and lasting, any settlement of the Middle East situation must take into account the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to their own State, as well as the right of all States of the region to have their national independence and territorial integrity respected and to live securely within internationally recognized boundaries. In the case of East Timor we encourage the Secretary-General to continue his good offices with a view to the full affirmation of the inalienable rights of the people of East Timor to self-determination and independence.\nIn southern Africa the negotiations under way have contributed to a change in the political climate and have brought progress in efforts to create conditions conducive to a global solution of the conflict in the region. We welcome this development but we must continue to express our concern over the persistence of apartheid in South Africa.\nThe visit I have just made to the People's Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique enabled me to observe the commitment to the constructive spirit and open-mindedness that characterize the position of those Governments in seeking a peaceful, just and lasting solution to the problems of southern Africa.\nIn this context and although we remain alert to the positive direction the talks en South-West Africa are taking and the prospects of peace which they open up, the international community must be firm in pursuing its endeavours with a view to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and to the elimination of the system of apartheid as a necessary step towards guaranteeing peace stability and democracy in that part of the African continent\nThe election of Mr. Dante Caputo to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session which is taking place at such an important juncture is due recognition of his great abilities and competence in carrying out these delicate tasks.\nWe are unanimous in recognizing the importance of this stage in human history. A new spirit of dialogue tolerance and agreement prevails in the world today and should be sustained. This cannot but contribute to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in resolving conflicts solving the problems of development and preserving international peace and security. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is a timely and well-deserved tribute to the courage and dedication of all of these men of good will.\nThis session should echo the new sensitivity and the new approach \u00a3hat prevail in facing the problems of our era, showing a spirit of willingness to engage in dialogue and our ability to recognise the true challenges that we face today in analysing and discussing the questions on our agenda. We feel sure that, together; we can take advantage of this historic occasion and usher in the new dawn that is now breaking, with confidence in our ability to join forces as we build a new reality ever closer to mankind's deepest aspirations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of my Government I wish to express to you, Sir, our appreciation and satisfaction at your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. We are sure that your talent and experience, as a politician and as a diplomat, will enable you to make a great contribution to the success of this session. Your election is a recognition of the importance of this factor and, at the same time, a well-deserved tribute to the country you represent. We therefore offer you our very best wishes for success in the difficult task entrusted to you.\nWe also wish to express our appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, for the exemplary and brilliant manner in which he presided over the forty-second session, thus, making a contribution to the strengthening of the United Nations.\nTo the Secretary-General, Hr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, we pay sincere tribute for everything he has done in the cause of peace and prosperity for all mankind, in spite of the political and economic obstacles and other drawbacks faced by the Organisation today. We are sure that, with help from all of us and support for the diplomatic and political commitment he has always demonstrated, there will be hope for a lessening of tension throughout the world and for the achievement of the  peace that now begins to shimmer in the distance and will ultimately bring great joy to you all. In the international situation there are signs of hope for lessened tension and for the peace so anxiously awaited by all mankind.\nThe Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF Treaty), now ratified, the progress made in the field of disarmament, in the framework of the talks between the United States and the Soviet Union and the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, the search for a negotiated settlement of the different conflicts that have been proliferating around the world - all of these are important landmarks on the way to achieving the fundamental goal of the United Nations, which needs to be pursued both in qualitative and in quantitative terms. We believe that those achievements are part of the solution to the problems that all mankind is facing today.\nThe radical changes we are witnessing today in the political situation in southern Africa are a consequence of a change in the balance of power, which now favours the peoples of the region engaged in a struggle against the hideous racist regime of South Africa. That is reflected in successive South African military defeats at the hands of the Angolan army and in the intensification of the liberation struggles of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa.\nAcknowledgement of those facts, plus the military defeat inflicted on the racist South African forces at Cuito Cuanavale, led the Pretoria Government to sit down at the negotiating table with the Governments of Angola and Cuba, with the mediation of the United States of America, to negotiate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the establishment of peace and security in our country.\nThe Governments of Angola and Cuba, which have demonstrated a true spirit of integrity and flexibility throughout the talks, brought to the negotiating table a set of principles set out in a negotiating platform presented in 1984 by Comrade President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos to the Secretary-General. As that platform is well known to all, I shall not dwell on it here.\nThe Government of the People's Republic of Angola has never accepted and will never accept the fictitious link some have sought to establish between the presence of Cuban internationalist troops in our territory and the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978),on the independence of Namibia. It is a prerequisite for the achievement of a just, lasting and honourable peace in southern Africa  that the goals set in the negotiating platform be attained.\nAttempts to establish a parallel between the withdrawal of Cuban internationalist troops and the independence of Namibia prove the arrogance and bad faith of a regime that is defying the entire international community, that continues to trample on the most fundamental rights of its own people by imposing the inhuman apartheid system, which is blocking the right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence, and that pursues a systematic policy of aggression and destabilisation against the front-line States.\nI am obliged to reiterate that Cuban internationalist troops are in Angola at the invitation of the Angolan Government, in keeping with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, while South African troops occupy the Territory of Namibia illegally, in violation of the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nThe Governments of Angola and Cuba, wishing to help resolve the problems of south-western Africa, also brought to the negotiating table a specific timetable for the withdrawal of Cuban internationalist troops from Angola, with a view to facilitating the implementation of Security Council 435 (1978), on the independence of Namibia. But it must be made perfectly clear that this gesture in no way implies de jure or de facto acceptance of the policy of \\\"linkage\\\". It should be understood, rather, as one more contribution by our Governments towards the achievement of peace in Angola and of independence for Namibia.\nAngola's firm commitment in this regard and our efforts to initiate a peace process are well known.\nSeveral meetings held in Luanda and Cape Verde were followed by a series of peace talks in London, Cairo, Now York, Geneva and Brazzaville. A protocol was signed in Geneva regulating the withdrawal of South African troops from Angolan territory as provided for in Security Council resolution 602 (1967); there was also agreement on the cessation of hostilities along Angola's southern border, and the installation of border control posts jointly monitored by Angola, Cuba and South Africa. That, along with the designation of 1 November as the date for initiating implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the presence of a United Nations technical tea, in Namibia/ are the clear results of the quadripartite talks. This shows how important and necessary it is for us to proceed with dialogue in order ensure peace and security in southern Africa. As President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos pointed out in a recent statement at the Franceville summit\n\\\"Our intention is to make the peace process in southern Africa irreversible, and we shall do everything in our power to make that happen.\\\"\nShould South Africa and its allies persist in their obstinate policy of hindering the peace process by making demands which by their very nature constitute crude interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola - demands that we can never accept - history will in due course be the judge of their actions.\nThe Angolan Government has repeatedly declared that/ under its policy of clemency and national harmonisation/ all Angolans are entitled to free themselves from the domination of foreign interests and to integrate themselves into the society we are in the process of building. That policy, recently reiterated by the President of the People's Republic of Angola, aims at the implementation of a peace process inside Angola, a process that draws on the history and experience of other African countries which have experienced similar situations. Assurances regarding the implementation of such a process after the Brazzaville quadripartite talks were given by the highest Angolan authorities at the Franceville summit on 5 October.\nThe People's Republic of Angola considers that there has been much progress in the quadripartite talks. But this does not mean we can decrease our vigilance; we must rather increase our solidarity with and our unwavering support for all peoples of the southern African region and all liberation movements struggling against colonialism and apartheid. \nIt is important to stress that the important consultations held at New York between Angola, Cuba and South Africa, with the mediation of the United States, were essentially exploratory in nature. Contrary to reports in the international media, their purpose was to prepare for the signing of a subsequent formal agreement. There is still a long way to go. At stake are the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola.\nI must mention here the efforts of the People's Republic of the Congo, and particularly of President Denis Sassou Nguesso, towards success in the quadripartite talks.\nMy Government will never shirk its duty to extend all necessary support to the fraternal people of Namibia in its just struggle for independence, under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative, the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO).\nTogether with a21 other peace-loving peoples, the Angolan people continue to extend all possible support to the heroic people of South Africa, which, under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other patriotic forces, is struggling against the inhuman apartheid system. We take this opportunity to call upon Pretoria's allies to cease forthwith all co-operation with the inhuman regime and to impose the comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa for which the international community at large has been calling for so long.\nThe development in the Maghreb region give us some reason to hope that, should all parties co-operate fully with the Secretary-General and with the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), a just, lasting and politically acceptable settlement of the conflict will be found on the basis of OAU resolution 104 and relevant General Assembly resolutions. We reaffirm our total support for the Sahraoui people and for the POLISARIO Front, and we call upon the parties to the conflict to do all they can to pursue the path of dialogue. \nWe welcome the agreement signed by Ethiopia and Somalia and regard them as a positive step towards improving relations between those two countries, whose common wish is to live in a climate of peace in order to be able to overcome their underdevelopment and raise the living standards of their respective peoples. We hope that the dialogue that has now been initiated between Ethiopia and Sudan - two countries whose peoples are linked by economic, historical and geographical ties - will lead to the establishment of a climate of confidence and good-neighbourliness.\nAs Africans, we have justified pride in welcoming the initiation of dialogue between Libya and Chad, two African countries that, under the aegis of the Organisation of African Unity, have been able to prove that it is possible to substitute dialogue for the force of arms in the settlement of regional conflicts.\nWe once again feel obliged to associate ourselves with all those who have demanded that the Zionist regime of Israel withdraw unconditionally from all Palestinian and other Arab territories which it is illegally occupying and where it is engaging in the most inhuman atrocities against the Arab peoples. We associate ourselves also with the international demand for the convening as soon as possible of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the sole end legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).\nA major development to which special reference must be made - because of its importance for peace in the Persian Gulf - is, without any doubt, the cease-fire and the resulting talks now taking place between Iran and Iraq, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, with a view to bringing peace to those two countries that have been fighting each other for eight years now. We call upon these two fraternal countries to pursue the path of dialogue and refrain from any act that may hinder the process now under way. \nWe welcome the signing of the Geneva agreement\u00b7 between Pakistan and Afghanistan and hope that this will help to establish a climate of peace and security in the region.\nWith respect to the Kampuchean question, we believe it imperative to seek a political settlement that can contribute to the establishment of peace and stability in South-West Asia. We appreciate the promising results of the meeting held in July this year in Jakarta, Indonesia, at which the parties to this regional conflict showed optimism about the possibility of settling it. In this connection, we hail the positive attitude of the Vietnamese Government, which, in keeping with the goal of contributing to the establishment of peace in the region, has decided to withdraw before the end of this year a part of its Military contingent stationed in Kampuchea.\nWe are also continuing to pay special attention to the situation in the Korean peninsula and to the Korean people's efforts to bring about an independent, reunified nation. We once again express our total support for the proposals made by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea that the Korean people be enabled to decide their future without interference or foreign intervention.\nTo the East Timor people fighting against foreign occupation and for self-determination and independence, under the leadership of their revolutionary FRETILIN, we once again affirm our unwavering support. Furthermore, we take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the stance that the Portuguese Government has been taking in its capacity as the legal administering Power of the Territory of East Timor. In this connection, we call on that Government as well as on the Secretary-General to continue their efforts to find a just and permanent settlement of the question, in the framework of General Assembly resolution 37/30. \nCentral America remains one of the regions of the earth most affected by instability. There, the policies of intervention, aggression, blackmail and interference in the internal affairs of the States concerned represent a threat to their sovereignty and development and to international peace and security. The People's Republic of Angola believes that this line of conduct is incompatible with a wish to see fewer regional conflicts and to achieve a political settlement of the differences. We therefore cannot agree that these confrontations should be viewed as ideological or as an East-West conflict.\nNicaragua and Panama are clear examples of that situation. They are currently the victims of coercive political and economic measures. We wish to reaffirm the importance and validity of the Esquipulas II peace plan and also the need for compliance by all parties with the Panama Canal Treaty.\nWe also express again our unwavering support for the Government and fraternal people of Cuba and their legitimate claim to regain the illegally occupied Guantanamo Naval Base from the United States and to be compensated for the material damage resulting from the occupation.\nWe unequivocally support General Assembly resolutions 41/11 of 27 October 1986 and 42/16 of 10 November 1987, which declare the southern Atlantic a zone of peace and co-operation. We call on the States of the region to contribute to that end by Adopting measures designed to achieve the objectives of the Declaration.\nWe are all in favour of d\u00e9tente, dialogue and co-operation between States, regardless of their political or ideological differences or their stages of development. We believe also that the acme race, particularly when it involves nuclear weapons, makes the establishment of a programme for general and complete disarmament urgent. The resources used by the armaments industry could be channelled to the developing countries that are the victims of the constantly deteriorating world economic situation. \nWe are sow approaching the end of yet another decade in which there has been a series of political convulsion in almost every region of the world. That is a source of great concern to the international community as a whole. During this period, some countries have been able to take important steps forward in seeking solutions to the various economic problems they face. However, despite their efforts, the majority of these countries have not succeeded in achieving anything more than a palliative that has not met their expectation for the settlement of certain problems that could really have been solved, to a large extent, with the political will and help of other countries.\nAs I have just said, we are approaching the end of another decade. At the beginning of this decade we had hoped for better results for mankind as a whole. It is therefore distressing to note that, despite the efforts made, the world economic situation is constantly deteriorating. The current crisis in the world economic system, which is obsolete and unjust, claims its principal victims in the developing countries. It is against that background, therefore, that we believe it to be important, indeed urgent, to establish a new international economic order that is real, fair, equitable and capable of responding to the growing concerns of more than two thirds of the human race.\nAt the beginning of this decade the United Nations adopted resolution 35/56 establishing a strategy by means of which the developing countries could achieve a growth rate of 7 per cent within the framework of the International Development Strategy. To that end, it was agreed also that the developed countries should contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for the benefit of the developing countries in general, and 1 per cent for the benefit of the least developed countries. Today, eight years have passed and we are still facing a manifest lack of political will on the part of cone developed countries to apply  the principles agreed upon. The consequences of this have been the stagnation in, and the reduction in the growth rates of, the majority of the developing countries.\nWe believe that the existing gap between our two groups of countries is constantly increasing rather than narrowing, despite the measures taken each year by the majority of those countries to bring about economic recovery. In that connection, we reaffirm our complete support for the recent decisions taken and the positions held by the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement. We are sure that they constitute the basis for future negotiations between the North and the South, taking into account the need for the revitalised, closer and fairer co-operation between the two groups of countries that which we believe is imperative.\nWe wish to focus for a moment on some questions that are of the greatest concern to us and that, in our opinion, are among the major impediments to the development of our countries. First, I wish to say that the international monetary and financial system will not be able to operate smoothly unless ell countries share the responsibility for the settlement of the problems relating to the malfunctioning of that system's institutions and mechanisms. Otherwise we shall continue to witness en uncontrolled flow of our resources to the developed countries. These resources could be utilised for the economic development of the countries of the South.  \nThere is therefore an urgent need for the restructuring of the present international monetary and financial system so as to render it more viable and capable of securing wider and more just world co-operation. Today a problem of undeniable importance is the inordinate level of the debt of the developing countries, which reached the astronomical figure of $1,200 billion in 1987. We therefore deem it appropriate to appeal to the multilateral financial institutions and the creditor countries to review, together with us, the impracticability of the mechanisms of the international monetary system now in force. \nWe reaffirm once again the need for an international meeting to be held as soon as possible on the debt of the developing countries, to enable debtors and creditors together to work out a solution to this thorny issue. For the low-growth countries of the African continent, the debt situation has become critical. The continued drop in prices of commodities, the main exports of the African countries, is an insurmountable obstacle to both their participation in the world economy and the effective implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, which are essential pre-conditions for real recovery in their economies. We accordingly endorse the position of African Heads of State at the OAU summit meeting in December 1987 on the convening of an international conference on external debt in Africa. The economic crisis has seriously affected the developing countries capacity to take a more active part in international trade. The economies of those countries are concentrated on the export of one or a few commodities or manufactures, and at the same time those products suffer from instability in developed countries and are the victim of protectionist measures on the part of the market-economy countries - measures that are in flagrant violation of the rules and principles of international trade and incompatible with the commitments undertaken by those countries in various international bodies. We must therefore continue to concentrate our efforts on achieving real adjustment in the structure of international trade and implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The People's Republic of Angola is convinced that the international community can create the condition necessary for this to be close. \nThe interdependence of States, of which we are totally aware, should lead us to a greater sensitivity concerning the food crisis. We note with deep regret the deterioration in the food and agriculture situation in many developing countries, especially African countries, which are experiencing a serious food deficit. The international community should support more strongly the International Fund for Agricultural Development in order to enable it to embark upon its second decade on a better and more solid financial footing. \nThe People's Republic of Angola, a developing country which has never experienced a single day of peace since it achieved independence in November 1975, is an integral part of the international community and cannot remain silent with regard to the world in general or the problems of the underdeveloped countries in particular. Its contribution to minimising the countless economic and social problems affecting mankind is still very weak. \nWe have been making efforts, together with others, to achieve the just peace so badly needed by the heroic Angolan people to solve the economic problems we continue to experience.' In this connection my Government has taken certain measures within the framework of the Economic and Financial Recovery Programme and has been enacting legislation that will make its implementation possible. \nI wish to take this opportunity to appeal to the international community to increase its support and programmes of assistance for the People's Republic of Angola with a view to helping repair the damage caused by the war of aggression and destabilisation waged by South Africa. This damage, in material terms - equipment, highways, bridges, roads, railroads and so forth - amounts to more than $12 billion, cost the lives of more than 50,000 people, caused the displacement of 200,000 families and created close to 150,000 refugees.\nIn conclusion, Mr. President, allow me to reiterate our sincere wishes for your complete success in conducting the proceedings of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and to assure you of the fullest co-operation of the Angolan delegation whenever necessary and at all times.\nThe struggle continues. Victory is certain.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, on behalf of the Italian Government I should like to congratulate you most warmly on your election. We are pleased that this honour should have been conferred on the representative of a country to which we ate bound by long-standing ties of friendship, personified by the presence of a large Italian community in Argentina. Your abilities and your experience will guarantee the successful fulfilment of this mandate, a mandate that has been rendered particularly delicate by developments in international affairs which offer hopes that cannot be allowed to die.\nMay I also be allowed to express my appreciation to the outgoing President who, in performing the task entrusted to him by the General Assembly last year, met the challenges posed to our Organization during that period with dedication and skill.\nLastly, the Secretary-General has the gratitude of the Italian Government and my personal appreciation. As a worthy heir to the Latin American juridical tradition, he has succeeded in handling with extraordinary political vision, commitment and negotiating skills situations from which others would have emerged the loser. In the efforts he has generously devoted to the pursuit of peace and security, in his quest for negotiated solutions, and in his firm defence of the principles of the Chatter, the Secretary-General has had, and continues to have, the unconditional support of the Italian Government.\nThe winds of history seem, today, to be blowing in the right direction. This is confirmed by the trust and sincerity of the ongoing dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the incisive role assumed by the United Nations in regional crises and conflicts. Italy is contributing to these developments the whole-hearted co-operation of a country fully aware of its international responsibilities. \nIn view of the advances made by the two major Powers in the field of disarmament, we must recognize that many things have changed over the past 12 months. Positive changes have opened up new prospects for stability, particularly in Europe. The Italian Government, acting individually and in the framework of the Atlantic Alliance and the European Community, has made its own contribution to promoting these prospects.\nThe conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles has particular significance. Above all, it suggests a new way of dealing with disarmament problems because, for the first time in the history of mankind, massive quantities of weapons are being destroyed, not through wartime military operations but, on the contrary,, as a consequence of negotiations. And here I should like to emphasize that this Treaty, together with the detailed verification procedures it provides for, should serve as a model to be followed and, accordingly, extended to other agreements as soon as possible.\nWe all cherish the well-founded hope that the agreement on a 50-per-cent cut in the strategic arsenals of the two major Powers will also be formally concluded at an early date. We would call attention both to President Reagan's consistent commitment to promoting the dialogue at the highest level with the Soviet Union and to the dynamic and courageous approach taken by General Secretary Gorbachev, also in his international policies.\nIt is chiefly in the area of disarmament that the community of nations must play a role if bilateral agreements are to be gradually extended to cover all types of weapons existing on Earth.\nToday, in the light of the results achieved, our objective must be to eliminate the risks of a sudden change of course. This is an endeavour incumbent on all nations, and should be self-evident in the case &1 an Organization that believes in the strength of its universality and the need to take the utmost advantage of all possibilities afforded by a more serene international climate.\nUnfortunately, the agreements between the two major Powers have not yet been matched by any appreciable results in the various multilateral forums.\nThe proceedings of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament did not produce any specific conclusion. Of course, we do not underestimate the contribution that emerged from these joint deliberations towards more effective mechanisms for the transparency of military budgets, towards a deeper analysis of the principles governing verification of arms control agreements, and particularly towards increased effectiveness for United Nations initiatives in activities directly or indirectly linked to disarmament.\nThese deliberative contributions are by no means minor. But our task does not consist solely in stating and illustrating positions; it requires us to work coherently for the realization of the good intentions and the equally receptive attitudes that exist.\nAt the conference table in Geneva no progress has been recorded for some time in almost any of the areas under discussion, from the cessation of all nuclear-test explosions to the prevention of an arms race in outer space, or from the banning of radiological weapons to the comprehensive programme of disarmament.\nOnly in the field of chemical weapons are negotiations moving ahead, but even these are moving too slowly. At one time we had hoped they might be completed this year. In fact that was the hope that, together with Foreign Minister Genscher, I personally expressed in Geneva last February. That has not happened, although the use of this terrible instrument of mass destruction is again of current concern to Governments and public opinion.\nWe do not, of course, underestimate the technical difficulties of applying adequate verification procedures in this field. For that very reason we sponsored an international symposium last May in Rome, attended by eminent scientists. Information and conclusions emerged regarding the possibility of conducting experiments to verify that there are no diversions for military purposes in industrial production processes. We shall bring the results of the proceedings to the attention of Governments.\nRegionally, the imbalances in conventional weapons existing in Europe are another dangerous source of insecurity. We must therefore make every effort to secure prompt results that will permit the achievement of greater stability at lower levels of forces and armaments. Here, in the context of the informal Vienna talks on the elaboration of a mandate for future negotiations, there are signs of a significant convergence of views on questions of substance.\nWe intend to continue to work, in every possible way, towards the speediest possible completion of a satisfactory final document.\nI should like at this point to reaffirm the validity of the Helsinki Final Act, an irreplaceable instrument in international relations which has indissolubly linked the United States and Canada to the future of the countries and peoples of the Old World. \nIn this context let me express the hope that Albania will also play a part in the overall European framework. I would interpret as a positive step in this direction the very recent Albanian decision to resume active participation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which will be celebrating its centenary next year.\nIn a final reference to the topic of disarmament in Europe, I would mention that Italy, as part of a drastic reduction in armaments, is giving priority to the elimination of asymmetries in the most destabilizing offensive-weapon categories. This elimination should be followed by a restructuring of military deployments in a defensive posture.\nIt will be recalled that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons itself provides that all the signatories, including the nuclear-weapon Powers, should pursue negotiations for the conclusion, as expressly stipulated in article VI, of \\\"a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control\\\". (resolution 2373 (XXII), annex)\nThe representative of the country currently holding the presidency of the Council of the European Communities has already stated the common position of the member states on the various more delicate aspects of international activities. The statement made by my colleague from Greece has testified to the work done by the Twelve towards harmonizing their respective foreign policies, a harmonization we Italians hope will become increasingly visible and extensive. We are indeed convinced that we must build a more united and mutually supportive Europe capable of progressively asserting, primarily on the basis of the Single European Act, an identity of its own and its own role in shaping a free world responsive to the demands of the various peoples. This identity and this role fully accord with the aims attributed by the Charter of the United Nations to regional arrangements. The United Nations has recently achieved encouraging results in endeavours to resolve some of the most acute and difficult international crises of the past decade. The advances made constitute real successes for the Organization and its Secretary-General, to whose perseverance and skill as a negotiator they ate largely due.\nI refer, first of all, to the good offices which led to the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan.\nIn the case of Iran and Iraq, a cease-fire was achieved and a direct negotiating process between the parties has finally been launched. We fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to consolidate, through implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), the results obtained thus far.\nIn the Security Council and at the bilateral level,, we shall continue to work for the restoration, between the two countries concerned and in the Gulf, of the conditions of security and stability which are the prerequisite for peace and are indispensable for the commencement of reconstruction.\nOn the question of Cyprus and in the dispute over Western Sahara, the patient quest for points of contact also seems to hold out prospects of change.\nWe are thus at a point in history when the United Nations is offered increasing opportunities, either directly \u2014 as in the cases I have just mentioned \u2014 or indirectly, to consolidate and bring to fruition the agreements reached at the regional level. This is happening in the case of southern Africa, where in Angola and in Namibia the United Nations may be called upon to facilitate and guarantee the withdrawal of foreign troops, the restoration of domestic peace and the completion of one of the last great decolonization processes in history. \nThe role of our Organization is undoubtedly becoming more incisive. We have seen the increasingly favourable reception accorded to offers of mediation by United Nations bodies and the new opportunities for action that are constantly opening up.\nThe new possibilities and the prospects I have mentioned are, without doubt, due to the changed climate in relations between the two major Powers and the overall improvement in international relations wrought by that change.\nFor the first time since 1945 - that is, since the approval of the Charter at San Francisco - the United Nations now finds itself operating within an international context not unlike the one envisioned by the founding countries, a context in which international collaboration, a tendency to engage in dialogue, the negotiated solution of problems, in short multilateralism and the rule of law, should take precedence over arbitrary approaches and the use of force.\nThe present convergence of positive elements could enable the United Nations to make greater use of all the instruments available under its Charter. Here we have a great opportunity, but also a great question mark. Once the differences between East and West have been reduced and, we hope, eliminated, it remains to be seen whether those uninvolved in that tension, and those who were loud in their denunciation of the inherent threats to international progress and stability, will also shoulder their responsibilities. There must be a broadening of narrow regional outlooks, less rhetoric and a greater focus on action, a feeling of participation in a common design. There is a need for a spirit of dialogue, which we must all patiently seek to make more effective.\nThe successes I have mentioned would not have been possible without the mediation efforts, I say again of the Secretary-General and his associates, with the contribution of the Security Council - an important context for its function and the problems confronting it, but a limited one, and, I would say, certainly inadequate in the light of the great potential of our Organization.\nThe time has come to test the potential of all the organs of the United Nations, including the General Assembly. We must overcome the conflicts between groups, which have been a frequent feature of the past few years. This is a necessary development if the system is to pursue the role assigned to it by the Charter, keep pace with developments in international relations, and thus preserve its credibility. One thing is certain. If the dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union is pursued in depth and results in a strengthening of the cause of peace and the necessary conditions for security, there will no longer be any excuse for those countries or groups of countries that have thus far, more or less deliberately, tried to shirk their historical responsibilities.\nSpecial attention should be given to unresolved conflicts.\nThe Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, which began last December, clearly reflects the distress of a population compelled for decades, and without any political prospects, to live in a state of occupation. The disagreements between Arabs and Israelis and the Palestinian problem are back in the limelight, serving as a dramatic and, indeed, a daily reminder to the international community of the existence in a sensitive area of an open wound that requires healing.\nWe are all aware of the complexity of the problem confronting us. Everyone, including the parties involved, is looking for a way out of the situation, and it is also generally recognized that repressive measures against a movement that is widespread and spontaneous are of no avail. Israel is a member of this Assembly, as it is entitled to be. This must be fully recognized, and so must the corresponding right to security, without offensive charges of racism. Similarly, Palestinians and Israelis, particularly those of the younger generation, must be helped out of the vicious circle of hatred and confrontation and encouraged to enter into dialogue and co-operation that can open up new prospects for development throughout the Middle East.\nThere is a growing conviction, shared by a very broad section of the community of nations, that an international peace conference, subject to rules and procedures that are imaginative and innovative, could help overcome the problems and obstacles in the way of a global, just and lasting solution to the conflict. \nWe welcomed the acceptance in principle by the United States of the idea of an international peace conference and we appreciate the aims underlying the personal and generous commitment demonstrated by Secretary of State Shultz in presenting his peace plan.\nI am convinced that solution of the problem confronting us - which, in essence, concerns the possibility for all the countries of the area, including Israel, to live within secure and recognized borders, and the right of the Palestinians to a homeland - is not always facilitated by those who take up purely declaratory positions which remain without effect. I believe that a serious, positive effort must be made by all of us to reduce existing differences.\nIn the Middle East context we also view developments in Lebanon with concern, for its institutional difficulties are all the more alarming in that they could jeopardize not only the coexistence of Christians and Muslims, but the very unity of the State.\nIn Central America, after encouraging progress in the dialogue following the Esquipulas agreements, we note with concern disturbing symptoms of intransigence that will make it harder to achieve the general reconciliation we hoped for and, hence, that \\\"happy peace for all\\\" to which the Presidents of the Central American countries referred last year when agreeing, inter alia, on the promising idea of a common Central American parliament.\nItaly is an active participant in the political dialogue instituted between the States of the region and the countries of the European Community. The latter countries are continually and actively following the regional peace efforts and hope that all parties will show that genuine political will necessary to give those efforts a constructive thrust and renewed momentum. \nThe Horn of Africa region also deserves the attention of the Assembly because of the tensions still existing there. These tensions, and some major natural disasters, have unfortunately made living conditions unacceptable for hundreds of thousands of human beings. Realism and a genuine spirit of conciliation are the components needed to consolidate promising agreements and translate into reality the political solutions that would restore peace to that area, as an essential prerequisite for its social and economic progress. For years Italy has been giving the highest priority to its co-operation in the development of this region. We are prepared to strengthen this co-operation further if conditions permit. In this context, Italy is devoting special attention to the situation in Eritrea, where its co-operation and humanitarian assistance efforts are encountering particular obstacles, which are having a negative impact on the normal development of those efforts.\nAnother crisis, that in Kampuchea, shows signs of positive developments, provided that the parties are able to maintain the commitments already undertaken and the conditions are achieved for the formation of the broadest possible domestic coalition.\nThe history of our planet is becoming increasingly a closely shared experience in which peoples, nations and different economic and social systems are participating. This is not, at this juncture, an empty statement. On the contrary, it has a particular meaning for a world that has become more aware of the dangers of collective destruction caused by misguided developments in science and technology and is consequently intent, above all, on rediscovering the values of solidarity and justice. The deliberations of the forty-third session of the General Assembly cannot fail to take account of the new climate of increasing openness to mutual understanding and of willingness to search more actively for common ground.\nItaly has always been a supporter of the role of the United Nations in the pursuit of international peace and security. Our very presence in the Security Council reflects those concerns and proceeds from the assumption that the role of the Secretary-General should be enhanced and that parties to a dispute should be constantly persuaded to take a peaceful view of their own interests.\nThe successes the United Nations is scoring today confirm the validity of multilateralism and show that we must all have faith in a system of agreements that promotes the rule of law and increasingly restricts recourse to violent means.\nIn this connection we affirm our belief in the principle of universality as a fundamental principle that must be reinforced and extended, where the proper conditions exist, by consistent conduct on the part of United Nations bodies and Member States. We hope, in this context, that contacts between the two Koreas will be resumed and yield positive results, so that the principle of universality may also become a reality for them.\nWe must also ensure that the United Nations is in a position to over time its present budgetary crisis and that there is a sound financial basis for its peace-keeping operations, which we all wish to see extended and consolidated, so as to infuse new life into the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nOur Organization cannot confine itself to reacting to events. It must take preventive action and look ahead if it is to understand and satisfy the far-reaching demands of our peoples and redress the glaring imbalances which are still poisoning relations between nations. We must, in other words, take full advantage of the opportunities available for bringing about a world order guaranteed by the rule of law and considerations of justice.\nThe path is now strewn with obstacles, difficulties and burdensome restrictions. The efforts of the entire international community are required to overcome them. Our peoples feel ever more acutely the need for an improved quality of life, a healthier and better protected environment and true freedom from the enemies of society and civilization, such as the heavy indebtedness of some countries, recurrent food crises, pollution of the atmosphere and the oceans, the effects of excessive urbanization and the production and use of drugs. In actual fact little has been done to combat these evils, I am thinking, in particular, of the terrible dimensions of the drug phenomenon, which is undermining the very foundations of our society and destroying our young people, who are our hope for the future.\nWe must attack drug production by carrying out adequate programmes to assist economic and social development and to substitute other crops for drugs in the producing countries. We must attack trafficking by means of increased co-operation between judicial and police authorities and by introducing, through international agreements, financial controls that will make it possible to freeze and confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers. Lastly, and perhaps above all, we must strike a blow at illicit drug use by putting into effect all appropriate preventive measures, educating and sensitising public opinion, harnessing for this purpose the power of the major communications media, using appropriate school and leisure facilities and instituting programmes for the treatment, recovery and rehabilitation of drug addicts.\nInternational co-operation to combat drug use is particularly necessary now that it is affecting all States, albeit to a different extent, so that no country can really consider itself immune. It is a terrible evil which we all share, from East to West, North to South, and we all have a duty to take forceful determined action to combat it.\nThe economic, social, health and environmental effects of urbanization also need careful consideration. It has been estimated that, after the year 2000, some 50 per cent of the world's population will be living in megalopolises, and that this phenomenon will affect the emerging countries particularly.\nWhile it is easy to imagine the kind of effects produced by the concentration of populations in cities, it seems more difficult at the present level of our knowledge to identify suitable remedies to reduce - at least partially \u2013 the resulting anomalies. Perhaps, in this particular area too, help will come from co-operation between scientists, in a setting in which science is growing more open, rising above ideological barriers to become a vehicle of universal progress and not an instrument of competition.\nThere are certainly many opportunities, even in this area of the quality of life, for encouraging and developing international co-operation. The United Nations, precisely because of its universal character, cannot evade these new ' challenges and, indeed, should be ready to provide convincing and eloquent responses to them.\nI am not at present in a position to suggest the courses to be taken.\nPerhaps, and particularly with a view to preparing for or, if possible, preventing major natural disasters - I have in mind disasters of the Sahel type - we might consider setting up a collective emergency force to be placed at the disposal of the Secretary-General. The establishment of such a force would complement certain activities which, to some extent, are already being carried out, and would confirm the universal role of the United Nations, viewed as a catalyst for human solidarity.\nIt would be over-ambitious of me to delineate the exact contours of our future, and predict the structure of our society at the planetary level.\nHowever, there is one element in the thinking of the authors of the San Francisco Charter that remains particularly valid - the idea that the United Nations and its machinery should be a profoundly innovative factor in relations between States. Besides, the mere fact of achieving harmony between peoples with such diverse cultures and systems through a process that precludes suspicion and mistrust in the interests of promoting co-operation, must inevitably result in something original and unique. \nNow is the time to embark on this venture, precisely because we must realize that the principles and purposes set forth in the Charter could not have been properly affirmed in an atmosphere, such as we have experienced in the past, characterized by serious tensions between the two major Powers. Is it possible, then, to attain these objectives in the framework of the process of revision taking place in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union? If we tried to give a definite affirmative answer to that question I think we would be venturing onto the unsafe ground of prophecy. We will merely note that there now exist favourable conditions for change and that the requirements linked to this change ace coming to light, even if they are not always perceived fully and with total clarity.\nMore than any other design, that of a more balanced order, an order that is informed, above all, with the principles of justice, appears the most likely eventuality as we approach the year 2000, if only because, as Plato said, every individual or State that is unjust contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction. And this is still valid for all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe delegation of Chad wishes to join previous speakers in expressing to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina our most sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. The delegation of Chad is doubly pleased that he was elected; because of his wide experience in international relations, and, in particular, because, as Minister for External Relations of his country, he has shown his competence and diplomatic skill. My delegation is also pleased at the excellent relations that exist, very fortunately, between his beautiful country and Chad. The confidence of the international community has been placed in his country and in biro personally and I have no doubt that the work of this session of the General Assembly will be conducted tactfully ably and affectively. We can be assured of the whole-hearted co-operation of my delegation in the fulfilment of his heavy responsibilities.\n1 should also like to extend the thanks of my delegation to his predecessor Mr. Peter Florin who showed a great spirit of compromise in guiding the work of the forty-second session.\nFinally, my delegation wishes to pay a special and well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Peires de Cuellar for his tireless efforts in the service of peace and for the promotion of development.\nOn 26 June 1945, when the founding fathers of the United Nations signed the United Nations Charter, their objectives, which were clearly defined in Article 1 were, in essence, peace and development.\nOn 25 May 1963, the Heads of State and Government of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) followed that example by enshrining the same principles in the Addis Ababa charter.\nThe combination of these peace ideals would normally have averted the disasters that our States have known, through irresponsible behaviour or because of the pursuit of immediate, selfish interests.\nDespite the fact that differences of view persist within the international community, in 1988 there has been a new development in international relations; a wind of peace can be felt here and there. If this trend continues, our world will experience a new era of the detente that had disappeared from the international scene in recent years. \nThe new approach in relations between Chad and Libya is part of this new era. Representatives will recall the years of suffering that the people of Chad have known, the verbal and military battles that have characterized the relationship between two countries which history and geography have condemned to live side by side, which age-old relations as neighbours and brothers have united, and which should have known only relations of good-neighbourliness and co-operation as enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the charter of the OAU. \nThe members are aware, Chad bas always shown a spirit of dialogue in trying to find solutions to the dispute between the two countries. This open attitude, which was disregarded for so long, finally met with a favourable response from our Libyan brothers in a statement by Colonel Qaddafi made in Tripoli on 25 May 1988.\nOn this new basis, in its resolution AHG/174 (XXIV), the OAU accordingly changed the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Chad-Libya dispute by assigning it, in paragraph 5, the following goals: the establishment of a climate of trust and a dynamism for dialogue through a rapprochement between the two parties to the dispute; normalization of relations between the two States, in particular in the political and diplomatic spheres and with regard to co-operation in all fields of common interest; the extension and consolidation of the cease-fire by appropriate means and measures.\nThis process began with the bilateral meetings held at Libreville under the auspices of His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, President of the Gabonese Republic and Chairman of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on the Chad-Libya dispute. Friendly Governments also provided quiet mediation, which finally led, on 3 October 1988, to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamarahiye.\nIn the joint communiqu\u00e9 issued in this regard, the two countries reaffirmed their firm intention to respect scrupulously the cease-fire of 11 September 1987 and to resolve peacefully their territorial dispute in keeping with the principles of the United Nations and the OAU Charters and in accordance with resolution AHG/17\u00ce (XXIV) adopted at the twenty-fourth OAU Summit, and to co-operate with the OAU Ad Hoc Committee in a spirit of responsibility and understanding.\nThe political will and the constant readiness of the Chadian Government, together with the persevering conciliatory efforts of friendly countries and of the OAU Ad Hoe Committee\u00b7\u00b7 on the dispute, have\u00b7 thus effectively and positively contributed to the\u00b7 establishment of this new climate of rapprochement and peace between two fraternal States.\nHence, on behalf of the Chadian Government and people my delegation would like from this rostrum to express our gratitude to these friendly countries for having spared no effort in bringing Chad and Libya to restore relations and to pay a special tribute to, and sincerely thank. President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo for the truly positive role he played in promoting the peace process. By their deeds they have all greatly assisted the Chadian people, which has always aspired to peace in order to devote itself fully to the struggle for development.\nWe hope that this step will be followed up and strengthened in order to achieve lasting peace. Lastly, I wish to reaffirm that Chad is willing to pursue this new dynamism in order to normalise relations between the two fraternal countries and to provide a just, lasting settlement to our dispute with Libya with regard to the Aouxou Strip, in keeping with the process entered into within the framework of OAU resolution AHQ/17M (XXIV). To that end, my Government reaffirms its sincere co-operation and total support with regard to the tireless and laudable efforts of the OAU Ad Hoe Committee to succeed in its noble mission.\nThe Chadian people profoundly aspires to peace in order the better to devote itself to fighting underdevelopment, which is a real battle for Chad owing to our unfavourable climate and the disastrous consequences of war. To the burden of war are added epidemics, desertification, drought, grasshopper and caterpillar infestations and floods. Those are the scourges from which my country has been suffering in recent years. With regard to the current agricultural season, there is very little chance that the harvest will be good, because the rains that came late were so heavy in August that several regions were flooded. Damages have been quite considerable; 68,816 people were affected, including 10,000 people in N'Djamena, our capital; 67 killed and score\u00b7 wounded; 3,416 cattle were reported Missing; more than 1S8 villages flooded; 20,539 homes destroyed; some 12,417 hectares of farmland completely flooded, something which will have adverse consequences on the harvest.\nThe crops that were spared in the flooding are threatened by locusts. In several areas of the country there is a risk of famine. Even before the rainy season, the torrid heat in March, April and May posed a meningitis epidemic that killed many people, in particular children.\nThese various calamities, together with the ravages of war, have dealt a serious blow to our national economy, which rests on fragile bases, such as cotton as the only export commodity and cattle-rearing that is still poorly managed. With world prices for cotton still low, the State had to do without earnings from exports of fibre, thus creating a serious budgetary deficit.\nRegarding cattle-rearing, the second mainstay of Chad, which is exposed to every calamity affecting the Sahel region, there is now significant improvement as regards the organisation of stock-breeders, controlling sanitary conditions, managing water facilities and pasture-lands, as well as improved management of livestock exports to neighbouring countries.\nThe control of development factors involves education and health. The Government of the Republic of Chad is aware of this, and it is now seeking way, and means to achieve good health for all by the year 2000. In this regard, health care for mothers and children, first-aid care and prevention are the fundamental elements of our health policy.\nEducation too is a priority for us. Chad, whose infrastructure was destroyed by war, is fully aware of the paramount role played by education in development. \nDespite our limited means, the Government has decided to breathe new life into the education system before tackling the rebuilding of the infrastructure. As in all other sectors, we have enjoyed significant financial and material assistance from both friendly countries and international organisations - that is to say, our efforts have always been supported by the donors, who have understood our difficulties and have trusted us.\nIn this regard, it is fitting to recall that the November 1982 and December 1985 Geneva conferences on assistance to Chad, under the aegis of the United Nations Development Programme, as well as the sectoral follow-up meetings of December 1987 and February 198\u00db, have made it possible for Chad to move from the rehabilitation stage to the reconstruction stage, and, hence, to contemplate development within the framework of our interim development plan. In the same context, and in keeping with General Assembly resolution 42/200, adopted on 11 December 1967, the Chadian Government will organise, on 14, 15 and 16 December 1988, together with the United Nations Development Programme, a round-table meeting of donors for assistance in rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction of the northern region of Chad, the Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti, which has been ravaged by war and natural disasters. \nOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of Chad, I wish to invite members of the international community to participate actively and in large numbers in that round-table meeting to reconstruct that important area of the country. Chad, which has already enjoyed valuable assistance from the international community in the rehabilitation phase, knows that it can rely on its friends and partners.\n1 should also like to express sincere thanks to the friendly countries and other donors and to say how grateful we are to them. In emergency situations and in the financing of our reconstruction and development projects, their assistance and development loans were of great help. We shall always be most grateful to them.\nDespite the fact that the international economic situation is not very propitious and despite the Increasing deterioration of the terms of trade, Chad continues to hope for a better future, if the laws of the market stop responding to speculation and reflect only the true elements o\u00a3 appreciation, real supply and real demand. This approach would doubtless help us to correct the fluctuations in commodity prices and to guarantee stable earnings for the developing countries. That too is a laudable effort that developed countries should make in addition to the assistance they have given to the third world. That would enable the developing countries to achieve real growth, which would doubtless help them in their development.\nThe international economic situation is certainly a subject of serious concern. If we consider that the economic environment has improved somewhat, with, in particular, increased growth in the industrialised countries, there are still serious imbalances which hamper the chances of any recovery for most of the developing countries.\nProspects are still grim for the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, whose future is seriously threatened by reason of the huge debt burden, instability and the low prices for commodities, which are their main resources. \nDespite the increasing cyclical difficulties and an unfavourable external environment, these countries have become net exporters of capital to the developed countries and international financial institutions. There is therefore a basic and urgent need for Governments - not out of humanism but in the light of their increased interdependence and in the best interests of all - to seek joint, just and lasting solutions to bridge the gulf between rich and poor.\nDespite the special attention that we were given two years ago by the adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action, Africa is still a continent that has been bypassed by development because of the combined effect of certain negative factors. Despite the heavy sacrifices that our countries have made to adjust our economies, the results we had hoped for in carrying out the terms of this contract have not lived up to the expectations we had based in this programme. Quite the contrary, living standards have dropped and poverty has increased its stranglehold, thereby causing serious political risks.\nNevertheless, in the light of the recommendations of the session of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly that has just concluded, there is reason once again to hope that Africa's partners will show the necessary political will to honour previous commitments, thereby helping to implement this inspiring common endeavour.\nIn addition to the serious economic difficulties, Africa has suffered natural disasters. Either simultaneously or one after the other, these disasters have undermined every effort, systematically threatening the progress made, and wiping out any assets. I am referring to the drought of recent years, the floods and the plagues of insects. Thus, in some parts of the continent, rain, which is generally considered to be a gift from heaven, a divine blessing, particularly at a time when drought had taken such a heavy toll, has turned out to be a real nightmare for the people. The rainfall has, in fact had serious consequences at the human, material, economic and social level, and has had profound negative effects, even for crops.\nWith regard to the States members of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), a combination of natural factors and factors that relate to the international economic environment has sorely tested their economies and hindered their development efforts. However, our countries are determined to work together in order to be better able to meet these challenges. Indeed, as His Excellency, President Al-Hadj Hissein Habre, the current Chairman of the CILSS, said: \\\"Drought should not be considered as a recurrent image of some incurable, fatal disease, but as an ongoing effort, a united struggle and a collective determination to overcome.\\\"\nI should like to take this opportunity to address, on behalf of His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre, the current Chairman of CILSS, our gratitude to the countries and to the international and non-governmental organisations that have continued to give their warm and constant support to our efforts, both individual and collective. But the battle is not over and we are still threatened, particularly as regards agriculture and food.\nIn keeping with the spirit and letter of the Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos, the countries of the subregion are committed actively to continuing their dynamic co-operation in the various special agencies such as the Commission of the Lake Chad Basin, the Niger Basin Authority, the Customs Union of States of Central Africa, which held its various meetings in Ndjamena in December 1987 and January 1988. However laudable and generous it is, the goodwill underlying these enterprises is not enough to enable us to make great strides in this regard.\nThe Government of the Republic of Chad has followed with interest and encouragement the development of the international political situation, which has been marked by favourable prospects for resolving conflicts that represent a dangerous threat to peace in certain parts of our world. Appreciable progress has certainly been made here and there, thanks to the tireless efforts put forth by our Organization, particularly by our dynamic Secretary-General, with the effective support of the international community. The positive developments in the situation in Afghanistan and the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq are certainly specific and encouraging examples of this fact.\nMy delegation welcomes the conclusion of the Geneva agreements on Afghanistan, and we hope that they will be respected and carried out in total so peace may be restored to that country. The many refugees will then be able to go back to their country and the Afghan people will be able to get down to the work of their future in full freedom. \nI have no doubt that many of will come to look upon the year 1988 a\u00b7 marking a positive turning-point in the deadly conflict between Iran and Iraq. The cease-fire of 20 August 1988 reflects the patient and persevering efforts made by the Organisation and by peace-loving countries. My Government sincerely supports those outstanding initiatives designed to bring about the effective and speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) in order to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict. To that end, my delegation urges Iran and Iraq to achieve peace through continued dialogue.\nSince no solution to it has been found, the General Assembly will once again this year consider the question of Kampuchea. Indeed, notwithstanding the efforts made by the international community in keeping with the provisions of relevant United Nations resolutions, no solution to that question has been found that will enable the Kampuchean people to exercise their right to self-determination free from any outside interference. My delegation hopes that the recent initiatives taken by the countries in the region will assist in finding a just and lasting solution to that question, which continues to be of concern to the international community. Chad supports, there and elsewhere, any effort designed to lead to a peaceful and definitive solution to the question. That is also the position of the delegation of Chad with regard to the Korean peninsula and Cyprus.\nAlthough there are glimmers of hope on the horizon with regard to some situations of concern to the international community, it is regrettable to note the lack of progress with regard to the Middle East, that other burning hotbed of tension and concern, the core of which remains the Palestinian problem. The deterioration of the situation in the occupied territories is becoming increasingly disturbing and dominates events in that part of the world. Chad, for its part, has always supported the cause of the Palestinian people, as was made clear in the statement made at the most recent summit conference in Kuwait by His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre, President of Chad, when he said:\n\\\"The Republic of Chad expresses\u00b7 its solidarity with the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people and, accordingly, we support the idea of an international conference under the auspice\u00b7 of the United Nation.\\\"\nIn Central America the delegation of Chad believes that the efforts of the countries of the region to achieve peace and co-operation should be encouraged for the benefit of the peoples in that part of our globe.\nApart from its ecological, economic and debt problems, Africa is also faced with political problems and conflicts that are of constant concern. I refer essentially to the painful and intolerable problems in southern Africa in general and the fate of the Namibian people in particular, problems that continue to figure prominently on the Assembly's agenda. Indeed, a tragic situation continues to exist in that part of Africa, despite international public opinion. The vile racist regime in Pretoria is obstinately continuing to strengthen the odious system of apartheid, thereby denying the fundamental rights of the black majority. Whereas the international community has on many occasions reaffirmed that the elimination of the horrendous system of apartheid in South Africa and the independence of Namibia are its chief priorities, it has so far done so too little effect, for the anachronistic Power continues to resist and to prevent the rapid realisation of the unshakeable will of the civilised world.\nMy delegation is therefore indignant to note the continuation of that grim situation end the perpetration of crimes against the majority. We therefore hope that peace-loving and justice-loving countries and the whole of the international community will bring to bear the absolutely indispensable pressures, both political and economic, needed to bring about the abolition of that barbaric crime against humanity and to bring about the realisation of a multiracial and egalitarian society in South Africa.\nWith regard to the fate of the Namibian people, deprived of their right to independence and plundered by racist South Africa for so many years, my delegation places hope in the recent contacts and ongoing initiatives as a way to the speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1987) calling for an independent and sovereign Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO), its sole and authentic representative.\nRacist South Africa must also cease its destabilising activities and acts of aggression against neighbouring countries.\nTurning to Western Sahara, Chad encourages the efforts being made by the United Nations Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to find an honourable and lasting solution.\nI cannot conclude my statement without conveying congratulations to the United Nations peace-keeping forces that have just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prise. In so doing, the Nobel Committee has reminded the entire world of the values we should attach to peace. Peace is essential and indispensable for each of us, whether individuals or States. Peace creates trust. Peace leads to security. Peace and security are inextricably linked and are, we feel, a guarantee for promoting development. Peace is, in and of itself, the bearer of hope and happiness. Peace is, as someone has quite rightly said, man's future. The atmosphere of peace, so indispensable, so sought after and so desired, is beginning to prevail here and there in our planet. My delegation hopes that the peace process that has been begun will continue without any let-up and that it will also extend to the peoples of Chad and Libya. Chad, as President Al-Hadj Hissein Habre so well stated in his statement at the twenty-fourth summit meeting of the OAU, \n\\\"profoundly aspires to peace. It is prepared to promote all condition\u00b7 to that end. However, we, like other peoples, are deeply attached to our freedom, independence and sovereignty and to the integrity of our territory. Our only ambition is to enjoy, on that basis, the most cordial relations with all our neighbours. We sincerely believe that that is in line with the higher interest of our peoples and with the dignity and credibility of Africa.\\\"\nThus, once again, we should like to take this opportunity to address the Assembly to express the hope that the international community will effectively support the efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU and peace-loving and justice-loving countries to bring about a peaceful and definitive solution to the territorial dispute between Chad and Libya, respecting the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State, in order to establish and develop a climate of good-neighbourliness and fraternal co-operation. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the United Arab Emirates it gives me great pleasure to extend to Ambassador Caputo ray heartfelt congratulations on his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-third regular session. His election reflects the appreciation of the international community for the leading role played by Argentina at the regional level in Latin America and at the international level, especially at the United Nations. It also reflects the confidence the international community places in hire and in his ability to guide the proceedings of this important session with wisdom and confidence.\nIt also gives me great pleasure to convey my sincere thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, for presiding so ably and judiciously over the previous session, its resumed sessions, and the special session.\nI would like, on this occasion, to reaffirm the confidence of my country in the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez d\u00e9 Cuellar, for his continued efforts to enable the Organization to cope with the problems it faces. I would also like to congratulate him on his efforts to enhance the role of the Organization, and to settle international and regional disputes peacefully and through negotiations. Most of his endeavours have been successful this year.\nThe forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly is meeting in unique international circumstances in the wake of a number of international political developments, including the peaceful settlement of numerous regional disputes. Foremost among these developments was the summit meeting between the leaders of the two super-Powers last May. This meeting led to a great accomplishment with regard to disarmament, namely the ratification of the Treaty which calls for the elimination of shorter and intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The meeting also led to political achievements that will have positive far-reaching consequences, since the two super-Powers expressed their determination to reduce the tension existing between them by replacing lack of trust by open dialogue. In that summit meeting the two super-Powers created an atmosphere of detente, even agreement on the settlement of certain regional conflicts.\nThis session is also unique in another respect; the fact that it is being held against the background of the United Nations success in settling a number of difficult regional problems. Through its various median isms, the United Nations has been instrumental in settling the problem of Afghanistan, and in stopping the war between Iran and Iraq. In addition, the Secretary-General has taken an initiative for the settlement of the Cyprus problem, and for the opening of a dialogue between the parties in the Namibian question in order to implement Security Council resolution 433 (1978).\nThese achievements represent an important turning-point, signalling the opening of a new phase in international politics. We in the United Arab Emirates welcome these accomplishments and hops, or rather urge, that they be utilized for promoting peaceful coexistence and co-operation among nations in order that we may reach a new and more advanced stage of international relations. This stage should be based on respect for, and equality among, all nations, as well as on the right of all peoples to secure their freedom and independence. To reach this advanced stage, the following conditions must be met.\nFirst, the two super-Powers should not only sustain the new favourable political atmosphere existing between them, but they should also work diligently to promote it on the level of their bilateral relations, as well as on the level of their respective military blocs. \nSecondly, the success of the United Nations in solving certain regional problems must be a lesson to all of us. We must renew our confidence in the Organization and its effectiveness. We must enhance its role through the commitment of all States, especially the great Powers, to the Charter of the United Nations, and to its purposes and principles. We must also benefit from the organs of the United Nations in all fields, particularly the Security Council, which should be used as a forum for the conduct of negotiations with respect to urgent international problems, and which should be utilized for the adoption of preventive and other measures.\nThe United Nations has become the basis for the international order of the future, and the instrument through which collective efforts can be undertaken to solve international conflicts and controversies, and to reduce the possibility of escalating regional conflicts into nuclear confrontations among the big Powers. The United Nations has also had many accomplishments in economic, social, human, legal, and other fields. In the light of all this, it is incumbent upon all of us to maintain these achievements, and to expand upon them by enhancing the role of the United Nations.\nThirdly, we must utilize the existing favourable conditions by reinforcing the prevailing trend towards solving regional conflicts through the mechanism of the United Nations. We must above all expand the scope of this trend to cover other regional and human problems, most notably the Palestine question and the problem of racial discrimination in South Africa.\t.\t.\nMy country welcomed the recent decision of the Islamic Republic of Iran to accept, as Iraq has done, Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as a basis for ending the war between the two Islamic countries. We also welcomed the decision of the two belligerents to cease fighting and to enter into direct negotiations in order to resolve all their outstanding problems. In this context, we express our appreciation for the role played by the United Nations Secretary-General in achieving the cease-fire and in bringing the two parties to the negotiating table. We also thank him for his continuous efforts to narrow the gap between the two parties.\nWe, in the United Arab Emirates, consider the cease-fire agreement, and the subsequent direct dialogue, to be a major turning-point in the process of restructuring the future relations between the two countries. We hope that the recent developments will lead to an agreement on just and equitable peace principles that will leave no room and no pretext for resorting to arms once again in the future.\nAs a Gulf country, we look forward to the restoration of peace and security in our region, a peace that is just and acceptable, and that is based on good-neighbourly relations among all Gulf countries, big and small, and on non-interference in internal affairs. We are following the negotiations very carefully, and we are certain that the two countries have a vested interest in the restoration of peace. We believe that good intentions will inevitably lead to this end. We shall do our best to make this happen. Despite international detente and the movement towards the settlement of a number of regional conflicts, the Middle East problem - with its core issue, the Palestine question - is still unresolved. It is still a source of tension and deep anxiety, and peace is not at hand. The Palestinian people are still suffering from oppression, imprisonment and torture under the brutal fist of Israeli occupation. Even though Israel 's aims in rejecting peace and insisting upon occupation are clear to everyone, it is difficult for us to understand the attempts of certain big countries to isolate the Palestine question from the trend of international peace. It is to be noted that Israel persists in creating obstacles, which the United States endorses  in order to obstruct the convening of an international peace conference. The convening of this conference has won the universal support of the international community.\nThe crux of the problem is the fact that one of the two super-Powers fully endorses the aggressive policy of Israel and refuses to recognize the existence of the Palestinian people, who are oppressed and deprived of their basic rights. Indeed, this super-Power works jointly with Israel in a futile attempt to stamp out the Palestinian identity, hoping to remove the Palestinian people from the pages of history. But through its valiant uprising, which Israel has tried to crush with all its instruments of oppression, the Palestinian people has clearly demonstrated its full awareness o\u00a3 its national rights, and its determination to secure those tights.\nFor seven decades the Palestinian people has been tenaciously struggling for freedom, independence, and the ending of occupation. We are confident, therefore, that this long struggle will lead to freedom and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State. The present trend at the United Nations to use its mechanisms for resolving certain regional conflicts and problems affirms the validity of the view that the only mechanism for achieving a just and permanent peace in the Middle East is the holding of an international peace conference. This conference is to be held in accordance with General Assembly resolution 38/58 C, under the auspices of the United Nations, and with the participation on an equal footing of all the concerned parties, including the Palestinian people as represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), its sole, legitimate representative.\nLebanon is still a source of danger and deep concern for all of us. This fraternal country will not return to normalcy unless Israel withdraws from Lebanese territory, ceases to meddle in its internal affairs, and stops its aggression against Lebanese towns and villages. We urge our brothers in Lebanon to put aside their differences and resolve their disputes through open dialogue, in order for Lebanon to regain its vanguard position in the fields of culture and progress.\nMy country has followed with interest the process of negotiations and what has been reached so far with respect to the question of Namibia and putting an end to South Africa's continued aggression against Angola. We hope that the Pretoria regime will not renege on its commitment to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which constitutes a comprehensive blueprint for the independence of Namibia. In this connection, we wish to reaffirm our support for the struggle of the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Despite the progress achieved with respect to the question of Namibia, the policy of apartheid, adopted by the white minority regime in South Africa, has been made more evil in its practices, thus causing more death and destruction. We strongly condemn the Institutional regime of this policy, which \ndenies the basic rights of the overwhelming black majority. This violates the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and contradicts the tenets of justice and human progress. My country also strongly condemns the continuous acts of aggression, terrorism and destabilisation perpetrated by the Pretoria regime against the African front-line States.\nMy country is a firm believer in the Charter. We therefore support its organs and call for the use of the mechanisms provided by those organs. We also wish to emphasize the need to abide by the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States non-recourse to the threat or use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nGuided by this belief, the United Arab Emirates welcomed the conclusion of the Geneva Accords last April for the settlement of the question of Afghanistan. The mechanisms provided by the Secretary-General played an important role in the conclusion of these Accords and in the involvement of the two super-Powers in guaranteeing their implementation, including non-interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and full respect for its independence and sovereignty.\nWe also welcome the recent dialogue among the parties to the Kampuchean problem and the constructive role played by the Governments of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in this regard.\nWe also welcome the ongoing dialogue to solve the problems and conflicts confronting the countries of Central America. In this regard, we support the initiatives of the Contadora Group and the Support Group.\nConcerning Korea, we urge the North and South to settle their differences through free dialogue unhampered by pressure and pre-conditions  This should defuse the crisis and bring about the unity the Koreans so earnestly seek. We welcome the readiness of the Secretary-General to help the two Governments. With respect to Cyprus, we commend the Secretary-General for his latest initiative, which has had s more favourable response from the parties to the conflict. We also welcome the decision of the leaders of the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities to co-operate with the Secretary-General, as well as their desire to meet without any pre-conditions and their setting of 1 June 1989 as the date for reaching a negotiated settlement for the Cyprus problem in all its aspects. We hope that the settlement will be just, comprehensive and durable. We also hope that within its framework, security and coexistence will be ensured for the two communities and that the settlement itself will guarantee the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-alignment of Cyprus.\nThe third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament was held this year in a favourable international atmosphere of d\u00e9tente. The successful results of the bilateral negotiations on disarmament conducted between the two super-Powers encouraged many participants in the special session to believe that those achievements could be transformed into new incentives for multilateral negotiations. Like many others, we nurtured the ambition that through consensus we would be able to agree on a final document that reflected the new developments in the field of disarmament. 3ut our ambition exceeded the prevailing realities owing to the lack of sufficient political will on the part of certain countries for arriving at a fruitful and successful conclusion to that session. \nAs the Secretary-General has stated in his report on the work of the Organization, \\\"Disarmament and the regulation of armaments ... will remain a decisive test of the improvement of international relations and the strengthening of peace.\\\" (A/43/1, p. 13) In this regard my country reaffirms its support for the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones, especially in the Middle East. We also reiterate our support for and commitment to the United Nations resolution declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace, and look forward to the elimination of all obstacles that have so far prevented the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean.\nThe improvements in international relations witnessed on the political level have not been reflected to the desired degree in the state of the international economy. Serious economic structural imbalances still persist. As a result, the prices of raw materials have become unstable and have even declined. Moreover, the policies of protectionism, the discriminatory practices and the restrictions imposed on the exports of developing countries have a detrimental effect on the process of development. They also cause an escalation in the crisis of foreign indebtedness faced by the developing countries.\nWe believe that it is impossible to enhance international detente without consolidating the economic foundations upon which it rests. This requires a stronger spirit of co-operation and the enhancement of die role of international economic agencies, it also requires the adoption by the advanced countries of more flexible policies and the introduction of structural reforms in the system of international economic relations. \nWe emphasize the importance of strengthening the role of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as they constitute the main forum for dialogue and negotiations with respect to international co-operation for development. We also stress the need to abide by the principle of multilateralism and to pursue an integrated approach to the various problems pertaining to finance, currency, indebtedness, commerce and the resources devoted to development. Similarly, we call on all States to adhere to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and to refrain from using commercial restrictions, blockades or sanctions as political tools for conducting economic relations in a manner that violates the Charter,\nThis session provides all Members of our international Organization with a valuable opportunity to review and re-evaluate both the great achievements attained through collective co-operation and the setbacks and obstacles resulting from selfish as aggressive policies. The United Nations offers an important frame of reference for such re-evaluation. The challenge before us today is whether or not we shall be able to utilize this session by drawing on our past experience, both positive and negative, for the purpose of reaching the right conclusions. The historical record proves that peace and security are synonymous with mutual trust and that they are the only means of elevating the human race to the desired level of economic growth, cultural advancement and social stability.\nModern history has taught us that the United Nations, through its organs and mechanisms, is able to lead human society to more understanding and co-operation. Can we vest our confidence in the United Nations? More important, can we trust each other in order that we nay build a world in which justice and mutual respect prevail and man nay enjoy freedom and stability? Future developments, in the shaping of which we all participate, will provide the answers to these questions. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bring greetings from the people and Government of Belize. I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the high post of President of the General Assembly. I am confident that he brings with him the expertise and energy for which he is well known and I wish him a most successful presidency, of which he and his great State, Argentina, may be proud.\nIt would, however, be remiss of me to fail to recognize the great contribution to the process of the presidency made by my colleague and friend, Dame Nita Barrow of Barbados, and to wish her too, success in her continuing illustrious career.\nIt is my sad duty to inform the Assembly that the Foreign Minister of Belize, Mr. Dean Barrow, is unable to take his place at this rostrum owing to serious illness in his family. Only something of such critical importance could keep him away. He sends his greetings to all his colleagues, with the following message: \\\"The forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly has opened in an atmosphere of almost unbridled optimism. Since last we met favourable developments in international relations have occurred with a speed that has confounded the naysayers, He have been witness to the de-escalation of several of the consuming conflicts that earlier blighted the global agenda. And we have even seen the possible beginning of the end of the madness that is nuclear stockpiling.\n\\\"We may be forgiven, then, if our speeches at times depart from the usual sententious rhetoric to strike an occasional high note of celebration. For we are enjoying a victory of sorts, and that victory is nothing less than the triumph of multilateralism, the revalidation of the United Nations system, and the vindication in the contemporary era of the historical vision of our founding fathers.\nI think it is particularly fitting that the assignment of superintending this exciting excursion into new avenues of international collaboration, should fall on the capable shoulders of one of Latin America's sons - a son of Argentina. I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to this high office, confident that your authority and capacity are nonpareil. My delegation wishes you well as you embark on a difficult but rewarding task. The burden of your duties will surely be eased appreciably by the fact that another eminent son of Latin America, in the person of our esteemed Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, will be at your side.\n\\\"The Secretary-General has now seen much of what he has striven for become reality. I congratulate him on his patience, his persistence and his success.\n\\\"Often the sacrifices and hard work of Under-Secretaries-General go unremarked in the bureaucratic profusion that is the United Nations. My delegation seeks the Assembly's indulgence to record our appreciation of the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and his staff. They efficiently serviced the last General Assembly and its resumed sessions, as well as the third special session on disarmament.\n\\\"That there has been a significant reduction in regional and international tensions over the past year is undoubted. Greater communication has been established between the super-Powers, the global community is resting a little easier, and the dream of universal peace has taken new wing. Much of the credit for this breakthrough can be claimed by the Organization. Burdened by notions of their national interests and misguided by the concept of bipolarity, the United States and the Soviet Union would not have reached their current degree of rapprochement without the atmosphere created by the United Nations. It is as much to the appeals and pressure of peace-loving Member States as to their own enlightenment that the super-Powers owe the present, unprecedented level of detente.\n\\\"My Government congratulates the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the positive first step they have taken to reduce the balance of terror. By agreeing to the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - they have signalled some small acknowledgement of the cry of the world community, which rejects being held hostage to the possibility of nuclear annihilation.\n\\\"At the same time, the point has been fairly made that, if the super-Powers had the capacity to destroy the world 50 times over, the achievement of a Treaty that merely cuts that ability in half, so that they are now able to destroy the world only 25 times over, is more symbolic than real. \nWe therefore encourage the super-Powers to continue their dialogue recognizing their responsibility not to let an illusion of peace replace the reality of peace. Our world will be a better place if the strongest among us find ways to co-operate with each other and accept that their best security lies not in the quantity of their arms but in the quality of their trust.\nBoth their peoples and our peoples would benefit from the reduction of the stupendous military budgets, with some of the savings being designated for the poorest and most infirm among us.\n\\\"Most countries, and particularly those in our region, Latin America and the Caribbean, have coins to realize that the problems of peace and development are indissoluble linked, since without peace there can be no development and without development peace will always be precarious.\n\\\"My Government congratulates our neighbouring Central American republics on the path to peace and development they have undertaken with the signing of the Esquipulas II agreement. We note, though, that the road has not been a straight one. There seems to have been a sapping of the political will that led to the regional agreement. Stasis has set in and there may even have been some slippage. \u2116 therefore urge Central America to recover the energy that will allow it to find a lasting and indigenous solution to a complex problem. At the same time we call on external interests to refrain from further jeopardizing the prospects of peace by attempting to transform essentially local difficulties into dimensions of East-West rivalry. We urge all Member States of the United Nations to abide by the Charter principles, most particularly the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of States. A scrupulous regard for these norms of international behaviour will ensure the continuation of the regional process leading to peace, social betterment, economic development and security.\n\\\"For its part the Government of Belize supports the right of all States including the Republics of Panama and Nicaragua, to choose their own leaders and to fashion their own political, social and economic systems free from threats or pressures. This is one small way in which we think we can contribute to the process of regional respect and reconciliation.\n\\\"Another contribution to peace in Central America is Belize's often-stated willingness to remove itself from the agenda of conflict in the region. In this effort we reiterate our appreciation to Member States for their continued support for Belize's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Their interest and active Participation in promoting the rights of the Belizean people continue to be a source of strength to us.\n\\\"It is a measure of the maturity of that country that the civilian administration of the Republic of Guatemala has agreed to join with us in a search for a solution to the difficulties that have prevented our two States from the full enjoyment of normal relations as independent neighbours.\n\\\"My Government is pleased to report that some progress has been made during the past few months, permanent Joint Commission comprising representatives of Belize and the Republic of Guatemala, with the additional participation of representatives of the United Kingdom, has been established. This Commission is charged with the preparation of a comprehensive draft of a treaty designed to resolve definitively the situation between Belize and Guatemala. \\\"All sides have embarked on this exercise in good faith, in an effort to arrive at a just and honourable solution acceptable to all the interested parties. Since people-participation is a fundamental pillar of Belize's democracy, whatever treaty is produced must be endorsed by the Belizean people in a general referendum before it can be considered to have been accepted.\n\\\"Our country maintains warm and friendly relations with all our neighbours in Central America, and our people would welcome a formula that would enable Belize and Guatemala not only to coexist in geographic contiguity but also to co-operate in human harmony. \n\\\"We continue to confront the challenges inherent in our reality as a Caribbean state on the Central American region and we are encouraged by the recognition by the United Nations system that Belize is possessed of a dual heritage that entitles it to maintain both its Caribbean and its Central American identity.\t\n\\\"It was therefore with a sense of special status that Belize took part in the dialogue of Latin America and Caribbean Foreign Ministers initiated by the Latin American Economic System and held in Caracas in September. We fully endorse the conclusions from the dialogue and propose to participate actively in further efforts to strengthen Latin American and Caribbean unity.\t\\\"Our region, in common with most of the developing world, continues to face a serious economic crisis that takes its toll of the quality of life of our peoples, creating conditions ripe for the political instability and social tensions that are anathema ix the consolidation of democracy.\n\\\"The persisting external imbalances that characterize the international economy at present give rise to the inevitability of chronic diminishing returns for primary producing and debtor countries, however valiant their efforts at greater production and timely debt servicing. We note that although real growth in the seven major industrial countries averaged 3,1 per cent in the year just past as against 28 per cent in 1986, the pattern of performance in developing countries was different. The rate of output growth in developing countries as a group was in fact one percentage point below the 1986 level. \n\\\"For many developing countries the debt problem remained a critical issue. The need to remain current on debt-service payments and thus retain some level of creditworthiness was reflected in restrictive fiscal and monetary policies that served to limit growth rates. Faced with the need to improve external accounts, indebted countries have had to increase savings relative to investment or reduce investment relative to savings, in both cases impacting adversely on the capacity creation for future growth. Approaches to a solution to the debt problem have continued to focus on the case-by-case option, despite widespread recognition of the multilateral and interdependent nature of the situation. Efforts to relieve the debt burden arising from loans extended by commercial banks have been complicated by the increasingly hard line taken by bank regulators in relation to provision for inadequately performing loans. \\\"\nTo create the conditions for the era of development that ought to accompany the onset of peace, hard decisions will be required to eliminate the main sources of imbalance between the larger industrialized countries on the one hand and between debtor developing countries and creditor developed countries on the other. Unless the heavily indebted developing countries can be assisted to grow out of their present situation, the likelihood of voluntary or involuntary suspension of debt servicing and consequential social and political instability will only increase, making nonsense of the notion of peace in our time. \n\n\\\"While not itself immune to the vicissitudes of the international economic situation Belize has recorded modest growth in real terms over the past year. We have managed to restructure our debt burden to service it more effectively. Flows of private and public investment have increased to facilitate infrastructural development and growth in the agriculture and tourism sectors. Under certain preferential arrangements there has been a favourable trading environment for our commodity exports, and an emphasis on diversification into other areas of activity has compensated somewhat for the fall in revenue resulting from the depressed prices on the international sugar market. \nIn keeping with my Government's policy of providing the economic and social infrastructure to facilitate private-sector economic development and provide jobs for our people, we have embarked on a number of large development projects. These include rehabilitation and extension of the main runway and construction of a new terminal building at the international airport; expansion of power generation and distribution capacity in the electricity company, together with feasibility assessments for mini-hydro installations around the country; acquisition of international telephone services from a foreign company; construction of a new public hospital for the country; rehabilitation and expansion of the main highway network; provision of credits for private-sector projects; and a number of smaller projects and initiatives to improve the quality of life in general. \n\\\"Belize continues to rely on the performance of its people in the management and direction of the economy; but we also work for improvement with the assistance and support of international development and financial organizations as well as the assistance of a number of friendly countries. These include, but are not limited to, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico. \n\\\"We hope to expand the roster of our partners in development by demonstrating our capacity and our maturity in ordering our development priorities. At the same time, we consider it necessary to reject the tendency of some donor countries and international agencies to attempt to dictate the development process of recipient States. That practice has led to misplaced priorities in the social and economic programmes of several developing countries, priorities inconsistent with the basic human needs of our peoples. My delegation is of the view that donors need to adopt a degree of sensitivity to this situation. That would allow recipient countries to set their own agenda based on the reality of their individual experiences.\n\\\"To allay the concerns of those who fear the spectre of misappropriation of aid money, mechanisms for proper co-ordination and accountability surely can be devised. A comprehensive needs assessment of the targeted sectors within the recipient countries ought to be made in consultation with the beneficiary country. To involve local authorities in the planning stage ensures that account is taken of the peculiarities of indigenous bureaucratic and co-ordinating machinery, and so guarantees implementation of projects for the benefit of the greatest number.\n\\\"It is in that context that Belize welcomes the Initiative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Development Programme's plan for economic co-operation for Central America. Belize was originally excluded on the ground that it was not part of Historic Central America. But as the Haitian proverb puts it, 'The pencil of God has no eraser. And we are happy about Belize's belated inclusion in the plan, thereby reconciling the notion of Historic Central America with the simple fact of geography.\n\\\"Belize has considered and submitted some project profiles aimed at assisting us to redress the economic and social problems occurring as a consequence of the influx of refugees from situations of conflict in the region. These projects respond to real needs and are intended to assist in the machinery of relocation as well as to benefit the Individual refugees and the communities in which they have been integrated. \\\"We stand ready to work with the agencies concerned to make sure that the projects are carried put to the optimum benefit of the target group. At the same time, we join in the appeal to potential donors that have not yet done so to commit the necessary reserves to make this humanitarian initiative an early reality.\tMy Government joins in the commendation already expressed to the Soviet Union on its decision to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. We urge the Soviet Union to let nothing deter it from this decision, nor to delay its fulfilment.\n\\\"The people of Afghanistan have suffered long enough and their development has been significantly retarded by the presence of foreign troops on their soil. Our hope is that the absence of those troops will create the climate for the return to a genuinely independent and non-aligned Afghanistan under a leadership responsive to the will of the people of that troubled land. \nWe welcome the appointment of a co-ordinator for United Nations humanitarian and economic assistance relating to Afghanistan, and support the people of that country as they embark on the process of reconstruction. I should also like to express my appreciation, and that of my Government, to the Government and people of Pakistan for the constructive role they have assumed during this crisis. Pakistan has served as host to more than 2 million refugees from Afghanistan, at great cost to its own people and resources. It is our hope that they too can now begin the rebuilding process in their own country.\n\\\"In the present global atmosphere of reconciliation and good will, there still remain areas where peace has been elusive. One such area is Kampuchea. The occupation of Kampuchea by Vietnamese troops is a violation of the United Nations Charter and the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement. \u0410s well it adds to the economic and personnel burden of Viet Kara itself. This era of conciliation offers Viet Nam a unique opportunity to reflect on its own struggle for independence, which won the support and admiration of the majority of the world's people. To re-establish that spirit of solidarity among the community of nations, Viet Nam is engaged to subscribe to a political settlement based on the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and internationally supervised free elections.\n\\\"We are encouraged by the decision of the protagonists in the Gulf war to agree on a cease-fire under the auspices of the Security Council. The time has passed for determining which side has won or which should win this senseless confrontation. The havoc and destruction visited on both sides, as well as on innocent non-combatants, have been monumental. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) affords the most viable framework for achieving a just and Lasting settlement. We are confident of the ability of the Secretary-General to act as a reliable interlocutor, and we appeal to those who have carved for themselves a special role in this affair to do all that is possible to ensure success in the negotiations and a return to normalcy and development in both Iran and Iraq.\n\\\"The situation in the Middle East continues to be volatile. My government was encouraged earlier this year when it appeared that an agreement might be reached on an international peace conference on the Middle East. We would support the early convening of such a conference. Our policy remains committed to the right of Israel to exist within secure borders - but not at the expense of a Palestinian homeland. For these difficult issues to be settled and for peace to return to the Middle East, dialogue between Israel and the Arab States is essential. \n\\\"While athletes from the four corners of the globe convened in Seoul to compete in friendly rivalry for the gold, silver and bronze in the games of the XXIV Olympiad, South Korea's leadership made a great leap forward toward fulfilling the dream of a unified Korea. He welcome and are encouraged by the declaration of President Roh Tae Woo that his Government is willing to end the situation of confrontation between the two Koreas and to establish relations with North Koreas based on a spirit of co-operation. This fundamental change of attitude will go a long way towards defusing tensions north and south of the thirty-eighth parallel and towards re-establishing hope for reunification of the two Koreas.\n\\\"We are heartened by the progress made in the negotiations regarding the 13-year-long conflict in Angola. It is our hope that as the South African and Cuban troops make their way home, the issue of linkage will finally be laid to rest and the way opened for Namibia to proceed at last to its independence.\n\\\"The intransigence of minority white South Africa in refusing to share power with majority black South Africa makes a bloodbath in that country inevitable. We regret that certain members of the international community are unwilling or unable to join in mandatory sanctions against that terrorist State. And in the name of our suffering brothers and sisters we appeal for an end to this mollycoddling of the Pretoria regime. \\\"A few months ago we celebrated Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday. Mandela is a statesman as well as a freedom fighter, but in South Africa he has remained imprisoned like a common criminal. The continued incarceration of Nelson Mandela, as well as the proscription of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC), is testimony to the barbarous lack of foresight on the part of the apartheid regime. It might not be too late to demonstrate some semblance of good sense by a decision now to release, unconditionally Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners. Such a gesture would facilitate dialogue between the Botha regime and the leaders of the black community, and would perhaps spare the continent of Africa the South African version of Armageddon that will otherwise surely follow.\n\\\"Members will recall that at previous sessions of the General Assembly my delegation dealt with the matter of the production, trafficking and consumption of dangerous drugs. The significant aggravation of the drug problem and its harmful effects on our societies urge immediate and concerted efforts to deal with it. For our part, Belize has adopted a multi-disciplinary course of action to prevent and reduce the illicit demand for narcotic drugs and \u00a1psychotropic substances: to control their use and supply, to suppress illicit trafficking and to provide treatment and rehabilitation for drug abusers and their victims. This is the approach that was agreed upon by the United Nations Conference held in Vienna last year.\n\\\"It has long been recognized that the drug problem spans borders economic circumstances and ideologies, threatening to create its own orthodoxy and its own peculiar moral and social imperatives. The war against drugs requires the co-operation of all nations, and we cannot lose sight of the fact that the basic motivation for drug production and trafficking stems from the readily available market and the phenomenal rewards offered by that market. Recognition of this by the largest consumer country has therefore been a welcome development.\n\\\"Small Governments must continuously defend their political and economic independence and their territorial integrity. Of late, assaults on our sovereignty have included attempts to introduce industrial waste into our region. As industrial and toxic waste accumulates in the developed countries  our small States are offered the argument that somehow we can benefit from the dumping of industrial waste on our land and in our sea. This is a remarkable piece of insolence from those who are determined to protect their own environmental balance while offering blandishments to destroy ours. My Government emphatically rejects those overtures, and we call on the industries concerned to make their own arrangements in their own countries to dispose of the effluent of their prosperity.\n\\\"No amount of economic benefit can compensate for the environmental devastation and human harm that will follow indiscriminate dumping of industrial waste. The quality of life we enjoy cannot be bartered for the quantity of promises we are offered.\n\\\"We in Belize have more than once undergone the trials associated with killer hurricanes. We are therefore especially able to empathize with our sister country of Jamaica, with the Cayman Islands and with the State of Yucatan in Mexico. We join in the appeal for international assistance to help these areas recover from their savaging by hurricane Gilbert.\n\\\"If I began this presentation in an upbeat manner, it is just as well to end on a note of caution. Although there have been real successes in the past year, the international agenda nevertheless remains crowded with conflicts. It would be a mistake, then, merely to give ourselves over to self-congratulation. What is needed rather is to press on with a new determination inspired by our recent progress. \u00a1Such a determination should above all seek to preserve the gains made by the process of multilateralism and to extend them from the political arena to the sphere of economic relations.\nIn urging on all Member States this renewed commitment to multilateralism, I am reminded of the tale of Oedipus. Members will recall how in ignorance he killed his father and married his mother. Queen Jocasta, and so became ruler of Thebes. In the meantime, the fates visited a plague on his subjects and tortured them with great pestilences. When Oedipus realized that he himself was the cause of the suffering, he put out his own eyes and wandered blind away from Thebes.\n\\\"The Czech \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer Milan Kundera uses this story to make the point that we cannot escape the consequences of our actions, even though those actions might have been unwitting.\n\\\"How,, one of the recurring themes of international, relations is that there is nothing more injurious to an effective world order than that the law of the jungle should prevail, that the strong should take advantage of the weak, that unilateral egocentricity should defeat collective responsibility.\n\\\"If we were to reject the case for multilateralism, therefore, we would be deliberately ignoring the lessons of history and could not even lay claim to the dubious excuse that we proceeded in ignorance. And who would gainsay that the consequences of our action could entail the demise of civilization, the extinction of our humanity? \\\"It is a chilling prospect, but one that we nay avoid by our continuing allegiance to the concept of multilateralism that is, after all the very raison d'\u00eatre of our United Nations system.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn the auspicious occasion of the forty-third session of the General Assembly, I bring the Assembly fraternal greetings from His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II and the Government and people of the Kingdom of Lesotho.\nWe are confident that under the wise leadership and guidance of the President the deliberations of this session of the Assembly will come to a fruitful conclusion.\nAt this early juncture I wish also to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a special tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, for the noble task accomplished during the hectic forty-second session.\nIt is also worth noting that most of the positive achievements of the United Nations system during recent years are attributable to our ever-indefatigable Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, to whom we are ever grateful. The catalogue of his outstanding achievements is second to none; indeed, he continues to acquit himself with flourishing distinction.\nThere is barely a decade to go before the turn of the century. This should be, for all of us, a moment of reflection as we seek to examine the future of mankind in the years that lie ahead. The pursuit of peace, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, remains one of the loftiest challenges to humanity. Recent developments in international relations have signalled a definitive shift from a world characterized by confrontation to a world of reconciliation, mutual accommodation and tolerance. Increasingly the futility of war is dawning upon nations, as is the tenability of aggression and foreign domination.\nThe emerging spirit of dialogue and co-operation has aroused great hope that the preservation of human civilization can be ensured. Moshoeshoe I, the founder of the Basotho nation, an eminent thinker of his time and a man of immense diplomatic skills, used to liken peace to his sister. We visualized peace as the mother of the community of nations, and hence the basis for the collective survival and security of nations large and small. Never before In contemporary history has the conscience of Mankind been so elevated with respect to full regard and respect for fundamental human rights. The inalienable right of peoples to national self-determination and independence the sanctity of human life and its dignity and the irrelevance of racism as a determinant factor in human interaction are now universally accepted as basic tenets of humanity, we have to rededicate ourselves and live up to the noble principles of human rights to ensure c better future for posterity.\nMy country has great faith in the role of the United Nations system in promoting respect for international law. The quest for justice entails a commitment to the principle of equal rights for all peoples of the world. The founding fathers of the United Nations envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Statute of the International Court of Justice legal instruments to guarantee for future generations conditions of just peace, freedom and security for all.\nWe applaud the initiatives now under way world-wide to resolve regional conflicts through peaceful means. We welcome the international community's growing awareness of the perils inherent in resorting to belligerency to settle disputes. We have reason to believe that the remaining hotbeds of tension in the world are on the verge of resolution given the current mood of reconciliation and goodwill among the nations of the world.\nIt is a sad reality of our times that in spite of the heightened world-wide appreciation of the worth of human life poverty in the third world remains the most serious affront to human dignity. Poverty with its squalor the pangs of hunger the misery of disease and the despair resulting from unfulfilled dreams of the promise that cane with political independence remains a stark reminder of the blatant inequalities that characterise our modern world. There can never be hope for peace and stability in a world in which the abject poverty endured by the any, coexistence with the abundance and wastefulness enjoyed and practised by the few.\nSouthern Africa continues to be a hotbed of tension and the situation in South Africa continues to be ever volatile. The problematic socio-political vicissitudes continue to come pouring in, not one by one but in sky-rocketing, astronomical figures. Black to blade conflict, bordering on ethnicity and ideological-political adherences and convictions, continues to soar. Racial tension and social imbalances are increasing. Should the world just sit bade and watch? I think not.\nThe root cause of this uneasy malaise is the policy of apartheid. It is my considered opinion that peaceful pressure exerted on the Government of the Republic of South Africa regarding the dismantling of apartheid and the resolution of the conflict in Angola and Namibia is an effective tool that should be used to persuade the Republic of South Africa to come to terms with inescapable realities and initiate round-table negotiations with all the parties concerned in South Africa, without any discrimination.\nOn less and until all men and women in South Africa participate in the political process and collectively determine their own destiny, lasting peace and harmony will not reign in South Africa. It is therefore imperative for all those countries in a position to do so to act promptly, before it is too late.\nInextricably linked to the conflict in the Republic of South Africa is the question of refugees and displaced persons. The nexus is not difficult to identify. Most of the persons fleeing from the repercussions of the South African situation make Lesotho their first port of call. Because of its geographical location within the heart of South Africa Lesotho is easily accessible from South Africa. As a signatory to international instruments on refugees, Lesotho continues to abide by its obligations. We are a country that was founded on the fragmented pieces of ethnic groupings at a time when people were suffering and fleeing from the scourge of vicious and violent subregional strife. Therefore, it is only fitting that we should reaffirm our unswerving and steadfast commitment to provide sanctuary to all genuine refugees, without discrimination based upon race, creed or colour. This reaffirmation of our commitment was also made by my country during the recent Oslo Conference on the plight of refugees, returnees and displaced persons.\nThe current diplomatic initiatives intended to lay the basis for the return of peace to Angola, independence for Namibia and the withdrawal of all foreign troops have given us great hope. It is to the credit and thanks to the foresightedness of the United Nations Security Council that, 10 years after it adopted the celebrated resolution 435 (1978), that resolution now appears to be receiving endorsement by all the parties concerned as the key to the long overdue attainment of independence by Namibia.\nThe General Assembly has served the cause of decolonising Namibia with distinction. Hence, it is our conviction that it will accomplish with even greater distinction the tasks it will be called upon to shoulder in the period leading to Namibian independence. The world is awaiting with profound anxiety the carrying out of the stated intention of the Republic of South Africa to the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) by pulling out its administrative machinery from Namibia by the beginning of November this year. We are also hopeful that South Africa's gesture of withdrawing its forces, from Angola signifies the beginning of the end of hostilities in Angola.\nWe are gratified to note the constructive role of the two super-Powers, the Soviet Union and the united States of America, in bringing their influence and prestige to bear in ensuring that a just and durable solution of this regional problem is arrived at.\nOne other issue that has featured prominently on the United Nations General Assembly agenda for the past eight years is the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq, two Islamic countries bound together by commonality of cultures, traditions and beliefs and both member a of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United nations. We all stood and watched with horror and disbelief as those two sister countries rampantly expended their resources and energies on the destruction of each other's economic infrastructures and the disruption of shipping in the Gulf region.\nThe United Nations took the lead in Making unsparing efforts towards the resolution of this conflict, and we are quite gratified to acknowledge that these efforts have not been in vain. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) has finally been accepted and earned its rightful place in the minds of those who are in a position to order the cessation of the hostilities. It is regrettable that this war, in which neither party has emerged as victor or vanquished, has resulted in the loss of so many human lives. We strongly believe that the war should not have been fought in the first instance. As we have already stated, many regional and subregional conflicts continue to be unresolved because of the lack of political will of the parties to the conflicts to adhere to guidelines enshrined in the United Nations Charter, such as non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, peaceful settlement of disputes and non-use of force, to mention only \u0430 few.\t\nHaving regard to the foregoing, my delegation is of the opinion that the Palestinian issue would be resolved if an international conference were to be convened under the auspices of the United Nations, at which conference the issue would be thoroughly discussed and concrete proposals and plans for the resolution of the dispute drawn up so as to bring to an end this problem which has been on the agenda of this Organisation for such a long time.\nAcknowledgement of the right of Israel as a sovereign state within recognised and secure borders and the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland of their own and ultimately to independence and sovereignty is a sine qua non for a durable and pacific settlement of the Middle East crisis. In the meantime we appeal to all the parties Involved to exercise restraint and to desist from resorting to the use of force as an instrument for the settlement of the conflict.\nDespite numerous efforts by the United Nations to bring about lasting peace in Cyprus, the situation there remains contentious. We are, however, gratified to note that the Turkish and Greek Cypriots are now headed along a promising path towards resolution of the dispute. May the recent talks held between President Vasiliou and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Denktash, under the auspices of the. Secretary-General of the united Nations, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, herald the beginning of a new era in the politics of that troubled island, so that in the not too distant future Cyprus may once again enjoy its unity, which it has so long awaited. \nLesotho continues to support all genuine efforts to resolve the  Central American problems and we support and fully endorse the Arias peace plan and the Contadora initiative which in our view constitute \u0430 pragmatic framework through which the pain and suffering in Central America may be brought to an end.\nThanks to the highly commendable mediation efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and of the Organisation of African Unity, we are beginning to see a ray of hope on the horizon of the Western Sahara problem. The intended referendum, which we hope will be fair, should give the people of the Western Sahara an opportunity to exercise freely their right to determine their political destiny. No doubt the road to peace will also be greatly facilitated if the two parties to the dispute agree to open the channels of direct communication.\nThe sons and daughters of Kampuchea rightly yearning for peace and a permanent resolution of the present political stalemate. For almost a decade the people of Kampuchea have experienced untold suffering, involving massive loss of life and destruction of property.\nThe political and economic effects consequent upon the Kampuchean problem have not been felt in Asia alone they have been a daunting problem for the international community. We support the barrage of resolutions passed by our Organisation consistently calling for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea. Lesotho steadfastly continues to support the intent and spirit of those United Nations resolutions and will do so until they are fully and unconditionally observed and implemented.\nBy the same token, Lesotho fully supports all the current moves and initiatives aimed at the reunification of the two Koreas and the return of true and lasting peace to the Korean peninsula.   \nWe are hopeful that the economic recovery of the North will create conditions conducive to the uplifting of the South, with particular attention being paid to the special needs of the least developed countries. It is also our fervent hope that the recommendations relating to the developing countries made at the 1988 Toronto summit, especially those concerning debt relief, will be faithfully implemented.\nThe mid-term review of the United Nations programme of action for Africa's economic recovery and development, conducted here at United Nations Headquarters just before the convening of the present session, revealed that Africa is in no better economic situation than it was when the programme was adopted in 1986. Africa's needs remain more acute than ever.\nIt would be remiss of me to conclude my statement without expressing our heartfelt congratulations to the United Nations peace-keeping forces for the well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize awarded to them in recognition of the meritorious service they continue to render to the international common in the maintenance of international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like to begin by congratulating Mr. Dante Caputo on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. His election is a tribute to- the important sole that Argentina, with which Tanzania enjoys excellent relations, continues to play on the Latin American and international community scenes in furtherance of international co-operation, understanding and peace. Mr. Caputo brings to the office a great wealth of' political and diplomatic skills and experience. I assure him of my delegation's support in bringing those skills to bear fully on the critical agenda before this session. \nI wish, at the same time, to convey the deep appreciation of my Government to his predecessor, who, with such dedication and competence/ so effectively guided the work of the last session. We greatly distinguished himself as we tackled the various major and pressing problems of our time. I wish him good health in the continued service of his country.\nAllow me also to pay a deserved tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and to the Organization as a whole. The last few months have been as engaging as they have proved challenging. The perseverance, dedication and sheer energy involved deserve commendation. It takes imagination, resourcefulness and commitment not only to ensure the smooth operation of the Organization but also to tackle the challenges before it, especially when it is experiencing such daunting financial problems.\nI should like to welcome enthusiastically the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for this year to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. The main mission of the United Nations is the safeguarding of peace and the prevention of war in the world. The award of this Prize serves as a timely reminder of this United Nations 'role. May it give hope and encouragement to the thousands of uniformed men and women involved g often in desolate places and on hazardous missions to keep belligerents fit bay, and facilitate dialogue between adversaries conducive to peaceful coexistence. The Peace Prize is a deserved, noble and global tribute to this United Nations work.\nThe activities and programmes of the United Nations system can be fruitful only if they are promoted from a strong financial basis. The current financial crisis of the United Nations works directly towards reducing its authority, operations and reputation. My delegation therefore appeals to Member States to honour their legal obligations under the Charter and make timely payment of their assessed contributions to the regular budget of the Organization. If we do not undertake these corrective steps we shall be rightly judged as retreating from the spirit and the cause of multilateralism, which is the corner-stone of the United Nations.\nSince last year we have witnessed the evolution of a new political atmosphere world-wide. There is an air of political optimism in all regions of the world. The thaw in the international climate is in large measure a result of the improved relations between the two super-Powers. The signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - last year, together with the follow-up summit in Moscow in June, has proved instrumental in acting as a catalyst to negotiations on a broad global agenda for resolving many regional problems. We note as a sign that the super-Powers are now willing to undertake co-operative action in the interests of peace. \nWhether it be in southern Africa, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Cyprus, Western Sahara or, Kampuchea, there is hope built around the conviction that the parties involved are now prepared to try the peaceful alternative, and that the super-Powers are willing not only to encourage them but also to make the political choice of guaranteeing that the peace will hold. We commend all those involved in the ongoing contacts and negotiations in all the regions. We wish to underline, however, the need to address the root causes of the problems. It would be an exercise in futility to address ourselves only to the symptoms of the diseases and gloss over the diseases themselves.\nPerhaps nowhere is such attention more called for than in southern Africa. While we are encouraged by the current contacts regarding the settlement of the Namibian question and the restoration of peace to Angola, we need to emphasize that these developments and contacts must serve as a curtain-raiser to an overall settlement in the region. They should not, therefore, be interpreted as a process of negotiating permanent arrangements for, coexistence with apartheid.\nThe genesis of conflict, war and general chaos in southern Africa is apartheid. The fact that, today, the apartheid regime has been forced to talk should not be taken as meaning that the South African Government has decided to abandon apartheid in South Africa or the politics of force against its neighbours. Rather, the apparent change of stance is a direct result of military defeats of its occupationist forces in Angola and the resulting political and economic pressures inside South Africa, and of the relentless pressure of external sanctions against the apartheid regime. The uprising by the black majority and some enlightened white elements, including those who now refuse to be drafted, has exerted combined pressure on the regime to abandon the war in Angola. This is the reality. We must remain vigilant and not fall prey to the apartheid propaganda or to that of the regime's allies and benefactors, which claim that it is on the road of reform. The regime remains racist; it remains aggressive. Its victims inside South Africa have seen no respite from its violence. Its victims in the neighbouring countries continue to suffer from acts of destabilization and outright military aggressions\nTanzania is deeply disturbed that the detractors of African freedom are seizing on the Current artificial atmosphere of movement in southern Africa to give solace to the apartheid regime and to undermine international political pressure against it. The situation in southern Africa represents the negation of our common humanity, which we seek to protect and foster by our subscription to the Charter and ideals of this Organization.\nThere can be no neutrality over apartheid, and we cannot leave the fight against it to the people of South Africa alone. The United Nations in particular must not just distance itself in pronouncements from apartheid; it must take concrete action to undermine it. It is equally important that it do everything possible to give encouragement to those inside South Africa struggling for the destruction of apartheid and victimized by its perpetrators. Now is the time to widen and deepen our reach into South Africa and to South Africans.\nFor this reason, my delegation is distressed at the prospect of the United Nations information system reducing its programmes targeted at the oppressed people of South Africa. It is the contention of my delegation that such curtailed programmes by the Department of Public Information, (DPI) on apartheid and on Namibia should not be implemented without the approval of the Assembly, which, in the first place, gave the mandate for the present DPI programmes on apartheid and Namibia. \nThat the apartheid regime is ready to talk to Angola and Mozambique and solicit the embrace of leaders of independent African States far from South Africa should not blind us to the reality that it continues to refuse to change its internal policies and to talk to the genuine leaders of the African majority in South Africa. Its peace overtures to Angola and Mozambique are not matched by similar overtures to its victims inside South Africa. Moreover, South Africa's aggression against its neighbours has not diminished. It follows, therefore, that if the regime wants to talk peace it should not talk peace only to Mozambique and Angola, but must seek fundamental peace with the black majority inside South Africa. Ito this end, it must repeal its apartheid laws, lift the state of emergency, end the ban on political parties and release Nelson Mandela and other political detainees, with whom it should discuss the future of a democratic, non-racial South Africa.\nSouth Africa's sudden enthusiasm for dialogue and negotiation should not induce an international relaxation of the various pressures mounted against that evil regime. Readiness to talk by the apartheid Government does not herald a conversion to civilized principle. The so-called new mood of the South African Government, therefore, calls for a stiffening of sanctions. The South African regime has exposed the hollow equivocation of those who, in their unbridled pursuit of profits, claimed the inefficacy of sanctions against South Africa.\nOnly last week the head of the apartheid regime expressed the hope that his latest diplomatic dissembling would serve to avert or blunt sanctions against South Africa. South Africa is saying that sanctions do work. It is the responsibility of the international community to make them work better. For this reason, my delegation calls on the Security Council to undertake a better enforcement of the arms and oil embargoes against South Africa and on, individual Governments to broaden, intensify ,and-make more effective the sanctions they have put in place nationally. There is no question but that comprehensive mandatory sanctions would be the quickest, most .effective and least hurtful pressure on South Africa, and my delegation renews its call on the Security Council to impose them.\nThe damage done to property and infrastructure in the countries neighbouring South Africa by its active pursuit of a policy of destabilization has been estimated at between 325 billion and 330 billion. Those countries need substantial assistance to rebuild their infrastructures and economies. A number of countries have been forthcoming in this regard, and I wish to place on record my delegation's appreciation of this support. It helps those countries to reduce their dependence on South Africa and to increase the isolation of the apartheid regime.\nBut assistance to the front-line States, necessary though it is, should not be made a substitute for practical measures to fight apartheid. There are those who in giving aid to the front-line and other neighbouring States portray that assistance as a substitute for involvement in the anti-apartheid struggle. We in the front-line States resent being used as an excuse for inaction and as an apology for policies of economic self-aggrandizement. A balanced policy to combat apartheid must combine measures directly aimed at its dismantlement in South Africa with measures aimed at alleviating the burden borne by the front-line and other neighbouring States. \nTanzania has followed with keen interest the various rounds of talks regarding the future of Namibia and the security of Angola. We welcome those talks, while regretting that South Africa did not give way sooner. The people of Namibia have been denied their independence for too long. \nThe uniqueness of the Namibian situation lies not only in the United Nations responsibility for the Territory, but also in the host of factors which have converged to complicate the situation. Namibia is a case of colonialism, institutionalized racism, economic plunder and military occupation. Namibia's freedom and independence continue to be made hostage to ill-conceived political judgements on the part of South Africa and the United States administration.\nAs we meet here, and even as the talks continue, South Africa continues to entrench the apartheid system Inside Namibia. There is evidence of stepped-up direct police and military action against the civilian population. Including indiscriminate detentions, imprisonment without trial, and even summary liquidation of those suspected of sympathizing with the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Even as talks about practical steps to Implement Security Council resolution 43S (1S78), embodying the plan for the independence of Namibia, continue. South Africa has not relented in its bid to assemble a coalition of internal surrogates, with a view to fraudulently denying SWAPO victory in the elections.\nEven as we nurture guarded optimism over the prospects of a Namibian settlement we should not be complacent. Agreement on Implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is still predicated on meeting many extortionist demands. Linkage is still in place and Namibia remains in colonial bondage. South Africa remains obdurate and its allies remain unwilling to prevail on it. The history of the negotiations reveals South Africa as a past master at prevarication and duplicity. It is not, 10 years since, resolution 435 (1978) was adopted. They have been years of raised expectations and frustrations, as the apartheid regime and its allies have constructed one impediment after another, with such a history of diversions, procrastination and retreats, we cannot pretend that all is well. \nWhatever the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, let me underline that Tanzania considers the talks as primarily aimed at negotiating modalities for implementing resolution 435 (1978) and guaranteeing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola against South African expansionism. We urge the Security Council, and in particular the United States, which is serving as broker for the talks, to ensure that South Africa does not seek to undermine those basic legal and internationally promulgated goals. We salute the gallant forces of the People's Republic of Angola and the internationalist Cuban forces, who have triumphed over the racist regime's occupationist forces and have decisively determined the source of the war, culminating in the defeat of the South African army of invasion in southern Angola.\nAs in southern Africa, there is optimism in other areas. We welcome the acceptance by Morocco of United Nations mediation in an effort to bring peace and settlement of the Western Sahara problem. We hope that the Secretary-General will be given all the necessary support in putting into place arrangements for implementing the United Nations formula for the self-determination and independence of the Sahraoui people. For this process to succeed, we urge the parties to the conflict to muster the necessary political will and enter into direct negotiations, as provided for in the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, Every effort must be made to ensure that the projected referendum in Western Sahara is, and is seen to be, an unqualified process of decolonization.\nIn the Middle East, we are outraged at the carnage being perpetrated by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian and Lebanese people, in contravention of Security Council resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention. Tanzania believes that, ultimately, the long-term interests of the region will be better served by political real ism on the part of all the parties concerned, a comprehensive and lasting peace can be ensured only by an unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Arab territories and recognition of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including the right to establish an independent State of their own. Equally, a secure peace must be built upon the inviolable right of all States in the region, including Israel, to live within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.\nIn expressing our unyielding solidarity with and support for the Palestinian people, we commend the role played by the Palestine Liberation Organization in guiding the struggle for freedom. The uprising, intifada, which has lasted for a year new, demonstrates once more that no price is too dear to pay for freedom and liberty. The situation remains explosive  it calls for urgent action. We endorse the call for an international conference on the Middle East, as we must insist that such a conference stands a better chance of securing peace for the region if only it recognizes the centrality of the Palestinian question in the overall Middle East problem. And, with this objective in view, the Palestine Liberation Organization must be allowed to play a key, definitive part in the Conference. \nTanzania welcomed the acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1988) and the cease-fire agreement between Iran and Iraq. We are gratified that a destructive war, which has claimed millions of lives and billions of dollars in property, is now finally being brought to an end. We commend the political courage of the leaders of both countries in agreeing to give a chance to a peaceful settlement of their dispute. By accepting a United Nations mediation role, the two countries have rekindled the spirit of the United Nations Charter and ushered in a new era of tolerance and, we hope, negotiations in the near future on permanent arrangements for peace and co-operation. We must urge them to remain committed to the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf. The road to reconciliation and economic reconstruction will not be easy. We urge perseverance and call upon the international community to assist in these efforts, especially in ensuring that the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (1\u04281\u041c0\u0421) discharges its responsibilities effectively.\nWe are encouraged by the resumption of the in intercommunal talks in Cyprus within the framework of the good offices of the Secretary-General, The continued division of that country and the mounting tension can only precipitate fratricidal conflict. We call upon the leaders of both the Turkish and the Greek communities to exercise restraint and assist the Secretary-General in his mediation efforts to bring about a lasting solution within the framework of the territorial integrity, independence and n on--aligned character of Cyprus.\nWe note that in Afghanistan the withdrawal of foreign troops has continued as scheduled. We hope that the same spirit will be demonstrated in the coming and more complex task of elaborating mechanisms for national reconciliation, national economic reconstruction and the restoration of peace, territorial integrity and the country's non-alignment. Ws urge the parties to the Geneva agreement, as well as the guarantors, to ensure that the agreement is implemented in its entirety and that permanent peace quickly returns to that country.\nThe Korean peninsula continues to be an area of simmering conflict. Occupation forces remain, yet 40 years of occupation have not diminished the fighting spirit and longing for unity of the Korean people. Tanzania calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the area and the promotion of a climate which will lead to the reunification of Korea.\nRegarding Kampuchea, my Government has been encouraged by the resumption of dialogue as evidenced by the recent Jakarta Informal Meeting. In commending the efforts of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), we call upon the different factions involved to place first \u00bfhe interests of their country and people and agree on a Government of national unity.\nThe problems of Central America continue to defy solution. Conditions in the region have continued to deteriorate as internal conflicts, foreign interference and aggression have increased. Indeed, despite sustained diplomatic efforts by the countries of the region and the international community, peace is not in sight; rather, we are witnessing the flame of hope lit by the signing of a cease-fire agreement in Nicaragua, and the understanding on a comprehensive peace settlement in the region early this year, flicker in the face of opposition by the United States Government. Naturally we share the anxiety and anguish of the Central American people for they have been unduly subjected to gratuitous suffering and deprivation for too long. In the search for peace it is imperative that the politics of force and threats of confrontation and war to abandoned. The countries of the region must seek solutions that take into account the real nature of their problems and reject prescriptions grafted from outside or imposed through economic pressure and military or other force. \nWe note positively that those countries, through the Contadora process and in particular the Guatemala peace plan, have recognized the importance of a regional approach to the problems of the region. By rejecting the ideological fixations which place the problems of the region in the arena of East-West confrontation and seeking instead solutions more in tune with their needs, those countries have taken a new direction towards a more stable and lasting peace. We commend the perseverance of all parties involved and call upon the international community to help these countries sustain the dialogue that has been initiated. In particular we call upon all those interested in the region to desist from actions which undermine the peace process and place its future in jeopardy.\nAs the world attempts to grapple with these regional problems, other problems of an economic and security nature have persisted, and while in some areas we have recorded encouraging signals the situation overall regains delicate.\nIn the field of armaments the world stands to record the highest military expenditures, at a time when the majority of the world population is threatened by economic problems, arising from a multitude of economic factors, a handful of countries are spending more than a trillion dollars on instruments of war alone.\nLast year the world was at one in welcoming the signing between the United States and the Soviet Union of a Treaty on the elimination of their intermediate-range and shorter-range nuclear forces - the INF Treat/. It did so because of the promise the Treaty held for the future. Insignificant as it was in terms of the numerical count of the warheads covered, the Treaty was applauded for Its political value. It was judged to be important in enabling the two super-Powers to cross an important psychological barrier. The Treaty demonstrated that, given political will, it is possible not only to halt the arms race but also, in a sense, to begin the process of reversing it. Given the optimism generated by the INF Treaty, much was expected of tee Moscow summit meeting. But despite what was obviously a favourable political climate It proved impossible to expand on the gains of the Washington summit meeting and agree on more concrete and substantial reductions. \u2116 note none the less that there was an expression of commitment want to a 50-per-cent reduction in strategic offensive systems and to the negotiation of a nuclear test-ban regime - even though on a phased approach, ,a urge the two super-Powers to take advantage of the current political warmth to negotiate deeper cuts and to broaden the scope of their negotiations to cover other areas.\nMy country, together with Argentina, Greece, India, Mexico and Sweden, continues to co-operate in the six-nation peace initiative. Our countries have united in a common belief that the non-nuclear-weapon States have a duty and a right to demand a halt to the arms race. We can no longer be satisfied by repeated promises, which have only moved the world closer to a nuclear war. In their Stockholm Declaration of January this year the leaders of the six countries reiterated their call for a comprehensive nuclear-test ban and the prohibition of the extension of the arms race into outer space.\nWe believe that verification has a central role to play in all disarmament agreements. In particular if such a role were entrusted to the United Nations it would enhance mutual confidence among the parties and encourage the exploration of expanded areas of agreement. The proposal of the Six for the establishment of an integrated multilateral verification body within the United Nations system remains. We hope that more countries will come around and accord it the necessary support.\nWhile there has been co-operation on the bilateral level we regret that the multilateral forum - namely the Conference on Disarmament - has been hamstrung. The paralysis now gripping the Conference, largely camouflaged behind the rule of consensus, has prevented the initiation of negotiations on crucial matters such as a comprehensive test ban and the prevention of the arms race in outer space. We must express our deep regret that despite public expressions of support some countries have steadily undermined the efficacy of the United Nations multilateral- negotiating forums on disarmament,\nTanzania believes that our pursuit of peace, is closely linked to the struggle for development. These two ideals, which are among the pillars of our political philosophy and foreign policy cannot be fruitfully pursued independently of each other. We need peace to develop, as we need development to preserve peace. That is why we continue to affirm that there is an organic link between disarmament and development.\t..\nIn June this year the General Assembly convened in a third special session devoted to disarmament. I need not labour the point that the failure of the session was the direct result of active Opposition on the one hand and permissive silence on the other by some developed countries. But the smokescreen of the so-called new realities cannot avail and procrastination simply multiplies the risks of an escalating arms race. Disarmament cannot be prescribed as the prerogative of a few countries, however powerful their arsenals. Certainly effective disarmament can be realized only by the participation and co-operation of the whole community of nations.\t\u00b7\t\nWe have in recent months witnessed the phenomenon of the dumping of nuclear and industrial toxic waste in the African continent. We deplore the callous action of those companies or individuals from the industrialized countries who have sought to turn Africa into a garbage dump for hazardous toxic and radioactive, wastes. It is morally wrong to take advantage of the economic weakness of the least developed countries, the majority of which are in Africa, and we call upon the international community, and in particular the International Atomic Energy Agency, to institute a regime of measures end norms to arrest this dangerous development not only in Africa but throughout the world. \nFrom Tanzania's standpoint, it is a matter of regret that the progress witnessed in the last few years on the diplomatic and political fronts has not been reflected in the world economic climate. This continues to be characterized by the imbalances and instabilities illustrated by growth in the industrial economies' and decline in the third-world economies. The sum result of these trends is the accelerated impoverishment of the third world. \nAfrica provides the starkest contrast. As the mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, 1986-1990 indicated, African countries are generally poorer today than they were two years ago. Their debts continue to rise as do the interest rates attendant upon them, commodity prices continue to fall and there is the incredible spectacle of a net outflow of resources from Africa.\nWe in Africa can no longer be faulted on the old grounds. As the Secretary-General's report has indicated, many African countries have embarked upon the necessary policy reforms and financial adjustments. We have bought all the prescriptions but our health has further deteriorated. \nThe facts and the logic are incontrovertible. The internal factors inexorably called for Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery. We believe the experiences of the last two years just as inexorably call for the tackling of the external factors. There is now a clear case for a global structural adjustment programme leading to a new international economic order - or whatever we may choose to call it. Third-world economic disenfranchisement cannot for long sustain first-world development. \nThere is yet opportunity to correct these imbalances and inequities. In addition to individual national adjustment programmes calling for external support; African countries have called for the holding of an international conference on African debt. The initiative of last June's economic summit on the debt of the poorest developing countries needs to be carried further. The Uruguay Round roust be negotiated with greater concern for the trading needs of the developing countries. Effective attendance at the debt conference and the Uruguay Round negotiations will produce solutions which will not only arrest the decline in the economic fortunes of the poor countries, but will also give a human face to the concept of international co-operation and interdependence.\nAttempts to monopolize the search for solutions of global and regional problems in the last few years have failed. This experience underscores all the more the centrality of the United Nations in world affairs, for it has reminded us that the United Nations offers a unique forum within which to evolve strategies for coexistence, accommodation and mutually beneficial co-operation. In this worthy and common enterprise Tanzania will continue to give its unqualified support to the United Nations and its agencies.\t'\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt is a pleasure, Sir, for my delegation to see you presiding over the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We are certain that with your experience in international affairs and your personal qualities you will lead and guide our work with skill and diplomacy. We congratulate you on your election and assure you of our fullest support and co-operation.\nOur thanks go also to His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin, who so ably guided the work of the forty-second session. \nThe year 1988 and the forty-third session of the General Assembly will probably go down as the most momentous in the history of the United Nations. Perhaps never since its founding has the Organization played such a dramatic role in conflict resolution, and that at a time when it faced the most acute financial crisis of its life. The Secretary-General and his staff deserve our highest praise for their tireless, painstaking efforts. We are confident that they will be rewarded even more for their work before the final gavel falls at the closure of the forty-third session in September next year.\nThe cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq on 20 August last after one of the longest wars of the century - and perhaps the bloodiest - brings relief to two embattled nations and their peoples. My delegation hopes that the peace process currently under way will lead to a lasting solution to the differences which separate those two proud nations. Peace between there will mean so much less turbulence in a region important to the economic and political stability of the world.\nAs is evident from the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq brought about through the patient mediation of the Secretary-General, the United Nations can play a major and positive role in conflict resolution. The cessation of hostilities in the Gulf war was not the first success of the initiatives undertaken by the Secretary-General within a period of a few months. Before that came the accord that led to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. Those developments prove that, irrespective of the numerous resolutions the General Assembly might adopt, there can be little hope of resolving conflicts without accompanying positive steps towards mediation. The intervention and good offices of a third party with no motive other than the promotion of international peace and security, appear to constitute an acceptable avenue. The United Nations, through the good offices of the Secretary-General, is the third party which, as has been proved, can play that vital role most effectively.\nMy delegation is confident that the best of intentions will continue to be displayed by both parties in the Iran-Iraq conflict during the peace negotiations and that they will soon establish the basis for a just and acceptable long-term solution to their differences. Likewise, we also hope that the parties to the Afghanistan accord will do nothing to jeopardize the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.\nLet us hope that progress towards peace in those two areas will impel the parties involved in conflicts elsewhere to accept the good offices of the Secretary-General to help resolve their differences. The signs are favourable in Namibia, Cyprus and Western Sahara. We urge all the parties concerned not to allow the opportunity to pass, but rather, using the Afghanistan and Iran-Iraq settlements as beacons, to add momentum to mankind's most cherished hope of a peaceful world. We are certain that the Secretary-General, who has an open mandate from all Member States to denote international peace and security, will be ever willing, ready and available to use his good offices in the cause of peace. \nFor small countries like my own, one way of demonstrating our commitment to the ideals of the United Nations is to contribute to peace-keeping operations. We are pleased to note that some countries which had withheld payments for many years are now meeting their commitments. Regrettably, a major contributor has become a defaulter. We urge all Member States not to cripple the Organization at a time when it is poised to make its most significant contribution to peace and security since its founding. Here I should like to reiterate that my country will continue to support the United Nations in all its peace-making and peace-keeping endeavours. We shall continue to contribute troops, as we do to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the United Nations Good Offices Mission for Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP) and to any other peace missions which might arise. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is a fitting tribute to the Organization and the various troop-contributing countries, including my own.\nThe events in Fiji last year which necessitated a review of our constitutional basis retrains a major preoccupation for us. We are grateful for the support which many countries have expressed for our efforts to devise a solution relevant to our circumstances. As those familiar with our part of the world will know, we are determined to pursue a course of action which will be fair and just to all our people.\nThe Interim Government has pursued two major objectives since it took office on 5 December 19\u03987. Those objectives are the reconstruction of the economy and the preparation of a new constitution. On 15 September 1988 the Interim Government released the eagerly awaited draft constitution, which contains guarantees for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, including protection of the right to life and personal liberty; protection from slavery and forced labour protection from inhuman treatment\u00b7, protection from deprivation of property\u00b7, protection for privacy of homes and other property, protection of freedom of conscience, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association and freedom of movement\u00b7, and protection from discrimination on the grounds of race or religion. It is envisaged that a consensus will emerge on the draft constitution, enabling the Interim Government to fulfil its promise to hold a general election within two years of taking office - that is before the end of 1969.\nFiji is a multiracial country, where all ethnic groups live in harmony without any systematic harassment. We will never institutionalise racism, as was alleged recently. At the same time it is vital that the needs and fears of the indigenous community be addressed if long-term peace and stability are to be assured. We need to take affirmative action as a matter of urgency to ensure that the indigenous community does not become an underprivileged minority in its own country.\nThe issue of decolonization still occupies a prominent place on the Assembly's agenda every year. There are now only a few colonial Territories left. We remain fully committed to the principle of self-determination for all the colonized peoples. The option of which choice to accept must be left to the people. Once they have made their decision the administering Power and the international community Rust respect their choice and assist in the implementation of their decision.\nAmong the few Non-Self-Governing Territories now remaining, none is of greater international concern than Namibia, which is being illegally occupied by the minority racist regime of South Africa. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) provides the basis for the just settlement of the Namibian question and we would like to see it implemented in its totality. The agreement reached last month is a positive and welcome sign and the international community must now use all its endeavours to give it momentum, so that the people of Namibia may be granted their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. The good offices of the Secretary-General may be vital in the pursuance and achievement of that goal.\nOn the opposite side of the world there is another people yearning for self-determination. There, too, we now see more hope than was evident a few months ago. My Government welcomes the positive measures that the new Government of France has adopted in its policy towards New Caledonia. The reopening of dialogue with the people of the Territory has resulted in the formulation of a timetable for a genuine act of self-determination.\nIt was with cognisance of those positive developments that my delegation, with the full support of other South Pacific Forum members, put forward a resolution on the question of New Caledonia which the Special Committee on decolonization adopted by consensus. That same resolution will come before the General Assembly. We believe it reflects the developments now taking place. It is positive and constructive in language and forward-looking in scope. We are confident that the General Assembly, taking note of the current situation in the Territory, will also adopt the resolution by consensus.\nThe reunification of the two Koreas remains the hope of the people of both those countries, ardently supported by much of the international community, but it can become a reality only given the determination of both parties to resolve outstanding difficulties. Until that happens my Government sees no reason why either erne should be denied its rightful place in this Organization. We support the admission of both North Korea and South Korea as full Members of the United Nations pending reunification. For the present, however, if one is unable or unwilling to take its seat, the other should not be penalized by being prevented from joining the Organization.\nWhile some positive developments give us reason to be hopeful, my Government once again voices its strong support for the Kampuchean people in their struggle to restore peace and stability to their war-torn country. The independence and territorial integrity of Kampuchea must be restored and this can coma about only through the withdrawal of all foreign forces. The people of Kampuchea have a rightful claim to peace and security. While problems and conflicts between countries can be resolved through mediation, nothing can restore dignity and equality to a people who are oppressed by a regime which is bigoted in its thinking and dogmatic in its policy. The minority regime in South Africa continues to fly in the face of international opinion and persists with its policy of apartheid\u0402 Regrettably, it is emboldened in pursuing its oppressive racist policy because some influential Member States lack the political will to apply appropriate pressure. If all Member States that strongly condemn and abhor the policy of apartheid had exerted consistent and firm pressure on the Botha regime, the oppression of the majority in South Africa would not have gone on for so long. If the international community continues to vacillate and not take effective measures against the apartheid regime, it must accept the responsibility when the volcano of suppression erupts. That day does not appear to be far away. Let us therefore act collectively and effectively so that bloodshed and violence can be avoided.\nThe easing of tensions and the resolution of regional conflicts has been given a greater impetus by the recent improvement of relations between the two super-Powers, leading to enhanced prospects of a more lasting peace through arras reduction. But much more remains to be achieved if the world is to be spared the scourge of another war. If the world is to be saved for succeeding generations, the elimination of nuclear weapons must remain our principal concern and steadfast goal. Until agreement can be readied on this score, however, we believe that the time has come to cease all nuclear testing. In this regard, my delegation condemns in the strongest possible terms the continued testing of nuclear devices in the South Pacific region, which, under the Treaty of Rarotonga, has been declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We urge Prance to respect that Treaty and desist from defiling our part of the world. We would go further and urge the three nuclear-weapon States - Britain  France and the United States - which have not yet done so to accept and sign the Protocols t, the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty.\nThe impact of the continuing international financial turmoil has a particularly devastating effect on the third world, and more so on island developing countries such as ray own. The vulnerability of such States means that when the world economy is healthy we are unable to take full advantage of the boom. But when conditions are difficult we suffer the greatest penalty. The escalating debt crisis, worsening of the terms of trade and rising protectionism will mean a grimmer future unless comprehensive steps are taken to cushion their impact on the developing world. Much is made of partnership between developed and developing, but this has to be reflected in more equitable policies and a greater willingness to share.\nThrough its numerous social and economic programmes the United Nations has given dignity and self-respect to millions of people in every corner of the world. Now it is embarked on a major task - to improve international peace and security. Yet the Organization is faced with a worsening financial crisis which today is more critical than it has ever been in its 43-year history. Every Member State has the right to criticize the Organization, to point out its shortcomings, to ask for reforms and greater cost-effectiveness. But no Member State should expect to be able to exercise that right when it does not honour its financial obligations.\nThe Organization continues to face a critical financial situation. Repeated requests by the Secretary-General for timely and full payment of assessed contributions continue to go unheeded, taking the Organization nearer to the brink of bankruptcy. We support and join the Secretary-General in his plea to all Member States to honour their financial obligations under the Charter. \nThe United Nations has long been accused of being ineffective. The events of the last few non the prove that when Member States show the will to support it the Organization can play an important role in helping to build a more peaceful and better world. Let us therefore give it the support it deserves. Let us make it an Organization to be proud of and one under whose aegis we can build a better world for our children.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation shares the confidence that the members of this body have placed in you. Let me assure you of my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of the high duties entrusted to you.\nMay I also take this opportunity to place on record my country's appreciation of a job well done by your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin.\nI have had the honour of addressing the General Assembly on two previous occasions in my capacity as Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea: on 10 October 1975, shortly after my country gained independence, and in 1983. I sun especially honoured to be able to represent Papua New Guinea as Foreign Minister at the forty-third session of the General Assembly, an occasion which marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nAs I stated on those two previous occasions, Papua New Guinea regards the United Nations as having a special role in working for the resolution of tensions and conflicts and for building a stranger framework for international co-operation based on mutual respect and understanding.\nPapua New Guinea remains committed to playing its part in contributing to this objective. As in previous years, the agenda for this session of the General Assembly is a complex one. Many pressing issues remain unresolved, and many uncertainties still exist in international relations, uncertainties which have a direct impact on the development processes of a great number of developing countries, including Papua New Guinea. But despite these uncertainties, there can still be some cause for hope and optimism. It can be said with a measure of confidence that a number of positive steps have been taken in tackling problems which are the subject of this session's attention.\nMy delegation highly commends the Secretary-General,\nMr, Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his unwavering efforts in upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter. We also commend the comprehensive report he has presented to the Assembly. It is especially pleasing to note the progress that is being made in respect of the situations concerning Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq conflict, Namibia, Kampuchea and Cyprus.\nBut his report also underlines other pressing issues, including disarmament, trade, finance and human rights, where more resolute international action is required. We remain convinced of the need for a strengthened United Nations system to play a central role in promoting peace and security and more equitable economic relations between developed and developing countries.\nOur own region in the South Pacific is comparatively free of major conflicts. Indeed, the region continues to enjoy peace and stability. But there are some changing trends and, unlike the past, more countries and organizations beyond the South Pacific are showing an interest in engaging actively with the region. The South Pacific is not immune from the effects of international tensions and many of the worrying trends in the world economy. Our region is one where in some parts colonialism has not been brought to an end, where in other parts nuclear activities continue to be conducted, despite strong protests from Governments of South Pacific nations, and one where there are growing tendencies for big-Power rivalry.\nThe South Pacific community is made up of many small island States scattered in a vast expanse of ocean, which depend on only a small number of agricultural and marine products for their livelihood and export income. I am pleased to be able to say that there have also been some positive trends in the South Pacific since the last session of the General Assembly.\nIn New Caledonia, constructive progress has been achieved by the French administration in re-establishing dialogue between different ethnic groups in the Territory. One year ago, my predecessor drew the Assembly's attention to the presence of a large number of French security personnel stationed in New Caledonia which, among other things, served to intimidate the Kanak people in their just struggle to seek independence from Prance.\nIn April this year, Papua New Guinea and other island nations were outraged by the merciless killing of 16 Kanaks by French security forces and the build-up of tension in the Territory. We are pleased that the Rachard administration has now set in train a process that will bring about positive changes for the better. The framework agreement concluded in Paris in August provides a basis on which the different communities in New Caledonia can work together in a spirit of reconciliation and understanding to achieve independence. But not all causes of tension have been removed. New Caledonia is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. The Assembly, therefore, has a responsibility to continue monitoring developments in New Caledonia. We also hope that the administering Power will live up to all its responsibilities and obligations as provided for in the Charter of the United Nations.\nPapua New Guinea has also closely followed developments in other Territories in the Pacific. In the case of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands, we believe that the people of those States have expressed their wishes on their political future. Political evolution in those States has been consistent with United Nations principles and practices. Papua New Guinea has therefore established full diplomatic relations with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands. We urge other Member States of the United Nations to do the same. We hope that the way will be clear for the people of Palau and the United States Administration to resolve outstanding matters affecting Palau's political future.\nPapua New Guinea is a full and active member of the South Pacific Forum, the major regional organization of the South Pacific. We continue to work with other member States of the South Pacific Forum in opposing nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear wastes in our region.\nThe South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty and the South Pacific Regional Environment Protection Convention are the two most important instruments established to safeguard the environment of our region. Papua New Guinea will shortly ratify both these Treaties. The decision by the Governments of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to ratify Protocols 2 and 3 of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty is a welcome development. We urge other nuclear Powers similarly to ratify the Protocols and to respect the operation of the Treaty in the South Pacific.\nAt a recent meeting of Heads of Government of South Pacific nations in September it was decided to put in place \u0430 number of new arrangements to facilitate more constructive dialogue and exchanges with other countries and organizations. A Forum institutional network has been created to bring together all regional bodies operating in the South Pacific for improved co-ordination and collaboration. Regular high-level consultations between the nations of the South Pacific and interested third countries are proposed to take place each year immediately following the annual meeting of Heads of Government. These arrangements are intended to draw greater international attention to the development needs and constraints of the island nations of the South Pacific to draw attention to our resource potential and to mobilize appropriate resources to contribute to economic development, self-reliance, capacity building and the social progress of our people. The entry into force in June this year of the multilateral fisheries arrangement between the Government of the United States and the Governments of Pacific islands nations has been an important step forward not only for the development of the region's principal resource - fisheries -- but also for the expansion of economic relations in our region. Papua New Guinea would welcome similar fishing arrangements with other major fishing nations. We urge the Government of Japan to continue the dialogue with island States with a view to concluding a multilateral fishing arrangement soon.\nThe South Pacific region is relatively unknown among the majority of the States Members of the United Nations, and to0 many United Nations agencies. The needs of the island communities in the South Pacific are great. The South Pacific Forum has taken important initiatives to encourage other nations and organizations to contribute to the development of our region in fields where they are able to assist. Other important regional initiatives are to follow, in arrangements dealing with trade, transport and telecommunications.\nRegional co-operation has been a corner-stone for the development of many United Nations programmes. We see a pressing need for many of the United Nations organs to be more sensitised and reoriented to the real needs and aspirations of the island nations of the Pacific.\nPapua New Guinea's interests extend beyond the South Pacific region. We seek to strengthen our ties with the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Our ties with ASEAN have steadily expanded in recent years. We continue to value our special observer status at the annual meetings of ASEAN foreign ministers. My Government is pleased also that the ASEAN nations have agreed to our request to be allowed to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Co-operation in South-East Asia. \nThe situation in Kampuchea continues to give cause for concern. My delegation notes with guarded optimism the developments and initiatives seen in the past 12 months relating to the Kampuchean problem. The informal talks held in Jakarta, Indonesia, by all the parties concerned with the Kampuchean issue ace a welcome development. My delegation believes that the Kampuchean problem will be resolved not only by the unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamese forces but also by the prevention of the return of the genocidal policies and practices of Pol Pot and the Khmer Ruge. Papua New Guinea commends the efforts of the ASEAN group of countries to resolve this outstanding problem of our region.\nThe situation of the Korean peninsula is also of concern to my Government. We appeal to the Governments of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to continue to seek ways whereby dialogue and reconciliation can prevail. My delegation notes favourably the recent initiatives contained in the July 1988 Declaration issued by the President of the Republic of Korea aimed at enhancing the prospects for reunification. We urge the Governments of both countries to reflect the wishes of their people, who earnestly hope for early reunification. My Government is of the view that the admission of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to the United Nations has the potential for opening up an additional avenue for dialogue. My Government associates itself with the growing number of Governments that wish to see North and South Korea join the United Nations.\nThe Iran-Iraq war represents one of the most unfortunate and saddest mobilizations of people in recent times. The unnecessarily prolonged conflict has cost so many lives and inflicted misery on so many persons. My delegation joins other delegations in welcoming the 20 August cease-fire. In that connection we commend the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar. The members of the Security Council have demonstrated the necessary political will to find an early solution to the Iran-Iraq war, and we commend them also. The leaders of Iran and Iraq owe it to their people to restore peace and harmony as soon as possible. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) provides a sound basis for the early resolution of the unfortunate conflict.\nRecent events in the Middle East call for nose efforts to be made to address the underlying causes of tension and conflict. My delegation believes that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland. Israel; too, has a right to exist within secure borders. Those two conditions are fundamental to any lasting solution to the problem.\nThe situation in Central America, especially in Nicaragua, deserves the understanding of the leaders of that region and those who are in a position to influence the outcome. We commend those leaders in that region who have demonstrated foresight and sensitivity to the problems in their midst. My delegation recognizes the value of the regional approach to the problems there.\nEvery year we have come to the General Assembly with expectations that some concrete measures would be taken in response to the problem of apartheid in South Africa. But, despite many resolutions by the United Nations, the problem still exists. My delegation believes that the option of mandatory sanctions against South Africa holds some prospects for success. We acknowledge that such a course of action, if adopted, could create economic hardship. But what other options are there? Economic hardship can be corrected over time, but left unattended apartheid will continue to create oppression and suffering.\nRecent signs that the people of Namibia could regain their freedom and sovereignty give us some hope. Papua New Guinea urges all parties that are in a position to bring about a favourable outcome to spare no effort to facilitate progress towards Namibia's long-awaited achievement of independence. \nWe in the Pacific are made up of mainly small States\u00b7, yet we are linked with the international community in many significant ways. Our environment may be less troubled than perhaps that of others, but we continue to be highly vulnerable to influences of the international environment.\nKeeping our region free of big-Power rivalry and of nuclear activities is an issue to which Papua New Guinea continues to attach considerable importance. The conclusion last December by the United States and the Soviet Union of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles is an important step forward in disarmament and arms control. But more can and should be done in this area by all those who possess nuclear weapons. Like other representatives who have addressed the Assembly, we believe there is a pressing need for further steps to be taken if effective disarmament, arms reduction and arms control ate to be achieved.\nAs I have sought to set forth earlier, vulnerability stems also from limited opportunities to promote economic development. Papua New Guinea attaches importance to international efforts aimed at dealing with the growing problems of trade protectionism, debt-servicing and the slow-down in financial transfers to developing countries. We have taken full account of the many comments that delegations have made in relation to the role and effectiveness of the United Nations at the present time. While the Organization has not been able to deal with all problems affecting the international community, there are positive signs that the United Nations machinery has been given a chance to work. Some momentum has developed in tackling a good number of problems for which solutions have been sought for a long time. Let us not waste this opportunity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like to begin by congratulating our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for the Nobel Peace Prise which has been awarded to the United Nations. Ho regard that lofty distinction as recognition of the noble task carried out by the troops in \\\"blue helmets\\\", but also, of course, as a gesture of appreciation for the heroic endeavours of the Secretary-General in defence of this Organisation, on behalf of peace and for the successes achieved within this last year.\nFrom 1981 to date, we have witnessed the emergence of an extremely powerful campaign against multilateralism, in general, and against the United Nations and the rule of law in international relations, in particular. Armed unilateralism has set aside the United Nations Charter and sought to have itself recognized as lord and master of the universe. Such is the extreme reached by the self-deification of the United States and the pretensions of its leaders,\nA loss of identity end delusions of grandeur are not unknown phenomena. Psychiatric hospitals are full of patients who believe they are Napoleon or Superman and demand to be treated accordingly. It is difficult to deal with such people; it is impossible to please them.\nNothing, however, can compare with the difficulty involved in dealing with a powerful State that believes itself to be God and requires all of us to burn incense at its altar and acknowledge its right - its non-existing right - to do whatever it may please regardless of all divine, ethical and legal precepts. We know what we are talking about, because we have experienced it directly. That is why we applaud the way our Secretary-General has succeeded in keeping the United Nations afloat amid the storm of economic pressure and campaigns to undermine the effectiveness of the Organisation. \nThe results achieved by the United Nations in promoting peace this year have finally forced these senseless circles to modify their attitude somewhat and to agree to face up to their economic obligations to the Organisation. We applaud this development as a victory for common sense. We should like to see this extend also to respect for the sacred principles of the Charter; otherwise, it would be futile to spend money to keep the Organisation alive. The Charter is the soul of the United Nations. The very reason for its existence lies in respect for the Charter and in making sure that others respect it.\nWe wish also to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of this important forty-third session of the General Assembly. As a representative of our Latin American and Caribbean region, as Foreign Minister of a country that belongs to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and to the Contadora Support Group, and as a tireless champion of international peace on both the political and economic fronts, you. Sir, are particularly well qualified to help us take the fullest possible advantage of the opportunities offered by the progress that has been made towards solving a number of regional conflicts and in negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nNicaragua has followed the development of this general debate most attentively. Manifest throughout the debate has been the optimism inspired by the new atmosphere of understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union, the most tangible evidence of which has been the agreement on the elimination of intermediate nuclear forces. Beyond any doubt, we share the belief that this understanding has had a positive effect on international relations. Nevertheless, the optimism and expectations created by this new age of detente should not make us lose sight of the very  rave problems that continue to confront mankind. As the Secretary-General acknowledges in his report on the work of the Organisation: \n\\\"The international situation is still, of course, marked by points of strain and danger, visible or lurking. Complacency about the resolution of complex problems that still face us is impermissible.\\\" fA/43/l. p. 2>\nThese new circumstances should be the starting point for a substantive change in international relations. We aspire to genuine international democracy, based on strict adherence to the principles and norms of the United Nations Charter, which is the only way to guarantee that just solutions will be found to the central problems of peace and development.\nIn pursuing this goal, the poor and the non-aligned countries must be more united than ever and must act judiciously and resolutely in terms of an agenda of our own making. The agenda for an international peace which can only be achieved through the development of peoples and the recognition of the sovereign and legal equality of all States.\nThe role of the United Nations is fundamental in the process of democratizing international relations. Here we must pay a tribute to the patience and determination shown by the Secretary-General, Javier Peres de Cuellar, who, over the years, has been able to cope with very serious difficulties and who, at this very moment, is playing an increasingly active and key role in the solution of a number of regional conflicts.\nAn essential ingredient in the strengthening of the United Nations Is an unflagging political will on the part of the permanent members of the Security Council as well. Genuine support, by which I mean the kind of support that is really needed to strengthen our Organization, is not the kind that arises from political propaganda interests of the moment, but the kind that comes from a profound conviction that the United Nations is the key to carrying forward the changes needed to guarantee peace. The pressing problems of disarmament cannot be resolved outside the framework of this Organisation. To prevent a nuclear catastrophe is a responsibility shared by us all. The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (the INF Treaty} signed by the United States and the Soviet Union is of tremendous importance, but we must not forget that it involves the elimination of only 4 per cent of current nuclear arsenals.\nBilateral negotiations between the two super-Powers should continue with a view to reducing strategic nuclear weapons and at no time should those talks be allowed to become an obstacle to multilateral negotiations. Unfortunately, this is what has been happening up to now. There are aspects of disarmament which are of vital importance to all States, such as the urgent need for a treaty on the comprehensive banning of nuclear testing, the prohibition of the production and use of chemical weapons, the prevention of the arms race in outer space and the reduction of conventional weapons. \nNor must the priority of nuclear disarmament be allowed to be an obstacle to progress in reducing conventional weapons. This is an area of the utmost interest to the developing countries. Reduction of the third world's military expenditure, which would help us to deal with the grave economic problems of the present time, nevertheless strict adherence to the principles and norms of international law and a climate in which hostility, force and intervention are replaced by respect for international pluralism, peaceful coexistence, co-operation and friendship among peoples.\t.\nThe main responsibility for disarmament in all its aspects continues to lie with the militarily significant Powers, which must reduce their military expenditure and increase the amount of their official development assistance. The idea of establishing a United Nations fund for disarmament and development remains valid. It is significant that the total debt of the developing world, which now exceeds $1 trillion, is equivalent to the current level of world-wide military spending. The outgoing capital transfers from Latin America and the Caribbean in 1987 amounted to 45 per cent of the defence spending of the United States and 66 per cent of its fiscal deficit. The price of financing, promoting and developing the arms race has been the poverty and hunger of our peoples.\nOne consequence of today's unjust economic order, the problem of debt, which affects the vast majority of the world's peoples, is today an insurmountable obstacle in the way of development. The starting-point for solving this problem is the recognition that our peoples have a right to development. Partial solutions by means of bilateral negotiations have been exhausted. The debt problem simply cannot be solved by means of more debt. Adjustment policies have been taken to their limit. The strategy of buying time and waiting for an economic miracle is not merely evasive but also suicidal. The consequences of a world-wide economic collapse would be suffered by all, debtors and creditors alike. Global solutions and consensus are therefore imperative.\nAn extremely important step in this direction is the decision recently taken in Caracas Venezuela by the countries that make up the Latin American Economic System (SELA) to hold the first Latin American conference on foreign debt next year. We believe that the conference should be held as soon as possible and that the participants should include representatives of other regions that also suffer the consequences of this grave problem.\nBut it is not enough to recognise the gravity of the debt problem and arrive at a just solution on the basis of recognising the shared responsibilities of debtor and creditor. The new international economic order must also become a reality. If it does not, little or nothing will be gained by resolving the debt problem temporarily, because problems are resolved not by addressing their effects but by attacking their causes.\nThe wealth of the few must not continue to grow in an unrestrained manner at the cost of the impoverishment of the vast majority. To the extent that we are capable of finding a just and comprehensive solution to this pressing problem we shall be laying the foundations for a reorganisation of the current system of world economic relations. A now international economic order continues to be one of our most important objectives and priorities, and the pragmatism called for by some should not be allowed to become a pretext for abandoning the struggle and irresponsibly giving way to the immoral logic of extreme mercantilism that today prevails. \nThe new momentum which the United Nations has acquired in solving various regional conflicts, represented by the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan, the developments concerning the independence of Namibia, the end of the war between Iran and Iraq, the dialogue in Cyprus, and the self-determination of Western Sahara, is to a great extent the result of the work undertaken by the Organisation and its Secretary-General on behalf of world peace. Although it is trying to take credit for these achievements, the credit certainly does not lie with the United States, the action of whose Government over the past eight years has been characterised by systematic blocking of this Organisation and its specialised agencies and the promotion of such theories as linkage, constructive engagement and low-intensity warfare, all invented to prolong the suffering of peoples and postpone the dawn of freedom.\nIf today we are witnessing a resurgence of the United Nations, it is precisely because this policy of overt and covert war against multilateralism has been defeated.\nIf today we can hope to see solutions to various regional conflicts, it is because throughout our resistance struggle we have succeeded in firmly defending our principles and have persevered in proposing solutions based on them.\nIf today it is possible to foresee the end of the hateful policy and practice of apartheid. which constitutes the most serious offence to the universal conscience of our time, it is thanks above all to the heroic struggle of the people of South Africa, as well as to international solidarity, first and foremost that of the front-line States, the heroic and disinterested assistance given by the Cuban people, backed by the entire Non-Aligned Movement, and the praiseworthy efforts of the United Nations. It is the admirable tenacity shown by individuals, peoples and institutions struggling for peace that will lead to recognition of the inalienable right\u00b7 of the Palestinian people, to the reunification of Korea, and to the liberation once and for all of Central America for, the age-old scourge of United States intervention.\nIn Central America peace efforts continue to be sabotaged It has not been possible to give full effect to the Esquipulas agreements, signed by the Central American Presidents on 7 August last year. One basic aspect of the agreements concerns the essential verification mechanism. Nicaragua has insisted that this mechanism take the form of a United Nations peace operation under the direction of the Secretary-General and with the participation of a group of countries which have already stated their willingness and desire to take an active part in this noble task of making peace and harmony a reality in our region. \nAs is well known to all, Honduras has been unwilling to sign a request together with all the Central American countries asking the Secretary-General to organise the verification mechanism. Here, the Honduras Foreign Minister made much o\u00a3 presenting an alternative proposal to that discussed in the context of Esquipulas II, but, as always, he has refused to engage in serious talks with a view to agreeing on the setting up of an instrument to ensure security on the border between Honduras and Nicaragua.\nWe have been repeating this to the point of exhaustion, and it is not worth spending much time on it here. The problems in Central America has a first name and last name, and they are the same namely United States intervention. When the United States stops making war on Nicaragua and stops involving its lackeys in that war, then the international situation in Central America will be immensely eased.\nWe have spoken of the need to establish genuine international democracy. The foundation for this democracy is principles and norms of a legal nature, compliance with which ensures international peace and security.\nIn the defence of its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity in the face of United States aggression, Nicaragua, in addition to its heroic military resistance, has given top priority to international law and justice.\nIn its historic ruling of 27 June 1S86, the International Court of Justice agreed with Nicaragua, claim and ordered the United States immediately to put an end to its sordid and immoral war and make reparation for the damages and losses inflicted on Nicaragua.\nThe fact that the Government of the United States refuses to comply with the Court's decision does not affect the validity of the verdict one jot. One of Nicaragua's guiding principles has been and continues to be the defence of international law. It is precisely for that reason that we favour universal acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the world Court.\nDuring the most recent ministerial-level conference of the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries, held in Cyprus, Nicaragua proposed that nest year, in the Hague, a special non-aligned ministerial meeting should be held on peace and international law. The proposal was approved by acclamation.\nThe celebration next year of the ninetieth anniversary of the first Peace Conference, held in the Hague, at which the first international accords on the peaceful settlement of disputes were reached, constitutes an ideal framework for such an undertaking. It is our desire, given the importance of the subject matter, that this meeting be open to the participation of all Members of the United Nations and States party to the Statutes of the International Court of Justice who wish to take part.\t. ,\nThe question of Nicaragua-and specifically the subject of the military and paramilitary activities organised, financed and directed by the United States against Nicaragua - is something that has occupied a central place in the awareness of all peoples of the earth over the last few years. In my travels throughout Africa, Asia and the South Pacific, as well as in Latin America, Europe and the United States itself, I have found that my small country has become a symbol of dignity and heroic resistance against those who seek to deny third world countries their rights to genuine self-determination and independence - the indispensable basis for the genuine democratisation desired by all peoples.\nAt the same time, we have witnessed the profound discredit into which the aggressor has fallen. In Latin America, the low prestige of the United States has reached bottom; some feel that it can no longer recover, or that at the very least a long time will have to pass before that prestige is regained. \n\nAll agree that the sordid, immoral and illegal policy against Nicaragua is the basic reason for this discredit. Secretary of State Shultz and a few of his Latin American friends may think otherwise, but that is another kettle of fish or perhaps another few hundred dollars. The facts tell another story.\nLatin America's sentiments were clearly manifested by the masses of people that Secretary of State Shultz and Vice-President Bush saw in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Brasilia, and recently Quito, places which were simultaneously visited by President Daniel Ortega. I do not think it is necessary here to repeat what those masses of people were shouting at Secretary Shultz, nor to state once again how warmly they greeted the Constitutional President of Nicaragua,\nDaniel Ortega Saavedra.\nHaving failed in its attempts at a military overthrow of the democratically elected Government of Nicaragua, the Reagan Administration has been involved in promoting different acts of provocation in order to test my Government's willingness to apply the law and thus run the risk of suffering official reprisals from the United States.\nThe Nandaime incident, which caused much hypocritical rending of garments, is only one of the latest examples of what is known today as the Melton Plan, named after the former United States Ambassador to Nicaragua responsible for its implementation.\nI think it is obvious to everyone here that no government worthy of the name can make the application of its laws subject to considerations of political expediency, and much less to forecasts as to how its enemies abroad, or the friends of its enemies, might choose to interpret its legal actions.\nIt is never proper to allow flagrant disregard of the law to pass with impunity. Nothing could be more damaging to the authority and credibility of a government. Nothing could be more effective in promoting anarchy and in inducing people to take justice into their own hands, than the demonstration of government weakness in the enforcement of the law.\nThe Reagan Administration is fully conscious of this fact, and its efforts are therefore aimed at causing an internal breakdown in the Nicaraguan Government as a result of inaction - inaction imposed on us by that Administration - in the face of domestic lawlessness.\nIn Nicaragua we have a popular Government, freely elected by the people, by means of one of the most exemplary electoral processes ever established in Latin America. We have laws. We have a Constitution. And those who choose to disregard those laws have to bear the consequences, even though they may seek to take cover under the official sponsorship of the United States for their criminal activities. \nIn the military struggle against the mercenary forces of the United States we were not intimidated - we have defeated them. Nor will we be intimidated by the ever-mounting political attacks and multi-million-dollar slander campaigns aimed at discrediting our nation. It is the United States that has seen fit to take fright and flee the impartial eye of the highest tribunal of justice in the world.\nWe will not be lectured to by a Government that lags far behind us in its own record on human rights and civil liberties, particularly in times of war. Neither, obviously, will we accept the shameless lectures of the Central American lackeys of that empire, who themselves have lost all credibility in the international community, especially in the United Nations, because of their disastrous record on human rights. For this reason, we shall not even bother to refute the unfounded accusations that were levelled against us here this morning by the Salvadoran Foreign Minister. Rather, we, for our part, will continue to oppose irrationality with reason, terrorism with law, intimidation with a guest for honest dialogue. \nWe shall continue to insist that the country that is host to the United Nations and to the Organisation of American States prove itself worthy of continuing to be the meeting-place of these organisations. This implies respect for the sovereign rights of member States and for the independence of the organizations.\nIn this connection, I just want to add that we reserve our right to take further action in respect of the improper denial of visas to members of the delegation that was to accompany President Ortega to this session of the General Assembly.\nWe believe in the United Nations and in the possibility of achieving international peace and security through the scrupulous observance of the norms and principles of its Charter. We believe also that it must be possible to reach an understanding with the United States and to normalise our bilateral relations with that country. We hope that, under the next United States Administration, that may be possible. Our banner is, and always will be, \\\"A homeland free, or let us die.\\\" We shall continue to defend the right of our people to live in peace only to have their inalienable right to self-determination and independence respected.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure that Mr. Dante Caputo has been elected President of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are all the more pleased to see\nas President a person who comes from a friendly country, Argentina, and from a\nsisterly continent, Latin America. His renowned wisdom and vast experience will\ncertainly enrich the performance of the General Assembly. We are confident that\nthe current session will constitute an important landmark on the path of\ninternational progress. By the same token, I wish to pay a tribute to his\npredecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, Deputy Foreign Minister of the friendly German\nDemocratic Republic, for his wise guidance of the proceedings of the forty-second\nsession and the third Special session devoted to disarmament.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries met in\nCyprus to review and assess developments in the international situation,\nparticularly the recent indications of the advent of a new era of detente between\nthe two super-Powers, a new era different from that which had prevailed in the\n1970s. This new era represents a more advanced phase towards positive peaceful\nco-existence. If allowed to maintain its momentum and to expand its scope, it\nwould create a favorable political climate conducive to general and complete\ndisarmament, both of nuclear weapons and of other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nSuch a new era could also be conducive to strengthening co-operation between\nthe approach towards the peaceful settlement of several international problems.\ncountries with different social and political regimes and to enhancing the\n\nThere are a number of indications which testify to the importance of this\nopportunities for their contribution to the world economy. It would further assist\nthe approach towards positive development, as is evident from the encouraging signs that several international and regional problems may be resolved. However, other problems are\nstill in abeyance. In the Middle East, the resolution of the Palestinian problem still faces\npersistent obstacles as a result of the intransigence of some parties and the\nrigidity of their positions. This state of affairs has led the Middle East region\nto lag behind other regions which have begun to proceed steadily towards just and\nlasting solutions.\n\nIn recent years the Palestine question has witnessed attempts to impose a\nfait accompli and to entrench the Israeli occupation. Nevertheless, the\nPalestinian uprising - the intifadah - has defied all forms of suppression and\ncoercion. The heroic Palestinian people, in their firm belief in their just cause,\nhave succeeded in imposing recognition of \\\"their existence and in gaining world-wide\nsupport for their legitimate national rights.\n\nThe Palestinian people have thus made it impossible to return to the\npre-uprising conditions. So the escalating acts of repression perpetrated by the\nIsraeli occupation forces are futile. These acts include expatriation,\nadministrative detention without trial, imprisonment, confiscation of property, the\nblowing up of houses, torture, the closing down of schools and universities and the\nfreezing of labour unions' activities. They further contravene the rules of\nI\ninternational law and the Geneva conventions and human rights. Such acts are\nstrongly condemned by Egypt, as they have been by the entire international community.\n\n\n\n\nThe decision of King Hussein of Jordan last July to sever legal and\nadministrative links with the West Bank was aimed at fostering the representative\nstatus of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in implementation of the\nprime responsibility for the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nBoth the Jordanian and the Palestinian parties have reiterated their\ndetermination and commitment to pursue their co-operation and intensify their\nconsultations. Such a decision is triggered by the exigencies of the situation and\nby the unity of their objective, namely, the ending of the Israeli occupation\nwithin the framework of a comprehensive, lasting and just settlement based on the\nnorms and principles of international legitimacy.\nGuided by this noble goal, Egypt has called for the convening of an\ninternational conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations. All parties concerned, includin9 the PLO, the sole, legitimate\nrepresentative of the Palestinian people, as well as the permanent members of the\nSecurity Council, are to participate at that conference, thus allowing direct\nnegotiations between the parties, with the aim of reaching a lasting settlement of\nthe Palestinian problem and putting an end to the regional tension in the Middle\nEast, which threatens international peace and security.\nInternational support for the convening of the international conference has\nundoubtedly become one of the basic tenets on which Arab and international\npolitical and diplomatic action to resolve the Palestinian problem is based. There\nis also a general international consensus on holding such a conference at the\nearliest possible time.\n\nIn this context, we welcome the United States approach based on the political\nrights of the Palestinian people and on the principle of \\\"land for peace\\\", both of\nwhich were reaffirmed in the initiative of the united States Secretary of state,\nMr. Shultz, in April 1988 and again at the tripartite meeting attended by\nPresident Reagan of the United States on the 26th of the current month. These\nprinciples conform to the provisions of the United Nations Charter and to the\nsecurity Council resolutions, foremost among which is resolution 242 (1967), which\nconfirms the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory\nthrough war. We believe that this principle is a sine qua non for the whole\nresolution and is central to ensuring its implementation and to the establishment\nof a comprehensive and lasting peace which would not entail a recurrence of the\ndispute in future.\nRefusal to face the facts, failure to admit the inherent nature of the\nconflict, persistent disregard of the Palestinian people and their legitimate\nrepresentatives and disregard of the national rights of those people, foremost\namong which is their right to self-determination - all these will keep this\nconflict unresolved and will lead to far-reaching consequences in the region. It\nis high time the various parties took historic and courageous decisions in order to\novercome the obstacles to peace. In this respect, I wish to welcome the statements\nof Palestinian officials at the highest level which emphasize the willingness of\nthe PLO to negotiate a peaceful and lasting solution of the Palestinian problem, as\nwell as the willingness for a mutual and simultaneous recognition of Israel. This\ndevelopment, which reflects a sound understanding of the situation and its\nexigencies, deserves every encouragement. I also wish to take this opportunity to\ncommend the peace-loving forces in Israel on their efforts for the achievement of a\nlasting and just settlement.\n\nIf our strategic goal, as I have mentioned, is to reach a lasting and just\nsettlement of the Palestinian problem, which would ensure security and stability in\nthe Middle East, we are equally aware that the introduction of nuclear weapons or\nthe threat of their introduction into the Middle East would create serious\nimbalances with grave consequences to security and stability in the region.\nTherefore we call on Israel once again from this rostrum to renounce the\nnuclear-weapon option, to accede to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and to subject all its nuclear facilities to the safeguard system of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. Such a decision would certainly boost\nconfidence and advance the drive towards peace.\nIn this regard, Egypt has been working persistently for the establishment of a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. We hope that this objective will be\nachieved at the earliest possible date.\nTurning to the situation in the Gulf, we observe that the Iraq-Iran conflict,\nafter eight years of war, has entered a new phase in which all parties recognize\nthat political settlement and serious negotiations are the only means of achieving\nsecurity and justice in that region.\n\nThe mere acceptance of security Council resolution 598 (1987) by the parties and the halt to military operations do not in themselves mean the end of conflict and the advent of peace. Rather, good faith and serious efforts are necessary requirements. \n\nWhile appreciating the efforts of the United Nations to bring about a peaceful settlement of this dispute, we express the hope that Iran will substantiate its good faith. It's appreciation of the exigencies of the present situation, as has already been demonstrated by Iraq, would accelerate efforts towards a just and honourable settlement of the dispute and an early establishment of peace and stability, thus allowing the States and peoples of the region to 1ive in peace and to harness their human and economic resources for reconstruction and development in\nthe interest of all peoples of the region.\n\n\nAs for the plight of the brotherly Lebanese people, the regional parties interfering in their affairs still refuse to admit that regional ambitions, the narrow political outlook and attempts by alien parties to impose control over\nLebanon will not achieve genuine peace for any party. Eventually it will be the\nLebanese people themselves who will pay the price and sustain the loss.\n\nwe appeal to all our brothers in Lebanon, irrespective of their creeds,\nconfessions or positions, to place the interest of the people and the unity,\nintegrity and security of their country above any other consideration.\nThe Situation in Afghanistan has passed through positive developments during\nthe present year. The United Nations and its secretary-General have played an\neffective role in bridging the gap between the viewpoints of the different parties,\nthus facilitating the signing of the Geneva Accords relating to the situation in\nAfghanistan. These Accords have moved the problem into a new and brighter\nperspective after all the untold suffering sustained by the valiant Afghan people\nwho had engaged in an historic struggle.\n\nIn this context we wish to welcome the Soviet decision to withdraw from\nAfghanistan and its declared intention of complying fully with this decision.\n\n\n\nHowever, these positive developments should not distract us from the fact that a\ngenuine and definitive solution to the problem of Afghanistan will not be forthcoming unless its people are enabled to choose their government freely and independently and unless its refugees are repatriated and a halt to foreign\nintervention is achieved.\n\nThe African continent has recently observed the silver jubilee of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which has been rich in accomplishments despite\nall the difficulties: Positive developments have recently taken place, giving a\nglimmer of hope that the heroic people of Namibia would soon be able to gain their\nindependence under the leadership of the South west Africa People's Organization\n(SWAPO), their sole, legitimate representative and that the territorial integrity\nof Angola would be preserved and respected.\n\nWe wish to reiterate our support for the heroic people of South Africa under\nthe leadership of their national liberation movements and their leader,\nNelson Mandela. We also call on the international community to continue shouldering its responsibilities for eliminating the abominable policy of apartheid.\nAs regards north-west Africa, we welcome the developments towards peace on the\nquestion of western Sahara in the past few weeks. We believe that the proposals of\nthe Secretary-General and his constructive efforts towards a settlement - so long\nas they are accepted by the parties - represent a great advance. We look forward\nto the implementation of those proposals and to the achievement of further progress\ntowards the resolution of this question, which has long been causing concern for\nthe international community, the Arab world and the African countries.\n\n\nAt the same time, a number of other regional problems have been benefiting from this positive climate. The problem of Kampuchea is witnessing genuine endeavours to achieve its independence and territorial integrity and sovereignty as well as a just solution that would ensure self-determination for its people, free from foreign intervention.\n\nThere is also a forward movement on the issue of Cyprus under the aegis of the united Nations. This positive development leads us to look forward to a future in which agreement is reached on preserving the unity and territorial integrity of\nCyprus within a federal non-aligned state, where all people and all communities\nenjoy equal rights. We hope that the emerging dialogue between the President of\nCyprus and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community will constitute a positive\nstep in that direction.\n\nWe also hope that the prevailing spirit of settlement will include the Korean\nproblem in accordance with the des ire of the Korean people for the unification of\nthe Korean peninsula.\nThe recent positive developments in respect of a number of regional problems\nhave demonstrated that the United Nations can play an important and efficient role\nin the settlement of regional disputes if enabled to do so. We therefore appeal to\nMember States to help extricate this Organization from its financial crisis so that\nit may be able to continue assuming its role as an effective tool for the\nrealization of justice, solidarity and peace in accordance with the provisions of\nits Charter. I am pleased to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate the\nunited Nations on the occasion of the conferring of the Nobel Peace Prize on the\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations in recognition of the growing and effective\nrole of those operations in various parts of the world.\n\nSince the international community has expressed satisfaction at the increasing\nrole of the United Nations in the settlement of regional problems, it is necessary to emphasize once again that that role emanates from one of the fundamental principles of its Charter, namely, the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes. This principle is one of the most firmly established methods for the establishment of peace. The extent of commitment to this principle reflects the level of international maturity in the practice and organization of relations between States through breaking stalemates and seeking solutions to such disputes.\n\nIn this regard I wish to refer particularly to the agreement between Egypt and\nIsrael on 11 September 1986 to resort to international obligatory arbitration in\norder to resolve the dispute that came up regarding some international boundary\nposts between Egypt and Palestine - under the Mandate - in what came to be known as\nthe Taba problem.. The two par ties had agreed on the terms of arbitration in\naccordance with the provisions of the Charter, in particular Article 33, which\nurges the par ties to a dispute to seek its resolution through one of the methods\nmentioned therein.\n\nThus, the ruling by the international arbitration panel in Geneva on the Taba problem on 29 September 1988 - that is, yesterday - encourages resort to the principles of international law and commitment to the noble principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We are gratified that the ruling of the arbitration panel has confirmed that Taba is an Egyptian territory that falls under Egyptian sovereignty and that the legal and historical documents and evidence provided by Egypt have been proved authentic. I am confident that speedy implementation, in good faith, of that ruling would lead to results that would transcend the disputed\nissue and improve the political climate in the region, thereby facilitating more\npositive developments.\nAs we approach the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights it behooves us to recall that Egypt has been at the forefront in signing or\nacceding to most international conventions and instruments relating to human rights\nand in honouring the obligations arising there from. This attitude echoes our conviction that the human being is the target of peace, stability and development,\nwhich cannot be attained without his efforts and which enhance his feeling of\ndignity and his sense of freedom.\nEgypt also attaches great importance to the issues of childhood and maternity\nand has therefore set up the National Council for Childhood and Maternity, which\nwill hold a national congress at Alexandria in November 1988 in collaboration with\nthe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and a number of its regional offices.\nA number of Egyptians and others involved in the various aspects of child medical\ncare and legal protection will participate in that congress, so that the widest\nsupport of public opinion may be mustered for the draft United Nations convention\non the rights of the child.\n\nI should like to refer here to the establishment of the Arab Council for Childhood and Development, which makes every effort to create better conditions for the bringing up of Arab children and to develop methods of control over the implementation of laws relating to children in the Arab world. Egypt has been elected vice-president of that Council. Egypt calls for the early preparation of the international convention on the rights of the child so that it may be adopted next year on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child.\n\nReferring to social development, I must express our appreciation of the\nconstructive contribution of the united Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in\nthe field of cultural development and the preservation of the ancient historical\nheritage of Egypt, in particular the revival of the library of Alexandria as an\nEgyptian and international cultural edifice.\n\nThe current world economic situation remains a source of deep concern, in view\nof the difficult conditions through which most countries are passing. However,\nbecause of their special conditions, the effects of that situation have been more\nadverse to and painful for the developing countries. The increasing debt and\ndebt-service burdens and the unfavourable external and internal conditions\nresulting from the decline in commodity prices, together with the burdens of\ntackling problems of underdevelopment, have led many developing countries to cut\ntheir imports and suspend some development programmes. Consequently, living\nstandards have deteriorated and austerity measures have had to be adopted, with\nincreasing social and economic risks and consequences that threaten social and\npolitical stability in most of those countries.\n\n\nI wish to refer in particular to the critical economic situation in Africa.\nThe impact of the adverse international economic environment on the efforts of African countries to achieve economic recovery and development has been\nshattering. African countries have made tremendous efforts to implement the United\nNations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development\n1986-1990. Despite those efforts the economic situation has not appreciably\nimproved, for reasons beyond Africa's control.\n\n\nIn view of the internationalization of economic life, the interrelation of\ninterests and the increasing interdependence of the countries of the world, both\nrich and poor, economic issues and the problems of the developing countries make it\nnecessary for the industrialized countries to view the problems of developing\ncountries from a different perspective. Such perspective should be based on the\nconcept of mutual interests, equity and collective responsibility, thus allowing\nfor a healthy development of economic relations in the interest of all parties.\nThe destiny of the future world will be a common one: progress for all\nretrogression for all. There is a dire need for all countries to engage in serious\nand comprehensive negotiations aimed at improving world economic conditions.\nSerious dialogue through multilateral co-operation has proved its usefulness, and\nthe results of the seventh session of the united Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) testify to that.\n\nIn this connection, the Egyptian delegation to the second regular session of\nthe Economic and Social Council last July took the initiative of calling for the\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly to be devoted to discussion\nof the world economic and social situation and the means of promoting development\nand international economic co-operation. The formulation of a coordinated plan of\naction for the international community in the 1990s aimed at resolving the\neconomic and social problems facing the peoples of the world is needed.\n\nPower is not the best means of establishing peace and security. The best\nmeans is, rather, removal of the motives that lead to war, the supremacy of\npolitical rationality; making peace a life-style for our peoples.\n\nFor this reason we should step up our support for the United Nations to enable\nit to increase its positive contributions. We should act together in solidarity\nand shared responsibility - Politically, economically and socially - so that we can\ncome closer to a more humanitarian world that would instill in mankind faith in\nitself and its creative power to forge a better future and a brighter tomorrow.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this forty-third session of the General Assembly. I say, with the benefit of my personal acquaintance with you, that it is an honour that you truly deserve. This Assembly is in good hands as it begins to tackle the work on its agenda. \nThis forty-third session of the General Assembly carries more than the usual sense of occasion. I am not alone in detecting here a feeling of purpose and o  achievement that has not always been evident in recent years. I take great satisfaction in being able to address the Assembly at a time when the standing of the United Nations is higher than it has been for some time. Even the fountain works. The mood has changed distinctly since the fortieth commemorative session, because, despite the difficulties and uncertainties it has faced, the Organization has pursued its diverse agenda while tackling a major programme of administrative reform. The record in recent times has been one of solid achievement.\nThe changing international climate has helped this process. In this Hall on Monday, President Reagan in his valedictory address spoke to us of his satisfaction at the movement towards a more constructive relationship between his country and the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Shevardnadze pursued the same theme. In certain regions of the world there has been welcome progress in resolving conflicts that had been festering for some time\u201e Many of the signs are favourable.\nThat will be a matter of particular satisfaction to the smaller members of the international community, including my own country. We have always attached importance to the principle that the collective effort of that community should above all be applied to the task of keeping the peace. That was the central purpose of those who founded the Organization. Today it remains a goal of no less importance. Thus far 1988 has been a year of significant peacemaking, from which the world can take heart and upon which it can build. As one who stood here to address the fortieth anniversary session, I am pleased that we are now seeing renewed recognition of the value of the role and achievements of the United Nations.\nRecent developments have highlighted the continuing value of this Organization's efforts in the settlement of international conflict. The accords reached on Afghanistan and the cease-fire in the devastating Gulf War required the co-operation of those directly involved. But a particular tribute must go to the dedication of the Secretary-General. The people who ate saved from further threat or have the hope of peace are indebted to his patience, skill, perseverance and unquenchable optimism. We welcome the role he has played.\nThere are other situations that still need the resources the United Nations can offer by way of mediation or assistance with peacemaking. Western Sahara, Namibia, Cyprus and Cambodia are all affected by unresolved conflicts. But even here the auguries are promising.\nIn this age regional tensions cannot be isolated from the mainstream of international life. There are dangers for all of us in conflict wherever it occurs. It follows that we share a responsibility to do all that we can to eliminate the conditions in which conflict breeds and to restore the peace if it is broken. At times the principle of collective security has commanded more support than the practice. I hope the success of current peace-keeping efforts under United Nations auspices will reinvigorate the principle of collective security and lead to its wider application.\nMy Government pledged last year to expand our practical contribution to the United Nations peace-keeping efforts. I am pleased that we have been able to give effect to that undertaking. Our existing commitment to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization has been maintained. In the past month we were pleased to be able to respond to the Secretary-General's request for a contribution to the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG). A contingent of New Zealand army officers was deployed to UNIIMOG following the cease-fire. Earlier this week a Royal New Zealand Air Force Andover transport aircraft with flight crews and maintenance personnel left New Zealand to become an important national contribution to UNIIMOG's air capacity. We stand ready to assist in a practical way if, as we hope, solutions are found to other long-standing conflicts.\nI have already welcomed the signing of the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan. Noteworthy as they were, the Accords did not put a final end to the conflict in Afghanistan nor did they bring into being a fully representative government enjoying the confidence of the people of Afghanistan. New Zealand hopes that the withdrawal of the remaining Soviet forces will be accompanied by real progress in addressing those unresolved problems. As Mr. Shevardnadze said:\n\\\"The Geneva Accords\\\" [should be] \\\"the first step in a chain reaction leading to a healthier world.\\\" (A/43/PV.6, p. 66)\nThe values of tolerance and respect for the dignity and worth of human beings can be seen by us all in the current Olympic Games. They are a sign of that healthier world and we congratulate the Republic of Korea on its role as host. But it is a matter for regret that divisiveness has persisted on the Korean peninsula for so long. We look for an easing of tensions and an improvement in relations between the Koreas.\nCambodia, too, has been a tragic source of international tension for many years. That impasse has come to seem rather less intractable during 1988. In each of the past nine years, this Assembly has rightly emphasized Vietnam's violation of the Charter of the United Nations by its invasion and occupation of Cambodia. That remains a fundamental issue.\nBut we must insist also on a settlement there which will prevent a return to power by the Khmer Rouge. The international community was slow to accept the evidence of genocide committed by the Pol Pot Government and we have had to deal with the consequences ever since. We have a responsibility to ensure that such atrocities are never again committed against the peoples of Cambodia. \nHarrowing images of mass persecution, unfortunately not confined to a single country or continent, remain fresh in our memories as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Much has nevertheless been achieved in the intervening years. But it cannot be denied that gross and massive abuses of human rights continue.\nThe problem of human rights is more and more the focus of the attention of the Members of the United Nations. All of us are bound to speak up and, if we do not, we bear a responsibility for continuing and future evils. The authority of this Organization as it deals with human rights must rest on a commitment by all to objectivity. South Africa's system of apartheid is an abuse in a category of its own. Events of the last year have shown the South African Government clinging tenaciously to its course, in spite of the international community's abhorrence of its apartheid policies.\nIt has so far spurned all the voices of reason and moderation. Nelson Mandela, the most respected leader in South Africa, remains incarcerated. The Sharpeville Six are still under sentence of death. The intercessions of the Security Council have been ignored. The country lives in a continuing state of emergency; it experiences increasing repression. The South African response to protests from neighbouring States is to make repeated terrorist attacks on them and to undermine their economic stability - all totally unacceptable.\nNew Zealand has implemented wide-ranging sanctions against South Africa. We believe that such sanctions are an effective means of changing the attitude of the white minority. New Zealand is ready to implement further measures. Our goal is non-violent progress to a non-racial, democratic and just society in South Africa.\nThere has been an encouraging movement recently towards peace in Angola. In Namibia, the United Nations has faced an enormous task. At last \u03b1 settlement there appears tantalizingly close. We trust that Namibia's independence can be secured peacefully and soon in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). That would present a further major achievement in the work of the United Nations on decolonization.\nOn the initiative of the seven South Pacific member countries of the United Nations, New Caledonia was re-inscribed in 1986 on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, thus invoking a United Nations responsibility for the future of the progress of the Territory to self-determination. The tragic events at Ouvea in New Caledonia earlier this year demonstrated the consequences of ignoring United Nations principles and also the aspirations of a major communal group. New Zealand therefore welcomed the decision in June by the new Prime Minister of France and the leaders of the loyalist and independence movements in New Caledonia to move together on a plan for political development. That plan rightly takes account of the interests of all genuine New Caledonians.\nThat development was recognized last month by the Special Committee on Decolonization in a resolution which was adopted by consensus and has since been endorsed by the South Pacific Forum at its annual meeting last week. No one should underestimate the difficulties that may lie ahead, but everything is looking better. We look forward to a free and genuine act of self-determination in New Caledonia which is consistent with United Nations principles and leads to a settlement safeguarding the rights of all New Caledonians, including the indigenous Kanak people. \nSome argue that while the United Nations has a vital role in dealing with regional issues of the kind I have mentioned, the scope for its involvement in the balance between the super-Powers is a limited one. I do not accept that. We have seen how the super-Powers inevitably become involved in the troubles of the world's regions. Equally, issues of disarmament - including those which vitally involve the super-Powers cannot be considered as anything but questions involving all members of the international community for we are all affected, by choice or otherwise.\nThe issue of nuclear disarmament has taken on new urgency. Nuclear weapons technology no longer remains the exclusive preserve of the five permanent Members of the Security Council. The capacity to build a nuclear weapon is now possessed by a larger number of countries, and soon even more will have it. There are indications that some of those countries have nuclear ambitions. Whatever their motivation, such ambitions have to be curtailed.\nThere is a real risk here. Regional conflicts, and their tendency to attract external intervention, are dangerous enough as it is. But the prospect of nuclear weapons being deployed in such situations must now be taken into account. In that event, the dangers we would all face would be appalling.\nThis is an added reason why the efforts of the United States and the Soviet Union to agree on further reductions in their nuclear arsenals are so important. What prospect is there of blocking the spread of nuclear weapons if these two nations cannot stop their relentless drive to develop and deploy new nuclear weaponry? In the course of last year's general debate, New Zealand applauded the United States and the Soviet Union for their decision to eliminate their land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The resulting treaty is now for the first time leading to a real reduction in the world's stock of nuclear weapons. With an agreement in the strategic arms reduction talks, the super-Powers would truly have shown the way to the other nuclear weapons States and those which have nuclear ambitions. It is not too much to hope that a corner would be turned and the threat of vertical and horizontal proliferation would no longer hang over us all. \nNew Zealand believes that achieving reductions and balances in conventional forces will be central, in the search for nuclear disarmament, to the nuclear-free world seen by President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev at Reykjavik. In Europe and many other parts of the globe the accumulation of conventional forces, often without regard to actual defensive requirements, has heightened tensions and led some to look for other mote dangerous means of deterring aggression; so the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament must take place in step, and must involve all States.\nYet, at the third United Nations special session devoted to disarmament, when we had an opportunity to set up a multilateral disarmament agenda to take us up to the beginning of the next century, we could not take advantage of it. But our failure then does not mean it cannot be done. Instead we have the task now, beginning at this session of the Assembly, to pick up where the special session left off.\nRather than confess disappointment at the special session's results, or conclude that the job is too difficult, we must try all the harder to broaden the areas of international agreement. The search for consensus on the prevention of an arms race in outer space must go on. The campaign must continue unabated to convince those few remaining States which yet doubt it that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is an essential measure to end the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nThe world community must at last bring to conclusion the negotiations on a comprehensive chemical-weapons convention. The Secretary-General has been called on time and time again to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use. He should never again have to issue a finding confirming such a charge. These hideous weapons must be outlawed once and for all, so that the world will never again be a horrified witness to chemical warfare. The main elements of a multilateral agreement have now been elaborated by the Conference on Disarmament. It is time to finish the job.\nNew Zealand has taken substantial disarmament initiatives. We are proud to have been part of the regional drive to create the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone, a significant multilateral arms-control measure.\nThe Treaty of Rarotonga makes a decisive contribution to the stability of the region. The majority of South Pacific Forum members have become parties to the agreement. Two of the nuclear Powers, the Soviet Union and China, have ratified the protocols to the Treaty. We look to the other nuclear Powers to do the same. The Treaty covers a wide area of the region, bordering the Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone to the east, and the demilitarised Antarctica to the south. We support ongoing co-operation with the Latin American patties to the Treaty of Tlatelolco so that we can each benefit from our mutual experience.\nFor nearly 30 years the Antarctic Treaty and its associated instruments have provided the framework for effective and peaceful co-operation in Antarctica, keeping that vast area free of all military activities. The Treaty, which is open to all States, has been the basis for a unique programme of scientific research and for the adoption of measures to protect the fragile environment.\nA further element was added to the treaty system with the adoption in June this year of the Convention on the regulation of Antarctic mineral resource activities. New Zealand was pleased to host the final session of the negotiation. The Convention provides a strong mechanism for protecting the Antarctic environment if mineral resource activities ever take place. It is a significant strengthening of international co-operation under the Antarctic Treaty. A peaceful Antarctica is of the highest importance for New Zealand. We look for a consensus at this session of the Assembly to preserve the Antarctic Treaty. New Zealand is strongly opposed to any efforts to undermine it.\nThe world economy offers us little cause for satisfaction or confidence. Trade growth is uncertain. The economic difficulties facing many developing countries seem almost intractable. Indebtedness and underdevelopment are threats to global economic stability. Much is at stake for developed and developing countries alike in the present round of multilateral trade negotiations. New Zealand calls on all member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to go to the forthcoming mid-term review in Montreal in a positive mood, determined to achieve real progress.\nNew Zealand places special important on achieving from the Uruguay Round a liberalization of world agricultural trade and the elimination of domestic and international policies which distort such trade. There would be no better single way of solving the menacing problems of indebtedness and underdevelopment of which I have spoken.\nThere have been significant moves recently towards regional free-trade areas, including an agreement between New Zealand and Australia to establish a single trans-Tasman market by 1990. It is vital, however, that the international community should continue at the same time to move along the road to an open, market-oriented, multilateral trading system. We must look for strong leadership here from the major economies, which have a special responsibility to apply, fairly and across the board, the principles of comparative advantage and fair competition. Smaller countries like my own, dependent on primary production, require the reassurance that we will not continue to be subjected unreasonably to artificial restraints on trade. \nIt is a paradox that the United Nations is demonstrating renewed vitality and relevance at a time when it faces major financial uncertainties. It is unacceptable that Member States should fail to carry out their legal obligations to contribute their assessed financial dues in good time.\nWe must recognize, nevertheless, that constraints on available resources are likely to remain while at the same time the demands upon the Organization continue to grow. Accordingly, there is no choice but to maintain the worthwhile progress already achieved towards administrative reform; otherwise, the Organization will be incapable of meeting the critical challenges as they arise.\nI speak here as the representative of the Fourth New Zealand Labour Government. The First New Zealand Labour Government, and its Prime Minister Mr. Peter Fraser, played a deeply committed role in the discussions leading to the adoption of the Charter in 1945. New Zealand's hopes of those early days have been exceeded by some of the Organization's achievements - in its economic and social work, for example, and in its human rights and decolonization activities. By contrast, our high hopes for the United Nations peace-making and disarmament roles have yet to be fully realized, but we are optimistic that the log-jam has started to move in those areas.\nNew Zealand continues to set high store on the work of the United Nations - particularly in its tasks of promoting world peace, preserving the global environment, combating world hunger, removing racial discrimination everywhere and creating equal opportunities for men and women throughout the world. We are determined to maintain New Zealand's strong support in the years ahead.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with great satisfaction that we welcomed the election of Mr, Caputo to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. We are convinced that his professional experience and sound political and diplomatic sense will bring success to our work. Through his august person, it is to today's Argentina that we now convey the sentiments of brotherhood and friendship of our people which, from the other side of the Atlantic, has followed with renewed sympathy and confidence the democratic progress of the peoples of Latin America.\nTo Mr. Caputo's predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, we wish to offer our gratitude and appreciation for the excellent work he did as President during his term of office at the forty-second session. \nI also wish to congratulate Secretary-General Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for his praiseworthy efforts to find peaceful solutions to the many problems which affect the functioning of this Organization, and in particular his fruitful diplomacy in the quest for peaceful solutions to regional conflicts.\nYear after year the Republic of Cape Verde has intervened in the general debate of this Assembly to state its position on the major problems of concern to mankind.\nProm disarmament to decolonization, from international peace and security to the fight against desertification, my country has always joined its voice to those of the majority of the members of this Assembly, sharing their concerns and their ideas, and making suggestions and proposals to solve these problems.\nToday, we should like to concentrate on some questions which in our opinion merit special attention from the United Nations at this historic phase in international affairs, a time when profound changes are occurring in the world, in the life of the Organization, in the international economic situation and the peace process in southern Africa.\nThe world is witnessing changes of fundamental importance in various fields of international affairs. At the threshold of the year 2000, the major challenge facing mankind is its ability to steer these changes in such a way as to ensure the perpetuation of life, peace, development, justice and progress for all.\nIn the economic sphere, the changes in recent decades which are characterized by the emergence of new poles of development have taken the form of a dynamics capable of leading to a recasting of the economic international system and the withdrawal of the most pronounced aspects of the bipolarization of the world that has characterized post-war international relations. \nSuch a change in international economic affairs causes profound alterations in the orientation of political regimes in many parts of the world, both domestically and internationally.\nThe mounting interdependence of international economic relations is another important aspect of current changes that derive basically from economic needs which, in combination with the development of new technology, also make it essential for there to be mutual understanding of the interests of all countries and systems at the economic as well as political and social levels.\nCurrent developments requite that the results of negotiations in the various international multilateral forums take account of the new realities, for these cannot be steered towards a positive evolution except through the real democratization of those relations and the advent of a new international economic order. The tendencies which can now be observed towards a multipolarization of the world in the economic field and the parallel aggravation of the crisis in the international economic system have had a direct impact on the conduct of the various economic partners. If, on the one hand, such a situation leads to protectionism and other similar phenomena, on the other it stimulates new experiments in North-South and South-South co-operation.  In the political sphere, we are also witnessing important changes. The resumption of dialogue and the intensification of co-operation between the two greatest Powers constitute an important axis for those changes.\nThe summit meetings between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States of America, and the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (the INF Treaty), are decisive contributions to the establishment of an atmosphere of detente in international relations, introducing as they do an element of rationalization, which is contrary to interventionism and could lead to the strengthening of the principle of the non-use of force in the settlement of disputes. The INF Treaty is a major step in disarmament and we believe that other important steps in the nuclear field should also be taken in order to eliminate from the face of the Earth the danger of a holocaust. We are convinced that both the United States of America and the Soviet Union are determined to bring about the full realization of this grand ideal and that they will be able to refrain from placing in space what they have decided to eliminate on Earth.\nAware that this Agreement concerns only a tiny part of existing nuclear arsenals, but with confidence in the dynamic that has been set in motion and the political will underlying it, we believe that the international community should not be excluded from this dynamic. On the contrary, it should encourage the two great Powers to redouble their efforts towards the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.\nOn the regional level, we have been following with much interest the changes which have occurred in regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes. From Afghanistan to Kampuchea, from southern Africa to the Gulf, the message of peace and of negotiated solutions has been predominant in the last few months. The international community cannot but welcome this atmosphere which opens up new prospects for progress.\nCape Verde wishes to express its great satisfaction with these developments, remembering that as a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, Gape Verde has ? .ways \u0159 located the course of dialogue, of relations based on mutual respect and sovereign equality of States, and of co-operation based on solidarity. In today's world everyone stands to lose when negotiated solutions are discarded and force is relied on instead. We firmly hope that this trend will spread to all the conflicts which for so many years have taken so many lives and spread desolation, stifling the hopes of man. We encourage the parties to the peace negotiations to press on with their efforts to achieve peaceful and lasting solutions.\nThe encouraging developments to which I have referred notwithstanding, the international political situation is still precarious. The changes which are now taking shape in the quest for solutions to regional conflicts need to be consolidated. We hope that today's political detente will help consolidate peace and that peace will not be jeopardized by tactical and short-term concerns which might compromise the gains made in international security.\nAt the same time, it is with satisfaction and renewed hope that we see, particularly in Central America and southern Africa, the carrying out of a process, which is increasingly well organized and institutionalized, whereby neighbouring countries and others have helped eliminate the hot beds of tension that still exist\u00b7\nThe participation of countries of the same region or on the same continent in this venture reflects the existence of new forms of solidarity with the peoples of countries threatened with destabilisation or countries which have been victims of prolonged conflicts. It also indicates a new global awareness of regional security and a renewed collective political will, which are most conducive to peace and give evidence of the renewed determination of the international community to resolve conflicts.\nMembers of the international community, particularly those with major responsibilities in the maintenance of peace, must continue to press ahead towards the negotiated solution of conflicts and do their utmost to refrain from any interference which might be damaging to the ongoing peace process or which might jeopardize the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General to bring about negotiated solutions to conflicts.\nIn today's international scene, we believe that all countries, all Governments and all leaders must do their part in consolidating peace and promoting development, thus opening up new prospects for progress and the emancipation of peoples with justice and social well-being.\nMultilateralism is thus of great importance in the quest for solutions to global problems. It is a crucial instrument within the framework of the changes taking place today, leading to a better appreciation and definition of the contours of the world over the next few decades.\nIn recent years Cape Verde has been one of the countries which have sought to emphasize the importance of the United Nations as an institution that is indispensable in a world such as the one in which we now live, a world in which global problems affecting the whole can be discussed and resolved by the collective effort and action of all Member States.\nWe remain firmly convinced that the United Nations provides a reliable and suitable framework for debate on the major problems facing mankind. We are also convinced that if we want to live in peace and resolve our common problems by peaceful means, there is practically no alternative to the United Nations.\nAs we see it, the work done by the United Nations has been meritorious, ranging from decolonization to the protection of human rights, from peace-keeping forces to economic development assistance. The major contribution made by the United Nations, or through it, to the building of a more peaceful and more humane world, is beyond the shadow of a doubt.\nThe tasks which still face the United Nations in the future are colossal. Its success in the completion of those tasks requires, at each phase, a re-thinking of its methods and the adapting of its methods to the evolution of the prevailing trends in international relations, of which it is and must be a reflection, and at the same time a privileged instrument.\nWe believe that the success of the United Nations in the statement of the ideals and noble objectives in its Charter will depend on its ability to mobilize mankind for peace and to make the peoples of the world aware of the need to arrive, by overcoming the obstacles, at solutions to the problems of hunger, development, illiteracy, the emancipation of peoples, and also the defence of human rights in its many dimensions.\nThe prospects of peace now taking shape in southern Africa are expressed mainly in the solid will for peace which inspires the peoples and countries that have been victims of the destabilizing strategy of the South African regime, which is yet another result of a mature, determined diplomatic effort put forth over many years and which is distinguished particularly by the Lusaka Compromise and the Nkomati Agreement.\nThe desire for peace manifested at all times by Angola and Mozambique, to which my country can rightly bear witness, has been an important and decisive factor in making it possible - despite the logic of the confrontation imposed from outside - to persist in the negotiated search for a solution to this conflict, in accordance with the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the United Nations and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We thus welcome today the withdrawal of South African military personnel from Angolan territory, the solemn reaffirmation by the South African President of the validity and current significance of the Nkomati agreement, and Pretoria's commitment to initiate on 1 November this year the implementation of United Nations resolution 435 (1978) with a view to bringing about Namibia's independence.\nThe caution which the negotiating process in southern Africa has always aroused in us, the fact that the relevant United Nations resolutions have repeatedly proved to be dead letters and the lack of respect for the rule of law and international public opinion should not lead us to minimize the importance and the dimensions of the current diplomatic success in the region.\nThese are important victories of international law, of which the United Nations is the global guarantor. These diplomatic successes are the outcome of the combined efforts of the members of the international community, which have repeatedly brought pressure to bear on the South African regime in order to lead it to heed the voice of reason and realize that international coexistence in today's world is subject to certain rules which cannot be breached. Also, we cannot disregard the beneficial influence of the general climate of detente in international relations, which has been made possible by the closer understanding between the great Powers and the mounting awareness of interdependence as a predominant factor in today's world.\nSouth Africa is thus in a situation in which it can either live up to the commitments it has entered into, thereby restoring its credibility in negotiations, or decide to violate them yet again, thereby entrenching itself in an isolation that will be a grave burden on a society whose contradictions have already assumed serious proportions. The Pretoria regime must realize that by persisting in its racist practice of denying the elementary civil and political rights of the majority of the population and by drawing up and implementing a policy that is hostile to the neighbouring African countries, it has excluded South Africa from the community of African nations to which it belongs.\nBy rehabilitating itself as an African nation, through democratic racial coexistence, good-neighbourly relations and non-interference, diplomatically or militarily, in the domestic affairs of the neighbouring countries, South Africa would be able to participate fully and with the weight of its economic and technological potential in the exalting task of the development e f Africa.\nApartheid continues to be a challenge to mankind, and primarily to Africans. This system is an aberration and must be eliminated. The persistence of this regime, which denies to Africans their rights and their ability to govern themselves, makes any agreement with South Africa precarious and brings to bear on the neighbouring countries a constant threat of interference and aggression.\nIn the light of the recent results achieved in the process of negotiations in southern Africa, the international community must redouble its efforts to ensure ever-greater solidarity with the struggle of the South African people and the intensification of international pressure to compel Pretoria to free Nelson Mandela and other black leaders, to recognize the African National Congress and the other democratic forces and to start talks with credible representatives of the black majority. That peaceful path is the path of reason, for it is the only one capable of saving that country from the cycle of violence and self-destruction.\nBy agreeing to implement the plan contained in United Nations resolution 435 (1978), relating to the independence of Namibia, South Africa has a unique opportunity to make a start on its rehabilitation within the United Nations system. Co-operation with the Organization in the impartial supervision of this process, and abstention from any act that might impede the transfer of power to the legitimate representatives of the Namibian people - which the entire international community hopes will be peaceful and democratic - would constitute an earnest of the good faith of the Pretoria regime and could have a beneficial influence on the inevitable future internal talks with the representatives of the black South African majority. The process of Namibian independence thus can be seen as a decisive test which will influence the future attitude of the international community, and above all the African community, towards South Africa.\nThe Government of Cape Verde is convinced that we are approaching the end of a long and painful period for the South African people and the neighbouring countries. We hope that the international community will support the peoples of southern Africa in the difficult re-conversion of a regional system based on confrontation and discrimination to a system of co-operation and healthy racial integration.\nDecolonization has gone down in the annals of contemporary history as a noble undertaking, successfully accomplished under the aegis of the United Nations. As a matter of fact, even if the United Nations had no other merits, its establishment would be fully justified by the tremendous legitimate contribution it has made to the liberation of peoples from the colonial yoke, to their emancipation and to the elevation of the universal idea of justice and freedom.\nThis historic phase of its international activity having now passed, the United Nations faces a major undertaking that is no less noble and worthy: the struggle for human rights. At a time when we are commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations must make the protection of human rights one of the fundamental and priority items on its standing agenda.\nOver the past 40 years many legal instruments for the protection of human rights have been adopted. Among them, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is without any doubt an important landmark in the modern movement to protect, enhance the dignity of and ensure respect for human beings, for their fundamental rights and freedoms. Putting its stipulations into effect, articulating its principles with national policies and implementing its provisions are historical necessities which all countries must keep in mind.\nMuch has been done towards raising the universal consciousness, particularly with respect to the need to protect and respect fundamental rights and freedoms. The results achieved in the context of the struggle against racial discrimination and for equal rights for women are among the specific pieces of evidence of that progress. But much remains to be done in various fields of the protection of human rights. Indeed, the first fundamental right, the right to life, is still insufficiently protected in many parts of the world. Universal and unwavering respect for that right must be a constant concern of this Organization.\nIn this connection, the Republic of Cape Verde is proud of the position it has taken never to introduce the death penalty into its penal legislation. We have done that fully by choice, aware that it is society that produces the individual; we are placing our bets on human beings and their ability to overcome.\nIn my country we also assess the international situation in terms of its specific and tangible impact on domestic life, on the climate of peace and harmony and on the colossal tasks of development and the combating of the scourges that beset mankind. Last year we identified the problems affecting the developing countries adversely, and we put forward ideas and suggestions that could, we believed, help to find a collective solution. One year later we note that nothing, or very little, has been done in the direction of solving those problems. Indeed, since then the obstacles to development have only increased, and hunger continues to devastate the peoples of a number of countries. \nThe persistence of this situation in various corners of the world runs counter to the positive developments observed in the international political climate since the last session of the General Assembly and continues to be a challenge to this organization\u2019s capacity and the determination of the international community to find real and lasting means of satisfying the aspirations of peoples. We take the view that the solution of the problem posed by questions of peace and international security necessarily involves the solution of problems posed by underdevelopment, hunger and poverty. The resolution of regional conflicts does not in itself necessarily imply the existence of a climate of international peace and security. The principal causes of instability and the threats to regional and universal peace lie in unjust international relations and poverty affecting the security and in the unequal distribution of the earth's resources. It is in the interests of the whole international community to work and co-operate with a view to assisting the countries of the third world to find solutions to their problems which we all share.\nDevelopments in the world economic situation are of concern to us because, on the one hand, the industrialized countries are registering heartening rates of economic growth, we ate once again forced to acknowledge that in the developing countries,, and in Africa in particular, it has scarcely been possible to curb the negative tendencies which continue to keep millions of human beings in an intolerable state of poverty. Millions of men, women and children annually pay with their lives the price of the world imbalance, an imbalance for which they are not to blame\u0402\nThe world's conscience is challenged by the contrast between the prosperity of some on the one hand and the abject poverty that we see in other areas. While the present situation is favourable to certain countries and to the detriment of the developing countries, it is certainly not to be encouraged in the near future, even in the case of those who are at present drawing some advantages from it. In order for the world economy to improve - and this is something we all wish to see - there is a vital need for evidence of a shared and powerful political will, a will based on the sacrificing of short-term gains, which stifle the healthy development of international economic relations. It is the African continent which continues to present the most desolate economic and social picture and which offers the most uncertain prospects. The special session of the General Assembly in 1986 devoted to consideration of the critical economic situation in Africa provided a framework and an opportunity for a contract of solidarity, which might have renewed the hopes for economic recovery in the African continent. However, two years later an assessment of the measures taken in that direction obliges us to acknowledge that, despite the efforts made by a great number of African countries and the important initiatives carried out at the international level, the results continue to be insufficient and far from encouraging.\nThe conclusions of the raid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 demonstrate that a great deal remains to be done. Many African countries have undertaken structural adjustment programmes in accordance with the requirements of the International Monetary Fund, thus exposing themselves to serious risks of social and political disruption. At the same time, the insufficiency of financial flows, the continued worsening in the terms of trade and '-.he unbearable burden of debt continue to act as powerful elements, the effects of which are cumulative and interrelated, neutralizing the tremendous sacrifices being made by the African peoples in the quest for valid and lasting solutions. \nCape Verde has not been spared the problems affecting the least developed countries of the African continent. Despite the difficulties it is facing, the Government has directed its activities towards a policy of austerity, seeking to limit the volume of external debt, which for a poor country constitutes a heavy burden. We regret that at the international level the volume of debt has not been considered sufficiently significant to be included in the framework of the special-treatment programmes. This means, paradoxically, that a country is penalized for having taken the course of a prudent and austere economic policy. We wish to remind this Assembly that in its second national development plan, covering the period 1986 to 1989 the development priorities of Cape Verde are set our and their implementation will be jeopardized without substantial support from the international community. It is essential and vital that the fresh winds which are bringing hopes of peace to the world should also bring changes in the world economic order, changes which would lead to the design of new machinery and the mobilization of fresh resources to reduce the gap between prosperity and poverty, establish international relations on a moral basis and help effectively to build universal peace. We cannot conceive of a world of peace and concord while imbalances persist which place a great part of mankind on the fringe of progress and outside the general well-being.\nWe sincerely hope that the detente in relations between the two great Powers and the positive climate currently prevailing, which favours the peaceful solution of conflicts, may herald a new era of co-operation and dialogue in international relations. The life of peoples on this planet is a tribute to their capacity for collective survival. Their history, marked by violence, destruction and war, has taught us from the very beginning that the course we are now following in the international community is the only possible course if we are to continue to carry out the marvellous work of creation. Conditions exist for us to make the twenty-first century the century of development for all. That is our obligation towards future generations, to begin now to take the concrete steps necessary to bring about this new era. Our collective survival requires it and our highest spiritual values justify it.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like most sincerely to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election as President, which is a well-deserved recognition of his personal qualities and record of great distinction in the service of his country and the international community as well as a fitting tribute to the role and stature of Argentina in world affairs. We bring to the presidency a wealth of wisdom and political and diplomatic experience. We are confident he will make a decisive contribution to the success of our deliberations.\nI wish also to place on record our sincere appreciation of Mr. Peter Florin, who presided over the forty-second session with impartiality and great distinction.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express my delegation's gratitude and admiration to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar. In recent years this Organization has faced many challenges and daunting problems, including a clear retreat from multilateralism, which threatens its very viability. But the Secretary-General never wavered from his resolve to ensure that the Organization would play its rightful role. With patience and tenacity he provided the requisite leadership and successfully reversed this trend and restored the United Nations to the centre of the world stage. The Secretary-General took initiatives to involve the United Nations in the resolution of many conflicts ranging from the Iran-Iraq war, to Afghanistan, the Western Sahara and southern Africa, to mention just a few. The peace agreements mediated by the United Nations have given a critical boost to the Organization's capacity to face the multiple challenges facing the world. They have resulted in the renewal of confidence and indeed of a realization that the United Nations is an irreplaceable multilateral forum for harmonizing international actions to handle the global problems of our time. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces last month is testimony to this climate. \nToday the international scene shows signs of improvement which offer us both challenges and opportunities. The relations between the super-Powers, which often have great impact on the international political environment, have relaxed. On the horizon we can see a faint outline of a peaceful world. The scientific and technological developments achieved, if well utilized, could help mankind to tame nature, conquer poverty and promote development. Yet amidst these encouraging developments, the world continues to be plagued by a number of political and multi faceted economic crises. These dismal realities that still plague us and the dangerous anomalies existing in the present international situation serve as a warning to us that all is not yet well in spite of our optimism.\nIn South Africa, we have an oppressive system and a Government whose callousness and viciousness is unparalleled in human history both in its intensity and the length of time it has endured. The regime poses three major challenges to the international community, namely, the independence and freedom of Namibia, apartheid in South Africa and the destabilization of the neighbouring African countries.\nThe right of a people to self-determination, sovereignty and independence is a fundamental non-negotiable human right and the universal quest of mankind. Regrettably, in Namibia this right continues to be trampled on by South Africa in arrogant defiance of the international community and the United Nations. It is now 22 years since South Africa's mandate over Namibia was terminated. The adoption by the Security Council of resolution 435 (1978), which contained the only universally agreed plan for the independence of Namibia and which was sponsored by the Contact Group of five, gave us hope at the time that the independence of Namibia was imminent. Resolution 435 (1973), however, remains unimplemented. Right from the onset, the implementation of the United Nations Plan was undermined, frustrated and scuttled by South Africa's intransigence and duplicity. The South African regime hatched on  pretext after another, as it carried out provocation after provocation against the neighbouring States to create ostensible excuses to remain in Namibia and ignore the obligations it had undertaken to abide by resolution 435 (1978).\nSuccessive attempts to finalize arrangements for the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia have since then been blocked by South Africa's continuing to hold Namibia's independence hostage to linkage with the extraneous issue of the presence of Cuban troops in Angola. The question of Namibia is essentially a decolonization problem, whereas the presence of Cuban troops in Angola is purely a bilateral arrangement, legitimately entered into between Angola and Cuba under Article 51 of the Charter. Angolan and Cuban troops have never crossed over to South Africa. On the contrary, it is South African forces which invaded the southern part of Angola and for a long time occupied that territory. It was in the first instance due to this invasion and occupation by the South African army that Angola had to seek the assistance of Cuba. It is, therefore, ridiculous to put the victim in the dock, or to equate him with the aggressor, or to demand that the victim must not be entitled to seek assistance in self-defence for its survival. The General Assembly, in its numerous decisions, and the Security Council in resolution 566 (1985), categorically rejected the linkage concept. Yet even at this time p linkage continues to be propagated both expressly and implicitly as a pretext to slow down the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and deny the Namibian people their independence.\nIn his report the Secretary-General struck a note of optimism in regard to the current talks on Angola and Namibia when he stated: \\\"There has been an improvement in prospects for the independence of Namibia. Recent diplomatic activity has made a significant contribution to the peace process in southern Africa, which should facilitate a settlement in Namibia without further delay. The date of 1 November 1988, has been recommended for beginning the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). In the light of these developments, the Secretariat has undertaken a review of its contingency plans in order to hold itself in readiness for the timely emplacement of the United Nations Transition Group in Namibia. It is my hope that current efforts will finally succeed in bringing independence to the people of Namibia.\\\" (A/43/1, p. 3)\nMy delegation welcomes the report in the hope that this time the parties involved, in particular South Africa, are taking the Secretary-General seriously and are not giving him and, through him, the entire international community, false expectations.\nCaution here is necessary, given the past conduct of the South African racist regime, which once raised the hopes of the international community only to have them suddenly dashed. This was the case at about this time of the year in 1980, when presidential elections in the host country, a member of the Contact Group of Five, were about to take place. As the pre-implementation talks of February 1981 demonstrated, South Africa's promise to begin the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) turned out to be a hoax. It is our sincere hope that we are not being made the victims of yet another hoax, but that we are about to witness the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) as the beginning of the complete and immediate decolonization of Namibia.\nMuch as we would like to be optimistic about Namibia's independence, we must realize that the whole South African problem derives from apartheid. We continue to witness the South African regime's hostility towards its neighbours, and to wonder whether the apartheid regime will allow Namibia to be truly independent.\nIt is our view that the international community, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and its allies should guard against the challenge in the likely event that the apartheid regime again pulls the rug from under us. To this end my delegation fully endorses the efforts of the Secretary-General to set a well-manned UNTAG in place in Namibia, and urges the international community to support all necessary steps aimed at guaranteeing the sovereignty and viability of independent Namibia.\nNamibia is a unique responsibility of the United Nations. It is therefore imperative that any negotiations regarding the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) should be within the framework of the United Nations. It is equally important that SWAPO, as the legitimate representative of the Namibian people, should be directly involved in such talks.\nIn South Africa itself the people continue to suffer under the inhuman practices of racism, repression, deprivation and State terrorism. For the last three years the South African regime has stepped up terror. South Africa is under a state of emergency which in effect amounts to martial law intended to muzzle the press, escalate arbitrary mass arrests, carry out detentions without trial, torture and the killing of many innocent South Africans, including women and children. \nHowever the much-touted military superiority of the racist regime is clearly under serious challenge and stress. We have seen for the first time whites revolting against conscription into the South African Defence Force. Draft evasion among whites has reached a level that has begun to worry the Pretoria regime. Recently, the leaders of 143 draft evaders declared their determination to stand firm against compulsory military service and identified the South African Defence Force as the linchpin of the system of apartheid. They realize that serving in the South African Defence Force is not the way to contribute to peace in their country and the region as a whole. The Dutch Reformed Church which gave apartheid its philosophical underpinning has been forced to disavow the system as being incompatible with Christian beliefs and morality. The increased divisions within the Afrikaner establishment in South Africa are a manifestation of the continued success of the liberation struggle. The racist regime is at war with its own people.\nWe are often warned that if the South Africans continue to fight this war of resistance, the South African apartheid regime \\\"will continue its descent into a siege mentality and become a garrison state in which all South Africans will be losers\\\". Of course there is a price to pay for freedom. The Charter of the United Nations was bought for such a peace. People in the whole world, including those who didn't know exactly what was at stake, were mobilized to fight the Second World War. The loss and human suffering were great but the ultimate achievements were worth the resistance. In South Africa, however, we are told this is different even to mention sanctions is taboo.\nThe international community can no longer stand by and let the South African racist regime, directly or through its surrogates, continue to commit acts of aggression and economic sabotage against neighbouring States, with the clear intent of intimidating them into perpetual subordination. My delegation takes this opportunity to put on record Uganda's appreciation of the front-line States for the immense sacrifice they continue to make in the struggle against apartheid. We appeal to the international community to increase economic support for the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC).\nThe conflict occasioned by apartheid has given rise to a tragedy of enormous proportions resulting in a massive displacement and exodus of people as refugees. UNICEF in its report entitled, \\\"Children on the Frontline - the impact of apartheid, destabilisation and warfare on the children in southern and South Africa\\\" chronicled and portrayed this grim reality. This August in Oslo, Norway, an international conference was convened to address this very problem. We are very appreciative of those who have provided relief assistance to the refugees and displaced persons. However, this assistance can only be a palliative: as long as apartheid remains, the tragedy will continue to unfold. Our obligation is to put an end to this crime against humanity.\nThe fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a timely reminder that the apartheid system is the very essence of the practices against which the Declaration was directed. That such a system flourishes in our midst is a strong indictment of all those who, through their actions or omissions, have contributed to its survival.\nIt is 50 years since that infamous Munich conference where, in face of the danger posed by the Nazis to the rest of the world, a fragile peace agreement was signed in 1938 in order to appease Hitler. It turned out to be a costly mistake and the price paid was the Second World War. The lesson learned then was that it does not pay to appease a bully or, more so, a group which believes in the idea of a superior race. It is instructive to note that when the world realized the danger the Hitler regime posed, it took up arms against that sea of troubles and by opposing it, ended it. The apartheid regime in South Africa poses a precisely similar danger and calls for concerted action by the international community.\nWe submit that apartheid cannot be reformed\u00b7, it must be dismantled. The conduct of the Pretoria regime; within South Africa, as well as in Namibia, and its acts of aggression against the front-line States clearly fall within the purview of Article 39 of the Charter. The imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions is clearly an imperative and it may be the only peaceful way left to eradicate apartheid.\nWe welcome the positive developments in another crisis area in Africa, namely, Western Sahara. The peace Agreement which both Morocco and POLISARIO have accepted should pave the way to ending a situation which is fraught with conflict and thus complete the process of the decolonization of Western Sahara. We hail the efforts of the Secretary-General and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in this regard. We call on the international community to support the Secretary-General and the OAU in implementing the Agreement.\nWe also welcome the accord and normalization of relations between Ethiopia and Somalia, on the one hand, and between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Chad, on the other. These are indeed positive developments in our region. We equally welcome the cease-fire and the silencing of the guns between Iran and Iraq. The war has exacted a heavy toll on the lives and resources of the two countries. The task of reconciliation is enormous. We urge the parties to ensure that the truce holds and that they move speedily to the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). \nUganda remains concerned with regard to the situation in the Middle East. The people of Palestine continue to languish without a homeland of their own. In flagrant defiance of the international community, Israel continues to consolidate its hold on the occupied Arab territories. The people of Palestine, in the face of oppressive measures by Israel, refuse to be cowed. They have continued to fight against and challenge the occupation. The uprisings that have been going on since December 1987 are clear testimony to their resolve to defend their inalienable rights. Instead of heeding the call of the international community to vacate the occupied Arab territories, Israel has chosen to respond with brutal force. All this constitutes a sad chapter in the seemingly endless tragedy of the Palestinian people. Israel needs no reminder that General Assembly resolution 181 II, which set up the State of Israel, also set up a Palestinian Arab State. The United Nations has a duty to implement that resolution.\nAs always, Uganda calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem. The people of Palestine, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization their sole and authentic representative, have an inalienable right to self-determination and to an independent State of Palestine.\nI wish to stress our continued support for General Assembly resolution 38/58 C which calls for the early convening of the International Conference on the Middle East. We are convinced that such a conference would provide a unique opportunity and platform for the achievement of a just and lasting solution of the crisis.\nWith regard to Afghanistan, Uganda welcomes the Geneva Agreements, which offer the Afghan people an opportunity to resolve their problems. All the parties concerned ought scrupulously to abide by the provisions of the Agreements.\nWe are likewise encouraged by developments in Kampuchea, where one can discern a movement towards resolving the conflict by peaceful means. \nOur position with regard to the division of Korea has never changed. We fully support the aspirations of the people of that divided country for peaceful reunification without outside interference.\nWe have also been encouraged by the Secretary-General's report on the question of Cyprus, in which he indicates that there are good prospects for success in the inter-communal talks. I wish to reiterate Uganda's continued support for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus.\nWith regard to Central America, we believe that the Arias plan contained in the Guatemala agreement of last year, provides a basis for the resolution of the conflict in that region. The people of the region should be left to negotiate the solution of their problems without outside interference or intimidation. The sovereignty and independence of each country in the region must be respected.\nOne of the most pressing issues of our time is the prevention of war, particularly a war involving the use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons pose a danger to all countries since there can be no sanctuary for any State in the case of nuclear fall-out. Therefore the calls for general disarmament and for the elimination of nuclear weapons remain issues of great importance to all countries. There have been promising developments over the past year. Perhaps the roost significant development in this area is the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty. The agreement was readied after over a decade of dangerous tension in super-Power relations, which had rendered our planet a more dangerous place. We therefore welcome and applaud this agreement.\nHowever, we must caution that the INF Treaty, has only a small quantitative effect on the nuclear threat. The number of weapons to be eliminated by both sides is less than 5 per cent of the total number of nuclear weapons deployed. The main significance of the Treaty is not military rather it represents a substantial concession on the political and strategic postures of the two super-Powers. If the Treaty is to fulfil its significant historic meaning, it should provide a springboard for more bilateral and multilateral negotiations and for the improvement of world security. It is Imperative to pursue negotiations for the gradual reduction of strategic weapons and ensure the prevention of an arms race in space.\nNuclear disarmament and conventional weapons disarmament are complementary aspects of the objective of general and complete disarmament. The global prevalence of conventional weapons, the high incidence of their use since the Second World War, coupled with the demands they make on the resources of developing countries, require urgent action to curb them. At the regional level, we can create the necessary climate for the reduction of conventional weapons by adopting appropriate confidence-building measures.\nWe had hoped that the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament would agree on a programs  that would accelerate the momentum of the disarmament process. Regrettably, at that session the Assembly was not able to agree on a final document. That should not, however, deter us from making further efforts Inasmuch as there was agreement on many issues.\nWe, in Africa, have opted for a nuclear-free zone and most of our countries are States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. But our efforts to that end have been frustrated by the continued nuclear collaboration between the racist regime of South Africa, Israel and certain nuclear countries. South Africa has admitted publicly that it is now capable of producing nuclear weapons. As I have had the occasion to state before, collaborating with South Africa in this regard is indefensible. We believe that nuclear energy should be used for peaceful purposes only. We therefore continue to hope that the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Economic Commission for Africa will join with the Organisation of African Unity in facilitating the holding of the seminar on this subject planned to take place in Uganda next year.\nThe manufacture, supply and use of chemical weapons is, in our view, a criminal offence and a violation of fundamental human rights, particularly the right to life. Those weapons kill indiscriminately. We urge all the Members of this Organization, individually and collectively, to adopt concrete measures to ban the production, supply and use of those deadly weapons.\nFor a considerable period of time, toxic waste, including nuclear waste, produced in the industrialized countries, has been dumped in developing countries. We, in Africa, refuse to accept that our continent be used as a cesspool for this dangerous Industrial garbage. We support the enactment of a convention to make such dumping an international crime. Those who engage, collaborate or conspire in this practice should be condemned and punished.\nIt should by now be self-evident that disarmament is inextricably linked with development. It is a sad commentary on our times that we live in a world that spends over 31 trillion a year on armaments. That amount is equivalent to the total indebtedness of the developing countries with its attendant deprivation and misery. That the resources of the world are being used to destroy rather than to improve the welfare of mankind is an eloquent summary of human folly. It is our hope that the recent relaxation of tension will usher in a period in which those resources will be diverted to development.\nThe contours of the world political landscape seem to have changed for the better over the past year in total contrast to the picture with regard to the economic situation. The international economic system remains inherently iniquitous. The grim reality is that the present world structure preserves and perpetuates the oasis of privilege and affluence in the desert of dearth and deprivation. It is a situation that causes concern and has grave implications for the future. The developing countries continue to be confronted with harsh circumstances. They are faced with an astronomical debt burden, the contraction of world trade and deteriorating terms of trade.\nMost developing countries have hitherto relied on the export of primary commodities for their income. But over the last 10 years prices of these products have continued to decline and have now almost collapsed. Yet the prices of imports of manufactured goods from industrialized countries, required as production inputs, continue to escalate. The net effect is a scandalous net outflow of resources from the impoverished South to the affluent North resulting in further balance-of-payments difficulties, unfavourable terms of trade and the inescapable resort to borrowing from the North. Those of us from the South should also take \u201e serious note of the fact that as long as the North continues to fix the prices of our products as well as the prices of their products the sea of poverty, hunger, disease and malnutrition is likely to continue to enlarge. It is therefore incumbent upon us to unite for existence. We can no longer tolerate a situation where the reward for the hard work of our people is hunger. \nTo address the problem, developing countries have been asked by the North and its financial institutions to undertake structural adjustment measures. The measures they have been forced to take are severe. They adversely affect their development prospects in the face of the harsh economic environment. Governments have to face the social and political tension arising therefrom. These measures have not yielded the desired results. They are, moreover, frustrated by increased protectionism in the developed countries, sharply reduced returns from our export commodity earnings and the ever-mounting debt trap. This is a critical economic situation in Africa.\nWhen the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, there were great expectations as to the impact of the programme. But to date the economic situation in Africa continues to deteriorate despite the economic reform efforts that have been undertaken at heavy social and political cost. Available financial resources continue to be insufficient to ensure sustained economic recovery and growth in our continent. \nThe inappropriately designed and externally driven short-term stabilization/structural adjustment programmes have become the hallmark of internationally supported reforms in Africa. Meanwhile, net resource outflows from Africa have increased due to the interrelated problems of dealing with export earnings, diminishing real resource inflows, and the crippling debt-servicing burden.\t.\nWe are now witnessing the ugly indicators of the scourge of reduced investment in the social sectors: a substantial fall in school enrolment, especially at the primary level, combined with a sharp increase in the brain drain, the highest incidence of infant mortality in the world and countless millions of lives at risk due to the re-emergence of diseases long thought to be extinct. Indeed, in the absence of positive economic growth, adjustment programmes in Africa have become politically inexplicable, socially unacceptable and economically unattainable.\nFor Africa or any other developing region, it is inverted logic and inadmissible practice to sacrifice real long-term development and prosperity to theoretically perceived short-term and short-lived macro-balances. While the role of market forces in the efficient allocation of resources is critical,\nideologically based policy generalizations distort reality and should never be allowed to influence the direction of economic reforms.\nWe believe that for the long-terra structural transformation of Africa the need for viable alternatives to the traditional adjustment must be addressed. lb build viable economies in our continent it is imperative to base such growth on the transfer of science and technology, reliance on favourable trading arrangements, the effective deepening of subregional and regional economic integration, and establishing the supremacy of the human being in economic development.\nAt $200 billion, Africa's outstanding debt looks relatively small compared to the estimated 01.2 trillion total debt stock of developing countries. Africa's average debt-service ratio, however, estimated at 60 per cent average, exceeds 100 per cent for a number of countries. In December 1987, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) extraordinary summit meeting set out a common position on specific measures and modalities for tackling the African debt problem, within the framework of an integrated and co-operative development-oriented strategy, based on a dialogue of co-operation and shared responsibilities. We hope that the creditors and the international community as a whole will give the necessary support to the African initiative for a North-South dialogue on all pressing issues.\nWe should carefully restructure our trade and financial linkages so that our own markets can act as a motor for our own development. We are therefore encouraged by the global system of trade preferences scheme which has been adopted by the non-aligned countries and the initiatives being undertaken by the South Commission. In our own subregion of eastern and southern Africa the preferential trade area has deliberately embarked on the path of regional economic co-operation to this end. \nThe United Nations has a vital role to play in the world of tomorrow. It should therefore be strengthened for this purpose. We accept reforms where these are intended to achieve the rationalization and better use of resources. Member States of the Organization should, however, be on guard to see that reform is not used to weaken the Organization, or to challenge and compromise the multilateral role assigned to it by the Charter, In his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has eloquently cautioned: \\\"For a country, large or small, to turn its back, to whatever extent, on the United Nations would be to surrender a good part of its actual or potential influence. To follow a two-track policy - at one level, to owe allegiance to the Charter and, at the other, to seek to marginalize the United Nations - would be to act contrary to the goal of harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of their common ends,\\\" (A/43/1, p, 8)\nAs we mark the fortieth anniversary of that immutable Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we commend the Secretary-General for his efforts in promoting human rights through the creation of advisory services which Governments, including that of Uganda, have taken advantage of. It is important to remind ourselves that a cardinal objective of the United Nations spelt out in the Charter is to ensure the full enjoyment of fundamental human rights, the respect, dignity and worth of the human person and the promotion of social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. The Declaration proclaims in Article 25(1): \\\"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control,\\\" \nArticle 28 further states:\n\\\"Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized.\\\" \nAs we prepare to enter the next millennium, the fulfilment of these objectives remains the challenge facing us in the next decade. It is imperative for us to ponder whether we shall bequeath to coming generations an international order that guarantees the total fulfilment of the rights proclaimed, in their entirety. The perpetuation of underdevelopment leads to lack of job opportunities, to poverty, disease and social deprivation. That situation becomes a breeding ground for dicta tots, for conflicts and wars and for violations of human rights. It is at this stage that the international community starts to deal with the symptoms - refugees, famine relief, and so on. The whole scene becomes a tragicomedy in which the poor keep chasing the mirage called development.\nThe United Nations is currently formulating a development strategy for the 1990s. It is imperative that that strategy be people-oriented. It should aim at bringing about development with a human face and the international order envisaged by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We maintain that the right to development is a fundamental human right. We should not construct the edifice of the world of tomorrow in such a way that we end up with a few people moving towards a post-industrial revolution while the overwhelming majority remain trapped in a state of underdevelopment and poverty. Such a configuration would be a recipe for perpetual insecurity, for a world without peace. That is the challenge to the Unite d Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the high office of President of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish him great success. I am convinced that under his experienced leadership the work of the present session will lead to a growth of confidence in our Organization. I assure him of the readiness of Czechoslovakia to continue to develop its friendly ties with his country which, through its active policy, is playing such an important role in today 's world. \nI should also like to express our deep gratitude for the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, to diminish tensions throughout the world and to resolve regional conflicts through negotiation. We especially appreciate the fact that thanks to his initiatives and efforts our Organization has achieved new and significant successes and is thus living up to the noble role it has been given, for, as the Latin adage states: Pacia donum est omnibus bonum - the gift of peace is a blessing for all. \nIn international relations we are witnessing events of truly unique significance. They demonstrate new political thinking. Militancy is being rejected; there is greater openness; we observe a growing readiness to engage in negotiations in a civilized and businesslike manner. These very promising events are leading to the building of relations among States on the basis of a balance of interests, a strengthening of the role of international law, and a humanizing of international relations - thus leading to a more comprehensive solution to problems of the survival of civilization as a universal human challenge. \nHowever, this cannot be done though destructive confrontation. The way to a solution lies in active co-operation. This is the philosophy of the end of the present and the beginning of the next century. It must open the way to the emergence of qualitatively new relations both on the global and regional scale. Of course, this requires that new phenomena must be analysed from new points of view. Problems that seemed irresolvable must now be resolved. The unthinkable must become the thinkable. What was impossible yesterday must be made possible. \nThe viability of this approach has been demonstrated by the four Soviet-United States summit meetings which have made the world safety prospects for peace stronger and the future more hopeful. A landmark of fundamental importance was the ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, the first step of an era of real disarmament. We were one of the eight States involved in the process of its realization, we have done everything that was required of us. We agreed with the conducting of verification measures on our territory. Soviet operational-tactical missiles with increased radius, which had been stationed in my country since the end of 1983, were removed even before the Treaty's entry into force.\n\\\"Today we must all jointly ask ourselves a questions how do we proceed further? How can we develop now what sober-minded politicians have agreed upon? The answer is unequivocal s let us compete in humanism. Let us make the cornerstone that unites us the survival and continuation of mankind. Let us hold a competition which  despite all of our differences in policy, ideology, world view, and other spheres, assures both nations and individuals of their future existence, let us demilitarize international relations and prevent both social and ecological disasters, thus arriving at new horizons of mutually beneficial co-operation.\nIt is precisely in this spirit that our Organization today must have a decisive say in the fundamental strengthening of multilateralism, which has proved to be better able to create confidence and achieve results than any other options. As pointed out by the Secretary-General in his annual report, when global problems requite global solutions the value of the United Nations for its Members is obvious to all. If its influence is not strengthened, we shall be constantly confronted with ever-growing instability throughout the world.\nThis is also the basis of the concept for comprehensive security which encompasses all aspects of international relations. It meets the need to make universal human interests a major element of international policy. It serves as an impulse for broad constructive dialogue on  hat can be done to enhance substantially the role of the United Nations in the present world.\nPositive developments in the world are creating favourable conditions for implementing the goals of restructuring all spheres of life in our country. By following that path we are endeavouring to build on the significant results achieved in our social and economic development and to strengthen the progressive and democratic traditions of our people.\nThis year we are commemorating some important anniversaries both glorious and tragic: the seventieth anniversary of an independent Czechoslovakia, but also the fiftieth anniversary of the \\\"Munich Agreement\\\" which was concluded behind our backs. This remains an abiding lesson. Security was and continues to be shared and indivisible. We recall the historical experience of two world wars and four decades of socialist development. This obliges us to pursue an active and constructive policy of peaceful co-operation.\nWe see as a manifestation of this policy the proposal for the creation of a zone of confidence co-operation and good-neighbourly relations along the line of contact between the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization put forward by the General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Milos Jakes. We believe that it is precisely the States adjacent to that line which bear a special responsibility. In fact this is where the concentration of military power is greatest and therefore misunderstandings are fraught with the most dangerous consequences and confrontation is most hazardous.\nHence, we are proposing a plan for the peaceful strengthening of security guarantees in this zone without confrontation, through both military and non-military measures. We intend to act in this area on the basis of the all-European process, and in so doing to create in that zone stimulus for its further intensification. To do this, of course, we must jointly throw off the burden of the past. We must abandon outdated models of bloc-derived thinking, reject the concept of enemies, measure the boldness of human deeds not by their degree of militancy but by their ability to overcome one-sided and deceptive military ambitions. \nOur proposal subordinates military relations to the principle of reasonable sufficiency. We want to enhance confidence-building measures and fulfil and further develop the conclusions of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe with respect to military exercises, including notification of such exercises limiting the number of participating troops, inviting observers and the tight of inspection. We favour a joint comparison of military doctrines with a view to giving them a purely defensive character. Together with our allies, in the context of an all-European reduction of armed forces and conventional weapons on the basis of joint elimination of imbalances and asymmetries in the various types of weaponry, we propose the removal of the most dangerous offensive weapons from the zone along the line of contact between the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). We listened with special interest to the valuable proposals along those same lines made by President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. These strengthen our conviction that intense dialogue will continue.\nAt the same time we must seek the development of the non-military factors of security. Therefore our proposal also encompasses the political, economic, ecological and humanitarian spheres. In the zone of confidence, measures in those spheres could even go beyond the parameters agreed upon in the all-European framework.\nThe possible opportunities for peaceful co-operation are practically inexhaustible. We ate thinking of joint ventures, the creation of free-trade zones, an improvement of the transport and energy infrastructure, a simplification of customs and visa practices, environmental protection, relief assistance in cases of natural disaster, a broadening of relations between twin cities and provinces, the establishment of direct contacts between schools, scientific institutions cultural establishments and youth organizations, reciprocal medical assistance in border areas, and so forth.\nIn that way we aim at the establishment of a machinery for regular political dialogue among the States of both parts of Europe, a dialogue built on a broad, solid basis. This follows upon other proposals made by socialist countries and on the constructive approaches and views of our Western partners. We are open to any constructive comments and considerations.\nWe are in favour of the speediest possible radical mutual reductions in armed forces and conventional weapons on our continent. Without this the danger of military confrontation will continue. The July session of the Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty, held at Warsaw, put forward new and far-reaching proposals; to eliminate asymmetry in weapons and armed forces and subsequently to reduce them by approximately 25 per cent, or by 500,000 servicemen on either side, then to continue this process until the military potential of both sides takes on an exclusively defensive character  This would take place in three carefully balanced stages. In that way our countries have taken a constructive step in an effort to  meet the position of the NATO countries, proposing a realistic scheme for reductions.\nWe are working towards a speedy and successful conclusion of the Vienna meeting, which should adopt a substantive and well-balanced document and agree on the mandate for negotiations on conventional disarmament. We agree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany,\nMr. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, that this should take place as soon as during this month. It is true that a great deal of responsible work has already been done at that meeting. Foundations have been laid for the adoption o\u00a3 good documents making possible broad development of all-European co-operation, constructive approach now requires political determination to complete the agreements now being prepared and political will with respect to all questions under discussion.\nWe propose that one of the subsequent events be the holding of an economic forum. It could discuss the entire question of co-operation in that sphere. We are ready to act as host to that forum.\nIn short, we wish jointly to raise the all-European propose to a qualitatively higher level commensurate with the realities of our times in order to reaffirm the viability of the concept of a common European home based on the various social choices made by the peoples. We must base it on solid ground, build it boldly and ensure that Europe speaks to the world in a single language of peace.\nWe face no greater challenge today than that of making the disarmament process irreversible. That was our basic approach to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. Unfortunately, that session ended without a final document. Yet it was a useful experience and a lesson for the future. The proposals made at the session remain a rich source of inspiration. For our part, we set out our proposals in a joint memorandum from the Warsaw Treaty States on security through disarmament, and in a number of other documents. I would mention, \nfirst of all, the joint proposal of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the People\u2019s Republic of Bulgaria and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to establish international machinery for verification of compliance with agreements aimed at reducing tension and limiting weapons, and to monitor the military situation in regions of conflict. This machinery would function under United Nations auspices. We are pleased that this has attracted numerous interesting proposals from other countries. Let us do all in our power to prevent our ever having to say that the settlement of a given issue is no longer verifiable. Let the humanistic triad of confidence, security and co-operation light the way towards qualitatively new international relations. Freeing the world from the nuclear-arms race remains the pivotal global task. To continue that race amounts to running consciously towards an abyss. A basic step in the right direction would be the early conclusion of work on a Soviet-United States treaty on a 50 per cent reduction in strategic offensive weapons, to be accompanied by strict compliance with the anti-ballistic missile Treaty, since the link between these matters is a deep and organic one. We favour the immediate cessation of nuclear-weapon testing. That would give us time for political solutions and for formulating a treaty on the complete, universal prohibition of such testing. We also support the development of international co-operation in the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes exclusively. We desire the strengthening of the authority of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, with consistent application of the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \nAn important addition to the efforts to avert the nuclear threat has been the concrete proposal put forward by the Governments of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the German Democratic Republic to establish a nuclear-weapon-free corridor in Central Europe. We support the setting up of similar zone in other parts of the world as well particularly in the Balkans and in Scandinavia.\nIt is high time that all obstacles to the completion of the convention on the complete prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons be set aside. We are prepared to be among its first signatories. We neither produce nor possess such weapons. Further delays in the preparation of the convention serve only to prone to the spread of such weapons and increase the risk of their use. In that connection we have noted a change in the attitude of France that we hope, will facilitate agreement. Like other countries, we are concerned about the start of production of binary warfare agents and about their possible deployment in Europe. Together with the German Democratic Republic, we propose the establishment of a chemical-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. As a Contracting Party to the 1921 Geneva Protocol, we favour the proposal to convene a conference of the signatory States.\nWe share the view that it is necessary to enhance the Organization's role in limiting conventional armaments. We believe that the proposal to create within the United Nations a register of trade in weapons will contribute to that end.\nWe are in favour of an expansion of international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space, which the United Nations has proclaimed to be the common heritage of mankind. It would be unforgivable were we to display indifference to the threat of the misuse of space for military purposes.\nWe are in favour of an enhanced effectiveness of the disarmament median ism, primarily of the Conference on Disarmament at Geneva. In this spirit, it should gradually become a permanent universal body for disarmament negotiations, as we proposed last February. That is in keeping with the logic of current global changes and integration processes.\nAn essential condition for the attainment of over-all security is the peaceful settlement of international disputed regional conflicts. Here, the fruitful dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States has had a beneficial effect. An improvement in East-West relations provides that calm that is necessary to the process of seeking and finding equitable solutions to long-standing and dangerous hotbeds of tension. We must take full advantage of it, thus an active role for the United Nations is now indispensable. What body other than the United Nations can make such a significant contribution to the protection of legitimate rights and co-ordinate the interests of the parties involved? What other body can better implement the machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes, stimulate the adoption of international guarantees to prevent the recurrence of a conflict? Only the United Nations can do so.\nWe therefore welcome the growing importance of the role of the \\\"blue berets\\\" in various world trouble-spots. They are a symbol of one of the most important area of United Nations activities, namely, peace-keeping. They can be even more effective in helping to stabilize the situation in troubled areas, ensure conditions for negotiated settlements and prevent the outbreak of new conflicts.\nTogether with world public opinion, we have reacted with hope to the signing of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan worked out with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General and jointly guaranteed by the two greatest Powers. The well-known steps taken by the Soviet Union and Afghanistan represent a responsible and scrupulous honouring of the obligations undertaken. In this connection we would emphasize the fundamental significance of unswerving compliance on the part of all signatories. Only in that way will it be possible to ensure peace for the Afghan people and for the region as a whole. \\\"We have also welcomed the positive turn of events in the Persian Gulf as a result of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We note with satisfaction that with the assistance of the United Nations the senseless bloodshed has been halted. The presence of the United Nations Military Observer Group has been a stabilizing influence. We fully support the continuation of talks under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General. \nRealistic prerequisites have emerged for a peaceful settlement of the problems in southern Africa. We hope that the ongoing trilateral negotiations between Angola, Cuba and South Africa; with the participation of the United States, will bring independence to Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978), That would also defuse the situation in the region as a whole. The efforts of the United Nations and of the entire world community must be even more consistently directed towards achieving a full and immediate end to the shameless practice of the policy of apartheid by the Government of South Africa. \nWe welcome the evolution of the situation in Central America as a result of the Esquipulas II Agreement. However, we deplore the complication of the situation in the region and of the development of the peace process that is now, as in the past, being caused by foreign support for the counterrevolutionary forces in Nicaragua. We view the convening of an international conference on the Middle East conflict under the auspices of the United Nations as a way of exerting joint efforts to find a definitive solution. The uprising in the occupied territories has once again demonstrated that the question of Palestine is at the core of any solution. This cause could only gain from the start of work by a preparatory committee for such a conference.\nWe are in favour of a peaceful settlement of the problem of Cyprus, one that would ensure the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus while preserving its non-aligned status. We fully support the constructive efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at easing the international tension in the Korean peninsula and at a peaceful reunification of the country. Thanks to those efforts, the prerequisites for entering into an orderly dialogue have improved.\nWe are also pleased by the positive developments in the Horn of Africa, in particular with the significant peace agreement signed by Ethiopia and Somalia. We also support the joint efforts of Ethiopia and the Sudan to strengthen relations of peace and mutual co-operation. A contribution to improving the international climate has also been made by developments with regard to a settlement of the situation in Western Sahara. We note with satisfaction, and we support, the efforts to find a political solution to the question of Kampuchea and to bring peace and stability to South-East Asia. We favour further development of the results of the informal meeting in Djakarta. The basis for positive developments in this field is created by the 50 per cent reduction in the number of Vietnamese volunteers in Kampuchea, now under way.\t'\nIn our view the seven-point programme of the USSR designed to strengthen peace in the Asian-Pacific region will give momentum to the process.\nWe welcome the positive trend to enhance the role of the Security Council in the resolution of international disputes and conflicts. In this regard it would be desirable periodically to convene meetings of the Council at the level of ministers of foreign affairs and, where the need exists, to do so in regions of tension, as proposed here by Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. Improved co-operation among the permanent members of the Security Council would doubtless yield fruitful results. We appreciate the deepening c ordination between the Security Council and the Secretary-General. We favour the adoption of the draft declaration on the prevention and removal of threats to peace and situations that might threaten international peace and security. Today the United Nations can truly do more for the cause of peace than ever before.\nCzechoslovakia currently favours the democratic restructuring of international economic relations. We cannot allow encouraging developments in other areas to lag behind. We cannot ignore the growth of forces and that have already created uncertainty and mistrust in the world economy and are likely to bring about an unprecedented international economic crisis. The future of us all will rest on quicksand if we fail to bridge the gap between the developed and the developing countries.  Therefore it is indispensable to create a new international economic order and justly to resolve the problems of underdevelopment and foreign debt and eliminate their appalling consequences: hunger, the inequality of millions, disease, illiteracy and poverty. We wish actively to promote resolution of these crucial problems.\nWe believe it necessary to continue the international dialogue on the implementation of the principle \\\"permanent for development\\\" and step by step to translate the conclusions of last year's United Nations conference into concrete measures. As we made clear in the document of the Political Consultative Committee issued at its July session in Warsaw, special attention must also be paid to the dangerous environmental consequences of the arms race.\nWe can no longer stand by idly in the face of the ecological threat, a problem which we have jointly and short-sightedly created. The conclusions of the World Commission on Environment and development and the document titled \\\"Environment Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond\\\" must be implemented without further delay.\nThis year in our country we have adopted a new long-term concept of environmental protection till the end of the century. To prevent ecological factors from undermining stability and peaceful relations, we have put forward a proposal on the creation of international ecological security, which should be based on mutually acceptable principles of co-operation and conduct of States in this regard. We support the idea of co-ordinating efforts on these issues and the holding of a series of international meetings on the way to the convening of a United Nations conference on the environment in 1992.\nWe intend to continue to promote the strengthening of international co-operation in the humanitarian sphere as well as in the field of human rights. The continuing, flagrant and massive violation of human rights in many parts of the world is indeed one of the most condensable phenomena of our time. There is no way to be complacent with it. We recall this with even greater urgency now, on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We welcome the profound ideas voiced here regarding a new category of human rights for the protection of mankind.\nIn particular the role of international law must be strengthened so that it governs relations among States. Its effectiveness must be continually increased through codification, progressive development and consequent implementation. We welcome the stimulating idea of the Soviet Union regarding working out a long-term programme of development of international law dealing with issues of security, confidence and co-operation. We agree as to the primary importance of legal guarantees of comprehensive security. We are considering ways to make our contribution towards the strengthening of the role of the International Court of Justice.\nGiven the urgency of the tasks facing the international community at this session, it is essential to strengthen our joint action and co-ordination. The United Nations has a truly indispensable role to play in this regard. Let us therefore concentrate our efforts on comprehensively stepping up the Organization's beneficial work. Let us strengthen the authority of its main bodies and make broad use of the established mechanism for co-operation and the strengthening of peace. Let us bear in mind the decisive importance of the factor of time - that inexorable arbiter of history. Through constructive efforts let us find new avenues leading to the solutions of the problems of our times. Let us cultivate morality and ethics worthy of the international relations of the future.\nThe Czechoslovak delegation has received a mandate from its Government to act precisely in this way, and it shall honour that mandate.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first of all to express the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Ito go to Mr, Dante Caputo on his election as President of this forty-third session of the General Assembly. That choice is certainly justified by his well-known diplomatic qualities and the firm devotion of his country Argentina, to the service of the noble ideals of the United Nations and the values of solidarity among peoples. These are all virtues aid assets that make it possible for us to predict success for the work that will take place under his presidency.\nThroughout the forty-second session of the General Assembly his illustrious predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic republic, demonstrated tact and competence in successfully guiding the work of the Assembly. My delegation would like once again to express to him its warm appreciation and esteem.\nMy delegation would like also to congratulate very warmly the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, on the pragmatic and efficient way in which he continues to serve our Organization. I should like particularly to hail his constant efforts to increase the Organisation's capacity for action and to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes and the application of the United Nations Programme for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa. I should like to assure him once again of the constant support of ray country in his work in carrying out his difficult and delicate responsibilities.\t.\nThe Nobel Prize, which has just been awarded to the United Nations Peace-keeping Forces, rightly honours the courage and devotion of the thousands of men and women mobilized in our common name to assure peace in the trouble spots of the world. This gesture of the Nobel Prize Committer honours before world public opinion the crucial role played by these forces in maintaining peace. Through me, my country, Togo, wishes warmly to congratulate them.\nThe forty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place in an international climate characterized by both legitimate hops and grave concern. The hope arises from the will of the two greatest Powers to reduce and progressively eliminate the threat of war, particularly nuclear war, and to settle peacefully the conflicts still tearing apart certain regions of the world.\nOf course there are grave concerns as well as to the ways and means of overcoming the grave crisis which continues to shake the economies of the countries of the third world. It is time to launch international economic co-operation on a healthy and more equitable basis.\nWe should like to express our sadness at the failure of the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. Here and there rays of light do appear among the storm clouds, which in some areas of the globe seemed to make impossible any hope of peace. The will to undertake a dialogue which has finally been shown in those areas is indeed a miracle. Certainly there has always been a shorter, less painful way to succeed in bringing men to work together on a more equal basis, even if they have not loved each other as brothers. Thus one must ask, is it really necessary that losses of human life and human suffering must lead us to the very brink of exhaustion so that there can be recognition and acceptance, finally, of the basic truth of history that force is only dissuasion if it is not reason?\nTogo has always proclaimed its faith in the virtues of peace. It appreciates its benefits and has done so for almost a quarter of a century of political sterility. We would like to reaffirm here, in this year of the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that the links between peace and human rights are indissoluble. That peace, which should underlie any development effort, constitutes the corner-stone of equilibrium in our respective societies and should be assured on the regional level by the implementation by each State of a policy of good-neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence and through the abolition of terrorism, particularly that clandestinely engaged in by States for the purpose of destabilizing their neighbours and thus diverting efforts from the only struggle that deserves to be waged - that for the social and economic development of our peoples. The search for peace should resolutely avoid all temptations of pressure or blackmail by terrorism, which sows grief and imperils progress and security for our populations.\nIn our interdependent world, military victories are only intermediate stages which do not bring any definitive solutions to the problems of relations among States. We have to discuss, negotiate and understand each other. There is no alternative. Thus we hail with relief the establishment of the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. This is a result of the efforts constantly and tirelessly made by the Secretary-General to ensure that the region of the Gulf and its peoples, afflicted by eight years of cruel war, can finally rediscover the benefits of peace.\nIn Western Sahara peace efforts are being given a great impetus and a better chance, undoubtedly because of the need for integration that necessarily brings together the Maghreb States. This conflict, which has seriously and sorely tested bilateral relations in the region and significantly disturbed the evolution of the Organization of African Unity, will soon find its culmination in the referendum which will make it possible for the Sahraoui people freely to express themselves on their future and thus exercise their right to self-determination. \nThe tensions which have disturbed relations between Chad and Libya are finally entering a phase of detente. Ito go, which follows with great interest this evolution, is pleased with the reaffirmed will of those two countries to seek peaceful means to solve their differences. We urge them to work towards the normalization of their relations so that a new era of good-neighbourliness and fraternal co-operation may open up for their respective populations.\nAs for Namibia, after decades of hard struggle and intense efforts, it is now moving towards the application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which stipulated the conditions for the achievement of its independence. It is to be hoped that the dialogue developing within the framework of negotiations between Angola, South Africa, Cuba and the United States will culminate in a just and true peace in that part of our continent. The agreements on Afghanistan reached in Geneva last March are a decisive contribution to the peace process in that region. Those agreements are based on the Afghan people's right - finally recognized - to choose, without any foreign interference  the political economic and social system they regard as being in conformity with their aspirations.\nThe edifice of peace is being built also in Central America. We pay a tribute here to the five Heads of State of the region, who, by reaffirming their commitment to honour all the obligations resulting from the Esquipulas II agreement, have greatly increased the chances for peace in Central America. The international community should promote and encourage these efforts in order to achieve the hoped-for results.\nIn Kampuchea the Kampuchean people should be enabled quickly to exercise the right to self-determination which they have been denied for a long time because of the invasion and occupation of their territory by foreign forces. My country, which has always supported the just liberation struggle of the Kampuchean people has taken note of the Vietnamese Government's intention to withdraw 50,000 soldiers. Of course, only the withdrawal of all the foreign troops will make it possible to find a final solution to this painful problem.\nIn the Korean peninsula, the willingness of the two Governments, of the North and of the South, to engage in dialogue seems to be gradually taking hold and broadening. Togo supports the idea of the peaceful reunification of the two territorial entities and believes that the implementation of the three-point plan proposed by North Korea should be negotiated in the context of sincere and fraternal harmonization of views, taking due account of the free will of the Korean people as a whole.\nThese harbingers of peace that are springing up here and there go hand in hand, unfortunately, with serious uncertainty, which makes it necessary for us to marshal our will and focus our efforts on methods that are worthy of our times and that can deal with the misery of millions of men and women who are still excluded from the community of free and sovereign peoples. That is true of the black majority in South African, which endures every day the suffering and humiliation caused by apartheid.\nIn fact, the leaders in Pretoria, deaf to all the protests by public opinion, are obstinately perpetuating the practice of apartheid, this socio-political system that is inevitably condemned to disappear. Banning or assassinating anti-apartheid militants, prolonging the state of emergency without any reason to do so cannot stop the historic march of the black people towards their freedom.\nWith regard to the Palestinian tragedy, Togo shares the concern about the situation in the occupied territories. The Palestinian people's right to a country and respect for the sovereignty of States are principles on which the settlement of this conflict should be based. My country advocates the idea of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations in which all the parties concerned would participate, including, of course, the Palestine Liberation Organisation.\nThe third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament should have been a milestone in the long history of the efforts to maintain and strengthen international peace and security. Unfortunately the hopes aroused by the progress achieved since the first special session and by the recent positive developments concerning disarmament did not take concrete form in the re-launching of the process of general and complete disarmament. This special session, which adjourned without the slightest consensus, could well have aroused doubts about our Organization's ability to encourage and strengthen the multilateral approach to disarmament. Nevertheless, this failure should not overshadow the remarkable efforts made by the two great Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, gradually to eliminate the threats of war, particularly nuclear war.\nThe ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles has given concrete form to the two great Powers will for peace and true disarmament. At the same time, it has the advantage of opening the path to more numerous and more audacious initiatives. Hence, it is in everyone's interest that the two great Powers tirelessly pursue their negotiations to reach agreement on a reduction by 50 per cent in their strategic nuclear arsenals and their conventional forces in Europe.\t\nThe international economic situation, which has for almost two decades been in a state of general stagnation, remains disquieting.\nThe uncertainty about world economic growth is even greater for the developing countries, and particularly for sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, according to forecasts, real income of the countries of that region and the least-developed countries as a whole will increase by 2.5 per cent, and there will be no growth in per capita revenue, or even negative growth, during the period from 1987 to 1995.\nIn addition to being contrary to the basic principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the protectionist measures taken by the developed countries are preventing the developing countries from participating fairly in international commercial exchanges. Nevertheless, we must hope that the new round of multilateral trade negotiations under way in Uruguay will open the path to a considerable reduction in and the gradual elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers.\nIt is true that the recovery of the world economy requires both concerted international action and the individual efforts of States. But it is even more true that the Draconian measures of structural adjustment imposed on the developing countries have a very high economic, social and political cost. They reduce the rate of development of those countries' economies. Because of the lack of provisions for increasing the prices of raw materials or reducing the excessive debt burden  our countries' economies are the greatest victims of the infernal process of increasing indebtedness  the continuing deterioration in the terms of trade and the reverse transfer of capital.\nIn those circumstances, the determinations of the developing countries to put into effect coherent economic and social policies comes up against external constraints linked to the iniquitous and imbalanced international economic system. The measures for structural adjustment, in their present form, should be reviewed in order to enable our States to keep their foreign commitments and continue internal development. While the global figure for the debt of the \u0447 developing countries has been constantly increasing - indeed today it amounts to more than $1 trillion - the controlled price index of the principal non-petroleum commodities exported by those countries has increased by an average of almost 5 per cent since 1980, and the reversal in the net transfer of resources caused them to lose more than $30 billion in 1986.\nThe constant decrease in the available financial resources is a major obstacle to the third-world countries' efforts to ensure the recovery of their economies and development. We know that more than two thirds of those countries receive more than half of their export income from the sale of commodities. Hence, the international community must put into effect measures that can stabilize and fix the prices of raw materials at remunerative levels. It must also adopt a new international strategy for development based on greater justice and equity and providing for the harmonious growth of the world economy. That new strategy should envisage urgent and appropriate solutions to the questions of foreign debt and the constant decrease in the financial resources of the developing countries, in particular by a substantial alleviation of the debt, and even the cancellation of entire portions of it.\nIn regard particularly to Africa, it is encouraging to note the increasing interest of our Organization in the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. That interest is clear particularly from two initiatives taken by the General Assembly at its forty-second session - that is, on the one hand, the decision to establish an Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the Assembly as the most appropriate mechanism to prepare the review and the appraisal of the Programme of Action and, on the other hand, the request made to the Secretary-General to submit to the forty-third session of the Assembly concrete recommendations for a speedy and full implementation of that Programme. We must however note with regret that the results hoped for during the meeting of the Committee of the Whole have not been attained. \nBy establishing an advisory group on financial flows for Africa the Secretary-General has acted upon his intention to give priority to that continent's economic problems and to seek ways and means to hasten implementation of the Programme of Action. In this connection, we must see to it that new financial flows are carefully channelled, at both the bilateral and the multilateral level. Therefore United Nations bodies concerned with development should have access to additional resources enabling them to participate actively in the implementation of the Programme of Action, among other things by devising and putting in place projects specifically designed for sub-Saharan Africa.\nIn fulfilment of their commitments, African States have undertaken major reforms to secure economic recovery and development, and it is therefore important that the international community to live up to its agreement to participate in implementing the Programme by providing Africa with all the assistance it needs.\nAt a time when African leaders are tackling with courage and determination the economic and social recovery of their continent, it is especially revolting to see the various wicked attempts by some in the industrial and business circles of the North to turn Africa into a dumping ground lot nuclear and industrial wastes, thus gravely harming the health of our peoples and our environment. These operations are motivated by a cynical desire to exploit the current economic and financial difficulties of our countries. In the face of this grave threat to African interests, the Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) unanimously adopted last May a resolution firmly denouncing and condemning the scandal of toxic wastes and undertaking to take the measures necessary to prevent the dumping of these wastes on African soil. \nIn that same spirit, the eleventh conference of Heads of State or Government of the Economic Community of West African States adopted a resolution by which it was decided to enact laws in all 16 member countries making it a crime for any person, group of persons, business or organization to participate in any act involving the stockpiling of nuclear or industrial wastes. To spare our continent the torment of the irreversible deterioration of its environment, we call upon the International community, and especially the industrialized countries, to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to prevent the export of toxic wastes to our countries.\nThis session coincides with the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and we must therefore vigorously reaffirm our total commitment to the humanitarian values that are indispensable in containing mankind's destructive impulses and suicidal passions.\nThe favourable developments that have taken place in regions long torn apart by hatred and violence reassure us of the usefulness of our Organization and its authority in the sphere of the management and settlement of international affairs. In the light of these developments, we must not stand idly by, but participate in useful activities to ensure that frontiers be no longer barriers between peoples but open doors through which they can pass to meet, join together and ensure that the weakness of certain countries, instead of being a pretext for shameful exploitation, becomes an opportunity for sharing and solidarity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI deem it a privilege and an honour to extend to the President the warm felicitations of the delegation of Burma on his election as the President of the forty-third regular session of the General Assembly, we are confident that his long and brilliant career at the national level in his own country as well as on the international scene will stand him in good stead in guiding our deliberations to a fruitful conclusion.\nI should also like to refer to the outstanding leadership provided by His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin, the outgoing President, to the international community during the preceding session of the General Assembly. \nIt is with a sense of satisfaction that we wish to join other delegations in paying tribute to the Secretary-General,  Mr. Perez de Cuellar for his dedication to the Organization and for his tireless efforts in the cause of peace.\nThe agenda of the General Assembly portrays the diverse and complex nature of the issues that the United Nations faces in dealing with international problems in their global perspective. In the search for solutions, the universal nature of the Organization makes it possible to see and reflect the interest of the world at large although finding consensus to meet the interest of all has not always been easy. While many problems remain to be resolved, the Organization represents the hopes and aspirations of the world community and must therefore continue to serve as the essential instrument for harmonizing the relations between States and upholding the rule of law in international relations. We are encouraged to believe that the present international situation provides favourable opportunities for the United Nations to further its endeavours to preserve peace, increase international security and develop international co-operation.\nMaintaining international peace and security is at the forefront of the agenda of the United Nations. However, the interdependent nature of the world is such that issues of peace and security cannot be separated from endeavours for the common well-being of the world's population. This in turn would depend much upon finding solutions to the problems of global development and the reduction of the disparities in the conditions of life of peoples.\nRegional conflicts have been a particular feature of our international life and have constituted major obstacles to the implementation of the provisions of the Charter. They are a feature that is prevalent particularly in the developing areas of the world and have created obstacles to the security and well-being of peoples, exacerbated international tensions and brought about much suffering. There is the force and political will as well as a humanitarian dimension to finding solutions which will enhance the prospects for peace at the regional level.\nThe major Powers can do much in finding solutions to international problems. However the objective of ensuring international security requires the endeavours of all Members through the collective security system of the United Nations. In the final analysis, it is through the willingness of Member States to conduct their relations on the basis of the principles of the Charter that international security can be effectively enhanced.\nThe bilateral agreement between the two militarily most significant States constitutes the first essential step in the process of nuclear disarmament and its significance can be seen from the prospects for achieving further substantial measures.\nSuccessful disarmament negotiations are of vital interest to all nations, and agreements between States that have the primary responsibilities should have a significant bearing on the efforts of the international community. The United Nations constitutes the centre stage for all such activities.\nIn Afghanistan, the United Nations, through the good offices of the Secretary-General, has played an important role in the achievement of the Accords, which are highly commendable. We believe that if the Geneva accords are implemented in good faith by all parties, the tragedy in which Afghanistan has been caught for nearly a decade will now come to an end and the Afghans themselves will once again be able to map out their future and reconstruct their land with the help of the international community.\nThe favourable international environment that is conducive to the resolution of  international conflicts is also noticeable in the quest for solutions to the problem of  Kampuchea. Year after year the Assembly has reaffirmed the basic principles of International relations with regard to Kampuchea. It is time that reason and fairness prevailed ever force. We hope that the people of Kampuchea, who have suffered for so long, will have the opportunity to work out a solution that will put them on the path of national reconciliation and reconstruction. It is a source of satisfaction for my delegation to observe the recent emergence of new, positive impulses which may be conducive to what the Assembly has been endeavouring to achieve for so many years - the peaceful and negotiated settlement of the question of Kampuchea.\nWith regard to the situation in Central America, the peace plan signed last year in Guatemala by the five Central American States reflects the desire of the peoples of Central America to live in peace, through a process of conciliation and co-operation, in accordance with the principles of self-determination and non-intervention. The prospects for peace in Central America should not be allowed to falter, and it is incumbent upon the international community to support such regional co-operation.\nThe question of Palestine, which has been recognized as the core of the Middle East problem, has been the focus of international attention as a result of the situation that prevails in the occupied territories. The tragedy of these events is a grim reminder of the urgent need to reach a just, comprehensive and peaceful solution of the Palestinian problem.\nWe feel that an international conference on the Middle East, under United Nations sponsorship, could serve as a useful vehicle in the search for a just and durable solution to the problem, provided all parties to the conflict are allowed to participate on an equal footing. The necessary foundations have already been laid in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nAfter much perseverance, the collective effort? of the Security Council have now resulted in a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. The cease-fire constitutes the first essential step towards a negotiated settlement, through implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), that would bring about a durable peace and an end to the suffering and devastation experienced by the peoples of both countries. We continue to place much hope in the efforts of the Security Council and in the important role of the Secretary-General in the peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations and in finding a solution to the conflict.\nIn southern Africa, the Assembly continues to face a situation in which the regime shows no sign of relenting in its efforts in maintaining the policies of apartheid. However, there are now significant developments with regard to the situation in the south-western region of Africa. The agreement on a set of principles for the establishment of peace in the region and recognition of the rights of the people of South West Africa to self-determination and freedom brings nearer the day of independence for Namibia. South Africa's intransigence and refusal to comply with the United Nations plan for Namibia constitute the obstacle to its implementation. It is hoped that the agreement reached will bring about without delay implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which constitutes the framework for the exercise by the Namibian people of their right to freedom and independence.\nNeedless to say, the root cause of South Africa's acts of destabilization  aggression and violation of the territorial integrity of neighbouring States Lies in the regime's racial policy of apartheid. Universal condemnation and the international call for the complete abrogation of the apartheid system have not been heeded by the South African regime. \nThe international community, through efforts in the United Nations and elsewhere, must continue to give steadfast support to the people of South Africa in their struggle against the institutionalised system of racial discrimination practised by the Pretoria regime.\nUnited Nations endeavours to foster and promote the economic and social well-being of all peoples are also a priority issue. Such efforts need to be focused on more balanced and equitable international relations and on narrowing the gap between the developed and the developing regions of the world.\nThe developing countries continue to face an increasingly difficult economic environment. The institutions which govern international economic relations and which were created for the purpose of facilitating the smooth functioning of the global economy have not been effective in meeting the needs of the vast transformation that has taken place in the pattern of the global economy. Fundamental to these changes is the growing interdependence of nations, the recognition of which would require a more favourable international economic environment that would help to overcome the imbalances in the world economy. The revival of multilateralism is keenly needed so that the process of meaningful dialogue in areas relating to international economic co-operation may begin.\nThe general debate in the Assembly sets the tone for co-operation between nations on affairs of international importance, for which this Organization was created, and the statements we have heard this year inspire us with confidence. At the same time, we note some remarks that do not contribute to the attainment of the purpose of our discussions, and which encroach upon what can be considered natters of an internal nature in the affairs of States. With these thoughts in mind, the delegation of Burma considers it relevant to mention developments that pertain to our country.  My country chartered the course of their history through crises and experienced situations which gravely affect their national life and result in turmoil and unrest and the occurrence of unavoidable incidents. Burma has recently passed through such a phase, which has deeply touted the hearts and minds of the nation, the Government and the people. In such a time, when there is a need to establish law and order, when there are moments of great danger and the nation is threatened, it is the duty and obligation of the authorities of the State to assume their responsibilities to overcome such difficulties.\nThe situation prevailing today is that our nation is overcoming a period of disruption and has achieved a reasonable measure of stability. No outside Power can prescribe for Burma what its future political destiny should be, for it is the right of peoples to determine their own future. In order that the Burmese people may be able to exercise their rights, the State authorities have announced and are making arrangements for the holding of general elections, which will be free and fair and in which all political parties will be able to participate so that the multi-party system of democracy to which the people have been aspiring may be successfully established.\nWith regard to the conduct of its foreign relations, Burma will continue to pursue its traditional independent and active foreign policy and maintain its relations with other countries on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference.\nAs the twentieth century draws to a close, profound changes that will shape life in the century ahead are taking place on the international scene. The problems that beset the world are many and complex and the destinies of nations have become more intertwined than ever before.\nAn atmosphere of optimism now prevails as nations express renewed faith in the United Nations. Such positive developments should bestow upon the Organization greater vitality and strength, as the universal forum for seeking solutions to the problems arising out of the complexities of our time, problems that affect all \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, it gives me particular pleasure to see you in the Chair as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We know that under your guidance this gathering is in good hands. My delegation looks forward to cc-operating with you in the months ahead. At the beginning of this week ray friend and colleague, Mr. Papoulias, the Foreign Minister of Greece, set out before the Assembly the views of the 12 member States of the European Community - including the Netherlands - on a wide range of international issues. This enables roe to concentrate on two major issues that deserve our common attention: the role of the United Nations in the promotion of peace, justice and international law and its significance in the field of human rights. On both subjects I should like to make a few suggestions.\nEarlier this month, in the presence of the Secretary-General, a ceremony in commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Peace Palace, the seat of the International Court of Justice, was held in The Hague. I was intrigued by a Latin phrase on the wall of the large courtroom: \\\"Arma togae c\u00e9dant, this is, \\\"May weapons yield to law\\\". One could hardly think of a more appropriate motto for the present Assembly session than Cicero's dictum. The Assembly convenes at a crucial juncture. In different parts of the world, conflict is giving way to negotiations, and more and more voices are calling for the supremacy of the rule of law. The United Nations may well be about to assume the role its founders envisaged. The United Nations Charter embodies the bold vision of a world-wide system of collective security, with the Security Council as its pivot. As Dag Hamnar once pointed out, the United Nations reflects at the same time an aspiration and a falling short of that aspiration. But, he added, the persistent struggle to close the gap between aspiration and actual accomplishment makes the difference between civilization and chaos.\nDuring these weeks representatives of nations from East and West, North and South, are paying tribute to the Secretary-General and his staff who, quietly but with perseverance, are serving the cause of peace. Like others, we applaud recent achievements in Afghanistan and the Gulf and the new impetuses being given elsewhere. Those developments have added much to the prestige of the Organization and of the Secretary-General. In those developments we recognize vital elements of the recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the Security Council that the Secretary-General advanced in his reports to the General Assembly in 1983 and 1986. At the time, those ideas did not receive the hearing they deserved. Now, the mood of frustration and impotence is giving way to renewed optimism. There seems to be a new confidence in the effectiveness of the multilateral approach in international relations.\nWe must seize the opportunities to promote peace. United Nations peace-keeping is one of them. It is therefore most befitting that the United Nations peace-keeping forces were collectively awarded the Nobel Peace Prize yesterday. On behalf of the Netherlands Government I most warmly congratulate them on that well-deserved award. The Prize honours all those soldiers who over the years have served in United Nations forces all over the world.\nThe Netherlands has always supported the efforts of the United Nations in the field of peace-keeping. We are now actively considering with our partners in the Twelve how we can contribute more effectively. In this context the valuable comments on the growing role of peace-keeping operations in the Secretary-General's annual report to the Assembly certainly deserve careful attention. Of course, one should not overlook the fact that here, as elsewhere, there is an obvious need to make the best possible use of scarce resources. This is the more true in the light of the magnitude of some of the peace-keeping operations that are envisaged, for instance in Namibia and in Western Sahara.  \nFor many years the world community has been demanding independence for Namibia. We are encouraged by the progress recently made. I trust that the momentum can be maintained.\nThe process of dialogue and negotiations we see in many parts of the world is also needed in South Africa itself. Apartheid is totally and fundamentally wrong. It has no future. Although change is long overdue, it is not too late to bring it about peacefully. But every new delay will make the task of national reconciliation even more difficult. The artificial separations apartheid has created between the various segments of the South African population ha/e bred deep resentment and fear of the unknown. In our opinion it is high time to replace this by a broad dialogue across all lines of colour. The Kingdom of the Netherlands urges the South African Government to release Nelson Mandela and all those others detained for their political beliefs. That could open the way to negotiations with the genuine representatives of the population.\nWe look not only to the early abolition of apartheid\u00b7, we look also to its replacement by a just political order in which all South Africans can live in peace and harmony. It is, of course, up to the South African peoples themselves to join hands in order to shape a new constitutional framework. But let me say this on the subject: the ideals of human rights, democracy and the rule of law to which ray country, like so many others, is deeply attached, would seem all the more essential in a society as diverse as South Africa's. May I submit that a bill of rights, to be negotiated and agreed upon between the authentic representatives of the entire population and safeguarded by an independent judiciary, would do much to guarantee equal rights and allay the fears that some have. Would not a pluralistic democracy providing adequate participation by both majority and minority offer the best prospects for lasting reconciliation? And, nay I add, would not a South Africa at peace with itself be a tremendous asset for the region as a whole?\nThe cease-fire in the 8-year-old war between Iraq and Iran was greeted with great relief. Untold suffering is coming to an end. But there was more to this war. In flagrant violation of international law we saw chemical weapons being used on a scale not witnessed since the First World War. The war endangered yet another principle of international law, namely freedom of navigation, on one of the busiest sea-lanes of the world. It was to uphold that principle that my country, together with a number of other Western European countries, contributed to mine-clearing in the Gulf. We have noted with interest that the Secretary-General has suggested looking into the possibilities of extending peace-keeping to the maritime environment. We are prepared to study the implications of such a new dimension in United Nations peace-keeping tasks.\nNegotiations between the two belligerents have now started under the auspices of the Secretary-General. The intransigence that has prolonged the war for so many years should not be transferred to the negotiating table. Together with others, we call upon both parties to co-operate intensively with the Secretary-General in order to achieve a comprehensive peace settlement in compliance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987).\nTurning to Cambodia, we welcome the intensified diplomatic efforts to read a settlement and the constructive role played by the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Cambodia has had more than its share of suffering. Our goal must be an independent Cambodia, free from foreign occupation and invested with democratic institutions strong enough to withstand internal and external threats. Clearly, neither a continuation of the current foreign the universally condemned policies and practices of the regional conflicts also, we see how the improved activities of States in the region and the support given to each other in working towards peaceful is that was found for direct talks between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus is another example of progress to that end.\nAnd in another hotbed of tension an unjust and painful stalemate continues to exist. We are looking forward to the day when the United Nations can also play an enhanced role in the settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The status quo there is not sustainable. The tensions in the occupied territories demonstrate the need for a renewed impetus to the peace process. My country fully understands the Israeli concerns about security. Israel, indeed, is entitled to existence in security. But the Palestinian people too have their legitimate rights. Their right to self-determination will have to be accommodated in the context of a comprehensive and lasting settlement. In recent meetings with the Israeli Government and with Palestinian representatives in East Jerusalem, the Netherlands Government joined those who urged moderation and a constructive approach by all concerned. \nThe road to a settlement will no doubt be long. It might have to be covered in stages, but then with a clear final perspective. Success will only be achieved if parties are willing to compromise, if parties do not confront each other with conditions they know beforehand to be unacceptable to the other side. Peace involves mutual concessions. Delaying the inevitable will diminish the opportunities of reaching a solution and will only increase the tensions. The role of the international community is, as we see it, not merely to mete out reprimands, it is to help the peace process along and eventually, once the negotiations have led to results, to guarantee their outcome.\nWe are concerned about developments in Lebanon and saddened by the continuing suffering of its people. We urge all parties concerned to abstain from any action that would deepen the rifts that have kept Lebanon divided for so long already. It is imperative that the constitutional framework of Lebanon be allowed to function so that a new President, elected freely and without interference from outside, can take up the pressing task of restoring the unity of the Lebanese people.\nMuch is changing in Eastern Europe. We follow the processes of reform with great interest and commend the spirit of greater openness. My country has, together with its allies, consistently pursued a policy aimed at better East-West relations and arms control. We will not be remiss in seizing opportunities to further these aims. Important progress in arms control has already been achieved, and this to an extent that seemed inconceivable only a few years ago.\nThe Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty was indeed a major breakthrough. And the 50-per-cent cut in strategic weapons, which is now being negotiated, would be an even more significant disarmament measure. But however much we hope for further results in the field of nuclear disarmament, it is essential that progress should also encompass conventional arms control. The serious conventional imbalance we face in Europe is at the core of our security problem, and our aim is to bring about a stable conventional balances at lower levels and with more transparency.\nIt is also essential to press ahead with a total ban on chemical weapons. The imminent danger of proliferation of chemical weapons underlines once again the need for such a ban, and that on a world-wide basis. Indeed, the verification problems are daunting, but I refuse to believe that they cannot be solved. In the meantime, while a total ban has not yet been concluded, it is tragic to see that the 1925 Geneva Protocol has not prevented the use of these abhorrent weapons. We support President Reagan's proposal, made last Monday, to convene a conference to see how together we can remedy the erosion of the Protocol.\nWhen addressing the third special session on disarmament I emphasized how important it was that the Secretary-General be able to conduct investigations, whenever there were allegations of the use of chemical weapons. The Security Council confirmed this necessity and encouraged him to carry out promptly investigations in response to allegations concerning the possible use of chemical weapons. It is therefore disappointing and disturbing to note that recently the Secretary-General was not permitted to ascertain the facts when there were strong reasons to do so.\nIt is indeed a worrisome development that \\\"proliferation\\\", which used to refer exclusively to the danger of nuclear proliferation nowadays is acquiring new connotations, as we see proliferation, not only in the chemical field but also in that of missiles and missile technology. It would be a bitter irony if at a time when arms control negotiations are at last beginning to yield long-sought results, we failed to stem the danger of proliferation.\nA key element of any arms control agreement is verification, and I am happy to note the growing international consensus on this point. In my statement at the third special session on disarmament last June I suggested strengthening the general role of the United Nations with regard to verification in a practical manner. Our proposal is that a group of qualified governmental experts would study ways to improve the assistance United Nations bodies could render in the verification of arms control agreements. This would apply in the first place to multilateral agreements and, furthermore, to regional, or even bilateral agreements, if parties so desired. Together with Canada and Prance, we intend to submit our ideas to the Assembly in greater detail.\nMaintaining peace and security is a primary task of the United Nations, but by no means the only one. All of us should seriously consider how we can increase the relevance of the role of the Organization in the light of constantly changing conditions, how we can enhance its efficiency and flexibility, and how we can counteract bureaucratic tendencies and duplication.\nThe Netherlands has participated actively in the special committee on the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations. I must admit that we are rather disappointed with the outcome of these deliberations so far. None the less, we must continue this reform process in order to enable the United Nations to increase its relevance also in the economic and social fields.\nOne does not have to be a prophet to foresee a major transformation of the international system in the decades ahead. The spectacular emergence of new economic centres in various parts of the third world is only one indication that we are witnessing a development towards greater multipolarity. This in itself could enrich the interaction amongst us, and, it is to be hoped, will increase the effectiveness of the United Nations when new actors assume larger responsibilities for the common good.\nThe recent economic recovery in the industrialized countries has not yet led to an improvement of the economic situation in many parts of the developing world. I believe that it is high time to remind ourselves of the target for official development assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product that has been adopted. In order to assist the economic and social advancement of developing countries, the Netherlands will continue to disburse 1 per cent of its gross domestic product for development purposes.\nThe review of the Programme of Action for Africa has made clear that it is Africa in particular that is facing economic problems of staggering magnitude. I am convinced, however, that the review has provided important impetus to both the African countries and the international community to redouble our common efforts to reach the goals of the action plan in time. The debate on the strategy for the fourth development decade offers a good opportunity to discuss the interrelationships and mutual dependence of specific development topics such as debts, investments, the environment, natural resources, commodities and trade and their implications for sustainable development. As a contribution to solving some of the most pressing environmental problems, my Government will host high-level consultations on the ozone layer next month and a conference on the protection of the atmosphere next year in the Netherlands.\nRegional co-operation has much to offer to people on all continents, both as a way to promote peace and as an instrument for increasing prosperity. Integration amongst European nations has allowed us not only to overcome a bitter legacy of division but also to achieve a considerable degree of prosperity for our peoples. Our endeavours have not led to Euro centrism but stimulated even an outward orientation of Western Europe. One large single market instead of 12 separate smaller markets should offer new opportunities, not only for the Community, but for third-world countries as well.\nWe do not see regional co-operation as a substitute for global co-operation. The two complement each other. Interdependence and co-operation are at the heart of the new global reality and the United Nations should be an energetic reflection of that reality.\nThe Olympic games provide us, right at this moment, with a powerful symbol of brotherhood and friendly competition. Against this background I may say that we hope that the Republic of Korea, now hosting the games, can soon take up its rightful place in this universal Organization.\nIn order to strengthen the basis for global co-operation we must reflect upon the values that bind us together. Article I of the United Nations Charter lists the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms among the three main purposes of the United Nations. Forty years ago, the General Assembly, building on this foundation, proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since then, the universal applicability of the Declaration has been firmly established.\nHuman rights transcend national borders. Violations of these rights - and they are only too frequent - are a common concern of the family of nations. They are not simply an internal matter within the exclusive domain of national sovereignty. The past 40 years have clearly refuted this argument.\nThe 1948 Declaration was the starting-point of an impressive effort at international law-making. The two United Nations Covenants on human rights, of 1966, were milestones in this effort and it is to be hoped that in this year, in which we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, those Member States that have not yet acceded to some of the United Nations instruments on human rights will be able to decide to do so in the near future. Let us be clear - the concept of human rights was not an invention to be used to attack those with whom we find ourselves in disagreement. No, we refer to fundamental standards on which we should all be prepared to be judged. Moreover, we feel that respect for human rights is essential for confidence-building between States.\nFormal accession by countries to the various conventions is important, but it is only a first step. Implementation must follow - and as we all know, that is where the real problems begin. This underlines the importance of the various monitoring procedures and mechanisms designed to hold States to their obligations. Signs of erosion of the supervisory system are a cause of concern. We would hope that the meeting of chairpersons of the various United Nations supervisory bodies scheduled for this autumn will be able to propose practical remedies to remove the strain on the reporting system. At the same time it is essential that adequate levels of funding for human rights monitoring mechanisms be secured. The Netherlands has circulated some ideas on monitoring procedures and mechanisms amongst these chairpersons. These suggestions will also be circulated in a document in the course of this session of the General Assembly.\nAs I have said, efforts at the regional level can supplement and reinforce those at the global level. In the Helsinki Final Act 35 countries pledged themselves to a broad programme designed to improve mutual relations. This programme includes respect for a comprehensive range of clearly defined human rights. Here, too, we have been faced too long with a gap between the standards we set and the degree to which they are being complied with. That is why the Netherlands insisted so strongly on the incorporation, within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), of a mechanism to review compliance in the field of human rights and human contacts. I hope that this concept will be reflected in the final document of the CSCE which, as we all hope, the current meeting in Vienna will be able to agree upon soon.\nThere is much to celebrate during the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration. But celebrations or commemorations should not divert our attention from the more sobering task of stock-taking. We should ask ourselves to what degree the rights proclaimed are actually promoted and enjoyed. Torture, summary executions and unlawful detention are an everyday reality for all too many of our fellow human beings. And yet, there is probably no government that does not profess respect for human rights. Let us not forget that the scourge of the abuse of human rights is man-made; it can therefore be remedied by man. The international Bill of Human Rights exists; the mechanisms are in place. Our task in the years ahead should be to promote the political will to bring about the effective enjoyment of human rights by all mankind.\nThere is a growing realization that these concepts, while values in themselves, are also basic conditions for shaping a more prosperous and a more just society. Freedom and democracy, we feel, are not luxuries. On the contrary, they go hand in hand with development and prosperity. The age of technology gives an advantage to those societies that allow information to circulate freely and give room to the innovative capabilities of the individual.\nBut if we cherish human rights so much, it is not only for their intrinsic value or for their contribution to the prosperity of man. Human rights are, as the Universal Declaration states, \\\"the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\\\". Indeed, internal oppression and external aggression have often gone together. It could not have been phrased more aptly than it was by the Secretary-General during his recent stay in the Netherlands when he said that \\\"respect for human rights and peace are inseparable. Just as the violation of human rights leads to conflict, so conflict and war lead, all too often, to the suppression of human rights.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI warmly congratulate Mr. Caputo of Argentina on his election to the important post of President of this General Assembly. Our two countries share important objectives in relation to Antarctica and the liberalization of trade in agricultural products. I also acknowledge the courageous role he personally has played in the consolidation of constitutional democracy in Argentina. It is a great pleasure, therefore, to see him presiding over our deliberations at this particularly auspicious time for the United Nations. \nThis year of 1988 is not only a special one for Australia, marking our bicentenary, but also for the United Nations, marking as it does the fortieth anniversary of the? Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a landmark in the struggle of the international community to guarantee individual rights for all people. Not entirely coincidentally, it is also the fortieth anniversary of the presidency of this Assembly of one of the founding fathers of the United Nations, and one of its strongest voices on behalf of the small and middle Powers, Herbert Vere Evatt, then Foreign Minister of Australia, who worked strenuously for, and announced during his presidency, the adoption by the General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nIn preparing to address this Assembly for the first time, I turned for a little encouragement to the wisdom and writing of my distinguished Labour Government predecessor, and I was not disappointed. A very great deal that Mr. Evatt did and thought, and that was important to him, stands the test of those 40 years. Twice in his lifetime Mr. Evatt had seen the world tear itself apart. In the First World War both his brothers were killed. He had seen the League of Nations collapse into impotence and irrelevance. In the Second World War he had been Foreign Minister when Australia was in grave peril. To him, therefore# the introduction to the Charter - \\\"We, the people of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\" - was not just a resounding piece of rhetoric but a commitment born of despair and necessity.\nFortunately, we have all been spared a third world war since then but this period has seen, tragedy and suffering wrought on our fellow human beings by a continuous epidemic of conflicts - both regional and internal - which have blotted the world's landscape. We have seen the return of chemical weapons. War has filled the refugee camps of the world. Violence has been father to suffering poverty and homelessness, on a scale that indicts us all.\nThe United Nations has performed indispensable work in dealing with the tragic consequences of these conflicts  but the sad reality is that for most of the past four decades it has largely been blocked from performing the task for which it was pre-eminently created, the peaceful resolution of conflict itself. So it is with a profound sense of hope for the future that we look back over the past 18 months. From southern Africa to the Western Sahara, through the Middle East, the Mediterranean, across to Afghanistan and Cambodia, we see the United Nations, led by its Secretary-General, at last bringing to bear the collective will and commitment of the nations of the world.\nThe Secretary-General and the United Nations peace-keeping forces thoroughly deserve their award of this year's Nobel Peace Prize. The Prize is a very timely, recognition of the commitment that this Organization must continue to assert: that deep-seated and genuine differences must be resolved without blood and agony for ordinary men and women caught up in conflicts not of their own making.\nIn Afghanistan, despite many problems, the Geneva Agreements are holding. The Soviet Union has met the target for the withdraw of 50 per cent of its forces, and we urge that it maintain the agreed target of the complete withdrawal. Withdrawal will provide the conditions for the essential next step of allowing the people of Afghanistan to decide for themselves the form of government. The international community has a responsibility, through the United Nations, to assist in the reconstruction of that land devastated by invasion and war and to help provide for the millions of refugees it has created.\nWe have all greeted with immense relief the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, another extraordinary achievement of the United Nations. But we are deeply concerned that, although the fighting has stopped, there has been little apparent progress in talks between Iran and Iraq under the auspices of the Secretary-General. Australia urges both countries to bring about an enduring peace, in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987),\nIn southern Africa there is a distinct prospect that independence for Namibia is at hand but it is still only a prospect. As a traditional supporter of the United Nations peace-keeping activities, Australia reconfirms its willingness to participate in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group for Namibia,\nAustralia also fully supports the efforts of the Secretary-General towards resolving the conflict in Western Sahara. In recent weeks, the most promising meetings in many years have occurred between the President of Cyprus and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, again under the auspices of the Secretary-General,\nThere have also been encouraging signs in my own region. My visit to New Caledonia three weeks ago and my discussions there with all major parties confirm that the process set in train by the Matignon and Oudinot accords not only is workable but has generated a whole new spirit of reconciliation and optimism. The process to which the Rocard Government and all the major groups in New Caledonia have committed themselves has Australia's support and that of the South Pacific Forum. We in the South Pacific share with France a determination to assist the peaceful evolution of New Caledonia to self-determination in a way which ensures that the legitimate interests of all the people of New Caledonia, including its indigenous Melanesian population, are fully protected, and their aspirations are given a chance to be realized.\nOnce again, after many years, Korea is on the agenda of the General Assembly - but for the first time as a single item. Australia heartily endorses the common goal of this new item peace, reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula. Australia finds encouraging the recent willingness by both South and North Korea to consider resuming dialogue. We believe there is now a real opportunity to bring to an end 35 years of confrontation.\nThere have also been important recent developments relating to the conflict in Cambodia. Talks are taking place among the concerned parties. The Jakarta Informal Meeting, ably presided over by Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas, realistically noted that a solution would require not only the withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces but also the prevention of the return of the genocidal policies and practices of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) draft resolution this year makes that point, and we welcome that statement.\nThere remain, regrettably, a number of regional conflicts and tensions where there has been less progress.\nAustralia is especially concerned about the seemingly intractable nature of the Arab-Israeli dispute. Australia's commitment to the State of Israel is firm; it may be traced back to Mr. Evatt's time and it has not wavered since. The right of Israel to exist within secure and recognized boundaries is and must remain an indispensable condition of peace. It is from this firm basis of commitment and friendship to Israel that we say that peace and justice for Israel will be found only when there is also peace and justice for the Palestinians. \n\nThe right of self-determination for the Palestinian people, including, if they so choose, the possibility of an independent Palestinian State, must be recognized. Israel's friends can only view with concern the continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Recent events there put at stake its reputation and future as a liberal democratic State and risk increasing isolation from traditional friends and supporters, like ourselves, who place priority on respect for democratic ideals and fundamental human rights.\nIt is also time for the Palestinians to take historic decisions regarding their relations with Israel. The Palestine Liberation Organization must reject, unequivocally, the use of terror, accept the process of negotiation and be prepared, clearly and without equivocation, to recognize Israel; To be durable, any negotiated settlement must take account of the legitimate interests also of the Syrian Arab Republic, Jordan, Lebanon and other countries of the region.\nIn Burma we have witnessed tragic loss of life as the Burmese people have struggled for their political and economic rights. The Burmese people have our deepest sympathy, and I offer to them Australia's support in the period of reconstruction and reconciliation which must follow the resolution of the current crisis.\nWhile there is much still to be done, recent events do hold out prospects for peace that only a few years ago would have been thought of as naive fantasy. Who among us two years ago - even one year ago - would have envisaged, for example, that President Reagan would be able to stand before us at this time and say that in many regional conflicts the Soviet Union had shown a \\\"spirit of constructive realism\\\"? The United Nations itself has been a crucial contributor to the improved East-West atmosphere. The United Nations needs the great Powers, but the great Powers also need the United Nations. There is a wide and growing agenda of issues that cannot be resolved by the great Powers acting unilaterally or bilaterally. The great Powers, alone or together, can hamstring the United Nations; but, alone or together, they cannot by themselves make it work. An effective United Nations requires the collective will and commitment of the whole international community. It is only when this is fully accepted by everyone that the recovery of the United Nations, with all its potential, will become permanent. \nThere can be few areas where this is better exemplified than disarmament and arms control. The conclusion by the United States and the Soviet Union of the Treaty on the Elimination of intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, the first arms-control agreement eliminating an entire class of nuclear weapons, is a truly significant development, as is the acceptance under that agreement of highly intrusive provisions for verification, which, in turn, make further agreements possible. Great progress has been made towards concluding an agreement to cut by SO per cent strategic nuclear arsenals and for all those developments Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev deserve the gratitude of us all.\nBut nuclear disarmament and arms control are not matters exclusively for those great Powers that currently possess nuclear weapons. For if there is nuclear conflict, it is not just the peoples of the nuclear-weapon States who will suffer. The peoples of the world will be devastated. As the potential victims of nuclear catastrophe, the peoples of all nations have the right to demand real progress and the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. They have the right to demand that the nuclear-arms race not take new forms, including its spread into outer space.\nOne of the few things that has given the people of the world some confidence that nuclear catastrophe will not occur is that almost all the nations of the world have undertaken not to acquire nuclear weapons. Australia considers the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which embraces that commitment, to be perhaps the single most important arms-control agreement in existence. We consider its preservation to be of paramount importance to peace and security.\nWe understand and have shared the frustrations many countries feel at the glacial pace of progress towards nuclear disarmament, but we do not believe that frustration is well served by bringing into question the Non-Proliferation Treaty itself. Does any nation really believe that its security or the safety of the world would be served by a world in which yet more States had nuclear weapons? Further nuclear proliferation would bring about an even more desperately dangerous world than the one we now inhabit. So we appeal once more to those countries that have not yet become parties to the Treaty to do so without delay. And, remembering - as we always must - the terms of the compact that lies behind the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in which the nuclear-weapon States undertook to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good faith and at an early date, we appeal once again to those existing nuclear-weapon States to accelerate the progress they have been making towards the elimination of those weapons.\nThe urgent conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty to prohibit all nuclear tests by all States in all environments for all time would be a major barrier to the further refinement of nuclear weapons, and it would be an additional obstacle to prospective proliferation. I hope the Assembly will once more resoundingly call upon the Conference on Disarmament to resume work on its nuclear-testing item.\nThe most immediate threat is posed by chemical weapons. The Secretary-General, after careful investigation, has found repeated use of chemical weapons in the Gulf region. We condemn such use without qualification or equivocation. We are convinced that the only solution to the increasing use and spread of these abhorrent weapons lies in the early conclusion by the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva of a comprehensive chemical-weapons convention. Australia actively supports all practical measures to advance the negotiations for a convention and to prevent the further erosion of international norms against the use of chemical weapons.\nIn this context the proposal for an international conference on chemical weapons use, made last week in the Assembly by President Reagan, has the support of the Australian Government and, we hope, of all Member States of the United Nations. Ito give effect to that proposed we roust seek to ensure that the international conference is open to participation by all States, is convened as soon as possible this year and is attended at a very high level. The conference must have a clearly defined central purpose: a declaration that chemical weapons roust never be used and a commitment to bring into existence \u0430 universal chemical-weapons convention, as currently being negotiated in Geneva, which would rid the world of chemical weapons for all time.\nOne of the clear messages to come from the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament in June was that we all have a responsibility for disarmament. We cannot lay the blame for the state o\u00a3 the world only at the door of whose who possess nuclear arsenals.\nThe quest for greater security through higher and higher levels of conventional arms is only too well known too us all. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development provided ample evidence. It is a simple proposition that more arms do not equal greater security. They feed the apathy of instability and the offers of those who choose to supply arms at levels that are well beyond those needed for self-defence. The only way that peace and security will ultimately be guaranteed is by universal acceptance of the principles of common security so well articulated by the Palme Commission in 1982, the thrust of whose conclusions is that no country can guarantee its own security by threatening others and that real security is achieved, not against other countries, but with them.\nWhile the founders of the Organization saw immediate issues of peace and security as the pre-eminent role of the United Nations, they also understood clearly that the roots of many of the world's conflicts lay in poverty, suffering and abuses of human rights. \nAustralia insists that human rights know no boundaries. Human rights must always be high on the Organization's agenda. The repulsive and contemptible system of apartheid in South Africa is the most serious instance of institutionalized abuse of human rights facing us today, and we continue to urge the United Nations Security Council to adopt comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions as an effective means of bringing apartheid to a peaceful end.\nIn the absence of such mandatory United Nations sanctions we have worked within the Commonwealth to develop an effective pattern of economic sanctions aiming particularly the banking and financial system, as well as strategies to meet South African propaganda and to strengthen the economic security of the front-line States in meeting destabilization by South Africa.\nAustralia also recognizes that all countries must be answerable to the nations of the world on these issues, and we are willing ourselves to answer to the nations of the world for Australian policies and actions. Every year sees an anniversary of one kind or another, but 1988 is, as I have already said, a special one for my country. Two hundred years ago Europeans arrived to establish permanent settlement in Australia. Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, of course, were there before us. They are, in fact, celebrating at this time not their bicentenary, but their bicentennial bicentenary - some 40,000 years of habitation on Australian soil. All too many of the 200 years of European settlement have been, for our original Australians, years of discrimination, cruelty and oppression, Australians today cannot reverse that history, but not are today's Australians responsible for it. Our duty today is to acknowledge the truth of our history and to redress it.\nIn the past 20 years significant progress has been made. Aboriginal and Islander Australians have the same legal and civil rights as other Australians. We are taking special measures to accelerate access to services and to provide a basis for further economic, social and legal advancement. We are seeking to complete a compact or agreement with our Aboriginal people and Islanders, acknowledging their rightful place not only in the past of our ancient continent but in its present and future.\nAlthough much has been done to improve the position of Aboriginal Australians, much remains to be done. We have undertaken to the descendants of our original inhabitants - and I repeat that undertaking to the United Nations - that we will leave undone nothing that can be done co right this great wrong of our past. ... Social prejudice and discrimination have, no place in any contemporary society and have none in my country today. Over 20 years ago bipartisan agreement was achieved within Australia to bring to an end the abhorrent but long officially sanctioned racially restrictive immigration policy. I bring here now, on behalf of my Government, the solemn undertaking, recently confirmed by resolution of both Houses of our national Parliament, that never, again shall we allow race to be used as a criterion in the exercise of our sovereign right to decide who shall enter our country. That undertaking is made hot only as a reflection of deeply held principle but also because if Australia were to do otherwise we would deserve the censure of the world. \nAustralia shares with developing countries the conviction that the United Nations has a major role to play in the areas of international trade and development. We have a commitment second to none to ensuring the success of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). That Round is a historic opportunity for the world to demonstrate conclusively its commitment to the multilateral trading system and to forestall the fragmentation into hostile trading blocs that damaged us all in the 1930s. The potential benefits of liberalization are great and the need is urgent. Results in key areas will be very important at the mid-term review of the Uruguay Round to be held at Montreal in December. Early results will enhance the confidence of the participants in the Round and establish a solid base for its ultimate success.\nAs efficient producers of agricultural commodities, Australia and its fellow members of the Cairns Group of Fair Trading Nations in Agriculture have a common Interest in promoting a more liberal trading system in agriculture. The benefits, however, can be far more widely shared. Recent research indicates that food importers would benefit from liberalization and the removal of distortions in international agricultural trade. The adoption of market-oriented agricultural policies in the industrialized countries lies at the heart of the agricultural trade reform issue.\nNor are our interests confined to agricultural trade reforms. Australia strongly supports efforts to strengthen the GATT framework, secure a broad-based liberalization of trade and extend multilateral discipline into new areas such as services and intellectual-property rights. The Uruguay Round provides an opportunity for us all to tackle these persistent and serious problems, an opportunity that might not come again soon.\nThe value of the United Nations is demonstrated most particularly when the Organization helps resolve problems which respect no national boundaries. One such problem is the environment, especially changes to the world's climate. Australia and our island neighbours in the Pacific and Indian Oceans have already pointed to the potentially serious consequences of the warming of the Earth's atmosphere. The very existence of a number of our fellow countries in the world is at stake. It is only by a total international commitment that we can protect ourselves, and we look to the General Assembly to give a stronger focus to international measures for dealing with this threat to our environment.\nThe Antarctic Treaty is a good example of international co-operation embracing environmental and disarmament concerns. It has grown from the original 12 signatories in 1959 to 38 with the accession in May of Canada. The disarmament provisions of the Antarctic Treaty ensure that the Territory is used only for peaceful purposes. The Treaty has promoted scientific research, environmental protection and conservation, has kept the continent free from international tensions, and deserves continuing support.\nThis session of the General Assembly has commenced on a note of high optimism not least because of the commitment of the United States to meet its financial obligations to the United Nations and to pay its arrears. Australia has always maintained that all Member States must abide by their obligations to the Charter of the United Nations. All should pay their assessed contribution in full and on time, and Australia has always done so.\nThe decision of the United States to meet its financial obligations should not give rise, however, to complacency about the need for reform. Much has been done to make the United Nations more efficient since the Group of 18 Intergovernmental Experts submitted its report on reform in 1986, but there is still much to be done, especially in implementing an improved budgetary process, ordering priorities and avoiding duplication. A strong, efficient United Nations is the best guarantee that the Organization will be able to meet the new and different challenges it confronts. It is only if the United Nations is strong and efficient that continued support can be guaranteed from the parliaments and the taxpayers of its Member States, This is especially the case at a time when new peace-keeping operations are likely to place much greater burdens on us all,\nAustralia will not shrink from its share of that burden now that the United Nations is succeeding in its pre-eminent role of peace-maker and peace-keeper. We have contributed personnel and financial resources to the peace-keeping force in the Gulf; we have committed funds for the rehabilitation of Afghanistan; we have committed ourselves in principle to providing 300 personnel to United Nations transitional arrangements in Namibia, It is against that background - and with those credentials, I guess - that we urge the Secretariat to ensure rigorous economy in developing its peace-keeping plans.\nThe reform process should proceed at many levels. There is an urgent need for rationalization of the economic and social areas of the United Nations. The Secretary-General must have greater flexibility in adjusting the human resources of the Organization to meet emerging priorities such as peace-keeping, human rights, drug-control programmes and the status of women,\nI began my remarks today by referring to Mr. Evatt, Lat me conclude the same way. Evatt was a towering figure in Australian life. He was one of our greatest lawyers, a judge of our High Court, Chief Justice of a State Supreme Court. He was Attorney-General; Foreign Minister and a Leader of the Opposition. He was a journalist and a writer - not always the same thing. For decades he was at the centre of political, social and economic change in our nation, often its most controversial figure. He was an ardent nationalist. \nBut to this ardent nationalist nothing in his entire life's work was more important than this international Organization here in New York. For all his many achievements and titles and honours his modest grave in our national capital has inscribed on it only his name and the words \\\"President of the United Nations Assembly\\\".\nEvatt described in his characteristically straightforward way what he saw as the objective of the United Nations. In 1948 he pleaded for Governments to keep faith with their peoples. They wanted, he said, \\\"not very much just peace and justice and decent standards of living, for themselves perhaps, but mainly for their children.\\\"\nThose words are simple and modest. They remind us that this place does not belong to the powerful or the wealthy, that it does not exist for diplomats or officials or statesmen. This Organization belongs to the ordinary men and women of our world. It was founded on a promise to those men and women that never again would their leaders bring upon them war, injustice and poverty. That promise has not to date been honoured.\nWe have today a second chance, a chance to fulfil that 40-year-old promise to our peoples to bring them peace, justice and a decent standard of living.\nLet us get it right this time.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me pleasure, on behalf of the delegation of Lebanon, to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. The relations between his country, Argentina, and mine, Lebanon, are firmly established, deeply rooted and characterized by friendship, co-operation and mutual respect. Since his appointment as Foreign Minister of Argentina, Mr. Caputo has contributed to the consolidation of these relations. We are fully confident, therefore, that his qualifications, experience and wisdom will make him an exemplary President and will ensure the success of the work of this session.\nThe delegation of Lebanon wishes also to extend its thanks and appreciation to Mr. Caputo's predecessor, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Peter Florin, whose wise leadership and great efforts enabled the General Assembly to achieve such good results at its forty-second session.\nIn expressing the thanks of the delegation of Lebanon I must not forget to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his good offices and efforts in the settlement of a number of regional crises and in making the Secretariat more efficient, in difficult financial circumstances. Indeed, the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organisation is clear proof of the success of his sustained efforts.\nThe agenda of the current session of the General Assembly is replete with important items - political, economic, social and legal. Some of these have been on the agenda for years, some for dozens of years, awaiting solution. However, we are still hopeful that just solutions will be found. The recent developments on the questions of Afghanistan, Namibia, Western Sahara, the Iran-Iraq conflict, Kampuchea and Cyprus are encouraging and make us very hopeful that efforts will be intensified to reach genuine solutions to the question of southern Lebanon, the Israeli occupation of a part of Lebanon, the Middle East question, and, in particular, the question of the Palestinian people.\nLarge numbers of Palestinians have been expelled from their homeland and dispersed in various parts of the world. Others live in camps in Arab countries that have taken them in, while the remainder continue to live under Israeli occupation in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Holy Al Quds. The Palestinian people has a legitimate and inalienable right to self-determination, to return to its homeland and to establish an independent State on its own soil. This people, which has expressed its free national will through its blessed uprising inside its homeland, has indicated at every opportunity its complete rejection of all settlement projects, which have also been categorically rejected by Lebanon and other sister Arab countries.\nDespite the ordeal by which it has been afflicted for approximately 14 years, Lebanon has not failed to meet its membership obligations to the United Nations. Lebanon has adhered to the Charter, which it signed as a founding member, and is committed to its provisions and to implementation of the resolutions of the Organization. Lebanon believes that the United Nations plays an important role in various fields, with the aim of improving man's condition and protecting peoples against the forces of oppression and tyranny. \nIn return for those duties and obligations, however, Lebanon has rights. It requires of the Organization that it secure its sovereignty and territorial integrity and ensure the safety of its people. It expects the world community to lend it full support in its efforts to liberate its land and revitalize its institutions, in order to enable it to resume its role at all levels - regional and international.\nIf I confine my statement to the question of southern Lebanon, it is because I believe that the question is extremely critical, since it threatens security and peace not only in the Middle East region, but in the whole world. One of the main causes of the continued ordeal afflicting the Lebanese people for about 14 years has been the continued Israeli aggression against Lebanon and the continued occupation by Israel of parts of our land. This ordeal is today increasing in gravity and complexity, and is reaching alarming dimensions, to the extent that it is now threatening the very unity and existence of Lebanon.\nPaced with this situation, Lebanon is right to concentrate on a question relating to its very future and existence. But in no way does this mean that Lebanon pays no attention to the other questions on the agenda. Lebanon's ordeal has not prevented it from participating in and contributing to the discussion of those questions over the years and striving to find the necessary solutions to them. Lebanon will not hesitate to continue to do so. It declares that it is ready and willing to do its utmost and to co-operate, within its possibilities, with other members of the international community to achieve the desired objectives of the Charter, for the benefit of all mankind.\nSince the creation of Israel in the Middle East region, Lebanon has suffered from invasions of its territory and from practices against its people. During one five-year period alone Lebanon was invaded twice by Israel - in 1978 and in 1982. Previous heads of the Lebanese delegation have spoken at great length about those two invasions and their consequences. Suffice it to mention now that since 1978 Israel has preserved for itself inside Lebanese territory a so-called security zone. Moreover, it has gone much further by continuing to launch repeated acts of aggression and raids against peaceful villages deep inside Lebanese territory - from the sea, by land and by air. \nI need not go into the details of this question, because the abundant complaints lodged by Lebanon, which have been distributed as official documents of the General Assembly and the Security Council to the members of the Organization, are quite sufficient. They prove that Israel is continuing to violate the rules of the United Nations Charter and the provisions of international law and agreements, and that it is still challenging General Assembly and the Security Council resolutions, particularly Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) and other subsequent resolutions. Those resolutions call for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Lebanese territory, the deployment of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to the internationally recognized borders, and support for Lebanon in order to restore its sovereignty and authority over all its territory.\nConsequently, Israel's responsibility is clearly established. Lebanon therefore calls an the United Nations and its Security Council to take a courageous and decisive stand to check Israel's behaviour and to compel it to respect the Charter and to abide by United Nations resolutions. Only full implementation of those resolutions can save Lebanon and the Middle East region from risks that might in turn jeopardize international peace and security. That is the only way to help Lebanon overcome this crisis, achieve territorial integrity, contribute to unifying its population and regain its constructive role within the international community. \nLebanon is yearning for the return of peace and stability, which will enable it to carry out the reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes that would put it back on the track to a normal life. The Lebanese crisis after so many years has created a deteriorating economic and financial situation. Lebanon's needs are estimated to be billions of dollars, and Lebanon expects to receive the necessary support and help from the international community.\nThis year's initiative by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, to collect 85 million for immediate urgent aid to Lebanon was crowned with success. Although the amount collected, $76 million, is, compared with the help needed, symbolic, we are all grateful to the Secretary-General for that important initiative. The delegation of Lebanon would like to place on record its gratitude to the Secretary-General, to all officials of the United Nations organs, and to all specialized agencies, as well as to the States that contributed to meeting this urgent need. It expresses the hope that the Secretary-General will continue his endeavours to provide the necessary aid for Lebanon's reconstruction and rehabilitation.\nThe delegation of Lebanon would like to add its voice to that of the Secretary-General in calling for the provision of the necessary funds for the international peace-keeping forces, particularly the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which is today considered the most important international peace-keeping force. Lebanon is grateful to UNIFIL for the services it has rendered and is still rendering in southern Lebanon. We should like to express our thanks and appreciation to the leadership, the soldiers and the countries contributing to UNIFIL. We therefore call upon the Security Council to adopt the necessary measures to enable UNIFIL to carry out the basic task entrusted to it and to help Lebanon transform its southern region into a region of security and peace. While talking about peace, we cannot omit to mention how gratified we felt upon hearing the news that the Nobel Peace Prize had been awarded this year to the United Nations peace-keeping forces.\nLebanon looks forward to the establishment of a new era following the election of the new President of the Republic, which we hope will take place soon.\nLebanon's national crisis, entrenched for over 14 years now, undoubtedly has its own deep-seated internal causes. Consequently, it can be solved only through a formula of national entente among the Lebanese people themselves. However, this crisis has most certainly had clear regional and International dimensions. The situation in Lebanon has therefore directly and strongly affected, and has in turn been affected by, developments in the situation both inside and outside the Middle East region. For that reason Lebanon will always need positive initiatives on the part of its Arab brethren and of all friendly nations in order to help it overcome the crisis.\nIn conclusion I should like to convey to the members of the General Assembly the hope of my people that they will do their utmost to help Lebanon liberate its territory and also to convey their determination to begin reconstruction and rehabilitation within the framework of a solid national unity, which has been and always will be the best guarantee for a Lebanon of harmony, love and tolerance, an oasis of coexistence and a bridge between East and West.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThere is an awesome power that pervades this Hall and the universe. It is a power that instils courage in the weak and humility in the strong. It is the timeless compassion and mercy of that ultimate and unseen authority chat inspired universal existence. It is to that eternal authority that I now raise my voice in silent thanksgiving and gratitude, for the glorious opportunity to address this dignified audience for the first time of my presidency.\nLet roe register my personal and my country's sincere congratulations to you, Sir, as President of this forty-third session. Your election is a testimony of your acknowledged ability and extensive diplomatic experience as representative of your friendly country, Argentina. We are assured that as you succeed the distinguished and dedicated Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Peter Florin, the work of this Assembly will be further enhanced.\nPermit me also to pay warm tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who has shown tremendous courage in defending the Charter of the United Nations and unwavering tenacity in pursuing the Charter goals of peace and human dignity in all parts of the world. He will surely be remembered as the man who rescued the United Nations from imminent collapse in the face of impossible odds, and quickly transformed it into the most effective universal instrument for neutralizing international tensions and promoting social, political and human rights.\nThere was a time in human history when war was pursued as an affirmation of the strength, courage and honour of men and nations. For others, it was a mechanism for the gratification of personal or territorial ambitions. It produced with traumatic regularity an array of fearsome leaders throughout the centuries. This tale of devastation, carnage and ferocity is catalogued in the pages of history. Today, in our world of the late twentieth century, minor traumas still exist, blemishing the intellectual, artistic and technological achievements of our age. From Kampuchea to southern Africa, from Western Sahara to Central America, the history is painfully familiar, and while the justification may be refined or righteous, the prosecution of war still bears many of the hallmarks of conflicts of distant ages.\nYet, somehow, amid the chaos and devastation, man's ingenuity, underlying his constant struggle for survival, has established a mechanism for the resolution of the enduring problem of war - the United Nations. It has for over 40 years endeavoured to transform much of the energy of nations from actual and potential violence into discussion, debate, negotiation and peace.\nFor 27 years of my country's history. Sierra Leone has had the opportunity to participate in the intercourse among nations in this dignified arena. It has been out pride to do so in the expectation that our young Republic has a contribution to make within the scope of its capabilities. Today, I wish to restate and reaffirm my country's faith and commitment to our Organization and to those noble ideals that inspire its existence. \nI am a simple man, inbred with those traditional values of family, community, religion, liberty and freedom of conscience that nurtured me. My country, sierra Leone, so named after the lion-like configuration of its coastal mountains, has had a long relationship with the world. Situated almost inconspicuously in the bulge o\u00a3 Africa's west coast, it is a land of diversity moulded into a State and a nation in peace and harmony.\nFor 40 years, the United States and the Soviet Union, backed by massive nuclear and conventional arsenals, have faced each other across an ideological divide that has constantly threatened peace. The language that has fostered their interaction has occasionally been uncompromising. But somehow the balance of terror and mutually assured destruction has maintained a nervous peace and stability for four decades. Now, more than ever before, we have the opportunity for establishing appropriate and acceptable criteria, for a comprehensive and durable peace. The citizens of the world cannot forever depend on the threat of mutually assured destruction as a guarantee of peace, stability and an orderly world.\nThe recent series of remarkable successes achieved by the United Nations, especially in the mediation of major regional conflicts, and the generally improved climate of relations among Members of this Organization, particularly between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, provide a much needed departure from the gloom and tension that pervaded the international political climate over the last few years. We appreciate that this significant development has not occurred accidentally, but through the sincere and sustained collective efforts of all the members of the international community. While the significant achievements made recently are a fitting cause for celebration, they should be seen first and foremost as a catalyst for greater efforts at consolidating those gains and for the mobilization of resources to confront new problems.\nWe therefore urge that greater encouragement be given to the Secretary-General in his efforts to advance the progress already achieved in the resolution of the Iran-Iraq conflict. We appeal directly to Iran and Iraq to continue to show maximum good will and co-operation. It is hoped that nothing will be done by outside forces to disturb the delicate negotiations that are currently under way. The chaos and economic devastation this war has produced must be an object lesson, not only for the two combatants, but for all those who contemplate military force as a primary option.\nThe Jakarta informal meeting was one of the most significant diplomatic steps taken so far in the search for a resolution of the Kampuchean problem. For the first time ever it brought together most of the parties to the conflict, including Vietnam. It is important that the momentum created by those diplomatic initiatives should not be allowed to dissipate, and that even as this diplomatic momentum is maintained, the international community should continue to exert other pressures for the withdrawal of occupation troops from Kampuchea and allow the Kampuchean people to establish a government of their choice. As we renew out support for the coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea we commend China and the States members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for their unwavering dedication to the cause of lasting peace in the region.\nThe steady progress made so far in the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan is to be acknowledged and commended. The restoration of normality in that country should be facilitated by a deep and sincere commitment on the part of all parties in the region, to promote genuine national political reconciliation and rapid economic rehabilitation. Efforts should be made to remove any obstruction to the process of complete troop withdrawal.\nIn Western Sahara, the useful collaboration between the Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) constitutes a welcome and effective diplomatic effort, one which has sustained the momentum in the search for a durable settlement of that dispute. In the face of those developments, we express satisfaction at the improvement in relations among countries of the region, in the hope that this will be a significant contribution towards a resolution of the conflict. The fact must however be restated and reaffirmed that only a recognition of the endeavours and decisions of the United Nations will produce a durable foundation for peace.\nWe are gratified that in spite of the occasional difficulties with the implementation of specific aspects of the Arias Plan for the political stabilization of Central America, adherence to its general principles has brought noticeable order into political and diplomatic conduct in the region. I pay a tribute to all the leaders of the Contadora Group of countries, whose collective determination to bring peace and prosperity to that region enjoys my country's admiration and support.\nRecent developments in southern Africa, leading to apartheid South Africa's uncharacteristic eagerness to facilitate Namibian independence, have been truly remarkable. While there are sufficient grounds for cynicism over South Africa's sudden apparent conversion to reason, our awareness of the delicate nature of the negotiations and the need for restrained commitment will limit us to merely extending deep gratitude to all parties who are currently working to bring about the early implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1971)  \nIn marked contrast to the apparent signs of its flexibility over Namibian independence, the racist South African regime continues to resist pressures for the orderly transformation of South Africa into a genuine democracy. In its desperate attempt to maintain itself against overwhelming international rejection, this regime has intensified its aggression against neighbouring African States. In those circumstances, it is important that material assistance to the front-line States be intensified to strengthen their capacity to withstand and resist South Africa's aggression. \nWe renew our support and admiration for the courage of Nelson Mandela, the fight for whose release from illegal imprisonment should continue to be a priority for all those with a conscience and a sense of justice. We also acknowledge the sacrifice and dedication of the freedom fighters, and the remarkable courage and dedication of Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\nIt is with a tremendous sense of hope that I express satisfaction and optimism that someday the very foundations of apartheid will be dashed to pieces. The signs ate potent. David Bruce is a young, white South African, a conscientious objector, gaoled for refusing to be drafted into the South African army, which is a racist military machine devoted to the defence of apartheid. Many like David Bruce, have registered their repugnance and resistance.\nRecent attempts at resolving the Korean question, though significant, need to be further intensified. While we congratulate the two Koreas on their fortieth anniversary, we have great faith in the ability of their people to strive and overcome existing obstacles to the achievement of durable peace in the peninsula. The international community and, indeed, the United Nations have a responsibility to contribute to this effort and help release the enormous potential of the Korean people to contribute to the well-being of the world. The situation in the Arab territories occupied by Israel represents a disturbing contrast to the general climate of relaxation of tension in all parts of the world. The great and sustained impact of the intifada, or protests by the Palestinian people  in the face of continued repression, clearly underlines the high cost and futility of attempts to perpetuate an unjust situation.\nIt will be tragic if we fail to learn an important lesson that has emerged from the intifada - that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is indeed the authentic and sole representative of the Palestinian people and that to continue to pretend otherwise can only further complicate the suffering and the instability in the occupied lands.\nWe therefore see great merit in the convening, under the auspices of the United Nations, of an international conference on the Middle East, at which all parties involved, including the PLC, will participate on an equal footing. In the meantime, my country renews its support of the Palestinian people and to the leadership  f the PLO.\nThe diminishing of regional conflicts is only one of the many steps necessary to ensure a stable and peaceful world. Another important step is to ensure predictability in the relationship between the super-Powers. In this regard, we should acknowledge the leading role played by President Ronald Reagan of the United States of America and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union in fostering a climate of cordiality in the relations between their countries, particularly the recent signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty. We express the hope that the climate will be improved with further wide-ranging disarmament actions, particularly in the area of multilateral disarmament negotiations. \nThe economic difficulties of the developing countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, continue to pose the most immediate challenge to the Organization and to the entire international community. Since the beginning of this decade, the economies of those countries have stumbled from one economic crisis to another, leaving behind them widespread human misery and damage to the foundations of those societies.\nWhile it is noted that the international community has responded generously to emergency requirements, support for long-term development programmes has generally not been quite so impressive. Our efforts to mobilize our internal resources to address the economic difficulties facing us have been undermined by a host of intractable obstacles, among which are the steep and continuous decline in our export earnings, the shortage of appropriate human resources and a heavy debt burden. We are therefore encouraged that the Secretary-General has emphasized in his report that debt, trade and commodities and human resource development are three main areas in the economic field where the international community needs to act urgently. It is in that context that we acknowledge the important initiative taken by some creditor countries to cancel the debts of low-income developing countries, including Sierra Leone. It is also highly significant that leaders of the major industrial countries are now considering the possibility of debt cancellation as a serious idea. We hope that this climate of unprecedented consensus on the approaches to solving the debt problem will quickly lead to concrete action by the international community to lighten the debt burden of developing countries.\nWe would also welcome a review of World Bank and International Monetary Fund conditionalities to enable low-income countries to gain access to funds specially reserved for assistance to those countries by those institutions.\nWe also believe that there is an urgent need to create a climate of absolute understanding and trust among donor countries, the financial institutions and recipient countries in the area of implementation of economic reform programmes. This area has been a source of great and painful friction between the donor community on the one hand and the recipient countries on the other.\nWhile the necessity for economic reform is widely accepted by developing countries, it has been observed that the reform process is a delicate activity that could cause great suffering in society and harm to the economy, particularly if it is pursued too vigorously without sufficient supporting measures. Indeed, some time ago, when my country adopted a wide-ranging reform programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund, we were forced to suspend its implementation when the mounting toll of human misery could no longer be justified. Many basic commodities became unaffordable to the ordinary members of society, as prices rocketed with the sudden removal of subsidies, exacerbated by a general wage freeze and a series of massive currency devaluations which left our currency greatly weakened. \nReform of our economy continues to be a major national priority. The loss of financial support from the international financial institutions which followed our suspension of aspects of the original programme has however weakened our strength to pursue this priority. We therefore appeal particularly to the international institutions for understanding and support to enable us to carry out reforms in an orderly and effective manner.\nIt is appropriate at this juncture to express deep appreciation to friendly Governments whose bilateral assistance has helped to sustain us during our period of difficulty. In the same vein we acknowledge the important contribution of the various United Nations agencies including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In particular our commitment to ensure the survival and healthy development of our children has drawn great strength from the efforts of UNICEF.\nThe purposes and principles of the United Nations, proclaimed in its Charter 43 years ago, set a high moral tone and the values and concepts enshrined in that Charter ate certainly enabling. As we understand it, the insistence of the Charter on encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms also implied a commitment by Governments to accept culpability, or at least moral responsibility, for violations of the human rights of their citizens, when the United Nations proclaimed its principles in the wake of the radioactive contamination of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the torment, torture and guilt of that best forgotten era were still fresh in the minds of the founding fathers. Culpability may be moral, legal or religious, depending on one's cultural background and perception. It is an embarrassing fact, however, that some States which ate parties to the Charter and which have stringent laws to protect their own environment allow their citizens to effect toxic pollution on defenceless developing countries. If it is an offence for someone in one country to dispose of toxic wastes without adhering to stipulated legal guidelines or fulfilling mandatory requirements, it should be equally essential for the laws of that country to make it reprehensible for any adventurer to deposit such wastes in any other country of the world.\nThe magnitude and complexity of this problem demand effective supportive action by the countries of origin of toxic waste as well as by the international community collectively. The initiative by the United Nations Development Programme to draft a convention on trans-frontier movements of waste is a welcome response. We believe countries of origin of hazardous waste have an obligation to extend their domestic legislation on hazardous waste disposal to regulate the disposal of such wastes abroad.\nIt has been with profound joy and satisfaction that I have been able to take part in this session, and as I go back home to Sierra Leone I take with me a message of hope and optimism for the future of the human family, within the scope of the United Nations. Those who preceded us in the formative years of this Organization have spoken eloquently about two issues - peace and development. Those terms carry grave implications for ail men, for peace does not refer only to an absence of war neither does development refer only to the presence of material progress. They are central today in the interactions among States, as they have always been, and they hold the key to the solutions of many of the world's critical issues. Peace is the abiding desire of mankind the world over. It is a condition deeper in conception, interpretation and realization. The search for it has moved statesmen throughout history and produced agreements, pacts and treaties; equally so has the breach of it spawned a multitude of aggressions and violence that span generations.\nFor the small and weak nations of the third world the United Nations is the ultimate platform for the search for peace. It is the arena that enables the instincts and precludes the realization of the dreams of evil men. In a world of competing national interests and jealously guarded sovereignties only the platform of the United Nations can assure humanity of a credible and durable peace. Support for the Organization, therefore, must be total and devoid of the secret manipulations and routine subversions that have characterized its relationship with some of its Members.\nThe Organization's role in development - human and national - is equally critical. The calamities of hunger, drought, flood and social misery produce much the same threats to the human condition as war. The programmes of development initiated by the United Nations have been laudable ventures. They proclaim the common purpose and destiny of humanity in its constant search for peace, progress and concord. The achievement of those aims requires a collective sensitivity and the will and energies of nations to mobilize an agreed consensus on development. The United Nations still constitutes the universal platform for its achievement. \nWhile we deliberate the great issues of our day, let our hearts reach out to those members of our human community whose concerns we seek to articulate and realize. They need and deserve our attention in our collective search for an organized and beautiful world. Nowhere is that more vividly expressed at this moment than in the peaceful artistic and physical quest for excellence in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Those athletes individually and collectively have a common message - one human family linked in the search for peace and development. That is in sharp contrast to the terrorist, the drug addict, the hijacker, whose constant ambition is to frustrate the designs of noble men.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt gives me great pleasure to extend to Mr. Dante Caputo the warmest greetings of my delegation on his election as the President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I am fully confident that under his wise and able leadership this Assembly will make substantive progress and further consolidate the gains achieved during the past year.\nMay I also take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, for his leadership and the able and exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the forty-second session.\nA short time ago the world lost one of its outstanding statesman, General Mohammad Al-Hass, President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, who not only contributed immensely to the cause of peace and justice in the world, but was also a pioneer of regional co-operation in South Asia# and a great supporter of freedom.\nWe are meeting this year with a note of renewed optimism. This note of optimism is largely due to the constant, tireless and patient efforts of the United Nations in resolving outstanding international disputes and tensions through peaceful means. We have witnessed a positive change in the global political environment.\nThe commendable efforts of the Secretary-General have brought a cease-fire to what seemed to be an unending war between Iran and Iraq; the Geneva Accords have melted away the tension over Afghanistan; there are signs of an early end to the Kampuchean crisis; and, with the Angolan accord, resolution of the Namibian issue appears to be in sight. Equipped with those positive developments, the Secretary-General is continuing his efforts for the resolution of the Cyprus-issue and also the Question of Western Sahara. The United Nations has again asserted itself as the single most important forum, representative of mankind as a whole, capable of tackling and solving major international issues.\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations is the widest representative organ of the international community. The powers of the General Assembly encompass a very wide area and cover the entire gamut of international relations. The decisions of the General Assembly set forth in its recommendations and resolutions over the last 43 years have amply demonstrated the very wide range of subjects that it covers. Members of the United Nations have the obligation to treat resolutions with respect and a sense of commitment. We are disappointed that there are several resolutions on such important issues as human rights, the dismantling of apartheid, disarmament, prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, the call for a new international economic order, and bridging the gap between the rich and the poor that have still not been implemented.\nWe would reiterate, though it hardly needs emphasis our firm conviction that the United Nations is the only forum that has both the legal and political capacity to address the manifold issues that confront the world today. We reaffirm our stand that all-out efforts must be made to further strengthen this great institution. The weakening of the United Nations would amount to the weakening of world security, peace and stability as a whole. \nThe prime objective of the United Nations today is to devise and sustain mechanisms to preserve world peace and save future generations from the scourge of war. One of the most important steps towards that noble objective is disarmament. At the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament we had the opportunity to review the issues related to disarmament, freely and frankly, from all perspectives. Arms control, especially the prohibition of nuclear arras, must be considered with the utmost seriousness. Similarly, any trends towards developing more conventional weapons, producing chemical and biological weapons and militarising outer space should remain a matter of concern they must be prevented by all possible means. A reduction of arms will greatly reduce tension and promote greater stability and confidence. The ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics shows that comprehensive disarmament is no longer a Utopian concept and that, given the political will and determination required, a better tomorrow in a new world could be built.\nWe have witnessed a breakthrough for the increased use of outer space because of the rapid progress in science and technology. It is therefore essential that strong safeguards be laid down well in advance, so that outer space is used only for peaceful purposes. Agreements and median isms on a global scale should be devised urgently in order effectively to set down the guidelines, formulate the safeguards and regulate the use of outer space for peaceful purposes.\nWe are firmly convinced of the usefulness of the concept of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world. That concept implies regional harmony and peace. Setting up such zones would facilitate the reduction of the tension and mistrust that often exist among countries/of a region. The Republic of Maldives is strongly of the view that the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace would contribute substantially to achieving the objective of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, Maldives has always supported the General Assembly resolutions calling for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in South Asia. We reiterate our stand that participation by all countries of the region and other countries concerned with the issue as well as consultations among them, is essential for the establishment of an effective nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.\nMaldives strongly supports the proposal for the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean r free from outside interference, military activities and influence, Maldives attaches great importance to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1971, It is our firm believe that sincere bilateral and multilateral consultations will have a positive result. In that connection, we call for the implementation of the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean# including the call for the early convening of the proposed international conference on the issue,\nWhile most of the world is advancing towards the objective of sharing the benefits of our common heritage, it is disheartening to note that some people are moving backwards with the remnants of past ages.\nThe pursuit of the policy of apartheid by the white minority regime in power in South Africa is a disgrace to the world community. South Africa's persistent disregard of the world condemnation of its racist policies leads us to believe that it is time to examine and adapt more stringent measures and enforce the United Nations resolutions on South Africa. Some nations' support, direct or indirect, for the racist regime of South Africa, merely to serve their own interests, also deserves criticism. Let us collectively urge the Security Council to resort to enforcement action under Chapter VII of the Charter, if necessary, and put an end to the apartheid regime and the illegal occupation of Namibia.\nWe pledge our support to the front-line States in their difficult efforts to deal with the destabilization caused by South Africa and to cope with the effects of comprehensive sanctions against South Africa. We appeal to the international community generously to support the Action for Resisting Invasion, Colonialism and Apartheid (AERICA) Fund proposed by the Non-Aligned Movement, which reflects the universal battle to achieve the total elimination of the system of apartheid.\nThe situation in Angola and in southern Africa appears to be improving. We welcome the cease-fire declared by the parties concerned and their agreement on a sequence of steps necessary to prepare the way for the independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978), and to achieve peace in south-western Africa. It is essential, however, that all parties directly concerned with the issue, and in particular the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which is the legitimate representative of the people of South West Africa/Namibia, be included in the negotiations. The direct and full involvement of the United Nations in the talks and negotiations is also essential to achieving a lasting solution.\nOne of the most positive developments of this year has been the acceptance by the parties concerned of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which called for an end to the Iran-Iraq war. Maldives welcomed that new development, and strongly supports the subsequent cease-fire and the direct talks between the two countries which began on 25 August 1988. These developments were particularly significant and commendable since they came at a time when this destructive war had assumed alarming proportions. We earnestly hope that Iran and Iraq will exercise constraint and continue to co-operate with the Secretary-General until a lasting and honourable solution to the conflict is found.\nThe situation in occupied Palestine continues to deteriorate. The Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza has only confirmed the severity and intensity of the situation created by the Israeli aggression. The uprising is a further demonstration of the popular will, another link in the long chain of resistance that began with the very first days of occupation - but it is much more persistent and intense, and people from all walks of life, young and old, are participating in it in a unified effort and a common struggle to achieve freedom and independence.\nThe Government of Maldives strongly condemns the use of brutal force and the abuse of human rights by Israel against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank. We also deplore Israel's continued defiance of United Nations resolutions, against all norms of international law. We reiterate our full support for and solidarity with the people of Palestine in their just struggle for independence and self-determination and the liberation of their homeland from Zionist occupation. We also welcome the overwhelming international support for the uprising, which is being viewed as the just struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of their usurped legitimate rights and the attainment of full independence. We also support the proposal for the early convening of an international conference on the Middle East, with the full and independent participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which remains the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Such a conference would, we believe, constitute a major step towards the solution of the question of Palestine. \nThe situation in Lebanon remains tense and extremely dangerous, Lebanon's legal identity and sovereignty have been reduced to a shambles, with about 13 years of civil and proxy wars and the illegal occupation by Israel of its territory, Lebanon now faces the disaster of a complete breakdown. Every day the toll of victims rises owing to the indiscriminate bombing by Israel and other acts of violence. It is fervently hoped that with the developments taking place in the region the question of Lebanon can be solved in a manner that will restore its sovereignty and alleviate the suffering of its people. With the signing of the Geneva Accords a peaceful solution to the problem of Afghanistan finally seems to be in sight. So far the schedule for the withdrawal of foreign troops is being followed satisfactorily. It is hoped that a political settlement will soon follow. We call upon all parties concerned to abide strictly by the provisions of the Accords in order not to frustrate the present opportunities to achieve a just and lasting solution to that complex problem. We hope that the United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance Programme relating to Afghanistan will respond to the Immediate need for relief and rehabilitation as well as to the long-term requirements for the reconstruction of the country.\nSimilarly, initiatives to bring about peace in Kampuchea are also having positive results. The recent negotiations at Bogor, Indonesia, are a significant breakthrough, and we hope that a peaceful settlement, based on national reconciliation and the withdrawal of foreign troops, will be forthcoming, leading to the restoration and preservation of Kampuchea 's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and neutral and non-aligned status and to the reaffirmation of the Kampuchean people's right to determine their own destiny.\nHistory has revealed unequivocally that the arbitrary division of nations does not preserve peace and stability but that, on the contrary, it acts as a catalyst to continuing tension and agony. The Maldives has been consistently supportive of the efforts of nations separated by war to achieve reunification. The process of reunification should operate through peaceful means and through the creation of conditions for reconciliation, peace and stability among peoples sharing the same aspirations.\nWe are optimistic about the prospects for reunification and national reconciliation in Korea. The Maldives reiterates its firm belief that that can be achieved only through peaceful and direct dialogue and negotiations between the peoples concerned, without outside interference. The good offices of the United Nations can be utilized in such peaceful negotiations.\nWhile supporting the independence and national integrity of Cyprus, Maldives considers that inter-communal talks are vital to a lasting solution to the Cyprus problem within the framework of national unity, justice and equal rights for all Cypriots. We are encouraged by the positive attitude displayed by the leaders of the Cypriot communities in their recent meetings in London, and we earnestly hope that a durable solution to that difficult problem will be found. In that regard we once again commend the valuable efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to bring about a peaceful solution to the problem.\nThe question of Western Sahara is yet another that is of concern to us. We hope that the recent initiatives of the Secretary-General with regard to that issue will bring about a lasting solution to the problem.\nAlthough Central America is geographically distant from us, the situation there continues to be a cause of concern. We strongly deplore the acts of aggression and intervention that threaten or jeopardize the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political stability of the peoples of that region and their rights to self-determination and freedom. We support the Georgetown Peace Appeal of March 1987, and we also welcome the initiatives of the Central American leaders and their peace agreement signed in August 1987. In that context we urge and appeal to all States to co-operate in the implementation of the Esquipulas II agreement and to refrain from supporting subversive activities and other acts of intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, which only produce destruction and misery for the innocent population. \nForty-three years have gone by since the adoption of the United Nations Charter, which, among other things recognized the rights of peoples to self-determination and freedom. With regard to the question of New Caledonia we reiterate our broad support for the rights of the people to self-determination in accordance with international law. It will be recalled that at its forty-second session the General Assembly had noted that progress towards a long-term political solution in New Caledonia required a free and genuine act of self-determination and the Assembly had called for resumption of the dialogue with all sections of the population of the Territory. We welcome the initiatives announced by the French Government and hope that the proposed plans will guarantee fairness and equality to all sectors of the population.\nThe world economic situation continues to be grim. The gap between rich and poor is widening. Some of the industrial countries pursue policies that have a negative impact on the economies of the developing countries. Furthermore, in the past couple of years many of the developing countries have been faced with such serious natural calamities as droughts, floods, torrential rains and earthquakes. Against such a backdrop it is disturbing that there is a decline in official development aid to developing countries. It is also a matter for regret that the official development aid (ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product called foe in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and the ODA target of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries remain unfulfilled. It is therefore essential to initiate a rethinking of the international development strategy and to implement the call for the new International economic order. It is regrettable that progress towards the establishment of a new international economic order has been unsatisfactory, owing mainly to the lack of political will on the part of some of the developed countries to implement the decisions. In the mean time, the efforts of the developing countries in their own development processes have been commendable.\nMost of the developing countries face huge debts, declining commodity prices, reduced flows of development capital and adverse terms of trade. For a healthy global economy it is essential that developing countries be given a fairer opportunity for economic rehabilitation and growth. We are optimistic that technical and economic co-operation among developing countries will show a further upward trend in coming years and will go a long way towards mitigating the adverse economic conditions they face today. The promotion of South-South trade within the broader context of economic co-operation among developing countries, based on principles of collective self-reliance, has been stressed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We urge the United Nations to take more effective and concrete steps to promote both economic and technical co-operation among developing countries in the course of its programme of action regarding the new international economic order. In that context we welcome the decision taken at the ministerial meeting cm the global system of trade preferences for developing countries at Belgrade in April 1988, which has given new impetus to the ongoing negotiations.\nMay I finally turn to a subject to which Maldives attaches great importance and which is of vital concern to us, namely, the protection and preservation of the environment. With almost blind faith in his ability and power to conquer nature and equipped with ever more sophisticated technology, humans unwittingly and to some extent unknowingly been destroying his basic life-support system. Our planet Earth can be compared to a small spaceship on which we are all travelling together, dependent for survival upon the vulnerable supply of air, water and soil and their balanced exploitation. The delicate equilibrium of air, water and soil is being threatened by increasing pollution by man. Man's action over the years has transmuted the natural order of the environment to the point where the whole world is ensnared in the consequences. As the scale of man's intervention in nature has increased, so have nature's repercussions on man. Today the world is faced with risks of irreversible damage to the environment - land, air and sea - that threatens the very life-support systems of the Earth.\nMaldives is a small, archipelagic State entirely dependent upon its seas for its livelihood. Any degradation of the marine ecosystem or any rise in the mean sea-level due to the so-called greenhouse effect is a matter for grave concern to us. Last year, it may be recalled, the Maldives witnessed the fury of tidal eruptions three times, and suffered extensive damage. Tidal waves, hurricanes and typhoons are becoming increasingly frequent phenomena. Scientists may attribute such natural havoc as the consequence of man's unscrupulous tampering with the environment. It is already well established that the pollution of the atmosphere by industrial effluents, by gaseous substances and especially by chlorofluorocarbons is damaging the earth's protective ozone layer. Damage to the ozone layer will result in greater heating of the Earth, melting the ice caps in the polar regions and leading to a consequent rise in the global mean sea-level. Such a result can be disastrous to low-lying island States like Maldives.\nThe Maldives is particularly concerned about any damage to the marine environment and the question of the sea-level rise. The immediate effects and the threats of nature on countries like the Maldives may not be as frightful and gloomy as described and dramatized by some newspaper reports. Our tourist attractions and the fishing activities will remain intact and these two vital industries may prosper for many decades to come without the fear of the country being drowned. Nevertheless we have embarked upon a programme of protecting the populated Islands from possible natural calamities. We thank the friendly countries, particularly Japan, for assisting us in this initiative and for their Interest in the problem.\nMaldives therefore strongly supports the call for environmental preservation and is already a party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. We urge all States to care lovingly for the environment and we reiterate the old maxim that prevention is better than cure.\nIn conclusion, allow me to express the sincere hope of my delegation that this session of the General Assembly will further contribute to consolidating world peace and maintaining the positive atmosphere and the momentum achieved during the past year towards the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, it is a pleasant duty for me to address to you, on behalf of the  people and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and on my own behalf, our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-third session. Your political and diplomatic experience and your personal abilities constitute pledge for the successful outcome of our work.\nI also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, for the skilful manner in which he carried out his important duties in presiding over the General Assembly at the forty-second session.\nLastly, I take special pleasure in paying a warn tribute to our very distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, who my people and Government continue to held in the highest esteem. I am pleased to have this opportunity to pay a tribute to the tireless and meritorious efforts he has unceasingly made for peace throughout the world, which have helped to strengthen the confidence we have always had in him. His faith in the Charter and his dedication to the fulfilment of his mandate, which is complex, arduous and often thankless, have done much to strengthen the role of the world Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security.\nSome 10 years ago, on 25 December 1978, the Vietnamese troops of aggression occupied by country, Cambodia. Since 1982, the date of the formation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, as President of Democratic Kampuchea, has emphatically denounced the acts of coercion committed by the Vietnamese occupation troops against the unfortunate Khmer people.\nThere can be no political solution for the Cambodian situation unless Viet Nam  sincerely wishes to reach a negotiated settlement with the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and desists from delaying tactics. In order to block the  process of a political settlement of the Cambodian situation, Viet Nam has sought to link the withdrawal of its troops from Cambodia to the non-return of the Khmers Rouges to power and the cessation of all aid to the armed forces of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.\nThe present situation in Cambodia was brought about by the invasion and occupation of that country by Vietnamese troops, who are still there today. Our- top priority, which is also of the United Nations resolutions on Kampuchea, continues to be the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, whether their presence is officially acknowledged or disguised. As for the other problems, they are internal matters which will have to be resolved among the Cambodian parties. The solution has already been implicitly mentioned In the resolutions adopted annually since 1979 at the United Nations: self-determination of the Cambodian people, through the organization of free general elections without pressure or coercion.\nA genuine peaceful solution can be arrived at only in the following conditions} first, withdrawal of all Vietnamese occupation forces from Cambodian territory, which roust be carried out not unilaterally but within the framework of a general negotiated agreement, under international supervision and in keeping with a precise time-table\u00b7, secondly, the dismantling of the Phnom Penh regime installed by Viet Nam and the State of Democratic Kampuchea} thirdly, the formation of a Quadripartite Provisional Government of National Reconciliation} fourthly, the establishment of machinery for international supervision in the form of a United Nations commission or any other international commission or whatever other measure may be necessary, such as an international force for the maintenance of peace and security, and, fifthly, the organization of authentically free general elections under international supervision. \nPeace in Cambodia depends on national reconciliation based on equality among all the political parties of the coalition and on respect for human rights and fundamental freedom, within the framework of a liberal democratic government. Thus, it is not a question of trying to isolate, still less, e1ininate, anyone. We are talking about a government of national reconciliation, that is, the Quadripartite Provisional Government of National Reconciliation, whose task it would to prepare and organise general and free elections under international supervision.\nAfter the general agreement on the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia, an international conference will be convened with the participation of all the countries concerned, the five permanent members of the Security Council and the United Nations Secretary-General. That conference will adopt all necessary measures to guarantee the agreement, as well as the independence and neutrality of Cambodia and prevent any possible return of Vietnamese forces and the illegal and violent seizure of power by one of the Cambodian parties.\nThe Jakarta informal Meeting, which was held from 25 to 28 July 1988, was the first of Its kind to bring together the three Cambodian parties of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, that of Phnom Penh and Viet Nam, and also the other parties in the region concerned with the Cambodian conflict, who were able to exchange views, we hope that the Working Group, which is to met soon in Jakarta, will prove able to achieve concrete results.\nThe Khmer people was deeply affected by the words of compassion towards them spoken by the President of the United States, Mr. Ronald Reagan, and also the words of solicitude spoken by Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, and other heads of delegations of friendly countries.\nTo return to a normal situation and restore peace, security and justice in any country, the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese occupation troops has become an imperative necessity. However, for greater credibility, I have proposed that this withdrawal be negotiated and internationally monitored. National reconciliation will have to take the form of the establishment of a quadripartite provisional government. This Quadripartite Provisional Government of National Reconciliation must be formed on a new basis, because the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea cannot agree to take as a basis the pro-Vietnamese communist regime of Phnom Penh.\nIn order to facilitate the formation of the Quadripartite Provisional Government of National Reconciliation I have proposed to the two other parties in my Government the changing of the name of Democratic Kampuchea and its flag and national anthem. His Royal Highness Sawdeoh Norodom Sihanouk has already given his agreement in principle to these changes. I believe that these changes - or rather this return to the national names and symbols adopted by the whole Cambodian people - are going to be a prelude to national reconciliation, a prelude to the new national unity that is needed for the restoration of peace in Cambodia and for the establishment of a some of peace, freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia, in keeping with the wishes of the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and, in particular, to the ending of the sufferings of our people. \nI take this opportunity to reiterate on behalf of the Khmer people, my respectful gratitude to His Majesty the King of Thailand for the kind compassion he has shown our refugee compatriots and to His Majesty's Government for the hospitality accorded to then in border camps.\nWe are grateful also to all the friendly countries that have given constant, valuable support in all spheres to the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and all the Khmer people in their national liberation struggle against the Vietnamese invaders and occupying forces.\nWs are grateful to the Secretary-General for the personal interest he has taken in the Cambodian question, and for his tireless quest, in the framework of his mandate and assisted by his Special Representative, Mr. Rafeeuddin Ahmed, for a just and lasting solution to the problem of Kampuchea in conformity with the Charter and relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\nI must say again how grateful we are for the important role being played by the United Nations and the Secretary-General, and extend our gratitude also to his Special Representative, Mr. S.A.M. S. Kibria and the Director of the United Nations Border Relief Operation (UHBRO), Mr. Y. Y, Kim, and all the staff, who have proved so able in helping those of our unfortunate compatriots who are considered to be displaced persons.\nIf Cambodian society is too be truly democratised, if human and individual tights are to be respected, it is essential to promote the education of Khmer children at all levels, both in border camps and within the country.\nThe thrust of sustained, common efforts by the entire international community, with the United Nations as catalyst, to prevent a nuclear holocaust has led to recognition of the fact that a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought. The world has welcomed the ratification by the two super-Powers of the  Treaty on the elimination of their intermediate-range and short-rang\u00b7 land-based missiles and the improvement in East-West relations. The withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan under United Nations supervision and within the framework of a signed agreement the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq after eight years of war, the withdrawal of South African forces from Angola and the prospect of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), on Namibia, and the acceptance\u00b7 by the parties to the Western Sahara conflict of a peace plan submitted by the United Nations have led to some relaxation of regional tension and strengthened the hopes that world tension will gradually ease.\nHowever, the genuine, persistent political will of all and the constant vigilance of all countries and people which push peace and justice are necessary if further progress towards the implementation of international peace and security is to be made.\nInternational peace and security continue to be threatened by numerous local and regional conflicts generated by policies of power, domination and expansion that put under foot the purposes and principles of the Charter, including the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, respect for the right of peoples to self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Until conflicts are resolved on the basis of respect for the principles of the united Nations Charter, it is illusory to hope for a climate of international trust conducive to the elimination or reduction of armaments.\nIn Afghanistan, the heroic struggle of the Afghan people and its mujahidin, combined with international pressure and the tireless efforts of Pakistan and the United Nations and its Secretary-General, finally collapsed Soviet forces to withdraw from that country. But that doe, not mean the war is over. By continuing, through its military assistance, and advisers, to keep alive the regime it has installed in Kabul, the Soviet Union persists in its interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, prevents the Afghan people from exercising its right of self-determination, and continues to fuel tension in that region of southern Asia. The Afghan people and its mujahidin are being compelled to pursue their just struggle to restore Afghanistan's independence, sovereignty, non-aligned status and territorial integrity. The international community must continue its assistance and support in that struggle.\nWe who are fighting for the same cause reaffirm our complete solidarity with and strong support for the Afghan people and its mujahidin in their valiant struggle until the attainment of their noble objectives. We wish also to pay a heartfelt tribute to the Government and people of Pakistan for their great compassion for and generous assistance to the Afghan refugees, and for their important contribution to the efforts that led to the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan.\nIn Asia, the mounting tension in Korea makes clear the increasing urgency of adopting practical measures that will make possible the independent, peaceful reunification of the country. In this connection, it is important to prevent a military confrontation and reduce the tension between the two parts of the country by the adoption of a declaration of non-aggression. We welcomed the negotiations last August at Panmunjon between parliamentary delegations from the North and the South, and are pleased that these will be required soon.\nStill in Asia, we assure our dose neighbours to the north, our Lao brothers and sisters, who for years have endured and struggled against repression and coercion under the Vietnamese yoke of our unswerving support and fraternal solidarity. \nIn the  Middle\u00b7 East the situation has deteriorated everywhere \u00b7. In the occupied Arab territories, the violence and high passions that have been growing for months are clear proof that it is vitally necessary for a negotiated settlement of the entire Middle East and Palestinian problem to be pursued within the framework of an international conference, under United Nations auspices, and with the participation of the representative of the Palestinian people, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). Peace can be restored only through the exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable national rights, with strict respect for the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of foreign territory by force and for the right of all States of the region to live and coexist in peace and security.\nIn Lebanon, despite the presence of United Nations forces, foreign armed intervention continues to fan the flames of discord. It is of the highest importance that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Lebanon and that the Lebanese people finally regain the cohesion and national unity that will enable it to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its country, restore peace, and rebuild the economy.\nThe cease-fire between Iran and Iraq has permitted a relaxation of tension in the region. Without underestimating the considerable and numerous problems that remain unresolved, it may be said that the cease-fire, which was achieved thanks to the praiseworthy, dedicated efforts off the Security Council and the Secretary-General, opens the way for the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We hope that with political will on all sides it will be possible to move towards a settlement of that painful fratricidal conflict. \nIn Africa, the economic situation remains a source of great concern. We reaffirm to all brother African countries and people our complete solidarity and assure them of our war warmest congratulations and deep admiration for their courageous and noble efforts to implement Africa\u2019s Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990. But those efforts are hampered by the problem of external debt and the excessive debt-servicing burden. Moreover, Sudan in particular Khartoum, has been stricken by unprecedented floods which have caused widespread devastation, and sub-Saharan countries continue to face drought, flood, plagues of locust\u00b7 and conflicts, with the consequent millions of refugees, malnutrition and famine.\nWe call upon the international community, especially developed creditor countries, to support and adopt the measure\u00b7 advocated by the Organisation of African Unity to resolve Africa's external-debt crisis, including the convening of an international conference on this problem. \nWe should emphasize that the economic and social crisis of the African countries has been further aggravated by the rising tension in southern Africa which has had harmful consequences throughout the continent. The aggravation of tensions is due to the policy of apartheid and the illegal occupation of Namibia by the Pretoria regime, which utterly disregarding universal condemnation of its actions, has not only refused to release Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, but is also even further intensifying its bloody repression, prolonging the state of emergency, condemning to death and threatening to execute anti-apartheid blacks in South Africa - in particular the Sharpeville Six - mistreating religious figures and banning all the political activity of anti-apartheid organisations, having representatives of South African anti-apartheid movements abroad assassinated, and committing an increasing number of acts of aggression and destabilization against front-line countries. Southern Africa will know peace and stability only when apartheid is eradicated as that will make possible the establishment of a non-racial, democratic government in South Africa and the advent of the independent of Namibia within its territorial integrity.\nIn this respect we believe that the development of the anti-apartheid struggle has amply demonstrated the need for global mandatory-emotions against the Pretoria regime accompanied by a plan of assistance to the front-line States. We ardently trust that the quadripartite negotiations to restore peace in Angola and to eliminate obstacles to the decolonization and independence of Namibia will succeed in compelling South Africa to give effect to Security Council resolution 435 (1973$.\nLastly, we whole-heartedly welcome the successes scored by the Government and people of Chad under the guidance of President Hussein Habre in their attempts to consolidate the independence and sovereignty of Chad, to restore their territorial integrity and to embark upon their reconstruction of their country in peace stability and harmony with all its neighbours. We renew our fraternal solidarity to them.\nIn Central America the situation continues to be grave notwithstanding the progress achieved in the field of verification of the obligations arising from the Esquipulas II agreements. This progress highlights the real possibilities of establishing peace and democracy in the region through dialogue and negotiation, \u0428 wish to pay a tribute to the five Presidents of the Central American States who declared in San Jose their political willingness to press ahead with dialogue and negotiations in order to fulfil the Guatemala commitment and we welcome the work done by the Contadora Group and the Support Group, which decided to continue to co-operate in this process of peace and democracy in this region. This is the only road to peace and stability and the only way to preserve the interests of the region as a ,hole.\nNow that the Organisation is preparing to celebrate at the end of this year the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now that the hope of better times is burgeoning with the approach of the new year and the dawn of a new century, and with the award of the Nobel Peace Prise to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, an award that was very well merited, let us hope that the millions of our human brothers who are seeking change and renewal in their lives will see their dreams come true thanks to the efforts of the United Nations and its Secretary-General in what the Gitanjali, the lyrical offering of the Bengali poet, described so aptly in the following words:\n\\\"In this paradise of freedom, ay fattier, let ay homeland awake.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, I wish at the outset to convey to you the best wishes of the President of the Republic of Kenya, the Honourable Daniel T. Arap Mai, and his hope for the success of the deliberations at the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I should also like to convey to you my delegation's and ray own warm congratulations on your election to the challenging high office of the presidency of this session. Your well known diplomatic skills and wide experience guarantee the successful outcome of our discussions in this body. I pledge to you the full co-operation and support of my entire delegation in fulfilling these expectations. \nI also wish to convey to your predecessor, the Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Peter Florin, my delegation's appreciation of the exemplary manner in which he presided over the work of the last session of the Assembly.\nThe fundamental principle underlying the Charter of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security. This principal objective cannot be realized without effective leadership. In the recent past the United Nations has been seen by many as having a marginal influence in solving the critical issues of the day. Indeed, the very existence of the Organization has been critically questioned. However, looking at recent events of the year, the United Nations has made important contributions to resolving regional conflicts. The cease-fire in the war between Iraq and Iran has been realized through United Nations efforts. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan has come about as a result of United Nations intervention. The decision by Viet Nam to withdraw its troops from Kampuchea was prompted by repeated calls by the United Nations for Viet Nam to do so. In southern Africa, Angola, Cuba and South Africa are working on an agreement that will start the process towards the independence of Namibia in the framework of United Nations resolution 43 5 (1978). \nWhile mindful of the tension between the super-Powers, we can attribute this list of successes by our Organization to the patient, strong and effective leadership given by our Secretary-General. I therefore wish to pay a warm tribute to him and to his staff for these resounding successes.\nKenya has always stated its conviction that resolution 435 (1978) remains the only basis for Namibia's independence. Therefore, while we are gratified to see the important understanding reached between Angola and Cuba on the question of the deployment of the latter's troops in Angola, we continue to hold the view that Namibia's independence should not and must not be linked to the issue of Cuba's troops in Angola, The United Nations should now proceed with the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) without any further unnecessary delays.\nWith regard to South Africa itself, we remain gravely concerned that, despite continuous international appeals and pressures, the racist regime in that country has not released Nelson Mandela and all other political detainees, as demanded by the United Nations through its numerous resolutions. Moreover, the decision of the Pretoria regime to place that country under a state of emergency belies its oft-repeated assurances of commitment to real change and democratic rule in South Africa. By now it must be clear to all that the true intention of the minority racist regime in South Africa is the perpetuation of its illegal and oppressive policy of apartheid, which the international community has long declared illegal and a crime against humanity.\nSouth Africa must therefore cease and desist from its cunning manoeuvres aimed at delaying the eradication of apartheid by instituting cosmetic changes in the name of so-called reform. Kenya calls on this body and peoples of goodwill everywhere\u00b7 to continue to exert pressure on the Pretoria regime to abandon apartheid. Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and detainees in South Africa must be released unconditionally and immediately so that they can participate fully in the democratic process of their country. South Africa should also immediately lift the state of emergency and its ban on liberation movements operating both inside and outside the country, and refrain from its acts of destabilization against its neighbours and other African countries in the subregion.\nThe large system of apartheid has made many South Africans suffer. A large number have left their homes to seek refuge in neighbouring States. South Africa continues its threats to destabilize neighbouring countries, causing mass movements of displaced persons within those States and outside and therefore further increasing the volume of refugees.\nIn order to alleviate the plight of the refugees and the burden imposed on the States hosting them, the Member States of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) agreed on the need for burden sharing in resettling the refugees. They did this in consonance with the international community, which resolved after the Second World War to contribute to the cost of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees. \nHowever, in recognition of the deteriorating refugee situation in southern Africa, the OAU Council of Ministers, at its fortieth meeting, in 1987, called for a conference on the problem. One of the main aims of the Conference was to formulate ideas on how to assist front-line States. The co-operation received from the international community, and particularly the Government of Norway, which made the Conference possible, has been encouraging. The implementation of the agreed programme and plan of action will require the co-operation of all Member States. The international community is also urged to look into the plight of these refugees, because their needs, which are unique, have to be scrutinized, appraised and well understood in order to provide them with the appropriate forms of assistance.\nThe war between the two fraternal States of Iran and Iraq resulted in the loss of numerous lives and untold suffering for many families in both countries. Kenya hailed the two countries agreement to a cease-fire with effect from 20 August 1988. While commending the leaders of the two nations for their courage and statesmanship in agreeing to halt the bloody conflict, our deepest gratitude goes to our Secretary-General, under whose auspices the two countries were able to come to the negotiating table in a bid to resolve their differences. Kenya is proud of its modest contribution, in connection with a United Nations observer team, to the quest for a lasting peace between the two countries, with which it enjoys cordial relations.\nWhile we observe some signs of relaxation of tension in various parts of the world, in the Middle East the signs are in a different direction. The uprising of the Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories clearly demonstrates the frustration of those people, who have lived under military occupation for more than 20 years. Israel, in its mistaken belief, has resorted to excessive use of force to suppress demonstrations. The use of force cannot be the answer. \nKenya has said time and again that no lasting peace in the area can be achieved until the legitimate rights of the Palestinians are recognized, including their right to self-determination and to a State of their own. We recognize the rights of all States in the region, including Israel, to exist within internationally recognized boundaries. We therefore call upon Israel to withdraw from all the Arab land occupied since 1967, as this is the only path to the achievement of a durable and lasting peace.\nIn Central America, unlike other regions where the peace process is gathering momentum, we note with concern that very little progress has been realized despite the efforts of the Contadora and Support Groups. We therefore call upon all the States of the region to redouble their efforts in the search for peace in the light of the current favourable international political climate.\nIn the Korean peninsula, we are encouraged by the recent developments in favour of a dialogue between the two parties. We therefore call for continued constructive dialogue between the two Koreas towards a peaceful settlement of the problem.\nThe continuing arms race remains a major threat to the survival of mankind. More clearly than at any other stage in history, the entire international community is now in agreement regarding the serious danger posed on our planet by enormous arsenals of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. It was against this background that we had hoped that the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly - the third special session devoted to disarmament - held in June this year, would provide an opportunity to agree on a course of action that could give further momentum to the disarmament process. Unfortunately, the session ended without reaching agreement on a concluding document, in spite of the international climate provided by the signing of a Treaty between the two super-Powers. However, although no agreement was achieved by the special session, we must look ahead and use the little that was accomplished as a basis for future efforts. Good proposals were made at that session and should be examined for future adoption.\nIn the recent months we have observed some very encouraging signs of easing of tensions in most parts of the world. The ongoing negotiations on arms reduction between the two super-powers have demonstrated that significant process in disarmament can be attained if there is genuine trust. In this regard, we welcome the recently concluded Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles.\nThe continent of Africa has undergone, in the course of its history, a series of unforgivable and humiliating experiences, such as slavery, balkanization, colonization, economic plundering and exploitation, to mention but a few in this sad catalogue. However, as if this were not enough punishment of Mother Africa, another scourge has been inflicted on Africa during the last few months. I am referring to the recent sordid revelations that toxic and radioactive wastes have been callously dumped in some African countries by certain companies from industrialized countries. This was and still is an outrageous criminal act. \nThis \\\"garbage imperialism\\\" poses a serious and very harmful threat not only to mankind but also to the global environment. It is quite ironic that while billions of dollars are currently being spent on the cleaning of the environment all over the world, some immoral companies have the temerity to dump toxic wastes, knowing full well the end result of this despicable action. The international community should condemn this callous action and take decisive measures at the subregional and regional levels to enact laws to punish severely the perpetrators of this vicious action.\nAs the 1980s come to an end, the global economy continues to be in a sorry state, despite some growth rates in the industrialized countries and in South and East Asia. Large international payment imbalances persist and there is a risk of instability in stock markets, exchange rates and interest rates. This deteriorating situation is a direct consequence of continuing divergences in the macro-economic policies of the industrialized countries. Unless there are significant changes in these policies, this may lead to a world-wide economic recession.\nThe economic conditions in the developing countries, particularly those with heavy debt problems and those in Sub-Saharan Africa continue to worsen, despite their stabilization, adjustment efforts and fiscal austerity measures. There are no prospects of improvement and the outlook for the future remains quite uncertain. These countries are likely to be plunged into a prolonged period of declining per capita income leading to severe poverty and socio-political unrest.\nInternational economic relations continue to be characterized by inequalities in the share of global wealth between the developed and the developing countries. This has been made worse by the unilateral and inequitable economic policies of many of the industrialized countries. \n\nIn the past it was taken for granted that once recovery in economic growth in the industrialized countries was on stream, it would be rapid enough to sustain development in developing countries, and that the transformation of financial and productive structures by the industrialized countries would not be disruptive to development efforts elsewhere, particularly in developing countries.\nThis approach does not seem to work at all. The slow-down in the world economy in the 1980s has demonstrated that the imbalances among industrial market economies constitute a serious threat to developing countries. The debt crisis, which was precipitated by the slow-down in world trade, deteriorating terms of trade in commodities, the decline in imports from developing countries, the unanticipated sharp and persistent increases in interest rates, and the swing to a net negative transfer of resources serve as a clear warning that in order for the global economy to recover and be on a sustainable growth trend, the benefits of interdependence must be mutual and self-reinforcing. The current vicious circle of poverty and waste in the third world - where over two thirds of the human population and abundant natural resources are to be found - must be broken in order to release the potential for generating global wealth for the benefit of all.\nDespite the slow-down in growth, many developing ' entries are continuing their efforts to improve social conditions under drastic fiscal austerity. There are however limits to such efforts under the present unfair international trading system, the negative transfer of resources and the burden of debt. The cost in terms of environmental degradation, waste in human and natural resources, and declining incomes threatens human well-being and the very survival of life on our planet Earth. As the United Nations Children's Fund has observed with regard to the possible nature of a new international development strategy for the 1990s, the prospects for slow growth or stagnation in developing countries\u00b7. \\\"... present a major challenge to the world community as it prepares for the 1990s. This is especially so if our objective for the years 2000 is to overcome the worst aspects of mass poverty: widespread malnutrition, hunger, ignorance and the deaths of nearly 40,000 small children daily ... . If these trends continue, per capita income levels in the least developed countries in the year 2000 will still be well below that of 1980 and, for many African countries, even below that of 1970, 30 years earlier.\\\"\nAccording to the World Bank, in .con teas t to other developing regions, sub-Saharan Africa has shown consistently weak economic performance over an entire generation. To make matters worse, during the 1980s per capita income has fallen to about three quarters of the level reached by the end of the 1970s. Africa\u2019s poor economic performance has now begun to erode the region's productive base. By the mid-1980s, gross investment levels in many countries were too low to maintain the capital stock. Consequently, healthcare and education, among other things, have deteriorated.\nAfrican Governments, individually and collectively, ace committed and have undertaken comprehensive reform measures to improve the economic performance of their countries. However, the severe structural economic imbalances and the vulnerability of African economies to worsening external environment have had, and continue to have, a serious negative effect on those efforts.\nIt was in consideration of this reality that at the special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa held in 1986, African Governments submitted a Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, which was adopted with the international community making a commitment to respond to Africa's efforts. At the conclusion of the recently concluded mid-term review of the implementation of the Programme, it was acknowledged that, under severe austerity measures, the majority of African countries had undertaken reform and structural adjustment measures aimed at improving economic performance to bring about accelerated recovery and lay the foundations for sustained development. It was also recognized that the reform efforts of the African countries had not been matched by international measures to sustain them and that the African economic performance had deteriorated further.\nAlthough the international community has taken some commendable initiatives in support of Africa's efforts with regard to debt relief and resource flows, the magnitude and nature of the African economic crisis calls for increased support and immediate vigorous translation of commitments into concrete action in order to produce the desired results. On their part, the African countries have renewed their commitment to these reforms and structural adjustments in order to improve their economic performance and the well-being of their people. Kenya appeals to all concerned, individually and collectively, to take all necessary initiatives and to make every effort to carry out the recommendations made in order to accelerate the full and timely implementation of the Programme.\nFinally, Kenya would like to join other Member States in congratulating the United Nations p-ace-keeping forces on winning the Nobel Peace Prize this year in recognition of their services in the maintenance of peace and security. With the lowering of tensions between the super-Powers, the United Nations is entering a new phase that is ideal for revival of the multilateralism for which all of us have been yearning. We have come to realize and equally appreciate the indispensability of the United Nations in our world of today. In this regard, we must have a strong United Nations to which all Member States are committed. Kenya, a staunch believer in the United Nations, will not be found wanting in rendering its unflinching support to our Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nFor the past few years, we have been meeting hers with the financial crisis hanging over the United Nations like the sword of Damocles. Today the financial crisis continues unabated, primarily because of the reluctance of a few Member States to meet their legal dues, but the sword of Damocles has vanished. There is now widespread global recognition that the United Nations is an indispensable instrument in the search for peace. After the Afghanistan and Iran-Iraq agreements, the critics of the United Nations have been silenced, at least for quite a while.\nUnder these auspicious circumstances, I am pleased to see you, Mr. President, presiding over a General Assembly session which will mark a turning-point in the history of the United Nations. With your extensive international experience and your country's commitment to the ideals of the United Nations, I have no doubt that you will bring to this session the right measure of fairness, firmness and guidance. I would also like to place on record our appreciation for the excellent work done by your predecessor, Mr, Peter Florin, who presided over one of the busiest year.\\\" in the life of the United Nations.\nThere is no doubt that 1988 will go down as one of the most remarkable years in United Nations history. Seemingly intractable problems are now making gradual progress at the negotiating table. A large part of the credit for this must go to the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who never lost faith in the United Nations ability to contribute to peace even in some of the recent dark days of the United Nations history. His courageous and dedicated efforts, combined with his unflagging patience, resulted in the agreements on Afghanistan and the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. We applaud his commitment to finding solutions to the other equally intractable problems in the Middle East, southern Africa, Cyprus, Western Sahara, and especially Kampuchea.\nWe are troubled that the hints of peace we get from Viet Nam on the Kampuchean problem remain meagre and uncertain. As long as the invasion and occupation of Kampuchea continues to threaten the peace and stability in North-East Asia, we are gratified that the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Mr. Rafeeuddin Ahmed, continue to work on the Kampuchean issue. We also believe that the United Nations commitment to the search for peace in Kampuchin is in full inconformity with the letter and spirit of the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement, which declared in its latest Summit Meeting, in Harare, that \\\"the United Nations represented the most appropriate international forum with the central role in the maintenance of international peace and security and peaceful settlement of international disputes and crises ...\\\". (A/41/697, Political Declaration, para. 314) While the remarkable political developments of 1988 deserve our full attention and scrutiny at this General Assembly, they will not be the focus of my remarks. These recent developments represent significant changes in the political currents. Underneath these currents there are more significant tidal changes taking place which could significantly alter the political and economic landscape of our globe. These deep tidal changes are more difficult to perceive than the swift changes of currents we see on the surface, but their impact could be more enduring and perhaps determine the shape of the twenty-first century.\nThese tidal changes are manifesting themselves in the remarkable change in the attitudes of all the major Powers and richer and more developed nations. In the past few decades the conventional wisdom in most multilateral forums was that it was the poorer, struggling nations of the South that faced a precarious and uncertain future. The richer and more developed nations of the North, viewing the future with greater self-confidence, were expected to channel their resources, imagination and energy to helping the South.\nQuite suddenly, in the past few years, it has been the richer nations of the North which have begun to speak and behave like endangered species. All these major Powers, perhaps with the rare exception of Japan, are now afraid that unless they make dramatic adjustments in their economic policies they may slip badly behind in the new industrial and technological race that has been unleashed. Nations that ate able to ride on the new technological wave will assure themselves of a privileged place in the twenty-first century; those that are not will be- considerably weakened.\nIt is this realization that explains, for example, the dramatic reforms being undertaken in the Soviet Union under the banner of perestroika - a word that is now as easily recognizable in the English language as in the Russian. Any nation that worries about its future today should attempt to carry our equally bold restructuring, or perestroika, of its social, economic and political systems.\nThere is no other choice, as demonstrated also by another large and important nation, China, which is attempting equally dramatic and no less visible changes in its economic system.\nSignificant as these developments have been, they are dwarfed by the changes taking place in the even more developed economies. The largest bilateral trading relationship in the world is between the United States and Canada, with trade totalling 3130 billion per year. This trading relationship is likely to be further strengthened with the expected ratification of the United States-Canada free trade agreement by the two countries, resulting perhaps in the creation of a single, enormous North American market.\nLarge as this market may become, it could still be smaller than another giant economic animal that will emerge in four years' time: the single European market. The decision in 1987 of the 12 Parliaments of the European Community to ratify the Single European Act virtually guaranteed the market's creation by 31 December 1992. The progress towards it may be slow, since the process of formulating it will be based on 300 directives, 200 of which have been put to the Council of Ministers of the European Community and 69 of which have been passed. The political will to create a single European market is manifest.\nThe economic benefits of such a single market could be immense. Today the Community has a total population of 320 million and a combined gross national product of $4.6 trillion. One study, by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission, entitled \\\"The Economics of 1992\\\" and published in 1988, predicted an increase of gross domestic product when the single market is created of between 3.2 per cent and 5.7 per cent in the medium term, a 4,5 per cent to 7.7 per cent decrease in consumer prices, and the creation of between 1.3 million and 2.3 million new jobs. Other equally important changes will be taking place with the creation of the single European market, in the form of the gradual removal of the administrative barriers that separate the 12 nations.\nIn 1992, or a little later, it will be possible for goods and services to flow freely among the 12 countries - perhaps an unprecedented development in the history of man, since a similar removal of national barriers has been accomplished in the past only through empire-building. Today these barriers are being removed voluntarily. For the citizens of the European Community this means that they will be able to go to college, work or retire in whichever European country they choose; to travel around without having to show passports; and to save their money in any of the 12 currencies, which may eventually become one currency.\nWe can imagine what the world would look like if the other subregions were to attempt equally dramatic reductions in the artificial barriers that separate nations. Here again, the established wisdom is that it could not happen in other parts of the world, which are beset by national, ethnic or territorial conflicts. This may be so. Yet it may be salutary to remind ourselves that only 44 years ago the battlefields of Europe were drenched in the blood of millions of soldiers trying to defend or extend frontiers. If some of those soldiers are alive today, and some of them surely must be, they must be puzzled that the frontiers they defended with blood and enormous sacrifice are now being voluntarily dismantled in some significant respects.\nAll countries which are at war today should pause to reflect on the European experience. If the armies of Viet Nam - to cite one example - were to return to their national frontiers and Viet Nam were to live peacefully with its neighbours, it could easily become a dynamic and prosperous nation. Instead, its people ate today suffering considerable economic misery and deprivation, leading to the severe outflow of economic migrants ; who have put a heavy burden on the rest of South-East Asia. The choice is clear: do we want to go the way of Europe or the way of Indo-China?\nAlthough we commend the growing integration of developed economies, we are mindful of the dangers it could pose for the global economy. One fundamental reason why the global economy has enjoyed relatively steady and constant growth rates has been the creation of an open and fair trading system under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which has been in force since 1 January 1948. If the new economic giants of North America, Western Europe and Japan were to try to build economic fortresses that divided up the global economy they could well increase the vast gap between the rich and the poor nations. Members of the United Nations should be vigilant and ready to defend the open global economic system. It would be ironic and tragic if the economic integration designed to remove national economic barriers ended up by creating even more formidable economic barriers which shut most developing countries our of the global economic system.\nThese are some of the major challenges that we shall face in the years to come. The United Nations has adjusted well to the new political currents sweeping across the globe today. It needs to pay equal attention to some of the major tidal changes that are forthcoming. If this General Assembly session could begin to focus its attention on some of these issues, it might well make a historic contribution. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President I take especial pleasure in conveying to you my Government 's satisfaction at the decision taken by this Assembly to place the representative o\u00a3 a recently restored democracy in charge of our deliberations. That decision is, without any doubt, based on recognition of your personal merit and of your professional skills. It is also an honour to your country, with which we are fraternally linked by bonds of history and geography and by our common identification with the ideals and principles underlying democracy. We are sure that, under your guidance, this Assembly will conduct its business in a manner which will ensure its complete success.\nSimilarly, I wish to express to your predecessor, Mr. Peter H. Florin, our congratulations on the sound, intelligent and constructive manner in which he conducted the business of the last session of the Assembly.\nOver the last few months, mankind has witnessed - at first with disbelief and, later, with mounting hope - the way in which a number of the crises from which the world had been suffering seemed to be nearing a solution, thanks to a combination of new circumstances. The conflicts in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Cyprus, Western Sahara and southern Africa appear to be moving towards a negotiated solution.\nAmong the circumstances which have helped restore faith in the ability of human beings to resolve their differences in a peaceful manner, mention must be made, on the one hand, of the detente in the relations between the super-Power s resulting from a realistic and positive dialogue between the United States of America and the Soviet Union and, on the other, to the role played by the, Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Pates de Cuellar, in his quest for negotiated settlements to those conflicts. His prudence, diplomatic tact and amply demonstrated perseverance are factors of fundamental importance which now allow, us to glimpse a process of peace in various regions suffering from conflicts. I wish to offer to the Secretary-General our gratitude for his extraordinary hard work for peace and also our encouragement to him in his efforts.\nMy Government reiterates its faith in, and support for, the purposes and principles of the United Nations, compliance with which is the best guarantee of the maintenance of international peace and security and also the best means of promoting the economic and social progress of all peoples.\nMy Government wishes also to place on record its concern over the financial straits in which the Organization finds itself, which prevents it from fully meeting its objectives. The financial crisis continues to threaten the Organization notwithstanding the efforts made by the Secretary-General to implement the recommendations of the Group of Eighteen.\nWe share the joy that is felt over the progress made in the negotiations with a view to the elimination of the spectre of a nuclear confrontation. The success achieved by the United States and the Soviet Union in agreeing on a treaty which means that, for the first time, there will be an actual reduction of nuclear delivery systems, is a step we all applaud. We trust that the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - will be a prelude to new agreements eliminating forever the threat of a nuclear holocaust and inaugurating a new era of understanding, peace and prosperity for all.\nThe cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq and the start of negotiations between the parties is also a source of pride for our Organization. In keeping with the principle that all disputes can and must be resolved by peaceful means, we encourage those States that have suffered so terribly from the scourge of war to renew their efforts to find a peaceful, just and lasting solution to their disputes.\nWe wish to stress the importance for world peace of the complete and final withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghan territory. It is to be hoped that this process will lead to reconciliation for the Afghan people and to the exercise of its right to self-determination.\nWe are likewise encouraged by the talks taking place in Geneva with the participation of the Governments of Angola, Cuba, the United States of America and South Africa with a view to creating conditions that would enable Namibia to achieve independence and thus reduce tensions in that part of the world.\nWe view with enthusiasm the positive turn taken by events in Western Sahara, where agreements are now beginning to emerge which, it is hoped, will lead to a settlement between the parties to the conflict. In this respect, the resumption of diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco has been a constructive factor.\nRegrettably the spirit of conciliation has not spread to other delicate situations in the world, such as the case of Kampuchea, where lack of agreement has prevented the withdrawal of occupation troops under international supervision. None the less, we are confident that the efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations will bear fruit In the near future.\nHonduras wishes to express once again its sincere hope that the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom will resolve their dispute over the Malvinas Islands through negotiation. We exhort the countries of the Middle East to put forth their best efforts to find a lasting solution to their dispute. The agreements arrived at by Egypt and  Israel are proof that the determination to promote peace, even in a region which has been a witness to bloody and prolonged conflicts, can bear fruit. In this respect, Honduras endorses the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle East.\nMy delegation reiterates its view that the question of Korea must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and negotiations between South Korea and North Korea. Faithful to the principle of universality for this Organization, we reaffirm our belief that it is essential for all nations that endorse the principles of the San Francisco Charter to belong to the United Nations.\nMy country wishes to emphasize its repudiation of all policies of discrimination, in particular the policy of apartheid, which the Government of South Africa continues to apply.\nOne of the problems that my Government views with mounting concern is that of the illegal production of, trafficking in and consumption of narcotics. Honduras, as is the case of other neighbouring States in Central America and the Caribbean, by the mere fact of its geographical situation, equidistant from drug-producing and drug-consuming countries, feels threatened by the continuing attempts to use its territory as a bridge for drug trafficking. We wish to place on record our resolute support for the struggle against the scourge of drugs and our determination to participate in the new international efforts to halt the illegal narcotics traffic, as we have in the past.\nIn the sphere of international co-operation for the solution of economic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems, we wish to acknowledge once again the work done by the Organization, particularly through the United Nations Development Programme. We fully share the concern expressed in this Assembly by the President of Venezuela who said that the need to overcome the problem of external indebtedness is fundamental to the attainment of social development.\n\n\nThe Government of Honduras takes great pleasure in the decision by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to establish in Tegucigalpa a regional office that will make it possible to deal more effectively and efficiently with the important programmes it is implementing in the Central American isthmus. We also welcome the presentation at this session of the Secretary-General's report on co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States. The fact that both organizations pursue the same objectives dictates the need for a common endeavour. Our initiative, adopted last year, calling for closer and more productive co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States was designed to achieve this goal.\nOne of the organs of the United Nations system whose work in the Central American area deserves special emphasis is the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Central American crisis, which is characterized by domestic crises in some of the countries of the region, has resulted in the international displacement of hundreds of thousands of people seeking security. Honduras shares borders with the three countries in the region in which civil wars or internal armed conflicts have taken place and have led to massive floods of refugees.\nHonduras extends protection in its territory at the present time to approximately 45,000 refugees - Nicaraguan, Salvadorians and, to a lesser extent, Guatemalans - in camps which receive assistance from UNHCR. To that number we must add about 200,000 citizens from those countries who have entered Honduras since 1979 and are living widely scattered over our national territory, in many cases lacking proper documentation. For a small country such as Honduras, which is struggling with great determination and self-sacrifice to emerge from underdevelopment, the entry of so many refugees into its territory imposes a burden that exceeds its capabilities. In this respect, it is essential to find a permanent solution to the problems of the placement of those refugees, whether by facilitating their repatriation, which necessarily requires a successful effort at democratization and domestic reconciliation in the countries concerned, or by their relocation in third countries. I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to UNHCR for its difficult and meritorious work in connection with the material care of Central American refugees and in facilitating their voluntary repatriation.\nIt is worth emphasizing that in May 1989 an international conference on Central American refugees will be held in Guatemala, with the participation of Mexico and the support of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in order to find practical solutions to the problems of the repatriation of Central American refugees. We hope that the international community, which has so often expressed its interest in helping resolve Central American problems, will play an effective part in this international endeavour, which is of vital importance to our countries.\nLast year the General Assembly adopted resolutions 42/1 and 42/204, calling urgently for the preparation of a special plan of economic co-operation for Central America. The Secretary-General has already submitted to the Assembly, in document A/42/949, the special plan drawn up with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, in close co-ordination with the Central American Governments and Central American regional institutions. This plan had the support of all the Members of the Assembly, which made it possible for the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme, at a later date to allocate special funds for the promotion, co-ordination, implementation and follow-up of the plan and the attainment of its objectives.\nHonduras is a small country situated in the heart of Central America between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, and sharing a border with El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Honduras pursues two fundamental objectives in its foreign policy; strengthening the democratic regime chosen by Hondurans as their way of life and government, and guaranteeing our citizens access to better levels of well-being. A basic prerequisite for the attainment of these objectives is a peaceful, stable and secure environment in the Central American isthmus, for which we have been struggling vigorously.\nOur foreign policy is pursued in compliance with the norms and principles of international law, in particular, the peaceful settlement of disputes, fulfilment in good faith of commitments entered into, respect for the right of peoples to self-determination, and the promotion and protection of human rights. These are the objectives which \u0449 Government has sought to achieve, notwithstanding the crisis which has afflicted the region since the latter part of the last decade. That is why we have taken an active part in the negotiations sponsored by the Contadora Group and its Support Group, and later in connection with the Esquipulas II agreements. Esquipulas II is to a great extent a response to the regional crisis, in that it establishes a procedure agreed upon by the five Governments of the area aimed at the return of internal normalcy in the countries that have endured civil war and the strengthening of the democratic system of government.\nIt should be recalled that on 16 October 1987 the General Assembly adopted resolution \u00cd2/1, voicing its roost resolute support for the Esquipulas process. In that resolution the Assembly renewed its support for a negotiated solution to the crisis, a support it has demonstrated since 1983.\nHonduras has fulfilled the obligations deriving from that process, including the deposit of the basic instrument of the Central American parliament. However, it is impossible to overlook the fact that the particular situation of those countries that are experiencing internal armed conflict is a determining factor in the regional crisis.\nHonduras acknowledges the difficulties that have arisen at the negotiating table owing to the complexity of the situation. In certain cases, the armed opposition has sought objectives quite contrary to democratic principles. But in other cases it is precisely the lack of will on the part of the authorities that has provoked a deadlock in the dialogue between the Governments and the opposition forces. That internal lack of will is also reflected in foreign policy. Indeed, the government of Nicaragua, which together with the other Central American Governments signed the Esquipulas II Agreements, has obsessively engaged in international actions that are mutually incompatible.\nHonduras has underlined that incompatibility both in this Assembly and in other bodies in order that the historical record will show that regional efforts to bring about peace have been adversely affected by the attitude of the Nicaragua Government.\nI refer to the legal proceedings brought by Nicaragua against Honduras in the International Court of Justice on the very same matter that is being dealt with in the regional political process. That incompatibility between legal recourse and the political procedure of Esquipulas II has emptied the latter process of its substance, thus thwarting the peace initiative of President Arias, endangering the plan Sot special economic co-operation for Central America adopted by the United Nations and even jeopardizing the co-operation between the European Economic Community and Central America - all efforts fully supported by Honduras.\nIn July 1986 the Sandinist Government brought suit against Honduras and Costa Rica before the International Court of Justice for reasons it would be irrelevant to mention here since what is of importance is to save Esquipulas II.\nHonduras and Costa Rica, on the basis of applicable law, argued that the International Court of Justice lacked jurisdiction, both Governments emphasizing that they could not continue negotiating while the suit initiated by Nicaragua was still pending.\nOn the basis of this criterion, upon signing the \\\"Procedure for the establishment of a firm and lets ting peace in Central America\\\" - Esquipulas II - Nicaragua withdrew the action against Costa Rica and promised to withdraw its suit against Honduras, a commitment it has not yet fulfilled.\nOn the contrary, the Sandinist Government, violating the principle of good faith, sought to use its law suit as an element of pressure on Esquipulas \u0399I.\nIn view of this Sandinist stubbornness, and with the purpose of freeing implementation of Esquipulas II from the interference of the judicial procedure, Honduras requested the International Court of Justice to hold the oral phase on the question of jurisdiction, which took place in June this year. The Court's lack of jurisdiction in this case was firmly demonstrated before the Court by Honduras.\nThe Government of Nicaragua has used the judicial proceedings in the International Court of Justice as a means of diversion, apparently with the purpose of justifying its lack of compliance with its own commitment in regard to national reconciliation, democratization and repatriation of the million Nicaraguan refugees - one third of the Nicaraguan population - which are now scattered around the world.\nThe negotiations between the government of Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan resistance undertaken in Sapoa, Nicaragua, are unmistakable proof that the case brought against Honduras belongs to what in the practice of the Court is known as \\\"ongoing or fluid situations\\\" and is therefore not appropriate for judicial decision.\nEvidence produced in connection with these cases is intrinsically inappropriate and unsuitable for consideration by the Court.\nDuring the negotiations held by the Sandinist Government and the Nicaraguan resistance in the town of Sapoa, Nicaragua, both parties reached agreements in principle on security matters. Those agreements assumed the character of an international treaty, since the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States and representatives of the Catholic Church took part in the negotiations as qualified witnesses. The signing of the final document of Sapoa on 23 March this year was attended by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega himself.\nIt is worthy of special mention that in that Sapoa agreement the parties to the conflict solemnly agreed to suspend military operations of an offensive character throughout the national territory - I repeat: to suspend military operations of an offensive character throughout the national territory.\nIt is very difficult to reconcile this carefully chosen language with the accusations levelled by Nicaragua against Honduras to the effect that Honduras is hosting and supporting armed groups that supposedly carry out offensive actions from the frontier zone against the Government of Nicaragua.\nThe reality is that the Nicaraguan resistance has never been recognized by my Government and its limited and sporadic presence in the Honduran frontier zones has been a de facto situation similar to what happened in the past with the Sandinistas, who also used our territory as a sanctuary in their fight against the Somoza regime.\nI consider it essential to emphasize that in the same Sapoa agreement, the Sandinista Government and the Nicaraguan resistance defined territorial enclaves within Nicaragua that add up to 20,000 square kilometres, almost the size of the republic of \u039e1 Salvador, where the resistance should concentrate without laying down their weapons until an agreement on a definitive cease-fire had been reached. It was also stipulated that the Nicaraguan resistance could receive foreign humanitarian assistance. It is a well-known fact that the Sandinista Government has deliberately delayed the negotiations on these points. In the light of these facts, the continuation of Nicaragua's suit against Honduras is totally absurd. It is the Sandinist Government, not the Government of Honduras, that recognizes the rebel army in its status as a belligerent organization with a territorial base, with the capacity to negotiate on an equal footing with the Government of its country. It is the Sandinist Government that negotiates and defines territorial enclaves, acknowledging the armed presence of irregular forces inside its own territory. It is the Sandinist Government that has agreed, as a matter of principle, to the delivery of foreign humanitarian aid to its armed opposition within the territorial enclaves inside Nicaragua.\nBut the most absurd aspect of this hullabaloo is that the Sandinist Government, which calls on the Government of Honduras to prevent the use of its territory by the Nicaraguan resistance, defined at Sapoa three territorial enclaves, with an area of 8,000 square kilometres and a length of about 230 kilometres adjacent to Honduran territory.\nThe Sapoa Agreement is the most eloquent testimony to the international conduct of the Sandinist Government, which, while calling for an international commission of inspection to verify the non-use by armed groups of territories adjacent to its two land frontiers, promotes conditions in which the Nicaraguan resistance can make use of Honduran frontier zones. By denying foreign humanitarian assistance, it inevitably compels the rebel army to infiltrate Honduran territory out of the sheer will to survive.\nHow can Nicaragua dare thus to accuse Honduras, when its own nationals are crossing into Honduran territory to escape extermination? Was it not the Sandinist Government itself that agreed at Sapoa to have three enclaves right up against the Honduran border where the Nicaraguan resistance was to concentrate? How is it possible to reconcile, from the point of view of logic and political ethics, the  contradictory and irresponsible use of incompatible international procedures? Is it not clear that this is a political manoeuvre to serve the destructive domestic and international purposes of the Sandinist Government?\nThe democratic and constitutional Government of President Jos\u00e9 Azona has fulfilled all the obligations of Esquipulas II and has fundamentally met the obligation to maintain domestic peace. It has even established a national commission for reconciliation, though since 1957 Honduras has fulfilled the constitutional mandate to form governments of national conciliation. Lastly, it has approved, ratified and deposited the constituent instrument of the Central American parliament, also provided for in Esquipulas II.\nGiven the disruptive elements that characterize and have caused the crisis in Central America - in particular the desire for political and military hegemony of a super-Power alien to the American continent, and the resistance provoked by such ambitions - it is essential that this problem have an international and global solution.\nIn this forum my Government endorses the proposal we submitted on 12 November last year in the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, and in that respect, urges the Secretary-General .of the United Nations to work cowards the establishment of an international peace force consisting of units from Canada, Spain and the Federal Republic of Germany, to be stationed along the frontiers between Honduras, B\u00cd Salvador and Nicaragua to guarantee that Honduran frontier territory is not used by the armed insurgents in those countries.\nHonduras has frontiers with the two Central American countries in which several wars are now going on. Those internal conflicts are being fed by the two hegemonistic super-Powers.\nHow can the Government of Honduras be compelled to disband the armed insurgent movements of Nicaragua and El Salvador when that would mean bringing Honduras into confrontation with the policies of those super-Powers? On what grounds is an attempt being made to impose on Honduras an obligation to resolve the security problems of neighbouring States?\nIt is a universally recognized truth that the Central American crisis is a problem of a complex international character. Consequently, it is for the international community to bear its responsibilities for the maintenance of regional peace and security without excluding an international peace-keeping force. That force, through inspection and enforcement actions where necessary, would guarantee the non-use of Honduran frontier territory by Salvadoran and Nicaraguan rebels.\nHowever, it should be recalled that the Esquipulas II procedure was designed for the purpose of resolving not just the problem of Nicaraguan security, but also that of putting an end to the subversion, financed by foreign sources, of which El Salvador is a victim.\nIt is equally important to prevent the trafficking of weapons to the Salvadoran insurgents, just as it is important to prevent the use of Honduran frontier territory as a sanctuary by Nicaraguan and Salvadoran rebels. For that reason the international peace-keeping force should locate these combatants far from Honduran borders, in Nicaraguan and Salvadoran territories. Their relocation in third countries should be carried out from sites in Costa Rica and Guatemala, whose Governments have declared themselves neutral, a declaration apparently not challenged by the Governments of Nicaragua and El Salvador.\nIn parallel, the Secretary-General, through appropriate international machinery, would make the necessary arrangements to prevent new flows of refugees into Honduras and to promptly repatriate those already in its territory or relocate them in third States.\nThe people and Government of Honduras cannot go on bearing the burden which has weighed down on them for nine years, a burden caused by the presence of tens of thousands of Central American refugees. We have thoroughly met our humanitarian quota, and it is unreasonable to expect us to make even more sacrifices detrimental to our economic and social development and our ecological equilibrium.\nIn order that this plan may be carried out successfully, it is essential that the process of Central American normalization be liberated from any interference that might have a harmful effect on it - for example, incompatible international procedures.\nIn implementing this initiative, it would be appropriate for the Secretary-General to call on whatever parties were necessary to overcome interference preventing the finding of a solution to the Central American crisis. For example, thought should be given to the holding of negotiations between the two super-Powers, on the one hand, and the five Central American countries, on the other - and also the United States of America and Nicaragua, when the parties deem it appropriate, as we suggested last November in the General Assembly of the Organization of American States. Such a global approach would guarantee parallel co-operation between all the parties concerned and would make it possible to take up the subject of security  focusing on the restoration of the balance of forces which has not so far been dealt with effectively.\nThe problem of security is of particular importance in view of the irrational arms race upon which the Sandinist Government has embarked, having set itself the goal of recruiting hundreds of thousands of military personnel and having recently emphasized that the size of the Sandinist army \\\"is not subject to any type of negotiation\\\". This incomprehensible attitude is in sharp contrast to the agreement recently reached by the super-Powers to dismantle intermediate nuclear forces.\nThe establishment of an international peace-keeping force as proposed by Honduras, and the adoption of the complementary measures which I have submitted to the Secretary-General for his consideration, would reinvigorate the peace-making impetus of Esquipulas II, which now seems to be in jeopardy. The establishment of stable, lasting peace in Central America depends on whether the Sandinist Government meets its obligation to allow the Nicaraguan people to choose its own destiny, without imposing its will in such a way as to prolong the people's suffering yet further, so that democracy, justice, freedom and peace may be achieved.\nIn the same spirit, my country demonstrates its unswerving respect for the norms of international law, particularly those relating to the peaceful settlement of disputes through the procedures set out in the United Nations Charter and the charter of the Organization of American States.\nIn conclusion, the Government and people of Honduras are delighted by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, on which we congratulate the Secretary-General. It is a well-deserved recognition of a job well done throughout many years of selfless dedication and sacrifice.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Cuba, and on my own behalf, I should like at the outset to express our warmest congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\nI am all the more pleased by your election,, first, because you represent a sister Latin American nation that has repeatedly demonstrated its devotion to sovereignty and independence, a nation to which we are united by historical bonds of understanding and fraternity and secondly, because of our close, long-standing friendship, which will be further strengthened by this session of our world Organization.\nWe are certain that on this occasion you will once again demonstrate your high qualities as a statesman, and for its part the Cuban delegation commits itself to making every effort for the success of this forty-third session and the attainment of world peace and the development of all peoples of the world.\nLast year, in this very forum, we said that, the great prevailing difficulties notwithstanding, we were living in a time of encouraging expectations, because the triumphalism ascendancy of the Reagan Administration had been checked and was on the wane. The activity of major international organizations had been strengthened, and a climate favourable to negotiations prevailed in Europe, Central America, southern Africa, Afghanistan and South-East Asia.\nThe facts of history and the efforts of the forces that cherish peace and progress have driven the obscurantist tendencies in international relations into total bankruptcy. Such tendencies seemed to be driving us to the brink of insanity and holocaust at the beginning of this decade. Such ideas, which had argued that a nuclear war was winnable and which advocated the theory of military superiority as a means of ensuring equilibrium and peace, are already losing ground. \nThere is a growing rejection of measures - such as the so-called strategic defence initiative - that could lead to an arms race and enhance the possibilities of the total destruction of our planet. A new and effective form of international relations is evolving, one based on dialogue, understanding and the negotiated settlement of conflicts that for years have hung over the world and been bringing our nations ever neater to the brink of a cataclysm of incalculable proportions.\nThe adoption of significant disarmament agreements between the two main nuclear Powers is not only a contribution to the attainment of world peace and international security for present and future generations; it enables us to envisage the release, within a reasonable time, of significant resources for the development of all nations and to help overcome the effects of the world economic crisis now threatening.\nThe efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving progressive forces are beginning to bear fruit. Thus, we warmly welcome the Moscow meeting between General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan; we welcome the agreements reached there and the way in which they are being implemented. We believe this represents a major step towards disarmament, but it must be developed and supplemented. At Reykjavik, Comrade Mikhail Gorbachev proposed working on a draft agreement to reduce strategic weapons by no less than 50 per cent and to eliminate them completely before the end of this century; that proposal is still pending.\nAlthough it is clear that we are moving towards a process of change, much remains to be done and positions that should be abandoned are still being taken. An example of this was the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which took place this year. Renewed efforts by non-aligned, socialist and neutral nations to achieve agreements compatible with the new times that seem to be emerging in the field of disarmament tan into the international stance of those who stubbornly refuse to countenance the Assembly taking anything beyond general decisions. Such an irresponsible attitude must be condemned. \nHowever, if the changes we are trying to bring about in international relations in our quest for full justice and equity do not go beyond disarmament measures, if they are not aimed at promoting the urgent solution of the problems afflicting the economies of the third world and the establishment of a new international economic order, then those changes - despite the glimmers of hope we discern - will be incomplete. Tb understand my country's position, it suffices to remember the words spoken recently at Quito, Ecuador, by President Fidel Castro: \\\"But the world's problems are not only problems of nuclear weapons and the threats of nuclear war that have unfortunately existed; there still remain other terrible problems for millions of people in the world, such as underdevelopment, poverty  hunger, and lack of education and health\\\".\nWhile the prospect of nuclear war and the resulting destruction and death is dreadful, the lives lived by billions of people on Earth are no less dreadful. The preservation of human life has been our incentive to strive for nuclear disarmament and for general and complete disarmament, and the preservation of human life must also be a driving force in the quest not only for disarmament measures but also for effective solutions to the problems caused by underdevelopment and poverty. For while nuclear war could potentially claim millions of innocent victims, it is no less certain that underdevelopment and poverty claim thousands of innocent victims every day. Suffice it to recall that every three days the number of children who die in the third world is greater than that of all those who died in the genocidal nuclear bombing of Hiroshima at the end of the Second World War.\nUnder the present circumstances, according to data from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), one in four children is suffering from malnutrition; four in five children in rural areas do not have access to running water or adequate sanitary facilities two in five children between the ages of six and 11 do not go to school; and four in five children have no access to modern medical care. These facts must cry out to our conscience.\nOn Monday, 26 September, President Reagan said farewell to us. But before he addressed us we had already said farewell to his policy of confrontation and war; more than saying farewell, we had defeated it. The international community said no to attempts to drive the world towards nuclear holocaust and stated its determination to move towards peace, disarmament, independence and development.\nPresident Reagan devoted several paragraphs of his statement to Cuba, in which he confirmed his well-known ignorance of the facts of today's world, of their historical background and even of the most basic geographical facts. For that reason we shall not reply to his statement so much as correct it, setting out the facts as they truly are and calling for respect for the truth.\nPresident Reagan tried to distort the results of the meeting of the Commission on Human Rights held last March at Geneva to fit his own desires, though at that meeting he was defeated thanks to member countries' respect for the purposes of the Commission.\nCuba is proud of its record in the field of human rights, and after defeating those Yankee manoeuvres we invited a delegation from the Commission on Human Rights to visit out country and observe the human rights situation there.\nThe situation today is very different from that of 30 years ago, when we were under United States neo-colonial domination and when the Yankee ambassador served as a pro-Consul who handed down orders to the sitting Presidents. Now, illiteracy has disappeared; life expectancy has risen from 55 to 74 years; infant mortality has declined from 60 to 13 deaths per thousand live births; the epidemic diseases that once claimed the largest number of victims have been eradicated; poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, and other such diseases have been wiped out. Where we had 20,000 university students we now have more than 300,000. Where we had 30 per cent unemployment, all Cubans of working age exercise their right to work.\nThere remain counter-revolutionaries imprisoned in Cuba. That is only natural, because the 30 years since the triumph of our revolution have been years of our people's victorious struggle against the constant aggression of successive United States Governments, especially that of the Reagan Administration. Fortunately, those in the employ of Cuba's enemies - agents of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other services - have failed in their attempts and have been sent to prison. In prison they receive humane treatment and their human rights are respected. There has never been an instance of torture or mistreatment; not a single prisoner has disappeared.\nPresident Reagan also ignored the facts when he spoke of the situation in southern Africa. He persisted in his failed policy of support for the hateful apartheid regime; he tried to equate the South African invader troops with the Cuban internationalist combatants who went to Angola 13 years ago at the behest of the Angolan people to drive back the racist invader troops. But President Reagan does not even seem to read the newspapers. How else are we to understand his insistence that the agreement on the full withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola should apply first of all to Cuban troops? South African troops have already withdrawn from Angola, after suffering defeat at Cuito Cuanavale. \n\nThe withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia is an obligation deriving from resolution 4 35 (1978) and is being called for by the international community. The Cuban internationalist combatants will withdraw, as has been stated, pursuant to a decision taken by Angola and Cuba.\nConstructive engagement has been useful in prolonging the existence of the hateful apartheid regime, extending by 10 years South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia. However, it was unable to prevent the failure of the invasion launched by the South African racists against the People's Republic of Angola. In southern Africa in 1988 we have witnessed significant developments which give rise to hope that we shall see achieved some of the objectives pursued by the countries in the region will be achieved - namely, the independence of Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), adopted by the Council exactly 10 years ago, and the provision of safeguards for the borders of the People's Republic of Angola.\nWithin the framework of the quadripartite talks, which involve the joint delegation of the People's Republic of Angola and the Republic of Cuba, the delegation of the Republic of South Africa and the delegation of the United States, acting as mediator, several meetings have been held in which the problems in the region have been dealt with in extensive discussions and principles have been established for the political settlement of the problems affecting the region.\nIn this context, in Brazzaville, following the seventh round of quadripartite talks a communiqu\u00e9 was issued informing the Secretary-General of the United Nations that, beginning on 1 November, effect would be given to Security Council resolution 435 (1978), on the independence of Namibia. It is a fortunate coincidence that this is occurring exactly 10 years after the adoption of resolution 435 (1978). We trust that very shortly Namibia will become independent and take its seat as. the 160th Member State of the United Nations. \nIn this context we reaffirm once again the existence o4 indestructible links between Cuba and the People's Republic of Angola, its Government and its people. They have been strengthened by the bloodshed by Cubans and Angolans in the struggle for the freedom and sovereignty of that sister nation. Cuba is not seeking a military victory. Cuba has no intention or desire to humiliate anyone. It is inspired simply by the desire to make its modest contribution to the preservation of Angola's independence, to the progress of the negotiations on Namibia and to the attainment of peace and security in that part of Africa. Consequently, Cuba is prepared to continue these consultations and looks forward to a successful conclusion, although it is aware of the obstacles and difficulties that still have to be overcome and the time and effort that this will entail.\nWe reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the Namibian patriots, led by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), and the South African patriots, represented by the African National Congress (ANC). We support their resolute struggle against oppression. The security of the other front-line States should similarly be guaranteed, thus checking the aggressive behaviour of the South African regime.\nParticular attention should be paid to the position of Mr. Nelson Mandela, whose release from a prison in South Africa has become a matter of universal concern. Prom this rostrum we congratulate him on his seventieth birthday and reaffirm the steadfast support of the Government and people of Cuba for him and his cause, which, with the whole of mankind, we share.\nThe negotiating process which began recently with a view to ending the Iran-Iraq war is also showing encouraging signs, notwithstanding the difficulties involved That war, which should never have broken out, must come to an end, not merely because of the benefits to both peoples that would result from peace and national reconstruction, both peoples, but also because this would be in the interests of non-aligned unity and world peace. Furthermore, stopping the war between the two nations would put an end to the imperialist presence in the Gulf, which must also be uprooted. Those naval forces are not acting as guarantors of peace; rather they are a source of tension and a threat to the independence of the States in the region.\nIn Central America there were hopes that peace would be reached under the Esquipulas agreements and the Sapoa talks. Such prospects, however, have run into the stubbornness and arrogance of the imperialists. The renewed efforts of the Government of Nicaragua, the Contadora Group and its Support Group in the search for a just and honourable peace in the region deserve recognition.\nMore than a year has passed since these peace initiatives were launched by the five Central American Presidents. They have not yet borne fruit, however, owing to the manoeuvres of those forces interested in impeding their implementation and pursuing a policy of aggression, destabilisation and blockade against the Government of Nicaragua. The situation in Central America calls for prudence, wisdom and firm support from the international community in order to prevent a further escalation of the dirty war directed against Nicaragua, to achieve a negotiated political solution to that regional conflict and to ensure the economic reconstruction of the region. We should also support the peace efforts being made by the Contadora Group and its Support Group. We must reject every attempt to exclude them from the negotiating process. Furthermore, a process of negotiating should be ensured for El Salvador and Guatemala, with the indispensable participation of those who were compelled to resort to armed struggle to achieve what they were denied by law and democracy. \nCuba reaffirms its full solidarity with the Government and people of Nicaragua and reaffirms Nicaragua  sovereign right to decide its own destiny free from any form of interference.\nWe welcome with healthy Latin American and Caribbean pride the honourable example set by the Panamanian people, which has rejected and defeated all the imperialist acts of aggression, blockades and threats directed against it, thereby demonstrating the enormous strength of a people united in defence of its sovereignty and independence.\nWe cannot fail to welcome also the significant agreements reached in Geneva with regard to Afghanistan, which are a source of satisfaction to us. The new situation which that Asian nation currently faces calls for renewed and continuing endeavours by all the parties and by the international community as a whole to bring about the speedy implementation of agreements, to ensure respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan and to enable all obstacles to the attainment of peace in that region to be overcome. Cuba fully supports the Republic of Afghanistan in the difficult process of national reconciliation.\nWe welcome the negotiating efforts being made by the States of Indo-China in order to achieve the long-desired peace in South-East Asia, the constructive and flexible dialogue among the countries of the region and the initiative taken by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement in his efforts to contribute to a negotiated solution. In this context, we reiterate our full support for the policy of national reconciliation formulated by the People's Republic of Kampuchea. These developments represent a source of hope in a climate fraught with dramatic potential.\nThe ministerial Conference of non-aligned countries met in Nicosia, the beautiful, warm capital of Cyprus, just a few days ago. The successful discussions at that Conference, the fraternal, constructive atmosphere during the talks and the presence of almost all member States of the Movement, with delegations mostly led by their Foreign Ministers, was unequivocal proof of the progress made by our Movement and evidence of its growing unity and capacity for action. \nIn Cyprus we reiterated our call for struggle for peace and development. We welcomed the progress made in the negotiations on disarmament and at the same time warned that acts of aggression were still persisted and that solidarity and encouragement should be given to the peoples of the world in their struggles.\nWe agreed to meet next year in Belgrade - where the first non-aligned summit was held in 1961 - for the ninth summit conference of Heads of State or Government in order to strengthen further the decisive role we should play in the defence of peace and the furtherance of development.\nLast year we reaffirmed that the United Nations should contribute with all its influence to the attainment of peace and the political resolution of conflicts and disputes among nations. Today we are witnessing a resurgence of the United Nations contribution, and very particularly that of its Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar. He has been responsible for much in the way of resolving many of these regional conflicts. We have noted with satisfaction that the achievements of the United Nations this year have helped put an end to the theories proclaiming the death of multilateralism and the ineffectiveness of the United Nations. The United Nations has done this by meeting its obligations under the Charter.\nThe situation in Latin America and the Caribbean is both promising and potentially dangerous. It is promising because of the sustained progress made in the political and social realms in our continent, because of the growing awareness of shared problems and because of the growing unity in a spirit of pluralism that has not been impeded by the natural differences of ideology, wealth or territorial extension among the countries in our region. The future of this continent will be bright if Latin America and the Caribbean succeed in exercising unity and cohesion, if we are able to take advantage of the legacy left us by our predecessors, that is. Bolivar, San Martin, 0'Higgins, Sucre, Juarez and Marti; if we succeed in identifying our common problems and in finding shared solutions; in short, if we are able to undertake a real endeavour at integration, in diversity, taking advantage of all those features that bring us closer together rather than resorting to those that divide us.\nThe informal dialogue of foreign ministers of Latin American and Caribbean countries held recently in Caracas represented encouraging evidence of a growing and necessary unity and of the urgent need for integration and co-operation. It showed that our united voice is strong and to be heard wherever integrationist tendencies are on the rise.\nCuba will do everything in its power to contribute to this process of Latin American and Caribbean unity, co-operation and integration.\nDemocracy has progressed in Latin America and the Caribbean. Dictatorial regimes are more isolated than ever, rejected by both their own peoples and the Latin American and Caribbean community. We are confident that 7e shall be able to manage our future collectively for the benefit of our peoples.\nHowever, we also said that Latin America is faced with a potentially dangerous situation, as hazardous as that facing the other countries of the third world. The international economic crisis has produced intolerable repercussions. It has stirred up an unbridled and spiralling decline in the living standards of our peoples with the progressive erosion of our economies, the worsening of injustice and unequal relations with the industrialized countries of the West. Furthermore, in recent years the arms race and its almost geometric growth have made the prospects of development even more uncertain and an ever greater amount of resources has been used that could otherwise have been employed to alleviate the effects of the crisis.\nThe difficult path we have had to trace in the 14 years since the adoption of the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order by the General Assembly at its sixth special session has become increasingly uncertain. This has shown the serious nature of the problems we face and the need for urgent solutions.\nThe phenomena which have traditionally affected international economic relations, in particular those involving the developed capitalist countries, on the one hand, and the third world, on the other, continue to worsen and to make the plight of billions of human beings unprecedentedly hopeless. Protectionism, the difficulties encountered by third world countries in the export of commodities and in getting access to markets, together with the unequal terms of trade, the dumping and the external debt constitute scourges which have plunged a large number of countries into an economic crisis, a \\\"crisis for existence\\\", the solution of which requires a major restructuring of the world economy and of its operating procedures. \nThis is one of the great paradoxes of our time. While we are witnessing encouraging signs of progress in international political relations, progress in terms of disarmament and a tendency to resolve many local conflicts, at the same time the economic plight of the underdeveloped countries is becoming increasingly worse. While the major capitalist countries Powers agree to hold negotiations on matters pertaining to war and peace, they still refuse to hold comprehensive negotiations to resolve the roost pressing economic problems of the contemporary world.\nDo they not realize that, no matter how much they pursue security, security will be incomplete as long as an economic gap continues to exist between one group of nations and another, and indeed continues to widen? \nA new international economic order continues to be our goal. In recent years we have repeatedly heard views questioning its validity in present circumstances. We do not agree with such views. How could one seriously and responsibly argue that an instrument that has never been implemented has ceased to be valid? Is it that the conditions that have brought it about have already disappeared? \nOf all the phenomena to which we have referred, the spiralling external debt of our countries has had the most serious impact and may potentially be the most dangerous for the political, economic and social stability of vast sectors of the world.\nWe have recognized over and over again that the external debt of third world countries is a political issue and should be approached as such and that all the parties involved - debtors, creditors, banks and financial institutions - should pool their efforts.\nWe need to find a speedy solution to this problem. We have recognized a number of factors which link such a solution to the search for answers to other problems affecting third world economies. However, a debt that exceeds 31 trillion is not something to be simply recognized or dealt with in terms of theoretical assumptions. Our countries have been concerned for far too long with poverty, hunger, illiteracy, inadequate health services and the desire for equality and justice.\nThe recent fourteenth Latin American Council of the Latin American Economic System decided to convene a regional conference on external debt. Everyone agrees on the fact that it is unpayable and uncollectable. We need to develop a comprehensive strategy for tackling the debt problem; we need to take a new approach. Several years ago President Fidel Castro proposed a formula with which this General Assembly is very familiar. We strongly believe in the accuracy and force of his argument and, indeed, it has been borne out by events of recent years.\nWe are entering a new decade. We should work for a new millennium of peace and coexistence in the 1990s, with a new and positive form of international relations as opposed to the attitudes and policies that prevailed in the 1980s. Aggression must give way to good-neighbourliness among nations. The use of force should be replaced by consultations and dialogue. Policies of coercion should yield to negotiations for the protection of mutual interests. Unequal terms of trade should give way to a just and equitable international commerce. The obsolete mechanism based on Bretton Woods should yield to a new international monetary system which would eliminate overt or covert exploitation. \nThe process which is now beginning for the United Nations Fourth Development Decade could offer a suitable framework for these objectives. Those who illegally possess the world's wealth currently \\\"have the floor\\\". They are the ones that have to demonstrate wisdom and genuine concern for the fate of the world; otherwise, it will fall into a state of collapse fraught with unforeseeable consequences.\nIn this connection, we welcome the endeavours of the South Commission and, particularly, the results of its meeting in Mexico. We believe that such institutions may be very useful in raising world consciousness about the need for development and providing new ideas for solving the most pressing problems of the third world. We are particularly pleased to see that this Commission is presided over by Mr. Julius Nyerere, an outstanding contemporary political figure and one of the eminent leaders of African independence.\nWe note with satisfaction that the Conference on the Indian Ocean will be convened in 1995. We should build our collective determination so that by the time the Conference starts that region will have been freed from military pressures and will have become a zone of peace. We believe that the new course we are beginning to see developing in international relations may represent a decisive contribution to the attainment of a climate conducive to the demilitarization of the region.\nWe reaffirm our support for the sister republics of Korea and express our solidarity with their aspirations for reunification and for the total withdrawal of United States occupation forces from the southern peninsula. We trust that we shall shortly have the delegation of a united Korea in the United Nations.\nWe also express our support for the legitimate desires of Cyprus, a non-aligned country to which we are linked by ties of close friendship. We call for preservation of its independence, sovereignty, national unity, territorial integrity and non-aligned status. We also welcome the talks between representatives of the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities. We support the convening of an international conference on Cyprus under the auspices of the United Nations.\nIn the present international circumstances, we should increase our efforts to put an end to the wandering life of the Palestinian people, who are subjected to unparalleled outrages on their native land. The response of the Palestinian people to Zionist abuse has been a national popular uprising which since its beginning last December has marked the start of a new phase in the long struggle waged by the Palestinian people against foreign colonization and domination.\nWe reaffirm our support for the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle East with equal participation by all parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We reaffirm our conviction that there can be no solution to the conflict in the Middle East without a solution to the Palestinian question and without recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the establishment of their own State.\nWe support the just cause of the people of Lebanon in their just struggle for national unity, respect for their territorial integrity and for preservation of their non-aligned status. We support the call for the withdrawal of Moroccan troops and administration from the territory of Western Sahara and for the establishment of an independent and sovereign Sahraoui state.\nWe continue to support Bolivia's just claim for direct and practical access to the sea, a right supported by the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. We support Argentina's claim of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. We reiterate our solidarity with Madagascar and its claims over the Malagasy islands of Glorieuses, Juan de Nova, Europa and Bassas da India. We also support the aspirations of Comoros to regain sovereignty over Mayotte.\nOther vestiges of colonialism also remain in Guam, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, East Timor, Gibraltar, New Caledonia, Anguilla, Pitcairn, Montserrat, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands and elsewhere. We cannot disregard the attempts to prevent the independence and sovereignty of so-called Micronesia.\nCuba is still suffering from illegal occupation of its territory by the United States naval base in Guantanamo, which remains there against the wishes of our people and Government, in violation of the most basic norms of international law. However, the day will come when we shall exercise sovereignty throughout our territory. Since the end of the last century, Puerto Rico has remained under the yoke of the most powerful colonial system of our century. It is the steadfast duty of the Cuban revolution, which liberated its own people from shackles, to contribute to the independence of Puerto Rico, as Jose Marti stated when he founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party almost 100 years ago, and prevent Puerto Rican soil from being used for the launching of continued aggression against other States of the region.\nThe General Assembly is duty-bound to continue to endeavour to promote the exercise of the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination; to independence; to sovereignty over their natural resources; to free economic and social development to defence of their traditions, languages and cultural identities; and to demand the removal of military bases from their sea and their soil.\nThe world is now facing the dilemma of peace or war. We have no tight to disregard the appeals of our peoples. We must be prepared to live in peace. We must create the machinery that will enhance and strengthen confidence and security among nations, as well as peaceful coexistence and productivity.\nWe must lay the foundations for the relationships of the future so that the generations of the next millennium will feel proud of the heritage left to them by their predecessors. That is our goal.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina our congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We has our best wishes for success and the assurance of our full co-operation, as he presides over what promises to be one of the most historic and far-reaching sessions of the General Assembly. We also has our appreciation for the very efficient manner in which he has thus far presided over our deliberations and otherwise piloted the business of the Assembly. In this respect, he has given us a great deal to be pleased with.\nIt is appropriate, we believe, to gay a tribute also to Dame Ruth Nita Barrow, Permanent representative of Barbados, who was also a candidate for the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. This outstanding daughter of the Caribbean has given her country, her region, and her friends much to be proud of. It is rare for one region to present two such eminently qualified persons for the same office at the same time. In so doing this region has once again, as it did five years earlier, enhanced and encouraged the development of democratic processes within the United Nations itself. For this we commend them both and we thank the Assembly.\nMr. Caputo is known as a man who cherishes democracy. His Government is one which is committed to democratic principles and ideals and which has worked hard to nurture and consolidate the restoration of his country's democracy. Thus, under his presidency, there can never be too many reminders of the importance of fostering and encouraging democracy, particularly in international relations and within international organizations. \nTo us in Vanuatu, a small island developing State, the enhancement of international democratic processes is far more than a nice-sounding slogan, an interesting theory, or a remote abstraction. We view this as an essential element of our development as an independent State. Our very survival as a nation depends on universal respect for the most basic and fundamental principles of international law, particularly respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every country regardless of its size, its location, or the health of its economy.\nUnfortunately, in international relations there have always been a few who occasionally forget to live by these important principles. Like small countries in every region of the world we have in recent year \u03b1 become very distressed by the rapidly accelerating tendency of some larger States to forsake calm and rational dialogue as a solution to international problems. They seem to favour instead an escalating arms race, threats, and the actual use of military force.\nIn some instances, economic coercion and intimidation have been substituted for military force, but the results have been the same - international chaos. The chaos that has resulted may, on the surface, have appeared to be less violent than that which occurred during the two world wars earlier this century. However, to those who have been the victims of the chaos, the consequences have been as severe and as tragic as those of the two world wars. After all, how large is the world of a frightened refugee fleeing his or her home in a desperate attempt to save his or her life in southern Africa, in South-East Asia, in Central America, or in the Middle East? Therefore smaller countries# such as our own# often view with a sense of urgency the need for the international community to strengthen democratic processes and truly recognize the inherent equality of all human beings and by extension the sovereign equality of all nations - large and small, rich and poor. While we cannot comprehend are those who proclaim that all people are equal, or that all nations are equal# but who then act as if might - be it military or economic - makes some \\\"more equal\\\" than others.\nThus# today, as hopes are being revived for genuine political dialogue to be a vehicle for resolving so many of the world's problems and as so many dreams of democratic freedoms are being born in so many places, we view this assemblage of nations as more relevant and potentially more dynamic than any other time in its brief history.\nLike so many others, we are encouraged by the possibility that hostilities and tensions may be diminishing in so many parts of the world and that peace may finally become a reality for so many beleaguered and besieged peoples. Military conflict between the world's two great super-Powers now appears less likely for this the entire world can breathe a collective sigh of relief. The war between Iran and Iraq may finally be coming to an end. The Soviet Union is demonstrating how great a Power it is by withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan as it promised it would. \nThere are also faint glimmers of hope that the long and costly conflicts in Kampuchean Western Sahara, Chad, Namibia and Central America may possibly be resolved and the people of those countries left to choose their own future, free from outside interference. Furthermore, tentative steps have been taken to lay aside old antagonisms and differences in focus, the Korean peninsula, the Balkans, the Maghreb and the Horn of Africa. Every day former rivals are discovering that there is more that unites them than that divides them.\nHowever, we must be realistic and understand that the road to peace is still paved with a great many obstacles. In every one of the areas where there is new hope, we must understand that there is little that is certain. The process of finding workable solutions and then implementing those solutions remains fragile and extremely delicate in every one of the previously mentioned situations.\nDespite what some might like us to believe, dialogue itself is never the sole answer for resolving any conflict. For dialogue to succeed there must also be a willingness to work together and to change the past antagonistic relationships and actions which led to existing contradictions and hostilities. In certain instances, circumstances dictate that there will be no rational dialogue until there has been a political struggle.\nIn this respect we are reminded once again of the words of Frederick Douglass, a leader of the anti-slavery movement during the nineteenth century and a great orator. As he most aptly put it,\n\\\"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\\\" Had he been alive today he might very well have been examining life in South Africa under the heel of the apartheid regime, or the motivation of the Palestinian resistance, when he said: If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favour freedom, yet deprecate agitation, ate men who want ... rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.\\\"\nWe might do well to recall those words during our deliberations, particularly our deliberations on those items of our agenda which relate to pleas for justice from those who have for fat too long been denied justice.\nWe believe that rational dialogue is the preferred way of conducting international relations and resolving disputes between nations. However, we also understand that dialogue is only possible when there is sin appreciation of its basis, and when there is common ground on which to meet.\nThere is not likely to be a meaningful dialogue in South Africa until the illegitimate apartheid regime recognizes the humanity of the African majority, frees from prison all those it should be negotiating with and allows others to return from exile. There is not likely to be a successful dialogue on the question of Palestine until all the interested parties are brought together at an international conference. In our own region, the question of East Timor will not be resolved until the people of that Territory are part of the process of dialogue and are allowed to choose freely for themselves who they are and what they wish to be.\nDialogue is not diatribe. The word carries within its meaning a willingness to listen and at least to understand the perspective of the partner in the dialogue. Perhaps the roost difficult notion for some to grasp is the notion that sincere dialogue does not necessarily entail claims that one party, but not the other, has seen the error of its ways and is now committed to change and to adopting the values and beliefs of its former adversary.  The largest and seemingly most intractable political problems between modern States can probably best be resolved by a convergence of views and a convergence of values. Mutual respect is the key, not domination or empty claims of triumph. As we all knew, in this nuclear age, this age of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, there are few instances in which any particular State can claim outright victory and impose its will on another.\nNew Caledonia is a case in point with respect to the effects of reasonableness and dialogue. During the last two General Assembly sessions, few items were as heatedly debated as the colonial status of our South Pacific neighbour. Our own relations with France, and those of our other Pacific neighbours, could not help but be affected by what we viewed as insensitivity to the legitimate aspirations of the colonized indigenous Kanak population of New Caledonia. We are pleased that today things are calmer in New Caledonia. This is due in part to the wisdom, the sensitivity and the courage of the current Government of France. It is also due to the courage and vision of New Caledonia's people and to their desire not to see their land torn further apart by civil inter-communal strife. There are still many difficult issues to be resolved in New Caledonia, but France deserves credit for changing the emotion-charged atmosphere in the Territory and taking measures to bring New Caledonia's people together in peace for a dialogue on the future.\nNo one can predict with certainty what lies ahead. We recall what happened more than 14 years ago when another European country, which was then a colonial Fewer in Africa, underwent a change of Government. It then put forward various proposals and options which prompted the leadership of what was then a liberation movement and is now an African Government to issue a reminder that \\\"there is no such thing as democratic colonialism\\\". Those words ring as true today as they did in 1974. \n\nThe South Pacific Forum, the Non-Aligned Movement and the united Nations have all contributed to the current hopeful state of affairs in New Caledonia, through their consistent support for well-established principles of self-determination and decolonization. However, the candid approach of the French Government and the patience and statesmanship of New Caledonia's people have been like a breath of fresh air.\nWe believe that no possibility for further dialogue and peaceful evolution with regard to New Caledonia should be left unexplored. Therefore, we were encouraged by the consensus reached by the Special Committee on decolonization when it considered the question of New Caledonia in August. We hope that the General Assembly will encourage the parties to continue to work together by reaching the same consensus on the recommendations of the Committee of 24.\nMy Government understands and supports the principled position of the African States on the issue of dumping nuclear and industrial waste in Africa. It was not too long ago that we raised the same issue with respect to our own region. We hope that that problem will be considered in its true global perspective rather than merely on a regional basis, which could lead to other regions' becoming dumping grounds for dangerous waste materials from the industrialized countries. We also hope that the views of the countries of the South Pacific on nuclear testing in our environment will similarly be understood and supported. What is at stake in Africa is also at stake in the South Pacific.\nThe name of the country doing the testing or shipping the waste to be dumped is irrelevant to us. The stated purpose of the testing is also irrelevant, as is the money paid for the dumping. What matters to us is the harm being done to our waters, to our lands, to our atmosphere, to our sources of food and sustenance and to our unborn children. Please try to understand our concerns. \nIt is ironic that many of the world's industrial countries became developed countries at the expense of what is now called the developing world. We, the now less-developed countries, were once forced to export cheap raw materials - and in some cases even our people, against their will - to help fuel the development of other countries. In return we were forced to accept certain manufactured goods, and agencies, in some cases even \u0440\u0435\u043e\u04401\u0435\u0433 in a reverse migration that was, again, against our will, against our own political and economic interests and ultimately against our own sovereignty.\nNow, we are still exporting raw materials. Today, they are called commodities, and we have little more to say about their prices than we did yesterday. Developing countries still export people as well. Some, of course, are refugees who have been made homeless and socially marginal. Others are not refugees but instead tend to be the most capable and best trained, with skills that are in great demand in developed countries and that ace in short supply in developing countries. However, owing to adverse economic conditions, those skilled individuals usually cannot be as highly compensated or recognized in our developing countries. Often, therefore, developing countries wind up with smaller long-term returns on expenditures for higher education and advanced training. Paradoxically, we sometimes find ourselves in a sense subsidizing developed countries, which, on a proportional basis, might actually spend less on education but which are able to offer far greater financial rewards to those trained by other societies.\nDeveloping countries also export something else, namely, capital, in the form of debt-servicing. That phenomenon has now appreciably widened the gap between have and have-not nations and created extremely dangerous social conditions in many debtor nations. It is almost incomprehensible that there is not a greater appreciation of the potential danger among the foremost decision-makers in the creditor States and financial institutions. It is also ironic that, while some were encouraged to borrow excessively, others found it almost impossible to borrow at all.\nThe manner in which some countries were encouraged to burden themselves with excessive debt is somewhat similar to the manner in which individuals were encouraged to acquire other well-known addictions. The habit is proving to be just as difficult to break, and the social consequences just as severe.\nWe offer those observations without bitterness, rancour or recrimination. We do not know of any easy solutions. However, we believe that we cannot adequately face the future without an understanding of the past. We cannot work together in finding answers until we know what questions we want answered.\nThe recent natural disasters that have brought death, destruction and new hardships to the peoples of Jamaica, Mexico, Bangladesh and India have shocked the world. Humanitarian assistance has been mobilized to help speed recovery.\nHowever, we ask once again: why does the world always wait for disaster to strike before going to the aid of those who ate roost vulnerable?\nThe specialized agencies of the United Nations system, particularly the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (PAO) do an excellent job with the resources they have at their command. Many private social and philanthropic organizations are also deeply committed and Involved in the development process. However, adverse environmental and climatic conditions, as well as the follies of mankind, are strong and persistent adversaries. They will not easily cease their assaults on the efforts to bring a better life to every corner of the globe. \nThus, my Government joins with those who appeal greater international co-operation in United Nations development activities and disaster-relief efforts. We join with those who appeal for an end to the arms race and arms trafficking. We join with those who work relentlessly to end drug trafficking and the social devastation it brings in its wake. We applaud initiatives to study and address the serious threat posed to life on this planet by the destruction of the Earth's protective ozone layer. It appears that in the years to come no issue will be more vital to mankind's survival. The gravity of this issue is reflected in the fact that even as we meet here today more chlorine and other chemicals are being released into our atmosphere. These will cause even more depletion of the ozone shield well into the next century.\nMankind has been blessed, we believe, with a high form of intelligence and a wide range of emotions. Occasionally we utilize this blessing as if it were a curse on our fellow human beings.\nWe have created horrible weapons of mass destruction, ranging from large stockpiles of conventional arms to chemical and bacteriological agents and nuclear devices. Unfortunately, those who have such weapons are seldom satisfied with their mere creation and possession.\nThe use of these instruments of death has always been among the saddest chapters of the human experience, lb day more than ever before the international community should speak with one loud and clear voice against the manufacture, stockpiling and use of all these instruments of unholy terror. Our failure to do so can only result in greater human tragedy and irreparably rupture the thread that binds us all together.\nDuring last year's general debate we expressed our sadness that inter-communal strife was plaguing every corner of the globe. Unfortunately, the plague seems to have worsened during the past year. Once again, it is not necessary to recite names, dates or places\u00b7, we are all painfully familiar with them. Nor do we wish to single out any particular country or region. The problem is universal. Once again we note that much of this inter-communal of ethnic strife has its roots in colonial history, during which colonialist practices often appeared to favour one ethnic group over another. However, some of today's inter-communal or ethnic conflicts either pre-date or are not at all related to colonialism. These are, rather, the result of ancient antagonisms and rivalries that all Governments should find unacceptable in the contemporary world.\nWhile we are concerned at the growth and proliferation of these conflicts, we firmly adhere to the well-founded principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and respect for the territorial integrity of every internationally recognized State.\nWe are aware that from time to time Internal and external opponents of particular Governments have incited or helped fan the flames of inter-communal or ethnic strife. However, that does not mean that we should close our eyes or our ears and pretend that the problem does not exist. This is a major problem which Is likely to become worse unless the nations of the world exercise strong moral leadership.\nMany people in the world look to the United Nations for such leadership. Generally speaking, we do not fail to exercise this leadership in a responsible fashion. The general subject of inter-communal or ethnic relations is one on which we believe that the international community should exercise its moral leadership by its example. We despair when we note that no region of the world and no country anywhere is completely Immune from this problem. Even the largest and wealthiest countries in the developed world have had to face this difficult issue, and still face it today. Those that face the issue with the greatest candour will make the greatest advances in stemming ethnic fears and bettering human relations. \nFor developing countries, our failure to recognize that the problem exists can only have disastrous consequences. We wish to see no society torn asunder, no country dismembered, no people displaced or disenfranchised and no Government embarrassed. We wish, rather, to encourage peoples everywhere to respect the cultures, customs and history of others. We wish to encourage greater understanding of what has divided people in the past and what can unite them in the future. We wish to see a broad international consensus appealing for an end to inter-communal strife, better inter-ethnic relations, and social progress and economic development for all peoples in every corner of the world.\nPerhaps this vision of ours is a dream. However, it is a dream we are proud to possess and be possessed by. We pray that others share this dream and will be willing to join in making it a reality. What could possibly be more consistent with the ideals that have brought us together? What could possibly be more consistent with our own pronouncements on the evils of apartheid and other forms of institutionalized racism? What better way to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?\nI conclude by conveying our appreciation of the efforts of the President of the last session, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, and those of our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. Their dedication, their patience and their successes on our behalf have in many ways helped to make the future far brighter than it was one year ago.\nThe recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations for its peace-keeping operations is very appropriate recognition of the fact that, through his tireless efforts and with the able assistance of a Secretariat of which we should all be proud, the Secretary-General has at last succeeded in narrowly opening the door to the very long corridor to peace, justice and harmony. \nNow we, the nations of the world, must do our best to play our part by opening the door further and taking the next important step. It rests with us to cross the threshold of that door and begin the long walk down that corridor together, hand in hand.\nLet us draw strength from our unity. Let us draw courage from the realization of our common fate should we fail or should we falter. Let us be nations that are, in purpose and objectives, truly united.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI warmly welcome this opportunity to extend to you. Sir, the congratulations of the delegation of St. Kitts and Nevis on your election to the eminent post of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. For the Government and peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean it is always a source of immense satisfaction to witness the presidency entrusted to one chosen from among us - and all the more to one as able as you. My delegation places absolute confidence in your abilities successfully to guide the deliberations of this body and pledges its full co-operation.\nMay I also heartily congratulate the outgoing President, Mr. Peter Florin, on his skilful guidance of the work of the General Assembly during the past year. The task was undoubtedly challenging, but he met every challenge with competence, renewed spirit and dexterity.\nIt is with a profound sense of admiration that, at this point, I pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his untiring efforts exerted in the pursuit of peaceful resolutions of the persistent and sometimes escalating conflicts that continue to beset the world community.\nWe have listened year after year as increasing numbers of disputes between nations and aggravating world problems have been brought to the attention of this body. Indeed, over the past 43 years of its existence the United Nations has had its lofty principles challenged by intense local, regional and international disputes that have increased sorrow to mankind and threatened to annihilate whole peoples\u00b7, by deep-seated ideological differences that have compartmentalized the world and vitiated against international co-operation in solving international problems, by persistent underdevelopment, abject poverty and acts of inhumanity that have made a mockery of human dignity, the right to freedom and a better standard of life. \nOften Member States express disappointment in the United Nations when solutions to our problems appear unattainable. But perhaps such disappointment results from unrealistic expectations from the Organization. For it can achieve only as much as its Member States permit it to achieve. The success of our concerted efforts to resolve global disputes is highly dependent on international dialogue and conciliation. It is the role of this body to foster such dialogue and such conciliation. However, the responsibility for good-neighbourliness and international peace and security remains that of each nation State.\nMy delegation is particularly encouraged by the noticeably improved international political climate, which has provided a favourable ambiance for the conduct of fruitful negotiations this year. Certain recent developments identify 1988 as a diplomatic and political watershed year, heralding long-awaited compliance with United Nations resolutions on prolonged conflicts.\nWithin the category of world events that respond to dialogue fits the recent agreement on arms limitation and disarmament. The ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, which calls for a 50 per cent reduction of the strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and the USSR signifies a major achievement for the entire world in the process of arms limitation and disarmament. We are all aware that divergent positions plagued the agreement, but we are heartened by the display of political will between the two major military Powers to reach an agreement. This movement in disarmament could augur well for the long-range goal of comprehensive disarmament called for by the General Assembly. Its prospects no longer seem as remote as they were a few years ago. My delegation continues to agitate for comprehensive disarmament, which includes not only nuclear weapons but conventional and chemical weapons as well. Let us be conscious that the survival and well-being of future generations is the responsibility of us all - nuclear and non-nuclear States alike.\nSimilarly, the situation in the Persian Gulf gives us cause to be optimistic about the prospects for peace in that troubled region. Just a few months ago the Islamic Republic of Iran announced its formal acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). That decision was welcomed by Member States as it signified that a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq could now be affected and negotiations to bring about lasting peace in the region could be set in motion. My delegation reflects sadly on the thousands of lives lost and the millions of dollars worth of damage that resulted from the nine-year conflict, and remains grieved at the fact that the suffering and loss were allowed to escalate to such proportions. I trust that the decision of both Iraq and Iran to abide by the Security Council resolution is now reflective of a desire to coexist peacefully.\nThe role of the Secretary-General in this initiative must be lauded. He drew on his vast and proved diplomatic skills and displayed tenacity and endurance while mediating the complex negotiations that led to acceptance by both nations. My delegation would like to encourage him in his efforts to pursue this initiative to the desired goal of a stable and lasting peace.\nThe situation in Afghanistan also shows signs of responding to international dialogue. For some eight years the General Assembly and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted strongly worded resolutions condemning the foreign occupation of Afghanistan. For eight years the international community kept the pressure on the occupying country by calling for the withdrawal from Afghanistan of all foreign troops. Those actions were supplemented by the efforts of former Under-Secretary-General Diego Cordovez. At last, this year, the Geneva accord was signed by all parties involved, and today troops are being withdrawn from Afghanistan. My delegation is only too aware that the real settlement of the problem lies in the hands of the Afghan people. Theirs is the task of establishing the Government of their choice and undertaking the restructuring of their country.\nWe regard with optimism the prospects for resolution of the status of Western Sahara. St. Kitts and Nevis notes with satisfaction the manifestation by both POLIS AR 10 and the Kingdom of Morocco of the political will and co-operation required in order to bring a peaceful end to this conflict which has persisted for more than a decade. The combined efforts of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations must be recognized as practical arrangements for a referendum by the Sahraoui people are formulated. My delegation urges both parties to intensify the negotiation process and bring a speedy settlement to the conflict. \nBy the same token, my delegation regards with cautious optimism the talks between the Governments concerned to bring an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia by South African troops. We have always supported the United Nations Flan for the Independence of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization and take this opportunity to reaffirm that support. We must remain firm in our resolve to bring about a liberated and an independent Namibia and take bold initiatives to make it a reality.\nWe renew our call for the United Nations to play a positive role in bringing about reconciliation between South Korea and North Korea. We support member ship in the United Nations for both countries on the Korean peninsula as a positive step to enhancing their dialogue towards reunification within this Organization's structured and sympathetic framework.\nWhile we can see rays of hope in several of the areas of conflict, that is not at present the case in the Middle East. Hope for an end to the conflict can lie only in solutions which recognize the rights of the Palestinian people to a well-defined homeland must co-exist with the tight of the people of Israel to live within secure borders. A first step to peace would be for all parties to adhere to the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on the issue.\n\u00b7\nMy Government also shares the view that the convening of the international peace conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations and at the invitation of the Secretary-General and all parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict, would be another appropriate step towards achieving a peaceful, comprehensive and just settlement of the conflict. The Secretary-General is therefore urged to continue his attempts to make the convening of this conference a reality. \nAnother area of continued concern to the international community is the situation in Kampuchea. Hostilities have entered a tenth year and there seems to be no foreseeable end. My delegation stands firmly behind the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on this question since its thirty-fourth session and awaits their implementation. The restoration and preservation of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kampuchean people as well as their right to determine their own destiny, should continue to be the goal, supported most assuredly by the international community.\nIn our own region, conflicts in Central America have set back the process of economic development. It is commendable that the Governments of Central America have mapped out a plan of action to restore peace and stability to their countries. We applaud the persistent efforts of the Contadora Group. We believe its efforts and those of others in the region deserve the full support of the international community, so that the United Nations objective of turning swords into ploughshares may be achieved.\nWe are deeply concerned about the unstable situation which exists in Haiti. Clearly, political events have made it difficult for meaningful economic development to proceed. We in the region stand ready to assist the people of Haiti as far as is practically possible, and we also invite the attention of the international community.\nWe must recognize the basic truth that social and economic problems have become both a cause and an effect of aggravated political tensions. Peace and development are inextricably intertwined objectives and we cannot achieve the one without the other. In May this year the United Nations approved a special economic plan for Central America which will assist the peoples of that region in restructuring and stabilizing their economies. This is clearly a step in the right direction.\nMy delegation notes the willingness of Belize and Guatemala to enter into dialogue. We call for early ratification of the Cartegena Protocol as a contribution to the lowering of tensions.\nInternational political issues constitute but a fraction of our common preoccupations. Continued human rights violations and worsening economic conditions provide equal cause for perplexity and consternation. Chief among our human rights concerns is the total eradication of the evil system of apartheid perpetuated in South Africa. My delegation reiterates its abhorrence of that inhumane system and continues to support the call for comprehensive sanctions to be taken against South Africa.\nWith the many sanctions already imposed, and with the perpetuation of apartheid in the face of them all, countries are prone to question the effectiveness of those measures. We are assured that comprehensive sanctions are working. According to an analysis done by the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers, trade and financial sanctions ate having a debilitating impact on South Africa's economy and this impact would be even more far-reaching were the sanctions themselves more widely adopted and their application tightened and intensified. Further disinvestment programmes must be pursued.\nOn a more positive note, however, in preparation for a free and democratic South Africa the international community needs to address the stabilization and security needs of the front-line States and to offer training to the black people of South Africa so that they may be adequately equipped to accept the task of rebuilding their country. The world's economic situation is another problem of enormous proportions for developing countries. We appear to be caught in a quagmire. A total restructuring of the world economic order is imperative if our goal of world development is to be achieved. We in the developing countries continue to experience relatively slow or negative growth in our economies. Sharp commodity-price declines, unavailability of external sources of finance, adverse terms of trade, debt-re-servicing problems - all still frustrate our economic ambitions. Clearly there is a pressing need to reassess the present international economic order to create greater opportunities for the developing countries to share equally in the world's resources. \nWe must concede that the international achievement of development strategies for the First, Second and Third United Nations Development Decades have been limited. We can only hopes that the development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade will be more fruitful.\nIn the developing countries, however, we must do more than hope. We must seize the opportunity of the current wave of peace initiatives, first, to divert our own energies and resources away from areas of conflict to confront the challenges of development on our own terms and on the basis of our own realities. Then we must challenge the developed countries to engage immediately in meaningful dialogue with us so that significant resources can be diverted from the battlefields and from the silos to improve the housing, the education, the employment opportunities, the infrastructure and the social and economic fabric of the developing countries.\nPeace must not become an international vacuum signifying only the absence of war. Peace must be a well-spring of opportunity and hope for the young, the elderly, the sick, the handicapped and the poor. Peace must be a powerful force that moves us forward, upward and onward. Peace must inspire us to achieve the greatest heights of humanitarian excellence of which we are capable. I send out a clarion call for peace between East and West to become a harbinger of a new era of co-operation between North and South.\nIn this context, I must issue an appeal for special consideration to be given to the unique problems of island developing countries, a number of highly reputable studies have shown that island developing countries have characteristics distinct from those of developing countries in general. It is essential, therefore, that there be flexibility in designing and supporting development strategies which are appropriate for addressing our special needs. \nOne of our major handicaps is vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, from which islands in the Caribbean are especially at risk. Jamaica's devastation by hurricane Gilbert is graphic testimony to this fact. Other problems include: small internal markets, lack of natural resources, heavy dependence on imports and the high per capita cost of building and maintaining economic and social infrastructure. Snail islands lack the critical mass to provide basic services economically for their populations. However, if island people are to enjoy an acceptable quality of life, these services must be provided. Certainly this community of nations cannot accept that the right to basic amenities, to life, to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness is to be enjoyed only by people in large metropolitan societies.\nMany resolutions have been passed in the General Assembly on island developing countries in the last decade. Let us seize the opportunity of the day and translate these laudable resolutions into effective action.\nWhile we have temporised and failed to address seriously the grave economic problems of developing countries, new crises have arisen which threaten to destroy the social and economic fabric of our societies and take a heavy toll on human lives. I refer to the problems of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking, and the dumping of hazardous waste in third-world countries.\nThe widespread increase in drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking has created a world awareness that the problem transcends national and regional boundaries. It menaces the fabric of all our societies and destroys our young people. Countries of the Caribbean are particularly vulnerable as by the nature of our geography we are used as transit points for drug trafficking, with the possibility of also becoming points of consumption. It is time for a co-ordinated global effort aimed at eliminating production, interdicting trafficking and eradicating consumption, especially where the market is greatest.\nSimilarly, the increasing reported incidents of dumping of hazardous waste in third-world countries indicate that a matter has arisen that requires urgent international attention. Recent investigations carried out by governmental and non-governmental environmental groups reveal that in the past few months there has been a proliferation of proposals and actual attempts to ship hazardous industrial and nuclear waste from industrialized countries to third-world countries. The developed countries must keep their waste. They have the resources to devote to its safe disposal.\nCaribbean countries are among the targeted dump sites. For us, this phenomenon has serious implications. First, we lack the adequate legislative and administrative mechanisms to control the management and proper disposal of the waste. Exposure to the environment will result in irreversible damage to ecosystems and human lives. Secondly, conditions in the Caribbean, and indeed in many third-world countries, are almost perfect for the spread of the harmful heavy metals and toxic chemicals found in the waste -\u00b7 for example, porous soils, wind and water erosion and tropical temperatures. Dependent as we are on our environment, our marine life and our human resources for development, this trend is a very serious threat to our survival, a menace to relations between States and a threat to international peace.\nMy delegation supports the request that an item addressing the problem be placed on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. It is a problem that demands international co-operation and immediate attention. It seems to be true that the world is weary of war. The world has decided, in the words of a famous song, to \\\"give peace a chance\\\". However, we must return to war. Indeed I am calling for a new declaration of war, a war to be fought with an intensity hitherto unknown, on the most violent of battlefields a war to be fought to the finish; a war on poverty; a was: on drug production, drug trafficking and drug consumption; a war against the destruction of the world's resources; a war on economic slavery. This must be a true world war, fought with the present resources and the creative ingenuity of all mankind; a war in which the North fights alongside the South, the East alongside the West; a war that is waged till all mankind is truly free to realize its vast potential and to live with dignity and an uplifting quality of life.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, I should like at the outset to congratulate you on your election to the esteemed post of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I feel sure that the possibility of restoring to the United Nations the spirit of conciliation and peace for which it was founded will depend, in no small measure, on your wise and experienced guidance.\nIn a discussion of the Middle East, history should precede diplomacy. The region has known epochs of war and golden ages, military conquests and spiritual greatness. It was in the Middle East that an invisible divide saw frustration and promise prevail in an unpredictable, seemingly uncontrollable, cycle. Yet it was man who triggered waves of hope and despair. Thus it was man who determined the course of history.\nToday, once again, the region faces a moment of human choice.\nWe are preparing for a better tomorrow. We are prepared with a vision of peace. It is the vision of an end to a futile, economically devastating arras race now sliding in the inhumane direction of chemical and biological warfare. Ballistic missiles know no boundaries, chemical warheads do not distinguish young from old. Those senseless enough to employ them must recognize that they are creating a danger to themselves as well.\nIt is a vision of an opportunity to concentrate on scientific and technological breakthroughs on Earth and in space, on civilian requirements rather than military needs where resources wasted on armaments are invested in creative enterprises from the greening of the land to the clearing of the waters, from educating young children to caring for the senior citizen.\nIt is a vision of a region whose stability is inviting, whose dwelling is hospitable, whose creativity is encouraging, whose needs are seriously addressed by those seeking to invest in promoting stability and in expanding economic potential.\nIt is a vision of a region come of age, a region cognizant of global rapprochement, a region ready to tackle the heretofore seemingly insoluble in order to offer a better future for all - Jews and Arabs alike - a region ready to respect differences among peoples without discriminating against any.\nIt is a vision that is a necessity. It is a vision that is within reach.\nYet the smoke of old fires is still in the air and new ones threaten to darken the horizon. \nUnless we take decisive action to change course belligerency will not be overcome. We have to do our utmost to ensure that never again will a young man or woman die in a war we failed to prevent.\nWhat should be done to achieve this goal?\nI shall start with Israel.\nThree years ago Israel stood before this Assembly and pledged to dedicate its efforts to the pursuit of peace. That pledge rested not only on resolve, but also on a conviction: that in the north, war can be brought to an end; in the south, peace can be salvaged and nourished and, in the east, the ground can be laid to start meaningful negotiations.\nIn all three directions we laboured to fulfil the commitment.\nIn the north, we put an end to our involvement in Lebanon. We are out of Lebanon, its land and politics. Our sole concern is to see that Lebanon no longer serves as the base for hostile activities against us.\nIn the south, we have revived our relations with Egypt, which has since restored full diplomatic representation in Israel. We have witnessed Egypt, under the steady leadership of President Mubarak - dedicated to progress at home and peace in the region - reassume its central role in the Arab world without parting with its peace strategy.\nIn the east, we have experienced hope and frustration. Until less than a year ago, before things went awry, the West Bank turned from the centre of violent debate to the focus of diplomatic efforts. Most significantly, in April 1987, energetic and creative diplomacy produced a framework for negotiations. Known as \\\"the London Document\\\", it provided a non-imposing internationally supported setting for direct negotiations. \nUnfortunately, while still viable, the effort has not yet reached fruition. Sadly, the absence of progress was accompanied by an outbreak of violence. Wrongly, the Palestinians chose to knock on the door of the future with stones in their hands. Knocking with a message of peace would have triggered an entirely different situation.\nIndeed, the Palestinians must recognize that it is possible to secure their legitimate rights - but not at the expense of Israel's security. Palestinian aspirations and Israeli security are not necessarily incompatible. \nPeace is an Israeli national interest. While we have confidence in the capacity of the Israeli Defence Forces to defend our country, by deterring any aggression and defeating it if need be, we consider the achievement of peace through diplomacy the greatest victory of all. My country has never surrendered to the pressures of war and will never yield to violence. In peace negotiations we shall stand firm on our security interests. Yet we stand ready for a historic compromise with our neighbours. For 40 years we have built our strength so as not to negotiate out of weakness. Today we are strong enough to negotiate for peace.\nIsrael has no intention of harming the Palestinian people. Israel has no desire to dominate their lives or to hurt their pride. We are prepared to negotiate with them, fairly, freely, as equals, a meeting-ground of needs, where Palestinians can enjoy their identity and Israelis security in peace.\nWe are prepared to conduct negotiations on the basis of the only framework, reaffirmed this week in the trilateral meeting chaired by President Reagan, with the participation of the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and accepted by Arab countries as well as by all permanent members of the Security Council - that is. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), calling for a territorial compromise and secure borders. They are the only existing common ground.\nAs we stand ready to live up to these commitments, we shall be as clear in addressing our expectations of our neighbours. For there can be peace, but not unilaterally; there can be accommodation, but only by mutual effort. We expect from the Arab world a clear voice for peace. For how long can a desire for peace be treated as a secret password as though we were living in clandestine surroundings? Commitment to peace must emerge loud and clear, for sceptics to witness, for the hopeful to respond. \nWe expect the Arab world to realize that there is no indirect peace. Peace is meant to reinforce, not to undermine, freedom and security for all involved.\nWe expect the Arab world, including the Palestinians, to do away with the contradiction of sweet promises and bitter violence. A policy of \\\"no war, no peace\\\", much like a policy that claims to combine both, is an exercise in evasion. A choice must be made: to pay the price of peace or to be resigned to the costs of war.\nAll of us must recognize changing realities. That which was rejected when offered, that which was doomed by war, that which could have been possible, belongs to the past. In the realities of 1988 the lines of 1947 no longer exist. After the Six-Day War Israel should not be expected to return to the lines from which it attacked. Readiness for a territorial compromise does not include readiness to compromise security.\nA breakthrough requires the understanding that peace is a matter of choice; it is the outcome of decisions; it is the product of a historic compromise. No vague formulation can replace a clear strategy to part with the past. The turn to a so-called Government-in-exile, the return to General Assembly partition resolution 181 (II), represents yet another escape to the realm of self-illusion. Any attempt to add to or subtract from the only commonly accepted basis for negotiations is bound to destroy the existing framework without creating a new one. Fuelled by a commitment to no war and no violence, no terrorism and no pressure, we can travel the distance towards accommodation.\nTo the Palestinians I must say with candour that violence does not pay off. By avoiding negotiations they are depriving themselves of their hope. For there is hardly a chance for a compromise to emerge in the absence of, or prior to, a free negotiating process. \nAlthough we cannot agree in advance on the outcome of negotiations  we can agree on the process by which to go forward - negotiations as an open-ended effort, free of pressure, imposition or threat. In those negotiations, Jordanians and Palestinians, much like ourselves, may present expectations and demands as they labour to balance contradictory aspirations so as to answer the call of peace. We are ready to enter into negotiations with Jordan and with authentic representatives of the Palestinian people who ate men of peace and not men of violence, in order to solve our differences with Jordan and to resolve the Palestinian problem in all its aspects. We are ready to negotiate with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. Yet, as peace is unlikely to be achieved in one leap, we are prepared to start negotiations without prior conditions with a Jordanian delegation or a Palestinian one. We hope that the Palestinians will not postpone the prospects of peace; and we hope that Jordan, regardless of its relations with them, will not postpone negotiations either.\nI wish to express the gratitude of my people to the United States, its leaders and its institutions for their firm and consistent support. The United States has enabled us to guarantee our security. It has encouraged us, as it has our neighbours, to enter into political negotiations.\nThe Shultz initiative calling upon the parties to enter into direct negotiations and negotiate a just and fair solution calls also on the permanent members of the Security Council to avoid imposing solutions, refrain from applying pressure and serve as supporters of peace. This initiative, which provides for direct negotiations launched in a non-coercive international setting - remains available for consideration.\nWhen we had an opportunity to review the prospects for peace earlier this week we were reassured by the unanimity among the host. President Reagan, and his guests from Egypt and Israel that there is no substitute for an ongoing, uninterrupted effort towards peace, and that all those attending are resolved to fill the next few months with relevant content.\nI wish to express my hope that the policies adopted by the Soviet Onion under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev will lead to a world of more ploughshares and fewer swords. Moscow has undertaken some steps, which, though partial and limited, are yet of importance. Zionist prisoners have been released. The number of Jewish emigration permits has grown. Consular groups have been stationed in the Soviet Union and Israel respectively. We have taken note of statements from Moscow calling on all sides in the Middle East to adopt realistic positions with the objective of demilitarizing international relations. \nI wish to express the hope of my people that the cultural autonomy announced by the Soviet leadership will enable our Jewish brethren to pray to our Lord in their own synagogues, to teach their children the history of the Jewish people, to express themselves in the language of their forefathers, and to set sail to the shores of the promised land.\nAs we watch with wonder and respect the People's Republic of China rearrange its own destiny, we hope it will find this the occasion to support a non-coercive setting for Arab-Israeli negotiations, as well as to normalize its relations with the State of Israel.\nThere is nothing in our region's history or in its present that rules out a different future. In an era of peace and co-operation, the industrial dynamics of the Far Fast, the Economic Community of Europe, the free enterprise and the enterprise of freedom of the United States, and the Soviet capacity to introduce an air of glasnost can all apply to the Middle East. We can draw on the experience of others. We can add that which is unique to us and offer our young generation the dawn of prosperity in peace.\nIn order to prepare the ground for the launching of our region on the long road to peace, may we suggest that all relevant parties undertake the following: those interested in the promotion of peace and stability in the Middle East undertake a moratorium on all threats or acts of violence; those interested in promoting Arab-Israeli peace negotiations undertake to encourage and facilitate the early convening of such negotiations in a non-coercive setting, free of a renewed arms race and free of external pressure; and those committed to the cause of peace in the Middle East reaffirm their adherence to ,the only commonly accepted basis for such negotiations - Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) - the renunciation of violence and terror and recognition of the right of all peoples and States in the region to freedom, dignity, peace and security.  \nBefore I conclude I wish to refer again to yet another issue that is very close to our hearts. As we have pointed out so often in the past, in Yemen, in Syria, in Iran and elsewhere our brethren are today permitted neither the free pursuit of our common heritage nor free departure to Israel. We call upon the Governments of those countries to respect basic human rights. We also call upon the Governments to reject the shameful assertion that Zionism is racism, a statement that shows no understanding of Zionism and a dangerous misunderstanding of racism.\nForty years ago the founder of our State, David Ben-Gurion, against the background of the turmoil of war and revival, introduced our Declaration of Independence, which stated:\n\\\"We extend our hand in peace and neighbourliness to all the neighbouring States and their peoples, and invite them to co-operate with the independent Jewish nation for the common good of all.\\\"\nIsrael at 40, proud of its accomplishments at home, confident about its future, today reiterates that very call; we extend our hand in peace to all our neighbours, peoples and States, as we stand ready to alter the course of Middle East history. At the all-too-familiar crossroads of hope and despair we are convinced that the choice is ours to make.\nMost appropriately, this week our people celebrate the holiday of Succoth, the Feast of Tabernacles, as we pray together \\\"Spread over us the Tabernacle of Thy peace ...\\\"\n\\\"He who maketh peace in heavens, may He make peace for us ...\\\"\nWe need it; we can help to achieve it. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, may I first congratulate you on your well-deserved election, which indeed guarantees the effectiveness of the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and which is a great honour for Argentina, a country with which we are united by ties of friendship and solidarity. We are certain that your outstanding personal qualifications and keen understanding of Latin American and world problems will lead to success in the work of the Assembly in its quest for concrete solutions at all levels of international life, which is today more than ever before filled with challenges, hopes and new ideals.\nI am also very pleased to greet Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, under whose leadership the United Nations h \u00bfis indeed demonstrated its ability to deal with very important international problems with regard to the maintenance of peace and security. I take special pride in congratulating him on the recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to a courageous group of men devoted to peace who work within the structure of the Organization. Central America - which was similarly honoured last year when the Prize was awarded to a great Central American, a keen advocate of similar ideals, Mr. Oscar Arias Sanchez, President of the sister Republic of Costa Rica - wishes today to pay a well-deserved tribute to these dedicated guardians of peace.\nEl Salvador has done its part. When in 1984 Jos\u00e9 Napoleon Duarte, the first freely elected President of El Salvador in more than 50 years took office, my Government set for itself a very clear and precise goal\u00b7, to establish democracy in the country as the basis and the principle for the long journey towards peace, reconciliation and social justice. Almost five years later, in the final stages of a convulsive and difficult constitutional exercise of titanic dimensions, we can say with dignity, mission accomplished. This is because the dynamic democratic process the Government of El Salvador initiated is of great historical significance, since it brought about opportunities for action which had never before had been able to develop. This progress is part of our national task in all its aspects; it is a viable component of the strengthening of our free, pluralistic and participatory society - the society roost Salvadorians desire.\nThe hard work and will of a visionary statesman, Jos\u00e9 Napoleon Duarte, President of the Republic - whose mandate is to end on 1 June 1989 - must be emphasized. I wish to refer to him not only as a statesman but also as a man who is at this time undergoing great personal trial and tribulation.\nPresident Duarte took on the responsibility of leading El Salvador in full awareness of the problems and sacrifices this entailed at a crucial stage of our history characterized by political repression and social upheaval. This was a formidable challenge, but he has faced up to it without respite, deeply committed to his Christian convictions and principles. Since then he has devoted all his energies towards completing the mission he undertook, despite the most varied difficulties and cruel vicissitudes.\nThe philosophy and plan of action of this man of unflinching will is and will be in the future of EL Salvador the only practical way in which to develop a new country, a country whose image has largely been formed as one of a struggling people aware of its historical commitment to achieve its own ideals. Thus, President Duarte outlined the plan that will bring El Salvador out of its former stage of backwardness and alienation into an era of democratization, participation, pacification, humanization, economic revitalization and internationalization of dialogue, not of conflict.\nThose are the moving forces, the ideas and the strengths that will continue to prevail until the final consolidation of the political landscape in El Salvador. The praxis of this programme is a unique challenge, because the application of these principles requires overcoming the forces of the extreme right and the extreme left while keeping a precarious centrist balance - what the President has termed, \\\"treading the cutting edge of the blade or walking along the edge of a precipice\\\".\nThis is Duarte's contribution at this most difficult juncture for our country. This is the challenge> this is the philosophy we must promote in the midst of misunderstanding and external aggression. To democratise a society enmeshed in a crisis with so many components and variables is indeed a formidable task.\nBut matters are now in the hands of the Almighty, a President and his courage, a people and a Government which have closed ranks in order to ensure the application of those principles. A great deal remains to be done, but what has been done with regard to each and every one of these principles has in sum yielded an outstanding result\u00b7, democracy, freedom and participation in a true social and humanistic context. This is a concrete legacy, a legacy of hope which impels us to continue to work with the same strength as our President. No doubt, in retrospect we see misunderstanding and destruction; and when we look closer we see a narrow and difficult path but when we look ahead we see the light at the end of the tunnel.\nThis forum - whose main task is the search for international peace and security is the appropriate forum from which to draw attention to the situation in my country and in Central America in general. In both cases there is a need for broad understanding of the efforts to regain the path of democracy as a way of life and a system of government in which there is plurality of interests in an open society that tolerates differences and promotes fundamental freedoms and the values essential to human dignity.\nTherefore, this forum must, as it has always done, firmly reject anti-democratic theses based on violence and terrorism and reaffirm the principles of non-intervention and self-determination, co-operation and respect for the expression of the popular will in the establishment of a Government clearly separate from the army, the product of free elections with the participation of all political and ideological groups. We believe that only tolerance and the rule of law can contribute to lasting peace and security for all. In this context and within the framework of these principles, which are basic to this august institution, the United Nations, I must, in all fairness, repeat that the Government of EI Salvador has endorsed the option which allows and promotes political, economic and social democracy, respect for human tights, both of the individual and of society, and the broadest possible measure of freedom of expression and criticism for all political groups.\nMay I be permitted at this point to make a necessary and timely distinction with regard to the context in which the problem of Salvador Is taking place. There are two systems at the present time. One is the institutional system, established on the basis of the freely expressed will of our people and embodied in a legitimate government. The other system. Imposed from outside through Cuba and Nicaragua, has given rise to a conflict which has completely lost its legitimacy, as the candidate from Democratic Convergence for the presidency of the Republic, Dr. Guillermo Manuel Ungo, who is from the FDR, recently stated. The fact is that the conflict is obsolete, it is a belated interventionist strategy advocated by the International enemies of democracy.\nIn the same connection we must now distinguish between this problem and the treatment of the problem of human rights. In this context we see, first, an Institutional area in which human rights and respect for them are treated in a normal way. They are part of the day-to-day activities of the government at the social level. Here we must recognize that the democracy to which I have just referred - free elections, the return and resettlement of refugees, the fullest possible measure of freedom, the broadest and most generous amnesty - all represent undeniable progress on the part of the Government of El Salvador. \nIn the other context, that of the conflict that has been ongoing, the problems which arise with regard to human rights, while they can be controlled through government action, as indeed has been done in the vast majority of cases, we must consider that in order to eliminate them, we must first remove their cause, which is the conflict itself. Secondly, we must also consider that in this field the most serious problems are brought about by the blind terrorist groups of the FMLN/FDR.\t>\nWe therefore insist that terrorism and subversion are not an option for the Salvadorian people or for the international community. . This has been shown by the political events that took place in March of this year, events in which the Salvadorian people participated and which were witnessed by more than 200 international observers, who confirmed that a pluralist democracy had indeed been established in El Salvador. The people expressed its views freely on 20 March and elected its deputies to the National Legislative Assembly and the municipal councils. The results of the vote favoured the political opposition. That event no doubt constitutes the strongest rejection of violence and is confirmation that most Salvadorians believe in the vote as the only way to obtain public power.\nWith regard to dialogue and peace, our determination to seek peace has been evident in our government activity since 8 October 1984, when President Duarte, speaking before this General Assembly, took the initiative in instituting a dialogue for peace. It was thus that on 15 October 1984, four years ago, in the city of La Palma, the first meeting took place with representatives of the FMI/J/fDR groups.\nEver since then the path we have followed has gone through Ayagual\u00f3 Sesori and, finally, after many other dialogues, San Salvador in 1987, in the context of the Guatemala agreement, known under the name of Esquipulas II. Unfortunately, the strategy or tactical lack of understanding on the part of IMLN/POR has impeded the incorporation of these groups, in their entirety, into the democratic process. However, as the undeniable result of tills effort, we can now see that what was formerly a guerrilla band has now been reduced to a group of recalcitrant terrorists helplessly constrained by its very commitment, whose threatened violence even keeps its own comrades from joining in the institutional process.\nActually, the way towards the attainment of peace has been extremely difficult since we cannot compromise when it comes to the lofty values of freedom, democracy and the very institutional 1\u0433\u0430tion of the Republic. No doubt; the conflict has had implications in the economic and social spheres. Its consequences have been felt in that it has not been possible to offer the nation better living conditions. It is true that the people of El Salvador have suffered the loss of their property, which was systematically destroyed by the FMHL/FDR. This has resulted in suffering and poverty, and is a clear and obvious violation of the civil and social rights of the Salvadorian people.\nWe can say that in El Salvador there is a widespread feeling that action should be taken to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\u00b7, but in a form consistent with the circumstances, the right to self-defence is also allowed within the appropriate channels of a legal order to counteract terrorist action and the violence of the extremist groups.\nThe democratic process has established areas in which everyone can express himself and criticize as he wishes, without, however, exceeding the legal limits, since respect for these limits and for order are essential conditions of democratic life. \nThe Government of El Salvador wishes to express its firm resolve to continue to strengthen democracy in which all participate. In this context the leaders of the FDR, together with the PMLN began to return to the country in November1987, as the result of a general state of amnesty. Their incorporation into political activity is an established fact. They have enrolled in the national voters registry and they have announced that they will take part in the presidential elections of 1989 under the name of \\\"Convergencia Perroeratica - Democratic Convergence. Although the political arm of the FMUJ, still states that there is no democratic process, they fear fanatic reprisals from their own allies. The fact is, however, that their incorporation into the electoral process means that there is an obvious recognition on their part of our process toward democracy.\nThe agreement entitled \\\"Procedure for the Establishment of a Firm and Lasting Peace in Central America\\\", known as Esquipulas II, has not lost its meaning, because the spirit of peace contained therein lives on, and it was the Central Americans themselves, through their Presidents, gathered in Costa Rica on 16 January 1988, who confirmed the value and importance of that agreement, as well as their commitment to its implementation. Similarly, the General Assembly, in its resolution 42/1, expresses its firmest support for the agreement and requests the Secretary-General to afford the fullest support to the Central American Governments in their effort to achieve peace. \n\nThe quest for peace in Central America is a historic endeavour for El Salvador, and in this context, and within the framework of this session of the General Assembly, we have continued to pursue initiatives to follow up with meetings of foreign ministers first, and then meetings of presidents, which are to take place within the next few days. The agenda that we shall discuss will include items on amnesty, dialogue, democracy and freedom, refugees, human rights and a Central American Parliament. In this review all countries will be shown to have assets and liabilities in terms of economy, but, regrettably, it must be said that one of them, Nicaragua, despite its efforts, whether serious or not, will have a greater debit balance. The Sandinist Government, reverting to situations that existed prior to the Guatemala agreement, continues, unfortunately, to violate the most elementary freedoms and civil rights. It persecutes and imprisons politicians and activists, represses public manifestations and closes channels of expression. The Sandinist Government has not even made the required clear and definite public statement of a total break, with the armed subversion in El Salvador, which is a clear commitment under the Esquipulas II agreement.\nThe link between the Sandinist Government and the FMIN is not only at odds with prevailing circumstances in El Salvador, but also totally incompatible with the letter and the spirit of Esquipulas II. Furthermore, the system which the Sandinist Government is trying to consolidate has been shown to be inappropriate at a time when everyone is trying to arrive at formulas of freedom and understanding far removed from totalitarian, oppressive and expansionist systems. Very few are going against the tide of history. We urge the Sandinist Government to reconsider and to join at this time with the world and Central America and no longer to obstruct the co-operation that now may lead to more concrete freedoms in the region, co-operation which the Government and the people of Nicaragua need.\nEl Salvador has done its part. Esquipulas II has led to the successful implementation of important decisions in the country on, among other things, national reconciliation through the broadest measure of amnesty ever known in the country, the massive repatriation of Salvadorian refugees, and regional co-operation expressed in the Central American Parliament, which has been endorsed our Assembly with a view to eventual, but certain, regional integration, which will have to be based on democratic and pluralistic principles.\nThe tragedy of Central America must be ended through global and regional solutions leading to a strengthening of peace and the restoration of security, \u00a1recognition of democracy as the legitimate means of acquiring power, and rejection of all violence, totalitarianism and confrontation.\nThis entire regional process must be credible. Thus, SI Salvador is proposing the establishment of a verification and follow-up commission at the political level to supervise in the various countries of the area the existence and validity of a true pluralistic, participatory democracy that broadly respects all individual, social, political and economic right the holding of truly free elections; and strict observance of human rights. We are proposing a commission linked to the executive commission of Esquipulas II, which my at its discretion visit the territory of the five countries to observe and determine compliance with these democratic commitments, which form the basic framework for real peace.\nRegarding the organization and financing of this commission, it would be made up of five Central Americans designated by the executive commission of Esquipulas II, and would have the necessary assistance of the international community in securing the appropriate technical and financial backing. We Central Americans must accept the commission courageously as a challenge for our future, which will be all the stranger and more vigorous for being based on the concept of a true democratic structure.\nThis idea of the commission for democracy, far from being contrary to international law, had already been suggested in similar terms within the framework of the draft Contadora on Peace and Co-operation in Central America. Therefore it already had the support of the Latin American group and all nations that supported the draft. We certainly view with interest the suggestion by Honduras about establishing a security commission which was also considered in the Contadora context. We believe  however, that peace and security in Central America can be achieved only through the radical and essential functioning of regional democracy.\nEl Salvador has done its part. What we have been able to do as guided by the far-sightedness of President Duarte, we have done and gone beyond} what has been beyond our ability and capacity, such as dealing with the effects of irrational conflict imposed from the outside, we have not been able to do, because the solution to this problem, unfortunately, does not depend solely on us, it depends on extraneous factors which violate the sacred principles that govern international coexistence and in which El Salvador firmly believes. These are the principles of non-intervention, non-interference, self-determination, good faith, loyal compliance with international commitment, and the consistent recourse to peaceful means of settling disputes.\nEsquipulas II appeals to countries not to support insurgency or armed subversion in El Salvador or in Central America in general. Today, I reiterate that appeal most strongly from this forum of peace, so that our democracy, free from interference, may bear fruit.\nWe reiterate our call for development, peace and democracy. Co-operation must be directed especially to the less favoured countries. This entails the provision of financial, technical and human resources, because inequality and poverty are certainly hindrances to the permanent maintenance of international peace and stability. It is therefore urgently necessary that one of the most pressing problems in International economic relations between North and South - that is, the foreign debt - be tackled with justice and realism and without delay by creating mechanisms to establish the shared responsibilities of creditors and debtors and the link between this problem and international trade.\nWe appreciate the co-operation we have received in SI Salvador and in Central America and the welcome intention of various countries and international organizations to continue to co-operate. In this connection, I reiterate the appeal in Esquipulas II to the international community to continue with urgency and determination to assist the region in its straggle to eliminate the deep structural causes of the conflict and to bring about the desired comprehensive development: of its societies, while understanding that democracy and peace cannot be consolidated without a policy of sustained growth. This effort is all-inclusive, and in the task of achieving the ideals of stability there are no priorities. All actions geared to the attainment of these objectives must run simultaneously and in parallel, so that if we wish to have democracy and peace we must also have development, to overcome poverty and backwardness. A colleague of mine has said that support should not wait for peace, because such support is needed to open up the road to peace.\nIn 1987 the General Assembly adopted resolution 42/1, on the situation in Central America, and resolution 42/204, on special economic assistance to Central America. In this context the Secretary-General submitted to the Assembly a report (\u0410/4\u0423949) containing a plan, which was prepared with the participation of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Economic Commission for Latin America (EC\u0141A). El Salvador welcomes these expressions of support and urges the international community of donors to achieve to the plan, which is of immediate need for the region.\nAgainst that background, may I state, with regard to the tragedy of the Salvadorian refugees, that the Government has devoted important resources to their return to the country, in keeping with the principles of humanitarian international law and internal legal norms. More than 8,000 Salvadorians have returned to their country since October 1987 from camps on Honduran territory, which shows that there are indeed encouraging signs of development, peace and democracy in the country which have encouraged them to return.\nEl Salvador considers it necessary to convene the proposed international conference on Central American refugees and expresses its strong support for that\nIn this context we welcome the results of the San Salvador Declaration in which the Central American countries and Mexico, with the valuable co-operation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), within an apolitical and strictly humanitarian framework, decided that that international conference should be convened at the highest level and be held in the city of Guatemala in May 1989.\nEl Salvador wishes to thank the International community and the friendly countries which have shown special concern over this humanitarian question and have offered immediate help and co-operation. We commend the work done by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and we especially agree with tine terms of the letter recently addressed by the High Commissioner to President Duarte recognizing his exemplary attention to this delicate and sensitive problem, which has been addressed exceptionally and with dedication by the Government of EL Salvador, as the High Commissioner has stated.\nDemocracy, peace and development - that is the triptych of principles which will lead us to regional integration, that being the only politically valid, stable solution to the problems of the isthmus. Only a strong Central America, united in democracy and progress, will provide a sufficient guarantee of subregional stability in a world which is becoming increasingly free and pluralistic and which, fortunately, is overcoming the stages of confrontation through dialogue, understanding and the requirement of plans of action oriented towards gradual universal integration in which technology and science would serve as the binding and motivating element.\nThis year, in which El Salvador was elected by an overwhelming majority to be the seat of the eighteenth General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) as a gesture of continued support for the sacrifices of its people and Government to achieve democracy, we welcome the presentation to this session of the Secretary-General's report on the item entitled, \\\"Co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States\\\", which is evidence of world solidarity. Our common universal objectives make it imperative for us to work together and I repeat, we welcome this with great hopes.\nEl Salvador considers that peace and efforts to guarantee peace continue to be threatened in South Africa by the policy of racial discrimination practised by the South African Government. Vie also share in the wish for the adoption of a realistic solution for peace between Iraq and Iran. We continue to be concerned over the situation in Lebanon. We condemn the occupation of Kampuchea by foreign troops and we express the wish that there should be a progressive withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. We support the strategy of the Republic of Korea, in the framework of its initiative towards reconciliation, co-operation and national reconciliation through dialogue and its wish to become a fully-fledged Member of the United Nations\nEl Salvador has played its part. My government welcomes and views with hope the progress and the achievements of this Organization and the international community towards consolidating democracy, peace and co-operation throughout the world on the basis of transnational agreements. Six months before the ending of the constitutional Government of President Duarte, after four and a half years of severe tests and enormous work, our commitments have been strengthened to the point where there is an awareness among all of the vital sectors of the country - the armed forces, the private sector, social and cultural organizations and so on - that it is no longer possible to go back. that is our destiny and our conviction. Democracy has been won. We now await peace and we will achieve peace through democracy, in the certainty that the vast majority of the peoples and the Governments represented in this Assembly stand with us in this endeavour. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI wish to extend to you, Sir, the warm congratulations of the Gambian delegation on your election to the high office of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I am sure that with your diplomatic skills and ability, as exemplified by your illustrious career, you will guide the deliberations of this important session to a successful conclusion. In the discharge of your duties you can count on the full co-operation of my delegation.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express my delegation's profound thanks and gratitude to Mr. Peter Florin, Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, for the efficient and businesslike manner in which he conducted the deliberations of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.\nPermit me also to pay a special tribute to our indefatigable Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his laudable efforts in the promotion of international co-operation and his devotion to the search for peace among nations. The decision of the Nobel Committee to award the 1988 Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces deserves our praise and admiration. This well-deserved recognition is also a testimony to the dedication and courage of the thousands of men and women spread around the globe and fully committed to the aims and ideals of the Charter of the Organization. The United Nations family deserves to be congratulated.\nLast year at this time, when the forty-second session of the General Assembly convened, the world was still caught in a web of escalating tensions and regional conflicts. In some areas, these conflicts took on higher intensity and wider involvement, fuelled with even more destructive weapons. The cost, both in material and in human terms, became incalculable, and unprecedented since the last World War.\nFrom the heat of the Sahara to the lush greenery of southern Angola, from the Shatt al-Arab waterway to the rugged mountains of Afghanistan and into the plains of Indochina, the principle of the peaceful resolution of disputes became illusive. It seemed as if the world had forgotten the solemn declaration of the United Nations founding fathers that they were determined \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". Indeed, conflicts, disputes and a general state of instability continued to prevail. But, at last, there is today a glimmer of hope in the international atmosphere for the resolution of several Long-outs banding conflicts and disputes. In fact, recent developments in many troubled areas have opened up new possibilities for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for co-operative coexistence among nations.\nWho would have believed, only a year ago, that during this session we would all be basking in the genuine hope of a more stable world, because of the remarkable achievement of a super-Power agreement actually to destroy a whole class of nuclear weapons? Perhaps, by this act, mankind has finally taken that important first step away from the threat of a nuclear conflict. With the present spirit of co-operation, my delegation is confident that this is just the first step, and that the best is way to come. As the Chinese saying goes, \\\"A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.\\\"\nAt their last summit in Moscow earlier this year, President Reagan of the United States and President Gorbachev of the Soviet Union laid a solid foundation for a realistic approach to the question of peace, stability and the reduction of the risk of global conflicts. The whole world notes with satisfaction their determination to prevent the risk of war, whether nuclear or conventional.\nAs the result of a remarkable series of initiatives and of greater understanding, both super-Powers have contributed greatly to the transformation of the world political situation. The new climate of mutual respect, understanding and dialogue has opened the door to more meaningful advances in the efforts of all nations, especially the super-Powers, to strive for a world without nuclear weapons.\nMy delegation welcomes the fact that disarmament has been a major theme in world politics during the last 12 months. We remain hopeful that the United Nations will continue to play its rightful role in creating the atmosphere for meaningful dialogue and that all current negotiations on this important issue will be expeditiously and successfully concluded. It is also the hope of my delegation that greater attention will be given to increased security in a wider sense, namely, in the release of human and material resources for redeployment on social and economic programmes for the general welfare of all underprivileged peoples around the world.\nIn his statement to the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament, held in June this year, the President of the Gambia, His Excellency Alhaji Sir Dawda Kair aba Jawara, addressed this issue of the unfortunate competition in the allocation of available resources for armaments and development as follows: \\\"The allocation of massive resources for armaments is simply a major constraint on the development process, as armaments and development both tend to compete for the same limited resources. Given the general global economic and financial crises, reduced military spending could contribute significantly not only to an increased flow of development assistance to developing countries, but also to an improved climate for global economic growth. We should therefore work tirelessly to ensure that the progress made in disarmament results in increased attention to economic and social development matters and in particular to increased assistance to developing countries. Remote as the chances for this may seem at the moment, we should continue to strive for this important transition, and I would urge that the General Assembly give this important question particular attention at this special session.\\\" (A/S-15/PV.9, p. 12)\nThe current climate of peace, of renewed hope and optimism, is not only evident in the search for a more stable and sustainable relationship between the two super-Powers: it has, as we all know, reached the other areas of conflict around the world.\nIn Afghanistan, foreign troops that have occupied that country for eight years are now withdrawing. We hope that the signing of the Geneva agreements and the total withdrawal of foreign troops will create conditions that will enable the Afghan refugees to return to their country in safety and dignity. In this way, all Afghans can sit together and chart their own destiny without any external influence.\nAt this juncture, my delegation would like to pay tribute to the positive and responsible attitude adopted by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Despite the threat to its security, which emanated from the presence of foreign troops in neighbouring Afghanistan, the Islamic republic of Pakistan gallantly provided shelter and relief to over 3 million refugees in accordance with universally recognized humanitarian principles.\nWe have also been following with keen interest the developments in the Gulf region, mainly because of our genuine desire for peace. In fact, as we all know, the President of the Republic of the Gambia, in his capacity as Chairman of the Peace Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, has since 1984 been actively involved in the difficult task of trying to bring an end to the Gulf war and to create better understanding between the brotherly peoples of Iran and Iraq, fortunately, recent developments in the area have generated much optimism. This conflict has caused immense suffering to the populations of the two countries. It is our fervent hope that the cessation of hostilities and the current initiatives of the Secretary-General will lead to an honourable resolution of all the outstanding issues without further delay.\nIn South-East Asia, we welcome and applaud the initiatives of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which culminated in the recent Jakarta informal meeting, and its endeavour to find a solution to the Kampuchea n problem. We appeal to all sides concerned to explore all possible avenues for the restoration of the rights of the Kampuchean people, while at the same time ensuring the legitimate interests of all the countries in the region to live in peace with one another.\nOur support for the current search for & solution is based on the principle that no country should be permitted to define its security in a way that creates insecurity for others. The presence of foreign troops in Kampuchea and the repeated incursions into Thai territory have heightened tension and posed security problems in the region. It has also transformed a large section of the Kampuchean population into refugees and placed an intolerable burden upon neighbouring countries of first asylum, particularly Thailand.\nLike the rest of the international community, the Gambia is committed to the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. This would allow the Kampuchean people to determine their own future, with the full participation of all Kampuchean.\nIn the Korean peninsula, we continue to support genuine efforts for the peaceful reunification of North Korea and South Korea, in the best interest of both parties. In this regard, a meaningful dialogue is the key to a lasting solution and must therefore be vigorously pursued. Pending reunification, however, my delegation will support the admission of both North Korea and South Korea to the United Nations, based on the principle of universality.\nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, the international community must ensure that the already explosive situation in that area is not immune from the prevailing climate of peace, dialogue and understanding. Developments in the occupied territories over the last few months have proved beyond doubt that the time has come for the prevailing winds of peaceful change to blow in this area. While there is anxiety over the need for all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries, we should admit that it is equally important to emphasize that realization of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to have a homeland of their own is long overdue. \nWe, in the Gambia, will therefore continue to support the Palestinian people in their heroic struggle for an independent homeland. We consider the convening of an international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, a very important step in the search for a genuine and lasting settlement. But if such a conference is to succeed, it must guarantee the full and effective participation of the Palestinian people, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nOn the question of Cyprus, my delegation will continue to encourage the ongoing contacts and negotiations taking place under the good offices of the Secretary-General. We reiterate our hope that the two communities will continue to co-operate with the Secretary-General with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable political settlement of the problem. In this connection, an arrangement based on the equal rights of both communities could be an ideal solution.\nLet me now focus my attention on Africa. As members are aware, we in Africa have just celebrated the Silver Jubilee of our continental organization, the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The celebrations, however, took place at a most critical time in southern Africa. The celebrations also coincided with the tenth anniversary of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on Namibia, thus serving as a sombre and bleak reminder of the nature of the monstrous regime in Pretoria.\nToday, there exists world-wide revulsion against the racist regime in South Africa. However, this widespread international outcry is not due to the international community sudden realizations that apartheid is evil, violent and immoral. This growing international reaction is due to the sustained struggle being waged by progressive and democratic forces inside South Africa itself. It is the internal struggle that made South Africa the focus of attention. But in bringing this about, the people of South Africa and the front-line States have had to make great sacrifices. In spite of the past record, much has been made by the racist regime and its supporters of South Africa's intention to institute reforms in compliance with internationally recognized norms.\nIf there is any regime that qualifies to have Chapter VII of the Charter invoked, then surely it is this regime whose policies have been rightly and universally declared as a crime against humanity. We must therefore make greater efforts to support the struggle of the South African people by continuing to strive for the application of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions. The international community must find ways and means of adopting further measures designed to impress on the authorities in Pretoria the compelling urgency of dismantling apartheid and creating the structures of democracy in South Africa.\nMy delegation would also strongly urge the international community to provide the front-line States with such assistance as would guarantee their territorial integrity and independence. We should, however, make sure that such assistance is not simply regarded as an easy alternative to dealing with the root cause of the crises in southern Africa which, as we all know, is South Africa's ever-increasing internal repression and brutality in its futile attempts to perpetuate apartheid.\nAt the moment, there is steadily mounting optimism with regard to the peaceful settlement of the Namibian question. Naturally, we, in Africa, welcome the series of negotiations that have so far taken place. We hope they will eventually lead to the independence of Namibia, within the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nOn several occasions in the past, hopes have been raised that South Africa would bow to international public opinion and to morality by accepting the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Those hopes have been repeatedly thwarted by a defiant South Africa; hence the reason for our cautious optimism. We hope that this time, the international consensus on the illegality and inadmissibility of Pretoria's actions and its several military setbacks in southern Angola will ensure that South Africa stays at the negotiating table.\nWe all do recall that when the founding fathers of the United Nations drew up the Charter in 1945, they reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person. Besides the Charter, the United Nations has also made clear pronouncements on human rights in many fundamental texts, such as, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966.\nAs we commemorate this year the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let us remember that all these solemn declarations and covenants recognize that freedom from want and fear can be achieved only if conditions ate created whereby everyone enjoys his or her civil and political rights.\nThe issue of the protection and promotion of basic human rights cannot therefore be separated from the immediate problems of human survival. There is an indissoluble link between the two. Human rights is indivisible and universal, incorporating, as it were, social and economic rights, such as, the right to a decent diet, shelter and access to basic health care and educational facilities.\nIn view of the widening gap between the universally accepted practices of human rights and the stark realities in many parts of the world, we must make more intensive efforts to defend the rights and dignity of the individual. The Gambia does not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of any State. Our stance on human rights is motivated only by a special concern for the individual and his freedom and dignity. \nIt is gratifying to note that specific steps within each region to improve the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms are particularly promising.\nIn Africa, important decisions have been taken towards the institutionalisation of respect for and protection of human rights in the continent. As this Assembly may be aware, an Organization of African Unity (OAU) Commission on Human and peoples' Rights has now been established and the Gambia's offer to host the headquarters of the Commission has been unanimously accepted by the member States of the OAU. We believe that the confidence and trust which have been reposed in the Government and people of the Gambia are based on our firm and irrevocable commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights, a commitment which is derived from the principles enshrined in both our domestic laws and our foreign policy.\nBesides the decision to host the Secretariat of the OAU Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, we in the Gambia ace currently in the process of establishing a centre for democracy and human rights studies in order further to promote and consolidate our achievements in this area. I hasten to add that the proposed centre will be a non-governmental institution, open to all those who share the Gambia's commitment to democracy, the rule of law and the principles of freedom and the integrity of the individual.\nThose are some of the more pressing political issues confronting the international community. Throughout the world there seems to be renewed commitment and hope that these political problems, despite their seeming complexity, will all someday be resolved peacefully.\nBut if the political climate offers some hope for the future the same cannot be said for the international economic environment. My delegation notes, with a great deal of anxiety, that our current economic crises, which pose no less of a threat to international peace and security, are not being imaginatively and effectively tackled. Notwithstanding the special concern about long-term structural problems, the necessary political will to solve them is regrettably still lacking.\nAs a result of global recession, unfavourable terms of trade, persistent high interest rates in some developed countries and the increasing cost of debt servicing, most African countries, including the Gambia, have had to put in place a comprehensive package of reform measures in order to remove structural imbalances in our economy and establish a firm footing for recovery and development with growth.\nAlthough there has been marked progress in redressing some major macro-economic and sectoral distortions, much still remains to be done. The Government of the Gambia is fully aware of the hardships and difficulties brought about by these domestic policy reforms, but we continue to show full determination in implementing all measures required for a speedy economic recovery and for laying the foundation for sustained long-term economic growth and prosperity.\nHowever, it is clear that our efforts to help ourselves will fail without a new and substantial flow of financial resources on a concessionary basis. We hope that the international community will give significant support to our efforts, in conformity with the commitments made in the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, adopted in 1986. It will be recalled that this Programme of Action was recently revised and reviewed by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly. My delegation sincerely hopes that at this session the Assembly will decide on the measures for overcoming the shortcomings and constraints that have been identified. \nThe root cause of the current economic crisis of the developing countries has been the collapse in commodity prices. According to recent estimates, the cumulative loss for developing countries resulting from the decline in commodity prices relative to those of manufactured goods imported by them between 1980 and 1985 amounted to about $US 50 billion. Such large losses in a period of declining official development assistance emphasizes the need for increased multilateral co-operation generally.\nNor should we lose sight of the fact that developing countries' dependence on primary commodities has remained strong, ranging between 68 per cent and almost 100 per cent. Moreover, in some cases, such as that of the Gambia, one or two primary commodities account for 90 per cent of total exports. The share of primary commodities in gross development product for the developing countries is over 30 per cent, whereas for the developed market-economy countries it is less than 10 pat cent. Consequently, a decline in commodity export earnings has far-reaching implications for us, not only for current account balances but also for fiscal revenues.\nOne aspect of the African crisis, which could be directly linked to commodity prices and which places a premium upon the need for flexibility and a new approach towards its solution, is the problem of acute external indebtedness. Africa's economic development has been held back by debt more than by anything else.\nThis, need for an international conference to tackle this problem is becoming even more urgent, It must be fully recognized, however, that despite the debt-relief measures adopted so far by some developed creditor countries the African debt crisis can be solved only if our economies are given the necessary impetus to grow and all debts are converted to grants. In addition to the restructuring of our national economies, the present crisis in Africa has focused attention on the urgent need to take further action on operating and sustaining closer subregional and regional co-operation. It cannot be overemphasized that Africa's future lies in greater co-operation and self-reliance, with a view to ensuring a balanced development, within the framework of our drive towards the total economic emancipation of Africa in consonance with the spirit of the Lagos Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos. That is which the Government of the Gambia attaches the greatest importance to our subregional organization, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\nAmidst rapid economic changes and uncertainties, EOOWAS continues to find effective ways of improving the standard of living of millions of people in our region. In this regard the Gambian President will, in his capacity as the current Chairman of ECOWAS, strive to give new impetus to the implementation of various programmes of subregional organizations, including the EOOWAS Economic Recovery Programme. Still on EOOWAS matters, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament for Africa for organizing a training programme on conflict resolution, crisis prevention and management and confidence-building among ECOWAS States, in Lome, Togo, from 22 August to 2 September 1988.\nThe programme provided a forum for communication between senior military and civilian officials of ECOWAS States responsible for issues of peace and security in their countries, especially in the practical skills and expertise needed to prevent and manage conflicts. This approach was seen as helping to break down barriers of mistrust and thereby enhance confidence among EOOWAS States. \nBoth military and civilian perspectives are essential in order to have a complete view of the dynamics of problems being analysed and to establish concrete mechanisms in the future for the realization of lasting peace and security in Africa.\nAs a result of the success of this programme, the desire has been expressed to continue such programmes and to expand them to include other subregions of Africa.\nOn this important issue of peace and security in Africa it is encouraging to note that the initiatives taken by our leaders to settle the differences between Chad and Libya, Morocco and Algeria and Ethiopia and Somalia are beginning to bear fruit. We whole-heartedly support this approach to the peaceful settlement of disputes between the brother peoples of Africa, based on the spirit and principles of the charter of the Organization of African Unity.\nAt a time when all our energies are being concentrated on the twin problems of survival and growth, a new and dangerous phenomenon is beginning to cause widespread anxiety and alarm. I am, of course, referring to the totally unacceptable and irresponsible practice of dumping industrial and toxic waste in Africa. The Gambia is one of a number of countries that have been approached, but we have firmly rejected all requests for the disposal of industrial waste in our country. Given the gravity of this situation, we have also enacted very important and stringent laws to prevent the likelihood of any waste-dumping in the Gambia. And, as I have said on another occasion, despite our poverty no amount of money would lead us to agree to mortgage the future of our environment.\nOver the years the Gambia has paid special attention to the better management of our environment as we endeavour to improve the standard of living of our people. In fact, about a decade ago the Government of the Gambia issued a special declaration, known as the Banjul declaration, in which we \\\"pledged our untiring efforts to conserve for now and posterity as wide a spectrum as possible of our remaining fauna and flora.\\\" Furthermore, following the long period of drought and the relentless encroachment of the desert in cur subregion, we in west Africa must be spared from any further form of environmental degradation.\nMy delegation would therefore like to support the proposal first made by the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and now accepted as an Economic Community of West African States (ECDWAS) project, for the establishment of a \\\"dump watch\\\", in order that countries which may be subject to the dumping of industrial waste are alerted in good time to enable them to put in place all the precautionary measures necessary to safeguard their environment. The United Nations should set up a special committee that would look into the activities of industrial companies that are guilty of this crime. The countries that have been seductively subjected to the systematic pollution of their environment should also be compensated.\nThis is the background against which the forty-third session of the General Assembly is convening. Never have there been greater opportunities and possibilities than today for the establishment of a world free of the menace of nuclear conflagration and regional conflicts.\nI should like to conclude by reassuring members of the Gambia's deep commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as to international co-operation for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all people.\nLet us, therefore, through collective action, rededicate ourselves to the lofty ideals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations if we are to ensure the survival of mankind and preserve peace among nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to convey to you, Mr. President, and to the Heads of delegations participating in this forty-third session of the General Assembly, the greetings of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz, and his wishes that God grant you success to accomplish the expectations we all have of this Organization as the appropriate framework for co-operation among nations and peoples, an important forum for dialogue and understanding and an effective tool for the settlement of disputes and handling crises.\nThe Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques was keen to participate in this session, which coincides with an important juncture in the course of international relations and in the crucial role of the United Nations, and would have done so had it not been for the present circumstances which required continuous follow-up of the issues of peace and security in our region. I therefore have the honour to present the following statement on his behalf:\n\\\"Mr. President, I have the pleasure to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this session, which reflects the personal esteem you enjoy and is an expression of the important role your friendly country, Argentina, plays in the international arena. We are confident that your competence in conducting the affairs of the General Assembly will provide new possibilities for dealing with international problems, and we are certain that your objectivity and far-sightedness will be reflected in the work of this session.\n\\\"I wish also to express our thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, President at the forty-second session of the General Assembly, for the objectivity and wisdom with which he conducted the work of the last session, which has appropriately earned him the appreciation of all.\n\\\"I take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his continuous endeavours to enhance the opportunities for establishing peace and to lessen the sources of tension that prevail in various parts of the world. His personal qualities are without doubt of great influence in this regard.\n\\\"It gives ms pleasure, on the occasion of the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize for this year to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, to congratulate the United Nations, the Secretary-General and the members of these forces and to express our thanks to the countries participating in them. This appreciation reflects the increasing importance of the role of the United Nations in keeping the peace and maintaining it in different parts of the world.\n\\\"Our belief in the principles and objectives of the United Nations as an international forum where all the peoples and the Governments of the world gather is firm and has been reinforced over time, despite the complicated problems and entangled crises from which the world suffers. Therefore, we return every year to the Organisation to consider problems and crises and to co-operate in finding solutions to them in order to establish an international community that enjoys stability and progress and in which justice, security and peace prevail. We hope that our Organization can work for the consolidation of the basic objectives for which it was created and for which the Charter was established, objectives to which we are all committed for the establishment and preservation of world peace, namely, laying the foundations of equity in relations among States in the political, economic and social fields. \n\\\"The ability of the United Nations to continue to serve as a safety valve, trusted and respected as regards the preservation and affirmation of these goals, is dependent, to a large degree, upon its ability to find appropriate solutions for the problems that threaten international peace and security.\n\\\"At past sessions of the United Nations General Assembly we used to review the problems and enumerate the dangers and crises they posed. It seemed to us each time that the world was living under a cloud of ceaseless conflicts and wars with no peaceful end, and that the trend towards evil and its destructive effects would prevail. But today we are seeing a noticeable breakthrough in many problems and crises and we are saying the distinctive and important role the United Nations can play in this regard. On a number of different occasions in the past, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed the view that the role of this Organization should not be confined to identifying international conflicts and crises, but should also include the formulation of realistic concepts that would enable the international community to face up to the dangers confronting it, and consequently to work out solutions based on justice and objectivity. Today, as we are witnessing many breakthroughs in which the United Nations has played an effective role, we cannot but mention the great importance of the work this Organization can do in this respect. We stress that the continuation and consecration of this role cannot be realized and accomplished unless the Organization can find ways and means to institutionalise this role through the organs of the United Nations system and at the core of its political activities, and not simply confine itself to the improvements in circumstances that take place in super-Power relations periodically. While we appreciate the importance of the role played by the members of the Security Council in making it possible to achieve such positive developments, we wish to mention also the special responsibility that the permanent members bear in this regard, which should complement the responsibility of the united Nations, and not, in any event, be an obstacle to it.\n\\\"The breakthroughs on the international scene which we are witnessing enhances the scope of hope for the accomplishment of increased peace, security and stability for the benefit of all.\n\\\"Lately, relations between the two super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet union, have experienced a noticeable rapprochement, one outcome of which has been the realization of significant steps in the limitation of nuclear arms. However, there ought to be a positive and tangible relationship between the degree of the evolution of, relations between the two super-Powers and the role of the United Nations in this regard. Since the rapprochement in relations between these two Powers has a definitive bearing upon the opportunities and possibilities for the realization of other positive developments in the international arena, such a rapprochement should constitute a safety valve exercising its important influence whenever relations between the two super-Powers deteriorate so that a direct confrontation or a change in either of their positions can be avoided. On the occasion of their meeting in Washington last year, I addressed a message in this regard to the leaders of these two States in which we expressed our hope for the establishment of a new world order, supported by them, based on the principles of solidarity and co-operation between all nations and peoples, in order to provide security, stability and prosperity to the world.\nOn the other hand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considered the breakthrough witnessed in the Iran-Iraq war as a good beginning for putting an end to a painful tragedy that had lasted eight years. As soon as it learned of the decision of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to fix a definite date for a cease-fire, with the consent of the two neighbouring States of Iraq and Iran, it immediately expressed its deep satisfaction and its great hope that this agreement would be an effective beginning for the establishment of a permanent and comprehensive peace in which all the States and 'peoples of the region would enjoy security, stability and constructive co-operation.\n\\\"While welcoming the decision for a cease-fire and the initiation of direct negotiations, we express our hope that the negotiators will reach solutions that will help overcome the obstacles by dealing with the points contained in Security Council resolution 598 (1987), stressing the stability of the cease-fire and the strengthening of the foundations of peace. We also hope that the cessation of the fighting between the two parties is a true and sincere beginning towards the accomplishment of the greater aim, which is the achievement of the desired permanent peace on the basis of good-neighbourly and constructive fraternal co-operation. While we appreciate the readiness Iraq has shown from the beginning to accept Security Council resolution 598 (1987) after it was adopted, and its consequent readiness for an immediate cease-fire, which demonstrates to the world the credibility of the Iraqi Government in its quest for peace and its earnestness to achieve it, we hope that the acceptance by Iran of a cease-fire and its participation in direct negotiations indicates a systematic change in its policy in the region, so that it will return to being a source of civilization and a pillar of peace stability and security, which are the responsibilities of all States in the region, thus sharing in the message of goodness, brotherhood and friendship, which are the goals that constitute the essence and the core of the true message of Islam. \nWe hope to abide by all this. As the Almighty says:\n'Help another in righteousness and piety\nBut help ye not one another in sin and rancour.\n(The Holy Koran V; 3)\n\\\"He also welcomed the Soviet decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and to leave the destiny of the country in its own hands. He hope that this will take place according to plan, that all the obstacles in the way of the achievement of full political and economic stability in Afghanistan will disappear and that, after a glorious struggle of nine years during which it gave proof of its strong belief in God and of sacrifice in the defence of its religion and rights, a regime which reflects the wishes of its valiant Muslim people will be established.\n\\\"We express our hope for the co-operation of all the parties concerned in restoring stability and tranquillity to Afghanistan, because the emergence of a Government which represents the true Afghan will is the firmest guarantee that Afghanistan will be the source of peace and stability for all its neighbours capable of co-operation on a sound basis of mutual interest.\n\\\"The Geneva Accords have paved the way for the finding of a comprehensive solution to the situation in Afghanistan. They confer upon the United Nations a continued responsibility to work in this direction until final implementation of the Accords and until the establishment of the desired transitional Government that will permit the Afghan refugees to return to their country and give the Afghan people the freedom of self-determination.\n\\\"At the same time, we deplore the violations of Pakistan's air space by the Kabul regime and express once again our appreciation of the great humanitarian role which the Government and people of Pakistan continue to undertake in hosting 4 million Afghans, who can now look forward to returning to their homes after Pakistan has alleviated their burdens for all these years. In this critical period, Pakistan has lost its President, the late General Mohammad Zia-ul-Hao, who worked hard in the service of his country, in supporting the rights of the Afghans and in bolstering the causes of the Islamic world. With the passing of the President, the Islamic world lost one of its most zealous and sincere Muslim leaders, one of the most experienced and well versed in the affairs of the Islamic world, as evidenced by his stands in international arenas and at the Islamic summit conferences.\n\\\"We are, moreover, following with deep interest and appreciation the breakthrough taking place on the problem of Western Sahara, where the wisdom and farsightedness of the leaders of the region have enabled the United Nations to accomplish its constructive role in ending this problem. I had the pleasure of personally conveying my thanks to both His Majesty King Hassan II and his Excellency President Chedli bin Jedid for their co-operation and their successful efforts in settling the situation and narrowing the differences in the points of view concerning this problem, in the hope of reaching a final formula and of the coming together of the two States and peoples on the basis of trust, amity and common effort, for the welfare of the States of the Great Arab Maghreb.\n\\\"With regard to the problem of Cyprus, we have always expressed our support for the ongoing negotiations, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, to find a solution to this problem which would protect the basic interests of the Turkish Cypriot brothers. We are encouraged by the fact that some positive signs have emerged, which will, we hope, result in the desired just solution. One of those signs is the growing understanding which has emerged in Greek-Turkish relations and the meetings which have recently taken place in Cyprus between the representatives of the two communities,\n\\\"We are also observing with interest the efforts currently being undertaken to solve the problem of Namibia and to restore its rights. It is a problem that threatens stability and peace in Africa and causes great concern. We hope that the indications of the breakthrough taking place are genuine and will reach their natural conclusion. We also support every effort approved by the Organization in support of the people of South Africa and in deterring aggression against its neighbouring States. We stand with the African States in resisting the oppression inflicted upon the people of South Africa. We are with them in isolating the apartheid regime and condemning its evil alliance with the Zionist entity in Palestine. It is a regime based on the worst in the human soul of selfish traits, grudge and the abandonment of human values. Its oppressive and tyrannical measures against its black citizens and its aggression against the peace and security of neighbouring States should be halted,\n\\\"It is regrettable that, in this atmosphere of breakthrough on different problems confronting the world, the question of Palestine and the Middle East, the Question that was created in the arena of the United Nations itself, remains the most dangerous of problems, undermining the progress of this breakthrough, and the most dangerous of the threats to regional security and world peace. It is unfortunate that this problem has not come closer to hope of a solution one way or another.\n\\\"Peace is an indivisible whole. It is a right that should not be the preserve of one group or be applied to one cause at the expense of another. Peace does not stand and does not endure unless it is based upon justice. Peace is not the acceptance of the status QUO, nor is it a surrender to force and oppression, which do not create a right or establish peace. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has always believed that no real peace can prevail in the Middle East unless a just and permanent solution to the Palestinian problem, which is the core of the struggle taking place in the region, is found. Those who imagine that the passing of time is a guarantee that the status QUO will become an accepted fact seem to forget that the rights of peoples in their countries do not fade with the lapse of time and are never forfeited by forgetfulness. The Palestinians, after waiting for over 40 years without any glimmer of hope for a just peace, found only the stones of their land with which to express their rights and their rejection of the Israeli oppression.\n\\\"Israel thought that by its continuous oppressive actions it could separate the Palestinians from their roots while they were on their own land and erase their history from the memory of their new generations, as well as from the annals of history. Then the Intifadah came, a revolution against oppression, a reminder that right never dies, and a daily and unanimous action for their just demands. Through its determination and sacrifices the uprising has been able to create a new reality, proclaiming its identity and vitality on both the local and the international level, with over nine months having passed since its beginning, it is clear that the Israeli violence has only reinforced its determination and that the logical result of the impossibility of things remaining as they are is the need for a movement towards a change.\n- the Intifadah has put an end to the false belief in the permanence of the status quo and killed the illusion that Israel worked to create in regard to the question of Palestinian representation, it has at the same time paved the way for concerted action aimed at attaining a just and permanent solution to the Palestinian problem. The blood of the martyrs and the sufferings of the victims are too dear to be squandered or uselessly lost; therefore there should be a conscious movement for the uprising of the Palestinian people to realize its desired objectives. The Palestinians have given all they can for peace and nothing demonstrates this better than the speech delivered recently by Mr. Yassir Arafat, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in Strasbourg.\n\\\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has frequently expressed its full support and continued backing for whatever the Palestine Liberation Organization, as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, considers for the realization of its legitimate rights and the establishment of an independent State on its land and the right to self-determination. The Kingdom will continue its efforts in this direction according to what the Palestine Liberation Organization will decide and consider to be a realization of those goals.\n\\\"As Chairman of the Arab Gulf Co-operation Council during its current session I sent messages to the leaders of the States permanent members of the Security Council to draw it to their attention that these developments do require of all parties a more realistic re-evaluation of the situation and a better perception of the dimensions of what is taking place in the occupied Arab territories, so that an end may be put to this tragedy in all its dimensions and all it entails in dangers, concerns and threats to security, peace and stability. A result will not be found except through a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestinian problem through the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East as the ideal means for realizing such a solution. It is worthy of mention that the two Arab Summit Conferences which took place in Amman and Algiers adopted a clear position towards supporting the convening of an international conference without pre-conditions.\n\\\"If the question of Palestine is our primary concern, the problem of Holy Jerusalem constitutes, in our view, the core of the Palestinian problem. In this regard the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia renews its support for the necessity to preserve the Islamic and Arab character of Jerusalem and to restore the Holy City to Arab sovereignty, so that it will return to being, as it always used to be, the gathering place for the faithful of all the divine religions and a sanctuary for forgiveness and creative coexistence between the different religions.\n\\\"As for Lebanon, we hope that God will guide its people to be able to provide a suitable climate for free and fair elections, emanating from the will of the Lebanese people and based on the present constitutional formula, so that a president may be elected who will endeavour to unify and to preserve the independence of the Lebanese territory and people and so that the shadow of the division which threatens Lebanon will fade away, denying continuous Israeli attempts to exploit these circumstances and to persist in perpetrating its aggression and occupying Lebanese territory.\n\\\"While in international relations we are witnessing the beginning of different regional breakthroughs, we notice the continued deterioration of the economic situations of the developing countries, in spite of some positive signs witnessed recently in international economic relations. The Industrialized States have been able to realize a greater amount of co-ordination between their economic policies, a fact which has allowed a relative stability in the exchange rate of the major currencies as well as the achievement of healthy rates in economic growth, while the economic circumstances in many developing countries have continued to deteriorate as a result of a continuous decrease in the prices of their primary commodities and an increase in the price of their imports of manufactured goods, as well as an increase in their debt burdens in a way which seriously threatens the course of their development. \\\"It was hoped, at the commencement of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations, that the terms of international trade would be corrected, that the protectionist tendencies would be reversed and that the trend towards freeing world trade in a meaningful way would be reaffirmed. But so far no tangible action on the part of the industrialized States has been forthcoming to eliminate the barriers which they have established on their imports from developing States. It is clear that some industrialized States are seeking to deprive the developing countries of many of the trade preferences required by their development circumstances.\n\\\"It was hoped also that the initiatives aimed at easing the international debt burden of many of the poor developing countries would take a positive direction at the meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank currently taking place in Berlin. But in this regard, there have not so far been any tangible results on the part of the industrialized countries, and this leads to a loss of hope among the developing countries participating in the Berlin meeting.\n\\\"While we welcome the progress achieved by the industrialized States in co-ordinating their economic policies, we express our apprehension at the continued deterioration of the economic situation in developing countries, many of which are facing heavy indebtedness on the one hand and a weak economic-growth rate on the other. That is a result of the failure to achieve practical measures to reduce the debt burden as well as of the continued custom and administrative barriers imposed on their exports to the industrialized States - which makes it very difficult to attain a reasonable level of growth in the developing countries. Therefore, while we emphasize the importance of expediting debt-relief measures for the developing countries, we also stress the importance of eliminating custom and administrative barriers and of giving developing countries the opportunity of promoting their exports to the industrialized States. We believe that that is the exemplary way to help the developing countries to correct their economic development, and at the same time would benefit the industrialized countries themselves, because this means a real contribution to the expansion of world trade.\n\\\"The deterioration in the situations of many of the developing countries has increased as a result of a number of natural disasters which have taken the lives of thousands of persons and left millions of the homeless in many regions of the world - and the majority of them were women, children and the elderly. We expressed our deep sorrow at the devastation suffered by Sudan and Bangladesh as a result of the destructive floods. We declared our full solidarity with the two fraternal peoples, and we have put at their disposal all that we can offer in emergency humanitarian assistance. The citizens of \u0142 the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia immediately made - and have continued to make generous contributions to the relief committees in the different parts of the Kingdom, which have enabled them to carry out their humanitarian duties towards the two fraternal peoples. \n\\\"Even a cursory glance at the extent of the suffering endured by many developing countries as a result of natural disasters clearly shows the important need for solidarity with them and for helping them to overcome their predicament. At the same time, it demonstrates that the ability to face such catastrophes is linked to the economic strength of these States; and yet we realize that roost of the States susceptible to such catastrophes are the weakest economically and the poorest. That truth leads us to an increased awareness of the problems of development and not to neglect of its humanitarian dimension. It also requires us to acknowledge that our solidarity with the afflicted States cannot be confined to alleviating the suffering of the affected peoples, but, rather, should continue so that these States may overcome their predicament and stand on their feet, so that they may prevail on their path to development.\n\\\"The breakthrough witnessed in international relations clearly demonstrates the importance of the role of the United Nations in the development of international relations. We are confident that the success achieved by the Organization through that breakthrough entitles it, at the same time, to expect our trust as it deals with the problems of development in a comprehensive and integrated manner, without neglecting the humanitarian side of international economic co-operation.\n\\\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whose principles derive from its compassionate Islamic Shariah and its Hanif faith, which call for peace, justice, equality and brotherhood, has forged for itself the path of peace that originates from these precepts and sublime values and from its belief in the principles and purposes for which the United Nations was created. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is continuing to play its role and to shoulder its responsibilities in every endeavour to achieve a just peace and to take a charitable course. It will continue to work side by side with all the peace-loving States to eliminate the shadows of war and develop friendly relations and fruitful co-operation between peoples, as well as to establish an international society where justice and peace prevail. \n\\\"From that standpoint, the decision of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as a contribution on its part to the consolidation of this peaceful objective, reflects its intention to work within the framework of the efforts being undertaken by the United Nations in this regard. While the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia urges other States to sign the Treaty, it hopes that this action will not be merely voluntary but a basic requirement of international dealings. It also wishes to stress in this regard that the possession of nuclear weapons by States which do not respect the rules of international behaviour and international agreements and refuse to sign and adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, such as Israel, constitutes in fact a dangerous threat to international peace and security, especially in light of the development of the Israeli nuclear and military capabilities in a manner that is considered to be a source of direct threat to the peace and security of the region. \n\\\"Terrorism is one of the problems posing the greatest danger to the safety, peace and stability of societies. The-spread of this phenomenon throughout the international community has led to the disturbance of international relations and to increased anxiety, tension and trouble. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has contributed, with all the means at its disposal, to efforts aimed at combating it and preventing its destructive effects. In this regard the decree issued by the Council of the High Ulema of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia imposing the death penalty upon terrorists, saboteurs and subversives - a decree supported by the Ulema itself and by jurists. Imams and Great Muftis in the Islamic world - is a sign of the Kingdom's determination and underscores our well-known firm stand against a phenomenon that has begun to spread through the world and to pose a threat to the foundations of a stable society.\n\\\"The position of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with respect to the phenomenon of terrorism accords with the positions adopted in this regard by the summits of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of Arab States. Moreover, while joining in the call for an international conference under United Nations auspices to define terrorism, we stress the need to draw a distinction between terrorism which aims to destroy society by striking at its roots, and the right of peoples to defend their existence and struggle for freedom and sovereignty when they have been subjected to occupation, domination, oppression and persecution in disregard of all international principles and norms.\n\\\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is presiding over the current session of the Arab Gulf Co-operation Council; we are proud to belong to that Council, which was established in conformity with the charters and resolutions of the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference as well as in accordance with the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Charter of the United Nations. The Council has played an effective and constructive role in promoting political, economic, security, social and cultural co-operation among its member States. While the Gulf Co-operation Council expresses the free will of those States and reflects co-operation among them in the context of a common perception of their national interests, it is not in fact a bloc against anyone, but rather a positive factor for stability in the region.\n\\\"At the beginning of my statement I referred to the great potential of the United Nations in the context of the breakthroughs we have witnessed in many current international problems, breakthroughs in which the Secretary-General personally has had a significant role in bringing about. The success of the United Nations in achieving further breakthroughs in the international arena will unquestionably be linked to its capacity to consolidate and structure this trend and make it an integral part of the political work of the Organization.\n\\\"If in the early part of my statement I concentrated on the subject of conflicts and what has been accomplished by way of breakthroughs in the international arena it is because the main concern in our region is the achievement of peace and because we are aware, as others ought to be, that instability anywhere is a threat to security everywhere.\n\\\"The time has come for all of us to bring our thinking into line with contemporary reality and to recognize that all our efforts for the betterment of the life of mankind will be in vain if just and lasting peace remains beyond our grasp. \n\\\"The interests of States have become common and intertwined to such a degree that there are no longer any limited conflicts whose effects can be confined to the parties directly involved. We are all partners in the ebb and flow, in good and evil, in war and peace, in prosperity and adversity and in development and underdevelopment. Let us all work together for peace.\n\\\"May peace and the blessings of God be bestowed upon you.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nAt the outset I should like to convey to you. Sir, my most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly, which is a tribute to Argentina, whose commitment to peace and international co-operation is known to all of us here. It is a country to which Finland is bound by ties of warm friendship. We know your experience and your abilities, and we are certain that with your leadership this session will be a truly fruitful one.  At the same time I want to express our sincere appreciation to the President of the forty-second session, Mr. Florin, for the excellent manner in which he discharged his responsibilities.\nI should also like once again to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, with whom we enjoy relations of deep trust and esteem, and to reiterate to him the Finnish Government's appreciation for his effort to promote the principles of the United Nations Charter and to strengthen the role and machinery of the Organization. The United Nations has often been criticized for its inability to perform the tasks entrusted to it in the Charter for the preservation of peace and security. The role of the Organization has been questioned. This criticism has not been totally unfounded. The opportunities offered by the Organization have not always been taken. The United Nations has too often been utilized as a forum for aggravating differences.\nYet the dramatic developments of the past weeks and months have demonstrated that the United Nations is still able to serve as a forum for resolute action in the interests of security and peace. The authority of the Organization has been enhanced by the recent achievements in various parts of the world. Those achievements demonstrate that the United Nations is an invaluable tool of peace-making and co-operation. This development is particularly welcome to Finland. My country has throughout maintained its firm belief in multilateral co-operation and support for the world Organization.\nIndeed, there is hope that confrontation is gradually giving way to co-operation. This development has been most striking in East-West relations. The dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States has widened and deepened significantly. Fresh approaches can be discerned in big-Power relations. These approaches have led to tangible progress in reducing the risk of war and military confrontation in Europe. Serious international problems cannot be solved without patient work and willingness to negotiate in good faith. Our Organization is the one best suited to offer a forum for a meeting of minds and a mechanism for resolving conflicts. Recent positive developments bear witness to the fact that the many years of efforts in the United Nations and elsewhere to work our solutions to these conflicts have not been wasted. In some instances results have been achieved which a year ago seemed nearly out of reach. \nThe United Nations must now decisively seize the opportunities offered by the existing favourable international atmosphere. Struggling with \u03b1 serious financial crisis, and after years of soul-searching, the United Nations must re-emerge as an important factor in inter-State relations. The late President Kekkonen of Finland once said in this Assembly; \\\"Rather than as judges, we see ourselves here as physicians\\\". (\u0391/?\u03bd.1040, p. 489, para. 10). The policies of Finland in the United Nations still accord with that vision. In fact, we believe that the whole Organization very largely follows the same precept, and should continue to do so. Acute problems may require skilful management and treatment. A strong world Organization is needed in order to make this possible. \nThe new situation warrants a reassessment of international approaches to conflict resolution. In order to function effectively, our Organization needs a wider communality of views. Decisions on important issues should be made by consensus. A basis for such communality already exists. It is the Charter of the United Nations and strict respect for all its provisions by all nations, whether big or small, aligned, neutral or non-aligned.\nToday, in the light of recent experiences, nobody should deny that international problems can be treated and solved in negotiations between the parties concerned. Nobody should deny that the United Nations can also be helpful in making such negotiations possible. Nobody must forget that the United Nations, in the Charter, has set universally accepted principles for all States, and in fact has enjoined States to settle their disputes if possible through negotiations. Dialogue and negotiations constitute the very essence of an orderly conduct of international affairs.\nThe results achieved this year are encouraging. For example, I pay tribute to the successful efforts made with great patience in dealing with the situation in Afghanistan. The services rendered by the United Nations in this matter have been crucial. Many uncertainties remain regarding the future of Afghanistan, hut the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the return of the refugees, together with a broad programme of humanitarian assistance, should make it possible for the people of Afghanistan to resume building its own future in peace.\nThe cease-fire worked out between Iran and Iraq is a major achievement, both by the parties and the United Nations. After years of bloodshed a cessation of hostilities was negotiated on the basis of a resolution adopted by the Security Council, This achievement would not have been possible without the universally appreciated peace-making efforts of the Secretary-General. In the negotiations on a final settlement of the conflict every effort should be made to work our solutions acceptable to all.\nWe have followed with keen interest the negotiations concerning the problems in south-western Africa and the process of independence for Namibia. Not only the peoples concerned, but the whole world community, are anxious to see further concrete results emanate from these negotiations. The progress made so far is promising, and it is to be hoped that the ongoing negotiations will, without delay, lead to independence for Namibia and to a durable solution in the area. Meanwhile, the world community is also entitled to react appropriately to the intolerable situation that continues to prevail in both Namibia and South Africa.\nIn South Africa the apartheid system remains fundamentally unchanged. Finland unequivocally condemns the apartheid system as an abhorrent violation of human rights and human dignity. The need for concerted international pressure on South Africa to change its policies remains. There can be no compromise on the principle of the equality of every human being or on the need to have that principle observed in practice. As a response to the inhumane racial policies of South Africa, Finland, together with the other Nordic countries, is now implementing the third common Nordic Programme of Action against Apartheid. Full economic and other sanctions are already in operation. We are now concentrating on additional measures, trying in particular to work for wider sanctions, including mandatory sanctions to be instituted by the Security Council and for increased international assistance to the front-line States of southern Africa.\nThe continuing stalemate in the long-standing conflict of the Middle East is in striking contrast with events in other parts of the world. No immediate solution is in sight. Violent developments in the occupied territories underscore the need for a speedy solution to the conflict. The basis for a solution is there. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well as the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, must form the basis for a final solution. Likewise, progress is not possible without recognition by Israel and the Palestinians of each other's rights. An international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations constitutes the best way to achieve a negotiated settlement. The convening of such a conference, which is almost universally desired, is long overdue.\nIt is not difficult to find other examples of problems in respect of which patient work carried our within the framework of the United Nations deserves to be rewarded with success. Where spectacular success has not yet been possible the role of the United Nations has often remained one of helping to keep the precarious peace or of continuing to encourage and facilitate a political dialogue.\nMy country is always willing to support such work. By providing personnel for the United Nations good-offices mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan and for the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, Finland tries to do its part in helping to implement the agreements reached this year under United Nations auspices. Finnish soldiers are now serving the United Nations in all the ongoing peace-keeping operations. We are ready for the next one, the one we had expected would have begun many years ago, namely to help in Namibia's quick transition to independence.\t.\nMy observations do not mean that Finland is in every respect satisfied with the experience gained heretofore in United Nations peace-keeping efforts. The use of military personnel contributed on a voluntary basis by various countries for peace-keeping in the service of the United Nations is intended primarily as a temporary measure. Its purpose is to create better conditions for the political task of peace-making. Yet we have seen that too often the United Nations troops have become the guardians of a status quo in which no meaningful political progress is taking place.\nA better common understanding of the basic goals and principles of peace-keeping is needed. The United Nations peace-keeping activities should be put on a secure financial and political basis. A comprehensive review of peace-keeping is now called for. In that process the need for sufficient financial reserves for peace-making and peace-keeping should also be dealt with. This is more urgent than ever now when the lack of financial predictability threatens the very launching of peace-keeping operations. For Finland, as a major contributing country, this is of special significance.\nFinland welcomes the progress made in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States that has led to agreement on the elimination of their land-based intermediate-range and shorter-\u00b7range nuclear missiles. We look forward to concrete results in the continuing negotiations with regard to the reduction of long-range strategic nuclear weapons. We would also hope that the Conference on \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which is now meeting at Vienna, would soon agree on a continued and enlarged process of confidence-building and disarmament in Europe.\nDisarmament has become one of the principal concerns of the Organization. Finland took the third special session devoted to disarmament very seriously. We made a number of proposals and worked hard for them and for a successful outcome of the session itself. We regret that it was not possible to reach consensus on a comprehensive concluding document. However, a number of important initiatives were introduced at the session, and the collective efforts of Member States with regard to disarmament must continue.\nIn order to promote disarmament. Member States should be willing and able to use the agencies and organizations in the United Nations family more effectively. The multilateral approach is necessary if we want to have an effective ban on chemical weapons, if we want to monitor nuclear testing everywhere, and if we want to make more progress in the urgent task of limiting conventional weapons. In our opinion the United Nations could also usefully assume an increasing role in the field of verification of compliance with disarmament and arms-control agreements that have been concluded.\nVerification is tantamount to the collection of information and the comparison of that information with certain pre-established rules and standards. Such tasks are already successfully handled by certain agencies in the United Nations system. In the security field relevant experiences have been gathered, for example by observers on peace-keeping missions. The systematic collection of data related to the verification of agreements in the disarmament field could be a logical step in expanding the useful functions of the Secretariat. \nI have now spoken mainly of the political tasks of the Organization, of the management and settlement of disputes. The magnitude of the work performed by the United Nations appears even more striking when the activities pertaining to economic and social issues and human rights are also taken into account. My country will continue to do its share in those United Nations activities as well.\nCombating the ever-increasing degradation of the environment will be one of the greatest challenges to mankind during the coming decades. The state of the environment will not be improved unless the detrimental consequences of human activities are not systematically taken into account. That is one of the central ideas of the concept of sustainable development discussed in depth during the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is necessary that the work already started towards sustainable development within the United Nations system by intensified. Finland's strong belief in multilateralism has been repeatedly stated. Only global multilateral efforts can help us to bridge the dangerously wide, and widening, gap between rich and poor. Environmental and developmental concerns make us focus on the interrelated problems where multilateral co-operation, and especially the United Nations, has a decisive role to play. We need a strong and effective United Nations system, with all its components, if we are to succeed.\nWe expect that the process of reforming the economic and social structures of the United Nations will be continued so that concrete results are achieved. That is an essential element in the process of restructuring the United Nations as a whole in order to improve its ability to meet present and future challenges.\nThe future of world economic development is closely related to the creation of -a better environment for world trade. We are convinced that the negotiations in the context of the Uruguay Round and the work carried on by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UMCTAD) will enhance possibilities for a better external environment in the field of trade, which will be beneficial to both developing and developed countries and to their peoples. A positive development is the entry into force of the Common Fund for Commodities, which will give a new impetus to the important worn of UNCTAD in this area.\nAs the 1990s approach, the international community should consider comprehensive measures which take into account the changing circumstances in the international economic environment. The debt crisis affects us all. Renewed emphasis on such development objectives as poverty reduction, population policies and environmentally sustainable development is called for. At the same time, an assessment of the relationship between domestic policies and international support measures is required. Consideration at this session of the preparation and elaboration of an international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade offers an opportunity to that end. It is a challenge to the whole international community which Finland, for its part, is ready to take up.\nOver the past years Finland has been one of the few industrialized countries that have rapidly and substantially increased the volume of their aid. The budget proposal for 1989 now before our Parliament contains appropriations for official development assistance representing 0.7 per cent of our gross national product. Thus, Finland will reach the target set by the United Nations.\nThe United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990 was reviewed just before the beginning of this session. Finland has actively supported the United Nations Programme and has continued to stress the importance of the development of African agriculture, measures against drought and desertification, human resources development and policy reforms. The necessary domestic structural adjustment measures in Africa can be sustainable when complemented by external assistance in a spirit of partnership.\nSome two thirds of Finnish bilateral assistance is directed towards African countries. Compared with the 1986 figures, Finland's assistance to the programme of multilateral financing institutions benefiting Africa has more than tripled this year. In the future too, sub-Saharan countries will remain major recipients of Finnish development assistance. Continued stress will be placed on co-operation with the countries of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference.\nThe costs of the United Nations are not high. I will not repeat the various comparisons that have been made with the costs of other human activities. Nor will I attempt to calculate the usefulness of the United Nations in quantitative terms. Finland demands efficiency in the administrative and financial functioning of the Organization. We pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his implementation of administrative reforms. We realize that the cutting of costs may sometimes lead to improved overall performance. However, regardless of the level established in any given year for the United Nations budget, there are certain principles regarding the financing of our joint undertaking that in our view must always be respected by all.\nThe United Nations Charter is a treaty between sovereign States, which have agreed to abide by certain obligations. Among these are rules that specify how decisions are taken and how costs are shared. The United Nations may sometimes have implemented programmes that Finland has not supported, but we have never doubted that it is our legal obligation to contribute our share to cover the costs of all legally established programmes. In our view, assessed contributions should be paid in full and on time. The unilateral withholding of contributions undermines multilateral co-operation.\nDespite some positive signs in the financing of the Organization, the United Nations continues to operate with inadequate income. The Secretary-General has appealed to Member States in order to secure the financing of United Nations activities. He is, in particular, referring to the new challenges that the Organization is facing in peace-making and peace-keeping. If additional expenses have to be met, Finland, for its part, will be prepared to participate in joint action to help.\nIt is clear to my Government that by its work the United Nations continues to demonstrate its usefulness every day. We need the world Organization. It is only logical that my country, for its part, wants to be useful to the Organization and thereby help to serve the needs of Member States. The Finnish Government continues to pledge its allegiance to the Charter and to joint efforts to promote the vital objectives of our Organization. That we can best do by pursuing our long-standing policy of neutrality and by a consistent search for reconciliation, dialogue and negotiation. That, then, is the Finnish credo in this forum.\nThe General Assembly is embarking on its work on a positive note. Let it demonstrate that the world community is united in the search for peaceful co-operation and dialogue. Let it become testimony that Member States want to see the United Nations effective and strong, and to assume responsibility for it.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, the delegation of Peru welcomes your election to preside over the present session of the General Assembly where countries of the north and south, the east and west will set forth their vision of a world still beset by war, conflict, injustice, inequality and the disgraceful racial discrimination of apartheid.\nWe feel that we have a share in the responsibility assumed by our region in your person. We are confident that your presidency is inspired by the ideals of freedom, independence, development and peace that bind together the kindred peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean.\nI am addressing the General Assembly in my capacity as Minister of Foreign Relations of Peru. I represent a country of ancient civilizations and cultures, a country which today on the eve of the twenty-first century has more than 20 million inhabitants, 40 per cent of its population being under 15 years of age, and a country stubbornly striving to uphold its independence and attain its development.\nFor us, being Peruvian means being a Latin American and that constitutes an inescapable commitment to affirm our standing as citizens of a continental homeland, or, as our liberator Simon Bolivar said, a nation of republics. Because of the Latin American commitment to the Peruvian people and because of the alarming features of the economic and social crisis that affects our region, it is imperative for me to focus my statement on the challenges posed for Latin Americans by the problems of the present and the promise and challenges of the future. As the representative of a nation struggling against inflation, the foremost enemy of our people, through a severe economic programme of austerity with social implications, the situation of my country is not unrelated to the drama being experienced by the continental people of Latin America where economic and financial difficulties are aggravating our social problems and demanding a united, innovative and coherent answer.\nWe Latin Americans have an historical awareness that only by being united can we advance towards resolving our economic and social problems. By being divided we will only manage to perpetuate and deepen those problems and we should be allowing a dangerous expansion of the distance separating us from the industrialized world, at a time when other geographical areas in the process of development are stepping up their rate of progress. \nLatin America is in a state of crisis. We must say so plainly and we must point out to the international community soma indicators which, like an X-ray, clearly indicate its magnitude. One indicator is the volume and structure of an irrational external debt that burdens us with payments that are impossible to meet, drastically limiting the mobilization of resources to take care of the most pressing social needs and hindering the flow of external investments and resources required for development.  \nWe Latin Americans owe $420 billion, representing 45 per cent of the region's gross regional product and whose servicing absorbs nearly 40 per cent of our total export earnings. In 1982, at the beginning of the crisis, the regional debt amounted to 2.7 times the total exports; that ratio has now increased to 3.5 times and the trend for future years is upward. Moreover, from 1982 to 1987, owing to debt payments Latin America transferred 3190 billion to the developed world, while receiving 340 billion in new inputs - a shortfall of 3150 billion. \nThat is most alarming, for the region is dramatically losing its financial resources and our countries are being transformed from capital recipients to net capital exporters to the developed world, thus depriving us of vital resources for social and development programmes whose non-implementation exacerbates the poverty of our peoples and endangers their very survival.\nIn addition, our share in world trade has declined to 4 per cent and the terms of trade have deteriorated by 14.5 per cent. Had this deterioration not occurred, Latin America would have had additional income in the order of 370 billion over the last eight years.\nAn equally serious aspect of the situation is the investment and financing attracted by the region during the same period. Domestic savings geared to investment in the region diminished from 24 per cent to 15 per cent of the gross domestic product, largely because that money went to paying the external debt; at the same time, external investment also declined, from 12 per cent at the beginning of the decade to 4.6 per cent in 1986. \nFormerly, in the context of the developing world, Latin America received 70 per cent of world investment; today that figure has been reduced to 17.5 per cent, largely because the impossibility of paying the debt on the terms imposed on us has discouraged capital investment in the region.\nThose are the realities of the crisis besetting us, as is the fact that our imports and exports have declined to historically unprecedented levels, pointing to an alarmingly regressive situation in circumstances where the Latin American population is constantly growing and thus creating corresponding economic and social needs.\nWhat can we do, given this harsh reality? What can we do to ensure that Latin America can emerge from a crisis that threatens to become chronic?\nIn the first place, it is imperative that we become aware of the magnitude of the tragic situation and that we Latin Americans assume a commitment to unite not just in a rhetorical repetition or reiterated announcement of the problems but in concerted efforts in laying our joint strategies enabling us to renegotiate the external debt on acceptable and realistic terms, and leading our creditors to understand that the debt cannot be retired on the terms originally contracted. Secondly, we believe that the time has come for Latin American States definitively to integrate.\nLatin American integration can no longer be a long-term project or aspiration. It has become an imperative of the present, an urgent need, an indispensable option to modernize our productive structures in order to bring about a broader market that will endow our exports with greater competitiveness and enable us to receive investments and financing on realistic terms without detriment to our sovereign decisions. \nIntegration thus understood will clearly give the region multinational negotiating power and strength enabling it to present a solid front in international economic and trade negotiations and to resist and reverse the protectionist measures of the developed world.\nLatin American integration - the key to development, the unrealised dream of our liberators and the unfulfilled commitment to our peoples - has been limping upstairs on crutches while in the developed world integration has gone up by the elevator, thus broadening the gap separating us from the North and painfully losing us resources and opportunities vital to regional development.\nHence our peoples cry out with good reason for action, responsibility, dynamism, resolve and concerted effort.\nThere is no time to waste in Latin America. There is no room for apathy, bureaucratisation and insensitivity, because 700,000 children in our continent are dying of hunger every year; because more than 110 million Latin Americans are living in poverty, and of these 35 million find themselves in that subhuman situation described as extreme poverty; because the children of 40 per cent of Latin American homes do not have adequate nutrition; because 78 per cent of them are living in unhealthy surroundings; because the absolutely unemployed, which in 1980 numbered 25 million, now number 40 million and may be growing as a result of recession; because the underemployed also number 40 million; because 60 per cent of the economically active population does not have social security coverage and because per capita income has declined by 10 per cent.\nAs if all that were not enough, hunger and poverty are also creating ,conditions making children the targets of war, political violence or terrorism, as is shown dramatically by the fact that from 1982 to date more than 300,000 children have been displaced from their homes and thousands more have died or been injured as a result of these destructive tendencies. Terrorism, a pathological and extreme form of violence which holds life and democracy in contempt and makes crime an aberrant style of politics, has also emerged in Latin America and deserves our most vigorous condemnation and our commitment to fight it with firmness, but within the framework of the law, because only thus will we be affirming the humanistic and democratic structures we want for our societies. \nLatin America must also face the serious and disturbing phenomenon of drug trafficking, which is a crime against humanity, distorts our economy, erodes the moral foundations of social coexistence and seeks to set itself up as a new focus of power, threatening the security of States and of society. Since the decade of the 1970s, when the consumers market for cocaine and other drugs grew tenfold in some industrialized countries, international drug-trafficking cartels have taken shape, and there are now more than 50 million addicts throughout the world.\nBecause of the magnitude of drug trafficking, which acts like a multinational and annually mobilizes some $400 billion, it is impossible to defeat it with isolated or partial strategies. It must be attacked frontally in every aspect through a comprehensive approach that takes into consideration the relationships between consumption, production, transportation, illicit trading and financing, which feed and perpetuate the economic cycle of drugs.\nPeru is affected by this plague, and it is committed to the struggle. Therefore, in the Andean Group, in the Organization of American States, in the Non-Aligned Movement and in the wider forum of the United Nations, we promote the co-ordination of policies and actions designed to establish effective international standards which should make it possible without delay to bring about crop substitution in the framework of an integrated development programme, a drastic reduction in consumption, the seizure of property and currency produced by drug trafficking, the unification of our legislations in giving decisive impetus to prevention and rehabilitation, and the enhancement of unconditional international financial co-operation to assist countries affected by illicit production.\nThe draft convention being negotiated in the United Nations should quickly lead to the approval of an effective international legal instrument. That can be achieved only through a balanced convention that attacks consumption, trafficking, transportation, production and illicit financing equally, and is based on full respect for the sovereignty and international jurisdiction of States.\nWe shall persist in the struggle against drug trafficking because that struggle represents a moral commitment to all the peoples of the world, especially the children and young persons affected by this plague. The President of Peru, Alan Garcia, has repeatedly called for such a commitment and has emphasized that there is no time to lose and no effort must be spared in this battle for morality and for life itself.\nI shall now refer to some of the priority items on the international agenda.\nThere have been significant advances in resolving principal areas of conflict, such as the cases of Iran and Iraq, Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Western Sahara and Namibia, which have been set on a path that augurs well for peace. The processes of detente and rationality are long-term processes that uphold life over death, and peace over war, and they are promoted with talent and vigour by the Secretary-General, a distinguished son of Peru whom we salute with legitimate pride. It is important that those processes bear fruit, and that new areas of negotiation are opened up for other regions in which there is conflict, such as Central America, a part of Latin America in which it is indispensable to fulfil the agreements of Esquipulas II and to affirm international law and the rule of law, under which non-intervention and non-use of force should guarantee the peaceful coexistence of the peoples. All of this is necessary to culminate a long process of negotiation in which Peruvian diplomacy has taken part and continues actively to participate through the Contadora Group and the Support Group.\nSimilarly, it is urgent for disarmament agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union to be deepened until they remove the nuclear threat from the face of the earth. Otherwise those agreements already achieved will have little practical effect, for real progress cannot be seen in merely moving from the destructive capacity to destroy the earth 100 times to the destructive capacity to destroy it 80 times. Disarmament is a synonym for detente and brotherhood. In economic terms, it implies releasing resources used for destruction and death for purposes of construction and life. Therefore the Latin American and non-aligned concept of using the funds thus released to establish a fund, under United Nations administration, to counter poverty and hunger retains its relevance.\nThose of us who call for the democratization of international relations, those of us who struggle for a process of peace, detente and non-violence, ate thus expressing the sentiments of our peoples, which cry out for life and social justice. Peru firmly and stubbornly believes in democracy and civil liberties, and that the State should be based on the rule of law. Those are enduring principles that govern our national life.\nIn this forum Peru holds out its hand to all peoples and reiterates its faith in the United Nations, and it expresses the hope that the results of this session of the Assembly will meet the aspirations of all who proclaim faith in the brotherhood of man and the common destiny of all who share this still torn and troubled world.\nThe eyes of the world's poor are upon us, in anxious hope. All who hold peace and humanity dear await our decisions. Let us not disappoint them.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nPlease convey, Sir, my warm congratulations to the President on his election to preside over the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I wish him luck and success in his high office.\nAs in previous years, my delegation will do everything possible to help the General Assembly achieve positive results.\nI wish to thank the President of the forty-second session, Ambassador Peter Florin, for his successful contribution. He guided the Assembly's proceedings circumspectly and pragmatically and with a view to getting results.\nThis session begins in encouraging circumstances. When we met here 12 months ago the war between Iraq and Iran was claiming countless victims day after day. In Afghanistan an end to the human suffering was not foreseeable. In southern Africa, too, there was no cause for hope.\nToday the weapons in the Gulf are silent. Negotiations have been begun between the warring parties. A year after its unanimous adoption by the Security Council, resolution 598 (1987) has been accepted by both parties to the conflict as a basis for a cease-fire. In Afghanistan the Geneva agreements, likewise achieved with the decisive assistance of the United Nations, created the conditions for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops. Fifty per cent of those troops have already left the country in accordance with the terms of the agreements.\nFollowing his talks in southern Africa the Secretary-General has expressed his confidence with regard to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nNone of this progress has simply fallen into the world Organization's lap. These achievements are the outcome of a favourable change in the international climate and are the product of the manifold efforts of the principal organs of the United Nations, above all its Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar.\nThe Secretary-General has said that serving the cause of peace is worth the maximum personal endeavour. He is making that endeavour and we all, the Members of the United Nations, are grateful to him for it. He has proved wrong those who had doubts about the United Nations. He encourages all who seek to strengthen its peace-promoting role.\t.\nThe Federal Republic of Germany has actively supported the United Nations and its Secretary-General.\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security Council, we have worked constructively for the implementation of Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 598 (1987). After the adoption of resolution 598 (1987) we kept in touch with both parties to the conflict, calling upon them to accept and implement it. I appeal to Iraq and Iran to conduct the negotiations with a will to make compromises and to achieve a comprehensive, just and honourable peace settlement. \nIn Afghanistan the withdrawal of the Soviet troops opens up the possibility of a new political beginning in that country. This opportunity should be seized by all concerned, like the European Community, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is ready to provide substantial humanitarian assistance in the process of repatriating and reintegrating the millions of refugees and, given the right domestic conditions, to contribute to Afghanistan's reconstruction.\nMajor progress has also been achieved towards a settlement of the conflicts in southern Africa. Important forward steps have been taken. The South African troops have left Angola. Negotiations are under way for the withdrawal of the Cuban troops. We have come a good deal closer to Namibia's independence. Security Council resolution 43S (1978) has always been and remains the only viable route to this goal. As a member of the Contact Group, my Government offers its good offices in seeking the implementation of that resolution.\nDevelopments have also been favourable in other parts of the world.\nIn Cambodia the contours of a peace settlement are beginning to appear.\nTalk between the Governments of South Korea and North Korea now seem to be within the realm of the possible.\nIn Central America the continuing cease-fire can facilitate dialogue between the conflicting parties so that democracy may be firmly established.\nA peaceful settlement of the conflicts in Western Sahara and between Libya and Chad is moving nearer.\nRepresentatives of the two ethnic groups in Cyprus are negotiating on the island's future.\n \u00b7 \nThe Middle East is still a source of concern. Negotiations are still not in sight, although the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories shows that the status quo is untenable. An international conference on the Middle East is and remains the appropriate framework for the necessary negotiations on a peace settlement that will enable the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and guarantee the right of all States in the region, including Israel, to exist within secured borders.\nWe wish sorely-tried Lebanon a peaceful solution to its problems based on sovereignty, unity and national reconciliation.\nIf we want to secure peace world-wide once and for all we must strengthen the forces of peace. This means, first of all, that we must strengthen the United Nations. To achieve this we must continue the successful endeavours to bring about internal reforms. What we need above all is full implementation of the Charter. We are prepared to consider seriously proposals aimed at enhancing the peace-promoting powers op our Organization. This is also the objective of our initiative for preventing conflicts which has been put before this session of the General Assembly for final approval. We deem it essential that the United Nations be in a position to act before a conflict actually breaks out.\nThe kind of peace we pursue can be based solely on the rule of law. It must derive from the right of self-determination of nations and from the civil, economic and social human rights enshrined in the International Covenants on Human Rights adopted by the United Nations. There is a growing awareness that all public power comes up against its absolute limit in human rights. Respect for human rights is not only an internal affair, within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe \u00cdCSCR) process those rights have become a central issue.\nOne of the most blatant mockeries of human rights and manifestations of disregard for those rights is the system of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa. We demand the abolition of this un-reformable system. We demand the release of Nelson Mandela, Eric Molohi and all other political prisoners in South Africa. We demand the lifting of the ban on the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and all other organizations of the black\nmajority so as to open the way for a peaceful national dialogue. Let there be no doubt about it; we will not be prohibited from helping anti-apartheid organizations.\nThe chairman of the largest single trade union in the world, the Metal Workers' Union in the Federal Republic of Germany, has drawn up a catalogue of minimum standards for labour relations to be respected by the South African subsidiaries of German companies. They afford South African unions and workers, irrespective of their colour, the same claim to social justice as their colleagues in the Federal Republic of Germany. Large German companies have promised to apply these minimum standards in South Africa. From this rostrum I appeal to all trade unions and all firms to follow this example.\nThe rule of law implies absolute respect for international law. That respect is the foundation of policies that are geared to negotiation and agreements rather than to the threat or use of force. The rule of law implies protection of and respect for minorities, be they religious, national or ethnic minorities. All such minorities have a right to develop their identity, to cultivate their language and to live according to their cultural traditions and to exercise their religion, while enjoying equal political and legal rights.\nThe rule of law is menaced by international terrorism. The international community must oppose terrorism, which is hostile to human dignity and any human order, with still greater determination.\nThe rule of law implies joint efforts to combat drug trafficking. This is an increasingly urgent international problem which can only be solved through the joint efforts of all governments. My Government hopes that the deliberations of the forthcoming diplomatic conference in Vienna will lead to a United Nations convention to combat illegal drug trafficking. This could mean considerable progress. \nWe can look to the future with confidence. The community of nations is showing greater respect for the rule of law. There is a growing willingness to resolve even the most serious differences by negotiation. This indicates a fundamental change in international relations. The core of these changes is in the attempts by West and East to place their relations on a new foundation. One of the reasons why the world Organization has been able to achieve progress in the peaceful settlement of conflicts is that West and East have increasingly been co-operating to this end. It has become obvious that West-East confrontation must not be carried over into the third world but must, where it arises, be defused step by step and, as far as possible, be resolved through dialogue and co-operation.\nThe progress of the European Community is one of the promising world trends. By creating a community of 12 European democracies we have won a victory over national egoism, power politics and prejudice. It is the greatest and finest victory in the history of Europe. It has not cost a single human life, yet it is winning us the future.\nFranco-German friendship and co-operation are at the core of this future-oriented development. The European Community is the most advanced association of sovereign States to date. The dynamism and attractiveness of our Community are growing constantly. The European Community has committed itself to free world trade and world economic co-operation. It is becoming a driving force of growth not only for ourselves but for the world economy as a whole. This makes us resolute opponents of protectionism.\nThe growth potential of the single market and of the common social and monetary area will make the European Community even more capable of developing a world economic partnership with the North American democracies and Japan. By increasing our economic strength we can also increasingly promote the development of the third world. The larger European market will be able to absorb even more products from the third world.\nAs the Lom\u00e9 Conventions, our agreements with the Mediterranean area and our co-operation agreements with the Association of South-East Asian Nations, the States of Central America and the Gulf Co-operation Council show, the European Community is already a major partner of the countries of the third world. This co-operation takes place on the basis of equal rights.\nThe powerful growth of the European Community creates a considerable opportunity for the development of West-East relations. The task now is to plan the architecture of the whole of Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals. The more the Soviet Union pursues the process of opening itself internally and externally, the more capable it will become of co-operation with the West and the East. We want this reform policy to prove successful. Europe's future lies not in hoping for, let alone seeking, the destabilization of the other side, but rather in co-operation and productive competition.\nThe manifold forms of co-operation will determine the architecture of the peaceful order in Europe or, as it also can be termed, the common European house.\nThe ensuing interdependence will enhance mutual confidence and make for greater stability. This new order must not be characterized by fences, but by open doors, by freedom of movement for people, for ideas and goods, as well as respect for human rights.\nOne of the pillars of the European structure is and will remain the European Community oriented towards openness and co-operation. We know that Europe is more than the European Community. President Mitterrand put this most impressively in his historic speech in Aachen in 1987. As a result of increasing co-operation, of genuine d\u00e9tente and of disarmament, the military elements will lose significance in the West-East relationship, whereas political, economic, ecological and cultural co-operation will gain in importance.  Thanks to this development. West and Fast will derive a fresh potential which can he used not for disarmament but for the advancement their own societies and for co-operation with the developing countries.\nThe change for the better in the whole of Europe derives energy from the revival of our continent's identity. That identity emanates from our common European history, Europe's glories and aberrations, its common culture - to which all European nations have made major contributions, and from the awareness of our mutual responsibility for the future of our continent and for peace and development in the world. Decades of separation have not made two Europes out of one Europe; decades of separation have not made two German nations out of one German nation. The German people in the heart of Europe, having often been in conflict with its neighbours, has learned its lessons from history. Both German States are meeting their responsibility for peace in Europe, including through mutual co-operation. 4hat benefits all Europeans.\nThrough our membership of the European Community and the Atlantic alliance, we Germans in the Federal Republic of Germany have responsibly used the freedom we regained after the Second World War. We have established the strongest imaginable bond States can have: the bond of common values. Our commitment to peace in Europe also led us to conclude treaties with the Soviet Union, the Polish People's Republic and Czechoslovakia, and to conclude the Basic Treaty with the German Democratic Republic, united, too, to our active participation in bringing about the Final Act of Helsinki and in the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). We regard the development of our relations with the Soviet Union, which are of crucial importance to us, as playing a key role in improving the overall West-Fast relationship. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's forthcoming visit to the Soviet Union will serve that purpose. \nWe have been nailing for a peaceful order in Europe ever since the Atlantic alliance presented its Harmel report in 1967. For a long time we received no answer to this proposed grand design for a better Europe. The policy initiated by General-Secretary Gorbachev in the Soviet Union can turn the design contained in the Harmel report into reality. This new policy in the Soviet Union meets not merely with a favourable but with a constructive response from us. We all have a responsibility to use every opportunity to bring about a change for the better. The distinct improvement in United States-Soviet relations indicates the opportunities arising there from.\nThe Final Act of Helsinki marks the course towards a peaceful order in Europe in which states with different political and social systems can live together in peaceful competition without fear of one another. By seeking to establish such a peaceful order in Europe, the Federal Republic of Germany is complying with the mandate of its Constitution, the Basic Law, which is to serve the cause of peace in Europe and to overcome the separation of our indivisible nation. Our efforts to achieve the early conclusion of the Vienna follow-up meeting with the adoption of a substantive and we11-balanced final document should bring us another step forward towards a European peaceful order.\nWe are today confronted with the task of protecting mankind from the dangers which man himself has created. Technological development leaves in our hands the decision whether we create a better and more humane world or we perish. The responsibility not only for ourselves but for all future generations must determine our policies, our thinking and our actions. \nIn view of the danger of nuclear annihilation, the disarmament process had to begin with nuclear disarmament. In this connection the Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces represents a breakthrough of fundamental importance since till now arms have only been limited. Now, for the first time, a whole class of weapons is being eliminated. The global elimination of Soviet and United States intermediate-range nuclear weapons must be followed by radical measures with regard to nuclear, chemical and conventional weapons. Reducing the strategic nuclear forces of both super-Powers by half must become a reality.\nThe shocking pictures of the consequences of the use of chemical weapons prompt me to appeal to all participants in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament to bring the now-far-advanced negotiations on a global ban on such weapons to the earliest possible conclusion. Only a world-wide convention ensuring the verifiable prevention of the manufacture, storage, transfer and use of chemical weapons can free mankind from the scourge of these cruel weapons for all time. My Government is playing an active part also in efforts to strengthen all instruments which can be utilized to prevent the use and proliferation of chemical weapons even before a global ban is in force. We welcome President Reagan's initiative calling for a conference of the signatories of the 1925 Geneva Protocol. While pursuing all these efforts, we must devote our entire energy to the task of achieving a global ban as the priority objective.\nIn the field of conventional arms our aim is to remove superiority and imbalances by means of asymmetrical disarmament. We want to create conditions in Europe in which neither side will still be capable of launching an attack on foreign territory. Large-scale offensive options do not feature in our Western concept. True conventional stability and further confidence-building require also consensus on the question of the defence philosophy underlying the policies. We seek \u0430 consensus on the functions to be given to both sides' forces. This must cover their size, equipment and command principles. I appeal to all concerned, to all the participants in the CSCE, to adopt before the end of October 1988, together with this final document of the Vienna CSCE follow-up meeting, a mandate for the commencement of negotiations on conventional stability. The time is ripe; all must now live up to their responsibility. \nUnlimited armaments do not create unlimited security, but balanced and mutual disarmament can help create more security. That is why disarmament and arms control are just as much an integral part of the security policy of the Atlantic Alliance as our defence efforts.\nIn the nuclear age war must be made un-wageable once and for all. New thinking requires that over the net of deterrence - the safety net of the ultimate ratio - an additional net of new, co-operative structures of military security be created which will reduce the enormous risks of exclusive reliance on deterrence.\nBeing realists, we know that we cannot base today's security on hopes for tomorrow. But, being men of action, meeting our responsibility for the future, we must today already create the foundations for our future security, foundations which must be broader, more solid and stronger than the ones on which peace has been based up to now.\nMankind's future is not threatened by war alone. There is a growing danger of man's destroying his own sources of life on this planet. We are faced with the task of preserving our natural sources of life and pressing ahead with the development of the third world. The two are closely intertwined. At present the world's population is more than 5 billion; soon it will be 6 billion. According to the World Bank statistics, about one billion people live in absolute poverty.\nThe industrial countries - all industrial countries; not only those in the West but also the socialist States - have a duty to act together. We must use our economic, scientific and technological potentials in order to render development possible and to preserve the world's natural sources of life. This presupposes the development of new forms of transport, new sources of energy, new materials and new production methods. It is on this and not on the development of new and ever more terrible weapons of mass destruction that the energy and the technology of industrial countries must he concentrated. What the nations of the third world need from industrial countries is not weapons but help for their development. I repeat my proposal that the United Nations record exports of weapons in a register. I welcome the Soviet Union's support for this proposal as expressed yesterday.\nThe purpose is also to satisfy the basic needs of hundreds of millions of people in the developing countries. Time and again, at ever shorter intervals, catastrophic food shortages occur which pose a challenge to mankind's solidarity and willingness to help. But humanitarian assistance alone cannot solve the problem. In spite of some favourable trends this year - the world economic situation having improved more than expected - we must admit that poverty in the third world is growing and the debt burden is growing. True, the gross domestic product increased in the developing countries as well last year, bat in many instances this improvement is being negated by population growth. Investments for the future are impeded by debt-servicing commitments.\nIn 1987 the debt-servicing payments of developing countries exceeded incoming funds by $15 billion. In such circumstances it is impossible for these countries to increase their economic potential.\nThe situation is particularly serious in the sub-Saharan countries. My Government supports the programme of action adopted at the special session of the General Assembly on Africa. 11 had previously cancelled about 2.9 billion marks of the debt owed by 20 of these countries. It has also announced its readiness to write off debts worth about 2.3 billion marks for six more African countries that are not among the least developed countries and are prepared to implement adjustment and reform programmes in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. \nAll donors should include in their official aid to the poorest countries a large grant element. We intend to increase the grant element of our financial co-operation with the developing countries overall. Our development assistance to the least developed countries is already being provided in grant form\nMy Government also proposes that initial, tangible debt-servicing relief should be afforded within the scope of the Paris Club rescheduling operations. It has also decided to broaden and considerably ease the terms of our bilateral financial co-operation with our partners in the third world.  We expect the commercial banks too to increase their commitment in the developing countries. Many of the newly industrializing economies as well are suffering from the consequences of their heavy foreign debts. Here, too, the commercial banks in particular are urgently called upon to provide the funds necessary to ensure the economic development of these countries. Such funds will not bring any long-term benefits, however, unless the recipients carry out effective adjustment programmes which create suitable conditions. We hope that the new Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency will also be conducive to this process.\nIt remains indispensable to secure free access for developing countries to the markets of industrial countries. The main problem here lies in non-tariff trade barriers. These must be removed in the course of the ongoing Uruguay Round if the concept of free world trade is not to lose its credibility. In the first six months of this year our imports from developing countries increased by over 5 per cent, while corresponding exports are down by more than 8 per cent.\nIn their joint efforts to promote development the industrial and developing countries must make sure that those very efforts do not themselves become one of the factors causing the destruction of the environment. The principle still to be observed is that the industrial countries, when investing in developing countries, should submit to the standards that apply at home.\nThe idea of introducing an international criminal law for crimes against the environment, which is being considered by the Committee on Crime Prevention and Control, is right. We must prevent large parts of the third world being turned into poison-garbage depots of the northern over-consumption societies as a result of criminal transport practices, but also as a result of exploitation of the financial distress of some developing countries. The political and economic colonialism of the past must not now be followed by poison-garbage colonialism.\nThere is more to the relationship between development and ecology than that, however. Many developing countries, owing to their economic plight, are compelled to over-exploit their natural resources. \nThe economy-ecology relationship must be made one of the main items of the agenda in the North-South dialogue. The violation and destruction of nature is much the same as the violation of human rights. The damage caused in one country is the concern of all- Who would still dispute that this has long since become a task of world domestic policy? For this reason, all German development projects are thoroughly examined as to their compatibility with the environment. Such a review should be carried out as a matter of course in the context of all development co-operation between North and South.\nThe extent of the danger to which we are all exposed is obvious from the changes in the world's climate. The gap in the Earth's ozone layer is constantly widening. A commission appointed by the German Federal Republic Parliament came to the conclusion that a catastrophic deterioration of the Earth's climate can be avoided only if the present international agreements are drastically tightened up in the next few years and if the aerosols causing the damage to the ozone layer have been almost completely removed by the year 20\u00dc0,\nOver the past 20 years more than 3 million people have lost their lives as a result of natural disasters all over the world. More than 800 million people have suffered as a result of such disasters and damage to property has exceeded $23 billion. The forty-second session of the General Assembly quite rightly proclaimed the last 10 years of the century the decade for disaster prevention.\nThe number of disasters afflicting mankind that do not have natural causes but are nature's reaction to its maltreatment by man is increasing all the time. The repair of damage resulting from such disasters must be complemented by preventive measures designed to ensure their early detection and mitigate their consequences. We already have the science and technology to achieve this, if only we can pool our efforts. This is a dictate of political and economic reason and applies to all members in the community of nations. The international community as a whole is responsible for the state of the Earth, which has been entrusted to us for safekeeping. The consequences of any aberrations affect us all.\nGenetic engineering will soon give man the power to change himself. This poses the question of our self-perception as human beings, a question which no congress of biogenetic engineers, no State, but only mankind itself can answer. It therefore needs to be dealt with by the United Nations. Let us bring together the best and the wisest citizens of all nations so that they may tell us where man should set his own limits if he is not to betray himself, if he is not to abandon his dignity, his uniqueness.\nWe must set our minds to that task. It, too, calls for a new approach. The scientist accepts as a matter of course that there is a complex interdependence, an interaction of different elements and processes. Similarly, politics too must now be understood as the interaction of quite different people, States and systems with but one framework for their actions, the biosphere in which we live, and with one dimension of responsibility, which extends far beyond our age, embracing the survival of mankind and the fate of the whole of creation.\nLet us erect a barrier against the maltreatment and destruction of creation. Because we all depend on the success of these efforts, we all depend on one another. While dependence compels all of us to desist from trying to dominate others, to desist from an arms race and to reject the arrogance of power and the egoism of the stronger.\nWest and East, North and South, must channel their energies into a new responsibility for this planet and for the future of mankind. We must no longer ask what our neighbours are doing to protect the Earth. We must ask what we ourselves can do, what can we do together. We need not despair in the face of this responsibility, which is unique in the history of mankind. We have no reason to be faint-hearted or despondent. As we face up to our responsibility for the future our best allies are the nations themselves. The people wish to live, they wish to live without fear; they wish to live without want. They will no longer allow themselves to be made objects of exploitation, oppression and power politics. They demand the chance to exercise their human rights, their civil, economic and social rights. The people are determined and inspired by the idea of their inalienable human dignity, the idea of freedom and the idea of peace. Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come. The time has come. We must act now.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first of all, on behalf of the people and the Government of Colombia, to congratulate you most warmly, Sir, on your election to the presidency of this Assembly. We are all confident that your well-known ability and your devotion to democratic values will contribute to the success of our work.\nThe forty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place in an atmosphere of optimism generated by the climate of detente that has emerged from the agreements between the great Powers. That climate and the intelligent endeavours of the Secretary-General are restoring faith in and credibility to the United Nations system.\nWe believe that this is an auspicious time for making of this forum a real centre of world understanding, not merely one that will continue to strive to avert confrontation and foster the settlement of disputes but one that will be a genuine setting for conciliation where we can find effective instruments to guarantee true, stable and lasting peace for all States. Although the Organization has shown signs of having the energy and capability to undertake substantial changes and convincingly to propose measures to establish higher standards of living and better patterns of development suited to the various regions of the world, the great Powers must be prepared to make use of this effective machinery to attain those objectives. Let us hope that we are witnessing a strengthening of the United Nations that will give it the kind of role it has never had before in safeguarding peace and achieving more rapid development for the poor nations of the Earth.\nAs they strive to consolidate their fragile process of development, third-world countries confront phenomena that pose agonizing threats to them in such vital areas as the food crisis, violence, underdevelopment, economic problems and, at times, political instability.\nNo less significant is the situation caused by destabilizing factors such as drug trafficking and terrorism. One of our major concerns in this regard is the way in which representatives of groups involved in these practices obtain the resources with which to strike at the legal order and democratic institutions. The wrong, senseless traffic in weapons which goes on unchecked all over the world bears with it disruptive elements that involve grave consequences for the countries that must endure these factors and that destabilize democratic, popularly elected Governments through interference in their internal affairs. When we look into this matter, universal hypocrisy becomes evident, foe at times\nthose very countries that profess to defend peace and security ate the ones that are supplying arms to those fighting to destroy them in other parts of the world. Often certain arms manufacturers encourage the commercial aspects of this traffic, and the whole world, without exception, is the victim of a travesty nurtured primarily by economic interests and private greed. For that reason, therefore, we believe that this issue must be tackled squarely and courageously, for we cannot continue to ignore the seriousness of the matter nor to turn a blind eye to its injurious consequences while at the same time, on the international scene, the great Powers are destroying a portion of their nuclear arsenals.\nWe wish likewise to condemn the use of chemical weapons. There is no argument that can possibly justify their use. We call on this Assembly to denounce and condemn not only those who employ such weapons but also those nations which supply the raw materials and technical assistance for their manufacture, for in this case the responsibility is shared equally by those who use such weapons and those who facilitate their use for motives of profit, or for whatever other reason.\nWe reaffirm our unconditional adherence to the resolution of disputes by means of the peaceful settlement procedures set forth in the United Nations Charter, We reiterate our continued hope that it will be possible to reach an understanding in the Central American conflict on the basis of the immutable principles of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples.\nWe accordingly reaffirm our shared commitment, along with a group of other democratic Latin American countries, to the establishment of a permanent political consultation and co-ordination mechanism to safeguard our countries' autonomy and respected position and to guarantee a future of peace, democracy and social and economic progress for generations to come. \nWe today express the hope that the negotiations aimed at resolving the Malvinas Islands sovereignty issue may be resumed as early as possible. You, Mr. President, are well aware that my country is in solidarity with your own in these endeavours.\nWe also place on record our satisfaction at the heartening signs of dialogue emerging in the Korean peninsula, and we shall be happy at this session of the Assembly to hear the views of representatives of both parties concerned.\nWe share in the whole world's feelings of satisfaction and optimism about the solutions now developing to such sensitive conflicts as those in Afghanistan, southern Africa and the Western Sahara and, of course the cessation of hostilities in the war between Iran and Iraq. Let us hope that next year we will be able to welcome among us in this forum representatives of a free Namibia.\nWe are hopeful that in the case of any other conflict the Security Council will act, in conformity with the terms of the Charter, in the same conciliatory spirit to promote peace for all mankind. The Security Council's potential should be used to the full.\nIt is with this conviction that Colombia has put forward its candidacy for one of the Security Council places allocated to Latin America. Colombia feels that in that position it would be able to make a constructive contribution in the next biennium to resolving the problems besetting international peace and security. We have the honour to be endorsed unanimously by the Latin American and Caribbean Group and we hope likewise to be worthy of this Assembly's vote of confidence.\nThe issue of South Africa and apartheid is once again on the agenda of this Assembly, and rightly so, for although we take the view that South Africa is not the only place in the world where there is racial discrimination, the racial discrimination in South Africa takes a uniquely repugnant form and is consequently morally indefensible and inhuman. We therefore reaffirm our solidarity with the South African people, which is suffering the consequences of the present perverted system, and with the countries of southern Africa that are directly involved in the struggle.\nWe have a cast-iron commitment to finding formulas to strengthen peace that actually work. In particular we are committed to identifying in terns regarding co-operation measures that will bring about speedy and balanced development in all the countries of the third world. For this reason we are pleased to be able to inform this Assembly that the request made by our President, Mr. Virgilio Barco, in his address to this forum two years ago, when he called for a meeting of\n\\\"... the responsible officials of all the relevant agencies of the United Nations system to establish the bases of a programme for immediate action against abject poverty, with the particular aim of submitting it to the Governments of Latin America and the Caribbean\\\" (A/41/PV.18, p. 16) has borne fruit with the holding last month in Cartagena de Indias of the first Latin American and Caribbean Conference on Absolute Poverty, whose conclusions, at the request of the participants, I shall be placing before this Assembly for consideration.\nIn this context, we believe that the external debt issue, a daily growing source of disquiet and complexity, must be addressed without delay. It is disillusionment and nothing else that has led to this issue's being left in the hands of those who have no option but to declare themselves impotent in the face of unbreakable undertakings. Indifference and ambivalence are of no assistance in freeing us from this abyss in which we have been trapped by an economic blunder that must be tackled with by debtors and creditors simultaneously. A similar point needs to be made with respect to drug trafficking. It is not possible for the burden of this struggle to be laid, as has been done with unparalleled hypocrisy, solely on the shoulders of a small group of countries whose societies are not the ones which, dissatisfied in the midst of abundance, have resorted to drug use. The war against drug trafficking must be the shared responsibility of all and should go hand in hand with effective controls on the interdiction of consumption. We are gratified to see that this position is now shared by the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean and that voices have been heard that prompt us to hope that in future the consuming nations will unequivocally accept their responsibility in this regard. \nColombia, one of the oldest and most robust democracies in Latin America, is committed, in the midst of the threats of terrorism and drug trafficking, to the protection and promotion of human rights. We actively and unconditionally support the activities of governmental and non-governmental human rights bodies alike, but we would issue a warning that the attempt by some to politicise these efforts in the service of certain interests must be checked if the actual advancement of human rights is to be achieved.\nThe prevailing climate of optimism prompts us to propose the convening in 1990 of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to development. We believe that a setting of that kind would enable us to arrive at an objective assessment of the world economic situation and the measures needed to speed up development in the poorest countries. As long as human beings continue to go hungry, to be homeless and to suffer disease, those who have the resources cannot remain unmoved.\nSolidarity must be a prerequisite for the continued survival of peoples and nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Chile, I have pleasure in offering sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We are confident that in discharging his duties he will not only do honour to Latin America but also make a significant contribution to the progress and success of the work of this Assembly. It is particularly gratifying to Chile to see the Foreign Minister of the Argentine Republic presiding over our work, representing as he does a nation with which we are linked by geography, history, culture and an identical shared peace-loving tradition.\nOur congratulations go also to the Secretary-General and his team of collaborators whose active endeavours have been a positive factor in making it possible for this year's General Assembly to see promising signs of the closer approach of wider international peace.\nIn this address I shall first express my country's opinion on some of the subjects that currently merit international consideration, and then I shall refer in particular to Chile, in view of certain important facts regarding our present situation.\nWe note with satisfaction that the cause of order and peace has been strengthened. Just a year ago, in this same Hall, the hope was expressed that the new relationship being perceived between the United States and the Soviet Union really would establish a world a climate that would benefit the international community. The strategic agreements that materialized this year offer encouraging prospects and we, together with the other nations of the world, await the new advances which these Powers may succeed in achieving. \nSimilarly, we hope that their concept o\u00a3 peace and constructive international coexistence based on respect will not only induce them to safeguard their own interests but with an awareness of their influence on the world scene, also impel them to encourage just and balanced international development.\nWe also hope that this newly declared spirit of peace may signify the end of hegemonist intentions or intervention, and will be translated into the effective ending of any such encouragement or assistance to violence as that given from well-known and condemned sources given to extremists groups in my country.\nFurther, we note with satisfaction the announced withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the quadripartite negotiations between Cuba, South Africa, the United States and Angola on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola; the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), designed to lead to the independence of Namibia; the cease-fire agreed upon by Iraq and Iran; and recent reports regarding an agreement between the parties in the region of Western Sahara.\nThese hopeful advances are part of a process that should continue without faltering until real and completely satisfactory results are attained. We hope that thus we hope, prolonged tribulations will come to an end. In this process, the Secretariat has made great efforts, which deserve our praise, and it should serve as a basis for new achievements in keeping with the paramount principles of the United Nations Charter.\nWe should like to see these results augmented by new progress on the problems of ecology, denuclearization, outer space, free trade, underdevelopment, terrorism and drug trafficking, and on all the other challenges which mankind must confront in order to achieve the international common good. However, we continue to be concerned about situations affecting other nations and peoples which have not yet found definitive solutions.\nWe note with sorrow the continued violence in the Middle East and its repeated effect on the life of the peoples there. This anguish is profound because many descendants of the Arab and Israeli peoples form part of the Chilean society and are dynamic elements in our nation.\nWe reiterate the importance of the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and the need to act realistically to bring about fair agreements that recognize the right of the Palestinian people to establish a sovereign State, and guarantee the peace and security of all the peoples of the region, including Israel, so that they may live within safe and internationally recognized boundaries.\nWe also observe with great sorrow the continuance of the tragedy affecting the Lebanese people. We trust that the new circumstances that prevail internationally will contribute to the ending of this tragedy by a satisfactory solution for all the parties involved.\nWe deplore the prolonged tragedy of Kampuchea whose people have been grievously attacked and subjected to sustained violence by a satellite of Soviet imperialism. I reiterate my country's recognition of the valour of those people in resisting the invader. We associate ourselves with the call by the Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) last July for a prompt solution of the Kampuchean problem to end the threat to the stability of that region.\nWe salute the Republic of South Korea on the completion of 40 years of its independence and applaud its efforts to unite its people. We value the call by the President of South Korea for dialogue between the two Koreas, and his Government's desire that both be incorporated into this Organization. \nOn our continent, we share in the situation involving the peoples of Central America, a region that during the last decade has been harassed by the activities of foreign ideologists. We recognize the efforts of the Central American nations to achieve peace. We are confident that the renewed proposals for peace which have been reported to the international community, and to which I referred earlier, will be extended to this area, the countries of which are so closely tied to the Chilean people by principles of freedom, historical origin and traditional friendship. \nAt the same time, we reaffirm our consistent rejection of any political or social policy that implies any kind of discrimination on racial or religious grounds. For this reason we reject apartheid and any other practice that disregards the equality of rights of man.\nWe also maintain our traditional policy of supporting true decolonization. As members of the Special Committee on decolonization, we have supported its action in the case of New Caledonia. We observe with interest positive signs emerging in the actions of the administering power, that should lead to legitimate self-determination for the people of that territory.\nSimilarly, as members of the Council for Namibia we shall continue to support compliance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Our action in the Council has taken on a special connotation this year because of the visit of a delegation from the Council to Chile. This permitted us to set forth our position clearly and pinpoint our offer of technical co-operation for the vocational training of Namibian experts in various fields.\nWe add out condemnation and repudiation to the civilized world's rejection of terrorism. It is a scourge that besets society as a whole, an outrage against the normal life of citizens, their families and their property. Terrorist acts \u2013 and I say this in the light of experience in my own country - destroy the human individual or render him an invalid, demolishing in minutes what has taken our national heritage years to create. Furthermore, these acts are often orchestrated for imperialistic purposes or ideological expansionism, in order to undermine the integrity of nations and jeopardize their sovereignty. \nThe world knows that there is a trans-national terrorism that still receives the overt or covert support of certain States. Moreover, the odious and repugnant links which at times become evident between terrorism and the drug traffic, bind together these two elements which destroy health and social coexistence. The most vigorous, definite and co-ordinated reaction on the part of the international community, without delay, is needed to eradicate these devastating perversions. One of the tests of the objectives of peace which certain Powers proclaim would be the degree of effective contribution they are able to offer to make such eradication a reality.\nWe resolutely support the cause of human rights and reaffirm the co-operation which we have offered in support of the responsibility which this Organization should bear in this regard. We do so on this, the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, despite the ostensible discrimination to which we have been subjected.\nWe want human rights to be protected effectively. To achieve this and it is necessary to introduce in-depth modifications into the instruments and the conduct with which States approach the treatment of the subject.\nExperience affirms the need to create juridical and procedural instrument that are universally binding, free of political and ideological content, that will guarantee non-discrimination, ensure impartial objectivity and preserve the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States \nThe politicisation of the subject of human rights has served to distort its high and noble objectives. Use of the subject for political purposes, or to exert  unjustifiable pressure has led to manifestly erroneous actions and downright omissions and silences.\nThis involves the risk of deterioration of the bases of peaceful and correct understanding between peoples and countries the very human rights and true values they represent.\nWe fully share the uneasiness caused by the world economic situation, and especially that which affects developing countries. In recent years these nations have suffered from the combined effects of the deterioration in terms of trade, the high level of real interest rates, and the absence of any effective or realistic treatment of the problems arising from the recession of the beginning of the decade, and external debt.\nThe destiny of the developing countries is closely linked to the possibilities for them to expand their international trade. For that reason, we view with concern the protectionist measures and disregard of multilateral commitments to liberalize trade which are emerging in the more developed countries.\nProtectionism restricts international relations in the modern world, intensifies the differences in the world community, and reduces the debtor's ability to meet its financial obligations.\nWe are hopeful about the results of the Uruguayan Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but we must point out that we cannot wait for the dismantling of protectionist barriers, or even accept the invoking of a dilatory excuse, such as the conclusion of a new round of negotiations.\nThe foreign debt problem, in its multiple dimensions - political, social and economic - requires that the debtor countries, as well as the developed nations, assume their respective shares of responsibility - the former by pursuing internal adjustment and reforms that will lead to the strengthening of their economies, and the latter by curbing protectionist tendencies and increasing effective co-operation with the debtor countries.\nFor those of us who, as in the case of my own country, have liberalized their economy and carried out an internal adjustment of profound ramifications, complying fully with all our commitments, the repercussions of international trade, protectionism and indebtedness have unquestionably a significance about which we cannot remain silent.\nWe share a common destiny with the developing and industrialized nations alike. We seek an economic order in which all of us can grow. The future of humanity demands that this growth be balanced. To fail to contribute to it and to attempt simply to accept only the short-term advantages is to close one's eyes to tomorrow.\nIn concluding this first section, I wish to voice the desire that world society should take to heart the profound appeal of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, who, in his last encyclical, said that in the natural interdependence of nations it was necessary to superimpose solidarity among them if an international order of peace and justice was to be achieved. We are encouraged by the hope that this Assembly is leading us on to that noble goal.\nI shall now refer to Chile. It seems an opportune moment to do so.\nEfforts have been made on the international scene to misrepresent the political realities of Chile. There has been no desire to believe the affirmations of my country and opinions, unjust and without foundation, have been expressed regarding the institutional process which it has been implementing. Time and again we have denounced and rejected the repeated attempts to interfere in our internal affairs. We do not accept attempts from outside to direct or influence the Chilean political process. As history confirms, grave crises suffered by some peoples have very often had their origin in colonialist designs or foreign intervention ism. The fundamental principles of international coexistence and the rights and powers of national sovereignties will be gravely impaired by any external abuse that interferes with a nation's own private political life.\nWithin a few days the people of Chile will take a political decision of profound significance in its institutionalized transition to democracy. In response to the will of the Government and our citizens, the culmination of our current political process is beginning. A system of government, fully in accord with the constant norms of the political Constitution approved by the people in 1980, calling for a democratic system in keeping with Christian-Western values and principles, will be inaugurated. My participation in this Assembly coincides with this historic national moment. Objective appreciation of this event is certainly necessary for a better understanding of our reciprocal links and for the fusing of our common goal of progress.\nIt is useful and appropriate to recall that in 1973 the Government of Chile took over a nation on the brink of material disintegration and of the loss of its national identity, with the imminent risk of being deprived of its sovereignty. It was a country in a shattered political, juridical, economic, social and moral condition. The institutions of the Republic had been seriously eroded or derided. The nation's economy was destroyed, its production sources paralysed, its international reserves exhausted. Chilean society was in crisis. The loftiest and permanent values of the nation were threatened. \nSince then the Government of President Pinochet has assumed the arduous and complex task of reclaiming Chile's democratic institutionality and opening the way to sustained progress, in harmony with the national common good.\nTo make headway on this great task the labour and effort of all Chileans has been required. We have faced adverse conditions resulting from international crises and recessions, as well as from the lack of understanding and the difficulties that we have encountered even from those that shared our principles and were aware of the nature of our problem.\nThis difficult task had the object of giving shape in Chile to an authentically free society, based on three fundamental pillars which mutually complement one another. These are, simultaneously, improvement of the Chilean's quality of life through social development, a social economy of the marketplace through economic development, and a solid participative democracy through political development. If an impartial, unbiased visitor were to check on what has been achieved in Chile, he would appreciate the substantial progress which the country has made at these three levels.\nAs for quality of life and social development, the respective indexes are eloquent and the forecasts are promising. The marked increase in life expectancy, the virtual disappearance of illiteracy and serious infant malnutrition, the increase in school enrolment, the decline in extreme poverty, the noteworthy urban improvement, housing construction, the increase in the number of home owners and the decline in the rates of unemployment to figures even lower than those in more developed nations are some samples of our social achievements, and these will continue to increase in the interest of the welfare of all Chileans,\nAs far as the economy is concerned, the results obtained have been the object of praise and recognition in specialized technical circles. To mention only a few aspects in this area, it is worth noting that the fiscal budget has been balanced; inflation has been controlled, having been reduced from percentages greater than 6\u00fc\u00fc per cent annually to 5.9 per cent in the first eight months of this year; an increase in the gross national product has been maintained for the fifth consecutive year; diversification of exports has substantially changed our position from that of being predominantly an exporter of a single product, with the result that, overall, exports have increased by more than 5 per cent, with the decisive participation of the private sector; and there has been negotiation of the servicing and reduction of the external debt.\nIn the political sphere, we have always affirmed that Chile would restore its democratic regime, proceeding with a process of transition outlined in a detailed plan.\nThe Political Constitution approved in 1980, which governs the country today, provided that in 1988 the people would be called upon to make a sovereign, free, secret and well-informed decision to elect a leader to assume the presidency of the Republic for the next term. It also provided that in 1989 the senators and deputies who would form the two branches of the National Congress would be elected by popular vote. To that end and to ensure the development of full democracy, the necessary legal regulations were prepared and put into effect.\nAs a result Chile today has a sophisticated system of public electoral registration of its citizens which has enabled almost 7.5 million Chileans to participate now in the electoral process. That is 92 per cent of the possible total in the country - a percentage that not even the more developed nations have attained and that has certainly never before been reached in Chile. Similarly, the legislation that regulates the voting and scrutiny process guarantees the correctness of the voting system and its results. The secrecy of voting is guaranteed, as is public scrutiny, and the representatives of all the political parties can verify results in the voting precincts and associated areas. Any complaints that the electoral processes may produce are dealt with by the Election Qualifying Board, a politically independent organism, in accordance with the respective statutes.\nIn compliance with the legislation on political parties, these are functioning in significant numbers, participating daily and constantly in the political debate in support of their respective options and arguments\nIn addition to the ample freedom that exists for electoral publicity through the media - radio, newspapers and other written material - free time has been legally granted on all television channels, with equal periods for all the electoral options presented to the citizenry. Anyone who does not keep his eyes closed in Chile today can see all the publications representing the most diverse political points of view, and if he does not plug his ears he can also hear innumerable radio stations broadcasting programmes about the different party options.\nIn addition, all the exceptional measures in effect in the country have been lifted, despite the persistence of extremist activity, so that total legal normality now exists. The last of the prohibitions on entry into the country established by virtue of the state of emergency, now revoked, has also been terminated.\nIn sum, all these actions confirm the absolute resolve of the government and people of Chile to restore full democracy.\nWithin this framework, Chile is now nearing the plebiscite to be held on 5 October, that is to say, a week from today. This plebiscite constitutes a form of election permitted once only under the Political Constitution as an extraordinary and exceptional measure. Its purpose is to allow Chileans an opportunity to give their majority support to the person proposed for the next presidential term and thus to ensure the best possible conditions for beginning the restored democratic institutional process. If this support is granted it will mean that the elected candidate has gained in a direct vote more than 50 per cent of the votes cast, a proportion which no one can contend does not represent the democratic will of a people. If that does not happen, a President of the Republic will be elected at the end of one year, in accordance with the general and permanent provisions of the Constitution.\nThis is the culmination of Chile's institutional and political development. However, we are not unmindful of the obstacles still to overcome.\nWe know that there are elements that seek a breakdown or failure of the institutional process, to the point that they have called for the electoral results to be disregarded or their constitutional effects modified. We also know that they will continue to try to distort the realities in Chile, through disinformation, creation of false images and falsification of results, and will even go so far as to charge fraud. Unfortunately, some of these disruptive elements seem to be able to rely on foreign complicity, or seek to obtain it. The Chilean Government will not hesitate to maintain order to guarantee free electoral expression by its citizens. \nLet the international community not be confused with regard to the situation in Chile. The facts I have just set forth confirm that the process that is now going on is in keeping with the deeply felt interests of the Republic, and enables it to face the future with stability, seeking the well-being of all Chileans.\nThe democracy that is being restored in Chile today constitutes a system in which political and economic freedoms are solidly linked with social development. It is based on our conviction that it is this unity that will give it stability since socio-economic development gives the individual freedom in his personal and social life, and political development involves him in participation in the common good of the nation.\nWe have full respect for the will of each nation and for the way in which each State manages its internal affairs. We have the right to ask that this respect be reciprocal.\nLet me say in closing that it is the desire and the confidence of Chile that this Organization which unites us will succeed in finding proper and timely answers to the desire for peace, justice and development so deeply felt in the world today and that it will also know how to inspire us to make a real contribution to the international common good, a responsibility we all must share.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe election, as President of the General Assembly, of a dear friend and colleague has been for me a source of great satisfaction. I should like to congratulate you. Sir, and also to congratulate ourselves because I feel entirely confident that your professional ability and proven diplomatic skill will ensure that the discussions in this forum will have the positive results for which we all hope. I also wish to express our gratitude for the work carried out by your predecessor as President, Mr. Peter Florin.\nYear after year, as we have debated the important issues on our agenda, we have observed with a feeling of frustration that many conflicts have continued to stagnate just where we left them the year before, and that nothing and nobody seemed capable of staying the sinister hand that wields the scourge of war. To this feeling of impotence was added a feeling of frustration because of a rather widespread tendency on the part of the public to dismiss the United Nations, and multilateralism in general, as an appropriate means of solving the most difficult and complex problems facing mankind.\nToday, however, there are reasonable grounds for optimism. The work of the United Nations over the past year has borne fruit in the area of the peaceful solution of international conflicts. The role of our Organization has been strengthened and has gained credibility in the eyes of the public.\nMy Government has always believed in the need and usefulness of multilateral channels in today's world. Three years ago - on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Organization - Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez reaffirmed Spain's unqualified support for multilateralism, and for the United Nations in particular. A year later, this was also the chief message conveyed by His Majesty King Juan Carlos I when he addressed this Assembly. We have always thought that as long as there is the necessary political will on the part of the Member States, and as long as we are capable of introducing the readjustments that are needed at any given moment, this Organization's potential should be practically unlimited.\nIt is not only the goodwill of the Member States and the new climate of dialogue among the great Powers - which has been reflected in the recent unity of action among the permanent members of the Security Council - that have contributed to bringing about this encouraging situation; the patience, the tenacity and the skill of the Secretary-General have also been instrumental. His hard work, which is now, quite rightly, winning international acclaim, continues to enjoy the full support of my Government, We trust that we are witnessing the start of a successful period during which the United Nations will be the forum in which everyone's efforts to implement the objectives and principles enunciated in the Charter will converge.\nWith regard to regional problems, I shall begin with the long and terrible war that has confronted Iran and Iraq. The united action of the Security Council and its co-operation with the Secretary-General have started to bear fruit, with the adoption of resolution 598 (1987), the Security Council had already laid the foundations for a just and lasting solution. With the full and unqualified acceptance of that resolution as a whole by both sides, a process of negotiation has formally begun under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his special representative. Ambassador Eliassen, who, in spite of the many obstacles and difficulties to be overcome, is to secure not only a cease-fire but true peace for these two peoples, worn out by so much death and sacrifice.\nIn the Afghanistan conflict, the beginning of a solution can also be glimpsed as a result of the signing of the Geneva Accords last April. The determination and tenacity of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Mr. Cordovez, were also decisive in drawing them up. We must now trust that the different parties involved will abide scrupulously by the agreements, that the withdrawal of Soviet troops of occupation will proceed in accordance with the agreed timetable, and that the Afghan people will be able to exercise their right to self-determination and finally achieve true sovereignty and independence. The setting up of a widely representative Government, and the free and unhindered return of as many refugees as wish to go back to their homes, will constitute the real proof of national reconciliation, to which the international community must contribute all possible aid for the urgent rebuilding of Afghanistan, through the Special Co-ordinator appointed by the Secretary-General.\nIn southern Africa, together with the hopeful progress towards the solution of the problems of Angola and Namibia, we observe that South Africa's policy of destabilization of neighbouring countries is being maintained and that the hideous and iniquitous system of apartheid is still in force. The repressive measures of all kinds taken over the course of the past few months and the re-imposition of martial law are clear signs of the unwillingness of the Government in Pretoria to engage in dialogue, while it radicalises the situation and makes the solution of the domestic problems more difficult. Once again we repeat our appeal for the immediate liberation of Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners, as well as the legalization of all political organizations. We are determined to reinforce, together with our partners in the European Community, both the positive actions and the application of pressure necessary to promote peaceful change in South Africa, which would pave the way to a pluralistic, democratic and non-racist society. \nHowever, it appears that there are also signs of hope in the region. On the one hand, in the talks new under way among the Governments of Angola, Cuba and South Africa, with the positive mediation of the United States, we perceive a desire for flexibility and a general political will to overcome the last obstacles that still hinder the attainment of peace and stability in Angola. On the other hand, the implementation of United Nations resolutions, and in particular Security Council resolution 435 (1978) - and, incidentally, today is the tenth anniversary of its adoption - appears to be drawing progressively nearer, after so many years of stagnation. The process of independence for Namibia will undoubtedly require significant effort on the part of this Organization and its Member States. Spain is prepared to co-operate fully with the Secretary-General in this process and to provide, if so requested, support for the human and military infrastructure that may be needed in order to bring it to a successful conclusion.\nThere are also better prospects for a solution to the problem of Kampuchea. For the first time in many years there is perhaps an opportunity for this unfortunate country, and the entice area of South-East Asia, to enjoy peace, stability and an end to violence. We are encouraged by the dialogue that has begun among the various parties to the conflict and the countries concerned. We support the constructive efforts of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and believe that contacts between China and the Soviet Union on this issue can also be useful. Any lasting solution requires the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea and the setting up of a Government of national reconciliation, representing the different political parties, thus averting once and for all the danger of a return to the immediate past, which we have all condemned.\nIn the Maghreb, a region to which my country is linked by innumerable ties. We have also noted over the past few months a significant easing of tension. Spain welcomed with great satisfaction the renewing of diplomatic relations between two of our friends, Algeria and Morocco, as well as the first steps towards progressive regional integration. In this new context, we observe that important steps have been taken towards the solution of a conflict, that of the Western Sahara, about which my country is understandably concerned. The Secretary-General, guided by the resolutions of this Assembly, and in conjunction with the President of the Organization of African Unity, has done some very constructive work here. This consisted in the sending of a technical information mission to the area; the maintaining of constant contact with the parties to the conflict - Morocco and the POLISARIO Front - and the submitting of concrete proposals to both these parties last summer with a view to holding a referendum for self-determination, duly organized and supervised by this Organization. We note with satisfaction that these proposals have received the initial agreement of the parties. Regrettably, the Security Council authorized the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative, who has ahead of him a delicate task in order to conclude the peace plan successfully. Spain is willing to provide all the technical co-operation the Secretary-General may require in this process. Furthermore, we are confident that, through the free and unhindered expression of the will of the Sahraoui people, an end will be put to a painful conflict that impedes this future of progressive integration that the peoples of the Maghreb desire.\nWe also wish to express our satisfaction at the progress made on the question of Cyprus. The recent talks between the leaders of the two communities, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, are a good omen that perhaps a way has been found to solve another long-standing conflict. My country supports this direct dialogue and is confident that it will lead to a final settlement which will guarantee the unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial interest of the Republic of Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations, while at the same time making possible peaceful coexistence between the two communities on the island.\nUnfortunately, in the case of other regional conflicts we cannot say that there has been significant progress in the past few months.\nLast year at this time I pointed out from this rostrum the advisability of not delaying the convening of an international peace conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, to seek a just, global and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East. A few months later, the Palestinian population of the occupied territories rose in protest, and this has attracted international attention both in connection with the deteriorating economic and social situation and the injustices being suffered by the Palestinian people and in connection with the repressive measures taken by Israel with a view to stifling the national aspirations of that people. \nThe deterioration of the situation in the occupied territories makes clear the dangers involved in a stagnation of the peace process My country trusts that, under the auspices of the United Nations, gradual and constructive initiatives will be introduced which will permit an agreement in principle among all the parties involved in the holding of a conference at which a final agreement could be reached. This agreement must guarantee respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the right of self-determination, as well as the existence of all the countries in the region, including Israel, within secure and internationally recognized borders. Meanwhile, the recent decision by Jordan to break off legal and administrative ties between the two banks of the river Jordan has left a void that requires, on the one hand, greater involvement and aid by the international community and, on the other, greater moderation, prudence and realism by all the parties directly involved in this conflict. \n Within the context of the Middle East, we see with great concern the recent aggravation of the political crisis that has been going on for so many years in Lebanon. Spain supports the wishes of the Lebanese people to put an end to the bloody confrontations that have taken so many lives in that country since 1975 and trusts that, through dialogue among all the communities, a strengthening of its constitutional institutions may be brought about which will make possible peaceful coexistence in a sovereign, independent and united Lebanon,\nMy Government continues to support resolutely the process of the strengthening of democracy in Latin America, although, unfortunately, clear threats and resistance to the progress of freedom still persist. Democracy presupposes pluralism, respect for human rights, and also the right of peoples to determine, freely and without outside interference, their political, economic and social systems. We therefore welcomed the Acapulco compromise for peace, development and democracy, which was signed by the Presidents of eight Latin American countries in November last year, and we hope that Chile will soon return resolutely to its democratic traditions.\nWith regard to the serious crisis in Central America, Spain greeted with hope the signing of the Esquipulas II agreements as a highly significant step towards the peace, reconciliation, and economic and social recovery of the countries of the region. It is true that since then other significant steps have been taken and that the will of the peoples concerned to find genuinely regional solutions to the problems of the area have remained unaltered; however, in general terms, there is a disturbing stalemate which must be overcome as rapidly as possible. \nIn this regard, the convening of the long-delayed summit of Central American Presidents, which has gained better prospects recently, can contribute to give a new impulse to the peace process. The national dialogue must continue, respect for human rights must be strengthened and there must be strict observance by all the parties concerned of the commitments in the Esquipulas agreements. There are no alternatives to this peace process, to this peace framework. At the same time, an essential element for the consolidation of the momentum towards peace is the implementation and development of the special plan for aid to Central America, which my country will continue to support fully. As we have incessantly repeated, the grave problems of this region have their roots in underdevelopment and the persistence of unjust social and economic structures. \nThis Assembly, which has acted as a true catalyst in the process of decolonization, has nevertheless been unable to eliminate certain pending issues from its agenda. With regard to East Timor, we trust that the contacts between Portugal and Indonesia will be continued and that progress will be made towards a just and internationally acceptable solution. As for the Malvinas Islands, direct negotiations should be held between Argentina and the United Kingdom that will enable Argentinean territorial integrity to be restored while safeguarding the legitimate interests of the population.\nI cannot fail to mention another pending colonial issue that directly affects my country. The Spanish Government and people continue to remain firm in their determination to find a definitive solution to the problem of Gibraltar that will restore the Rock to our country while safeguarding the interests of the population,. In this connection, we have continued the dialogue with the United Kingdom and we shall continue to do so in the future along the lines of the agreements contained in the 1984 Brussels Declaration and in accordance with the decision taken by both Governments in Geneva in 1985 to deal with and resolve all aspects of the problem, including the matter of sovereignty, through negotiation. During this past year significant progress has taken place in the talks on some technical problems, such as air facilities, and it is our firm intention to continue along this path of negotiation, with the goal of being able to conclude the process of decolonization through the restoration of our territorial integrity, thus implementing the resolutions that were adopted by this Assembly at the time.\nRecent positive developments in some regional conflicts and the continued efforts of this Organization and its Secretary-General to bring about a solution for others have brought the United Nations peace-keeping activities to the forefront. As has been mentioned, the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988 is something we all welcome and in which we can take satisfaction. The resolute action by the Security Council in this field is a particularly encouraging factor. The growing containment to the concept and the practice of peace-keeping operations among Member States and, above all, the political will to co-operate in their implementation on the part of those who have shown most reserve in the past provide a solid basis for developing them more thoroughly at a favourable time such as the present.\nWe feel that the time has come to draw up general regulations on the financial arrangements and the supply of facilities, services and personnel by Member States. My delegation considers that it would be most advisable to revitalize and strengthen the activities of the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations, whose recent meetings a few months ago, after five years without being convened, strengthen our optimism about its possible future role in this important sphere of the work of the Organization.\nThe new trend towards peace on the international scene prompted me to the first with regional conflicts. But obviously the task of this Organization does not end with the solution of regional conflicts. There are many other areas in which the United Nations, with less spectacular but nevertheless tenacious and continuous efforts, has been demonstrating for years its capacity for dealing with the major problems facing the international community. I have in mind three areas in which the importance of multilateralism can hardly be denied and in which the Organization's efforts have been especially significant: disarmament, co-operation for development, and the protection and promotion of human rights.\nSome three months ago, at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, I gave a detailed outline of my Government's views on the many items of the agenda related to this important issue. At the start of this forty-third session, I should like to make some remarks of a more general nature. \nOver the course of this year several developments have pointed to the possibility of developing a new pattern of East-West relationships, which had focused on confrontation, with scarcely any margin for dialogue and co-operation.\nThe Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - the slow but sure progress in the strategic arms limitation talks, the advances towards the limitation and ultimate banning of nuclear testing; these are all stages in a new bilateral dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union aimed for the first time at reversing the arms race on Earth and preventing its extension to outer space. However, their significance is not limited to the field of arms control and disarmament, nor to the strict framework of bilateral relations between the super-Powers.\nThe satisfactory implementation of the intrusive verification procedures provided for under the INF Treaty is a confidence-building element which will affect other areas. Thus, in the field of arms control and disarmament, a new impulse could be given and new initiatives could also be introduced in international forums.\nThe fact that it was not possible to agree on a final document at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament is soma thing that we regret, but that has not undermined our confidence in multilateralism. In our opinion; the document - which never saw the light of day although it had obtained broad consensus on most points - contained many elements which deserve more thorough treatment in the immediate future and which could provide an excellent working basis for the debates during the present session. \nThe issue of conventional stability is especially important within the European regional framework. In this connection, within the context of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), it is necessary to proceed without delay to a reduction of the existing imbalances in the conventional field, which will make possible enhanced security with lower levels of forces. At the same time, Spain is in favour of the adoption of new confidence-building measures that will complement and reinforce those adopted at the Stockholm Conference.\nProgress in the field of security must be accompanied by substantial advances in other areas of the CSCE process, particularly with regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms. We are following with growing interest the process of greater openness in Eastern Europe, which we hope will have a positive effect at the Vienna meeting. Spain is confident that a substantial and balanced final document will be agreed upon promptly at that meeting, so that negotiations in the area of security can begin as soon as possible.\nHowever, there is a matter of serious concern that I should like to stress. The renewed use of chemical weapons, together with the proliferation of ballistic missiles, gives new urgency to the need to achieve decisive progress in concluding an agreement for the complete and effective elimination of the whole category of chemical weapons.\nEconomic development is another major issue facing the international community. It is perhaps the major question facing it. The recent economic recovery in the industrialized countries has served to enlarge the gap between them and the developing countries and to make the poverty of the latter more visible. Commodity prices have been another disruptive factor in the past few years. Protectionism is directly related to economic power. Six years of external debt have condemned the majority of those countries to a pathetic and hopeless effort, especially in Latin America, where they are beginning to speak of a lost decade. We are seriously concerned about the grievous situation in Latin America, where the burden of debt servicing and the unpredictability of financial flows for development have turned the countries of the region into net exporters of capital, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in international economic relations.\nWhile addressing the subject of the debt of these middle-income countries, I should like to recall the words of the Spanish Prime Minister a few days ago, when he addressed the Governors of the Central Banks of Latin America and the Philippines:\n\\\"Facts show that the present strategy to solve the debt crisis 1 unable to provide for a timely solution of the outstanding problems.\\\"\nLet us face the truth. We need to reconsider the strategy, now that public opinion and the banking situation are favourable. The problem must be dealt with multilaterally within the framework of the international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a consensus being reached with regard to interest capitalization and the reduction of the debt burden. The resulting financial margins could be used in support of the necessary adjustment policies that must continue to be implemented.\nWith regard to the least-developed countries, we shall carefully study the proposals of the Toronto summit meeting. We are also ready to participate actively in the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, to be held in Paris in 1990, at which financial issues will undoubtedly be of special relevance.\nI have previously mentioned the link between the external debt of developing countries and the evolution of commodity prices. Despite the recovery of some commodity markets, the majority of commodity prices are still below 1980 levels. Here, the foreseeable entry into force of the Common Fund for Commodities could give rise to hope.\nIn the face of the protectionist pressures that have surfaced in international trade, the progress made in the present Round of multilateral trade negotiations, launched by the Punta del Este declaration in 1986, is also an encouraging sign. Despite present difficulties, we cannot afford to let this Round end in failure. We hope that, with the necessary political will, the review of progress achieved, scheduled to take place at the ministerial meeting next December in Montreal will be a valuable and positive contribution to the ultimate success of the Uruguay Round. \nFinally, the efforts and determination of the United Nations to alleviate the most urgent problems have been outstanding. In this connection the funds and specific programmes are especially relevant, among them the United Nations Development Programme, which continues to work effectively in assisting developing countries. Spain is determined to continue to increase its voluntary contributions to the funds for and programmes of operational activities for development.\nAs we all know, the African continent is now facing one of the most difficult and agonizing development problems in the world. This General Assembly session marks an important turning point in the assessment of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. The nucleus of the Programme of Action contains the twofold commitment made by both the African countries and the international community. On the one hand Africa must lay the foundations for stable development and sustained growth through structural adjustments and improvements in its economic policies, and on the other the international community must substantially increase its assistance and adopt initiatives in support of the African efforts. Although it is true that in the short term neither commitment has had any visible results, it is also true that with a medium-term programme such as this there must be enough time for it to become properly established.\nSpain will continue to assist African countries, both multilaterally through its participation in the conventions and programmes of the European Economic Community, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and the United Nations agencies, and bilaterally through co-operation agreements with individual African countries.\nWhen speaking of development it would be inexcusable not to mention the dangers inherent in ecological imbalances. It is urgently necessary for all of us, but most especially the industrialized countries, to do everything possible to preserve the environment, with a view to ensuring a more habitable world for future generations. The Brundtland report and the measures subsequently taken have been fundamental in this connection.\nOne of the fields in which the work of the United Nations has been most innovative and successful is the promotion and protection of human rights. Thanks to this Organization's efforts, the international community now has a large number of legal instruments in which basic human rights are defined and the necessary mechanisms established for their control and defence. The initial corner-stone of this imposing edifice is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the fortieth anniversary of which we shall be celebrating in December. Its few brief articles comprise a resounding reaffirmation of faith in the value and dignity of every human being, and of the principle laid down in the Charter that universal respect for human rights is the concern of all peoples and Governments. The best proof of the great moral and legal value of the Declaration is the way it has influenced many constitutions and national legislations, as well as the international legal system that it has been drawing up over the past few decades, from the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to the recent Convention against torture, which my country ratified in October last year.\nThe Spanish Government is convinced that we must continue to advance resolutely along this path. The situation in many countries shows, regrettably, that we are still a long way from being able to feel satisfied. We believe that from now on our efforts, without forgetting the drawing up of new legal instruments aimed at perfecting the current international system and filling its possible gaps, should be directed above all towards the application and development of existing ones and the effective monitoring of their observance. A good way of making progress is through the world information campaign on human rights, which the Secretary-General has proposed should be launched on the anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration.\nThree years ago the Assembly took an important step when it condemned unanimously and unequivocally all acts, methods and practices of terrorism where so ever and by whomsoever committed. The bodies and agencies of this Organization must now continue to advance along the path opened up at that time and design a strategy for combating terrorism in their respective fields of action. The initiatives aimed at reinforcing international protection for civil aviation and promoting security at sea have our whole-hearted support. The terrorist threat has acquired universal proportions and the efforts to eradicate it must also be universal.\nThe Organization's work in the social field also deserves to be mentioned. The process of drawing up an international convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs will no doubt be concluded in December. Its entry into force will enable the international community to deal effectively with a problem of universal dimensions whose repercussions, given the ramifications which link the illicit traffic in narcotics to activities such as arms traffic and terrorism, and whose solution depends on close and resolute international co-operation. The speed and determination with which work is proceeding towards the conclusion of the convention shows the international community's awareness of this issue.\nAt the beginning of my statement I said that this was a particularly promising time for the United Nations. However, there is a shadow threatening the work of the Organization - that of the financial crisis which for three years now has been hovering over its daily work as a result of the unjustifiable failure of some Member States to fulfil their obligations under the Charter. During that time, significant efforts have been made to make better use of existing resources. Progress has been made also with regard to substantive issues, such as the decision-making process in budgetary matters and the beginning of a review of the necessary, although complex, restructuring of the economic and social sectors. I should like to call on all the countries represented here to do their utmost to meet their financial obligations to our Organization and to co-operate in introducing, at this particularly felicitous time, the adjustments needed to speed up and rationalize its operation and make it more flexible.\nYear after year, as autumn comes to New York, we meet in this Assembly in a long-established ritual in which speeches are delivered, meetings are held and agreements are negotiated. This time we all have the impression that this exercise, which goes on quietly throughout the year, can be, and is, successful. We know very well from experience that what is happening is not the result of ineluctable fate, but that, rather, we are facing issues created by men, now or in the past, and that those issues must be solved by men, now or in the future. In any event, we are more responsible than ever before because we are better informed and have more resources than ever before.\nAncient Stoic wisdom consisted in knowing what depends on us and what does not depend on us. Now nearly everything depends on us, both the problems and their solutions. We are finding the solutions, and we shall continue to find them, not with less dialogue but with more dialogue, not with less justice but with more justice and not with less freedom but with more freedom; and, starting with this Assembly, which has now become so encouraging, we shall do so not with less hope but with more hope. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to associate myself with previous speakers in offering to Ambassador Caputo my warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am confident that, under his guidance the work of the Assembly will be carried out efficiently and with authority.\nI should also like to extend to his predecessor, the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Peter Florin, our gratitude for the exemplary way in which he conducted the work of the forty-second session \nLet me also pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr, Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the outstanding way in which he has directed the work of the United Nations and for his tireless efforts to achieve international peace and security. Those tireless efforts have resulted in the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the peace-keeping forces and have greatly contributed to the resolution of certain regional conflicts in the period since the last session of the General Assembly. I refer, in particular, to the Gulf, where the event that has been awaited for so long has come about - the cessation of the hostilities between Iraq and Iran. The acceptance by Iran of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the opening of negotiations between the two countries augurs well for peace between them.\nMauritania has always worked to put an end to this deadly, destructive war between two fraternal Muslim peoples. We sincerely hope that comprehensive, just and lasting peace will be established between them so that they may at last be able to live in harmony and devote their efforts to progress and well-being. This perseverance has also produced results in Afghanistan, with the signing of the Geneva agreements last April. Mauritania welcomes the signing of those agreements and the withdrawal of foreign troops and hopes that the process that has been started under United Nations auspices can speedily restore peace and concord to the people of Afghanistan and an independent and non-aligned State.\nIn Western Sahara, the process of joint good offices started by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity has made an important step forward with the submission by the Secretary-General of a peace plan to the two parties to the conflict. Mauritania supports these efforts and particularly welcomes the agreement in principle brought about in this area as well as the progress made thus far towards a just and lasting political settlement of that fratricidal conflict. The final solution of this problem will contribute greatly towards building the Greater Arab Maghreb, to which all the peoples of the region profoundly aspire. It was to that end that the Heads of State of the region met, for the first time since their independence, in Algiers last June to prepare favourable conditions leading to the Greater Arab Maghreb. This was a historic event which established the main guidelines for the integration and construction of a united Greater Maghreb. At the present time, various meetings are taking place to implement this political will which was clearly expressed by the Heads of State.\nMy country welcomes the relations between Libya and Chad and the good will both countries are showing with a view to normalizing (their relations.\nIn southern Africa the series of negotiations that have been taking place over the last few months opens new prospects for peace and in particular for the end of the illegal occupation of Namibia, Security Council resolution 433 (1978) remains the only acceptable basis for a just and lasting settlement of the Namibian question, for it embodies international legality and enjoys the support of the Namibian people and their legitimate representative, the South West Africa People's Organization.\nIn South Africa itself, the apartheid regime insists in its heinous policy and continues to inflict untold suffering on the black majority. It also continues to carry out acts of aggression against the front-line States.\nApartheid, that institutionalized system of racism and racial discrimination, is an affront to human dignity and a threat to international peace and security. It is the duty of all civilized nations to implement the strategy to oppose that system adopted by the United Nations, in particular the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions.\nMauritania fully supports that strategy and naturally supports the struggle of the people of South Africa, under the leadership of the African National Congress, to establish an egalitarian, democratic and non-racial society, just as it fully supports the heroic resistance of the front-line countries.\nIt was in that context that my Government was honoured to host, from 16 to 18 June last, the second preparatory meeting for an inquiry into apartheid. That important meeting, which was sponsored by the Heads of State, was attended by eminent personalities of world-wide repute for their devotion to the cause of human rights and democratic principles, and largely contributed to mobilizing international public opinion with respect to the odious system of apartheid and set the stage for entering an active phase to prepare for an international tribunal to be held next year.\nIn the Middle East, the Palestinian people chose the double anniversary of 40 years of partition and 20 years of occupation to remind the world that it cannot disregard the national rights of a people. Because of its scope and duration, the popular uprising in the occupied territories has shown the world the magnitude of the tragedy of the Palestinian people as well as its fierce determination to recover its land, its dignity and its inalienable rights, no matter what means are used by the Israeli war machine and the acts of inhuman repression carried out by the occupying forces.\nThe popular uprising has also shown the world that the Palestinian question is the cote of the Middle East conflict and that as long as the Palestinian people is deprived of its national rights, in particular its right to self-determination and the establishment of its own independent State, peace can never be established in that region. Any just and lasting solution requires the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories, including the holy city of Al-Quds. But the regime of Tel Aviv disregards all these facts and obstinately follows its policy of aggression and expansion, in contempt for international law. \nThe convening of an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation on an equal footing of all concerned parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is the sole, authentic representative of the Palestinian people, is the proper framework for finding a just and lasting solution to the conflict. The violence and repression that we witness in the occupied territories make the convening of such a conference increasingly urgent and constitute a new challenge for the United Nations, which must assume its full responsibility with respect to the Palestinian tragedy.\nIn Kampuchea, the search for a political settlement continues and the ongoing national dialogue holds much promise. The solution to that problem must be in keeping with the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, which reaffirm the need for the withdrawal of foreign troops from that territory and the right to self-determination of the Khmer people. In Central America, Mauritania sincerely hopes for the final restoration of peace on the basis of the recommendations of the Contadera Group and the Contact Group, as well as the Guatemala agreements signed last year by the five Heads of State of the region.\nTurning to the question of Korea, my country has always advocated the peaceful reunification of that peninsula in the interests of the Korean people as a whole. We support all efforts undertaken to that end.\nThe world economic situation is also a major item of profound concern to the international community. The gap between the developing and the developed countries continues to widen. The drop in commodity prices, the increasing debt-servicing burden and the re-emergence of protectionism and restrictions placed on the transfer of technology have had an especially severe impact on the developing countries. The stalemate in the North-South dialogue has prevented us from achieving agreed innovative solutions to ensure the recovery of the world economy and the development of the third-world countries.\nAware that they have the primary responsibility for the economic and social development of their peoples, the Governments of the developing countries have adopted important reforms and made large-scale adjustments but, because of the international economic climate, those actions have not led to the achievement of the goals that were set. Action must be co-ordinated at the international level, Africa, the least developed continent of the world, is particularly affected by the economic crisis. In an effort to confront this situation, the Organization of African Unity held an extraordinary summit conference in Addis Ababa, which undertook a clear analysis of the foreign-debt crisis in Africa, Mauritania is in full agreement with the joint African position on the convening of an international conference on the African external debt.\nOnly an overall, integrated strategy will enable us to resolve the African debt crisis and to give concrete form, at the same time, to the commitments undertaken by the international community in the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, In that regard, we appreciate the positive decisions taken at the last summit conference of the industrialized countries, particularly in regard to relieving the burden of debt of the developing countries, and we hope that these decisions will be extended and strengthened. In particular, we are deeply grateful to the Federal Republic of Germany, which has agreed to defer repayment of the whole of our large debt. We thank also those countries that are prepared to take similar measures to help our country.\nThe scourges of drought and desertification are still a serious threat to the Sahelian region, of which Mauritania is a part. In October 1978 another disaster occurred. I am speaking of the pilgrim locust, which has great mobility and destroys everything in its paths crops, pastureland, date palms, and so forth. In order to deal with this scourge, which specialists agree will continue to afflict us for several years, various meetings of west African and Maghreb countries have been convened to co-ordinate the policies of the various States and to advocate common action. My country, which is particularly affected by this infestation, has combined its national efforts with the international efforts.\tI also thank here the friendly countries and the international organizations for the aid they have already supplied as well as for their sensibility to Mauritania's concerns.\nThese natural disasters and the international economic crisis require exceptional financial efforts by my country, in a particularly difficult economic situation. Since 1985, despite these conditions, my Government has been engaged in a broad programme of economic reforms and structural adjustments. Significant progress has already been made in economic and financial recovery, but these results cannot minimize the scope of the efforts that must still be made to satisfy our countries. That is why the consolidation of the development strategies and programmes implemented in recent years in conformity with the Lagos Plan of Action and priority programme for African recovery is a major concern. Accordingly, my Government has just adopted a three-year programme of consolidation and recovery, which will be submitted soon to our economic partners. But, basically, we ate relying on ourselves.\nOur development policy is based primarily on mobilizing all our energies. In that context, our national leadership, our national leadership, headed by Colonel Maaouya Quid Sid'Ahmed Taya, President of the Military Committee of National Salvation and Head of State, on 12 December 1984 chose to establish a State of law, in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed to all the citizens. Thus, a process of teal democratization has been undertaken. The communal experience having been extended to all areas of the country, this year municipal councils will be set up at the local and city levels. The purpose of these elections is democratic participation, which will enable the people to take part directly in development activities. In that connection, the rural sector occupies a major place. That is why the Government has given it priority by allocating 36.5 per cent of public investments to it and encouraging the private sector to carry- out hydro-agricultural projects involving the free distribution of land and a guaranteed return from production.\nThe major economic and financial problems facing the international community show the great urgency of releasing additional resources for development. It is only common sense that this should be done at the expense of the arms race, given the flagrant disproportion that now exists between resources allocated for military expenditures and those devoted to development assistance. Indeed, it is intolerable that enormous human, financial, natural and technological resources should continue to be consumed by the arms race at a time when poverty is the daily lot of more than two thirds of mankind. That is why we emphasize the need to link disarmament and development - a link that was established by the international conference on this subject held last year.\nIn that regard, we welcome the conclusion by the United States and the Soviet Union of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, as well as its verification clauses. But it is only a beginning, and international peace and security - that is, the survival of the human race - can be brought about only through general and complete disarmament. Without that, we cannot imagine that mankind can survive on the earth.\nToday's world is at a crossroads. It has to meet many challenges, in particular the persistence of armed conflicts and hotbeds of tension everywhere, as well as the arms race and the unfair distribution of wealth. Unfortunately, despite great progress in science and technology, the world is still unable to ensure well being and prosperity for all. That is an intolerable situation.\nWe must all understand that nations are interdependent. We must understand the magnitude of the problems facing mankind. The United Nations offers us the only multilateral framework in which to channel all our efforts. It is an instrument that is indispensable to peace and international co-operation. The United Nations has an enormous potential that can be mobilized and used to achieve the noble ideals laid down in the Chatter. This is demonstrated by the progress being made in the political solution of major regional conflicts on which until recently no progress had been made. The Member States, particularly the great Powers, have historical responsibilities in that connection.\nMauritania expresses again its faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter and will continue to work to improve and strengthen our Organization's role. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff I should like first of all to express Haiti's deep gratitude to the countries of our region for the invaluable support they have given us, both morally and diplomatically, in recent weeks. We are particularly grateful to the delegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis and our neighbours on the former island of Hispaniola, our brothers of the Dominican Republic, with whom we share not only geography but a common future in our two peoples' constant pursuit of dreams of peace, pluralistic and liberal democracy with a human face, based on social justice, freedom and fraternity. \nI am particularly happy, on behalf of the government and people of Haiti, to extend to the President our warm congratulations and wishes for success on the occasion of his election to preside ewer the General Assembly at its forty-third session. We should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President, Ambassador Peter florin of the German Democratic Republic,  hose prestige and remarkable talents as a moderator enhanced the proceedings of last year's session.\nWe are happy also to associate ourselves with the tribute paid to our Secretary-General, His Excellency Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his efforts on behalf of peace and the promotion of the ideals of the United Nations in its role as the conscience of humanity. Is it not, indeed, the vitalising source - even the special source - of the great achievements in the field of human rights in the twentieth century? Does it not also contribute to support for the community of nations as it moves towards a better world where dialogue and agreement will take the place of confrontation? The recent successes that have been scored - successes that augur well for a fruitful forty-third session of the General Assembly - emphasize once again that the Organisation remains, in the bleakest times, the last bastion of the equal sovereignty of States and the right of peoples to self-determination and, finally, the special place where the people's most precious hopes are placed, at this end of the century, for a future of peace, justice and international co-operation.\nThe course of events has recently highlighted a clear lessening of tensions in certain regions of the world. Nevertheless, there are still many hotbeds of crises and many challenges that are of concern to the international community.\nThe most striking and most pernicious case is without any doubt, in our view, that of South Africa, where the system of apartheid persists. Once again we raise our voice to say no - a thousand times no - to that regime of infinite degradation, exploitation and misery. It is essential that everything be done to put an end to that unspeakable regime and thereby do away with this serious threat to international peace and security.\nOn the same subject, we are following with the greatest interest the progress of the talks designed to end the illegal occupation of Namibia. This is a time to reaffirm our solidarity with and support for the courageous Namibian people, who are struggling, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) - their sole, legitimate representative - to break the hated yoke of colonial, racist oppression. \nContinuing to refer to Africa, we were very much encouraged by the results of the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations which led to the Geneva agreement of 30 August 1988. That is clearly a large step in the right direction taken by Morocco and POLISARIO. We cannot but encourage them to continue on that course, because we are convinced that, given the good faith of the parties and the political will, the people of Western Sahara will finally be able freely to exercise their right to self-determination.\nIn the Middle East, the establishment of the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the opening of bilateral negotiations in Geneva give us reason to hope that the peace process has really begun and that it will lead to a mutually satisfactory solution.\nOn the other hand, we deeply deplore the wave of violence that continues to claim so many victims in the occupied territories. Nevertheless, we feel some optimism about the future because of the prospects for an indispensable dialogue between all the parties, which could finally lead to the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In that regard, we support the principle of an international conference on the Middle East to lay the foundations for an overall settlement that would take simultaneously into account Israel's inalienable right to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries and the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination, including the right to a homeland.\nSo far as Lebanon is concerned, we endorse anything that can restore peace, beginning with the withdrawal of all foreign forces, which is a pre-condition for the restoration of the Lebanese people's sovereignty and national and territorial integrity. \nWith regard to South-East Asia, ,e continue to give our full support to the constant efforts by the United Nations to find a negotiated solution in the case of Kampuchea as well as that of Afghanistan. Moreover, we continue to place our hopes in the reunification of the Korean nation and we offer our support to any initiative that could contribute to achieving that peacefully. \nThe solution to the problems of Central America can be found only by the peoples of the region themselves. That is the real meaning of the Arias plan, which we are pleased to support unreservedly. We regret, however, that the dialogue which has begun has not yet produced all the expected results.\nWe state again our conviction that there is an indissoluble link between disarmament and development, which are the undisputed bases of international peace and security. Today the expenditure on over-armament activities can be counted only in the thousands of billions of dollars - even after the recent Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - whereas a part of those resources could have been advantageously reinvested in meeting human and social needs and, moreover, would have increased the security of all.\nThe Republic of Haiti protests against the practice of making the third-world countries the dumping grounds for toxic wastes from the Northern countries. It strongly condemns this new form of aggression and supports the idea of an international convention on the prohibition of and punishment for such acts.\nFinally, in response to the wishes of national public opinion, the Government of the Republic of Haiti intends to struggle tirelessly against the illicit traffic in drugs and is willing to accept any assistance that nay be given by the countries with some experience in this field.\nMy country, which is classified among the least developed countries, cannot fail to note that, despite the strength of the economic recovery in the industrialized countries, the gap separating the North from the South continues to widen dangerously. In view of that situation, which is of the greatest concern, it appears quite legitimate far our peoples, the producers of raw materials, to wonder how they can again have the conditions of sustained and balanced growth when the fall in the prices of their commodities increases year after year and their external debt weighs heavily on their export capacities and compromises their prospects for investment. \nWe are convinced that it is urgently necessary to infuse dynamism into official development assistance and make it more accessible. We feel that it is also indispensable to set up a new international order able to respond to the expectations of the least favoured countries through the effective democratization of international economic relations. Finally, we believe that the debtor countries should be given an opportunity, over and above their debt servicing, to meet honourably the obligations arising out of the social, political and economic contract that binds their Governments to their peoples. In that way the right of those peoples to the minimum well-being that Saint Thomas Aquinas said was necessary to the practice of virtue may be effectively taken into account.\nWe turn now to the situation in our country following the major political events which have taken place recently, and we wish to testify to the hopes that have been aroused by the democratic renewal in all social sectors of our population. The Haitian people has just given striking new proof of its powerful attachment to freedom. Two years ago, on 7 February 1986 , this people clearly indicated to the world the forcefulness of its democratic instincts and its unshakeable courage in the face of the burden of bankruptcy, an economy in ruins and social and political structures un-adapted to the challenges of the end of our century. In the enthusiasm of that time, a powerful desire for national reconstruction was born. Thus in the Constitution of 1987 we adopted a new charter of rights and freedoms that defined the main outline of a new social contract and a legal framework on which the institutions for guaranteeing Haitian democracy were to be founded.\nUnfortunately, our hard apprenticeship in the cause of freedom did not go forward uneventfully. Through one upheaval after another the country was plunged once more into a climate of violence and confusion in which suddenly the freedoms achieved and the victories in our struggle were again jeopardized. In that context the already precarious economic situation could not but worsen and social disorder increase. It was clear that we were moving towards the collapse of a regime that was incapable of undertaking the expected reforms and meeting the needs of the rural and urban masses.\nFrom the depths of the abyss, the Haitian army once again, in the face of our national peril, responded on 17 September, to the appeal of our country. It was guided solely by the need to defend the higher interests of our nation and by its faith in the dynamics of lasting structural change in laying the foundations of democracy in Haiti once and for all. Thus a new Government was formed in which the entire country could see its views reflected. It is a consensus Government, desirous above all of the common good and national dignity. It is determined to gather together all political trends, all schools of thought and all Haitians of goodwill, without exception, so as to seize the opportunity of establishing once and for all the foundations of genuine democracy that will put an end to the structural instability of power in Haiti and prevent any return to dictatorship.\nThe nation has rediscovered its true nature and the State its authority. We see the new Government, in full agreement with the desires of the people, resolutely embarked on the course of necessary change, aiming to bring the people out of its period of transition to assume responsibility for its destiny through elections that at last will be free and honest, in a climate o\u00a3 representative democracy irreversibly founded on a multi-party system, respect for essential freedoms, the inviolability of the rights of the human person, and social justice. \nTo that end the 1987 Constitution, which was adopted by a large Majority, will be restored, with the changes that the people, in its sovereignty, may feel it necessary to make to it. The institutions that it had defined to ensure the proper working of the Haitian society will be re-established to meet a twofold challenge - the modernisation of our political structures and the invigoration of our economy. From now on, Haiti turns a new face to the world. Freedoms - I mean all freedoms - are guaranteed; the political parties are re-emerging; justice is resuming its rights; those who were forced to flee the country are coming back; and, above all and for the first time since 7 February 1986, a democratic dialogue has begun among all political trends and schools of thought and the Government, in a desire for complete national reconciliation, without which the reconstruction battle would be compromised from the outset.\nIn the present circumstances there is only one possible policy that aimed at giving a lasting foundation to a regime of law and freedom end attacking the structural causes of absolute poverty. Those two courses are closely linked and inseparable. It is clear that it is impossible to exercise political rights in any meaningful way without full enjoyment of economic and social rights, and to that end we must tackle without further delay the major problems which the Haitian economy is now facing and which call for urgent medium- and long-term solutions. \nThe grave deterioration of the physical environment as a result of the deforestation and erosion compounding the desertification of our country, deficiencies in the machinery of production and the uncertainty of Income, particularly in the rural areas, are factors behind the complete halt in economic growth, while population growth is about 1.5 per cent.\nIt must also be emphasised that as a result of socio-political troubles during the period 1986-88 the problem of employment has only worsened, making the socio-economic situation of the needy sectors of our population even more difficult in a country that already had a highly alarming rate of unemployment.\nAnother point to be stressed is the burden of financial difficulties, which have been aggravated by the freeze on international assistance for a year now. That is compounded by the considerable material damage caused by hurricane Gilbert.\nIn short, the past eight years have been characterised by a serious, constant decline in production, employment and the level and quality of life in Haiti. We fear that the 1980s may be a lost decade for development unless energetic, timely action, strongly supported by the international community is taken to help what is the only least developed country in the Americas to break this vicious circle of underdevelopment. In this regard, the statement of the Episcopal Conference of Haiti on the events of 17 September this year was unambiguous. It reads: \\\"We beg you, the international organisations, to continue the assistance given to this country. But in the present circumstances we address an urgent appeal to you to increase aid for the development of our people,\\\"\nIn its programme of action the Government has set itself a three-part target - the establishment of a regime of freedom and human dignity, economic growth and social development - in a climate of exceptional economic difficulties. That is why we make an urgent appeal to the whole international community, friendly countries and the specialized agencies of the United Nations to mobilize the necessary resources to permit a return to sustained growth in Haiti after years of stagnation.\nIn this regard, we believe that the proposals, recommendations and continents in resolution 39/196 of 17 December 1984, concerning a special United Nations programme for assisting Haiti, could be updated and their content could be expanded to enable our country to tackle its most urgent problems, overcome its many handicaps and deal with the structural problems that have all too often been neglected in the past.\nWe hope above all that with mutual respect and trust Haiti's partners will work to ensure the implementation of that decisive plan of action, which the people of Haiti believes it has a right to count on, if it is to achieve by the year 2000 a level of economic, social and cultural development compatible with fundamental human rights and the requirements of human dignity.\nFoe our part, we shall spare no effort. That was the gist of the message of the President of the Republic, Lieutenant General Prosper Avril, when he said at the inauguration of the Cabinet:\n\\\"The task is immense and cannot be put off. Let us begin it immediately, making it a point of honour that the true foundation of our legitimacy should be the extent of our services to the community. Today a man of good will is stretching out his hand towards other men of good will; a chain of solidarity must be formed and made longer and longer, stronger and stranger, so that Haiti nay live and make progress.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, I am particularly happy to express our most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\nHis outstanding personal Qualities and deep knowledge of international issues augur well for the success of his work in discharge of the important responsibilities entrusted to him by the General Assembly. We may be assured of the complete readiness of our delegation to co-operate with him for the success of our deliberations.\nI would also wish to extend to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, all our thanks and appreciation for the dedication he brought to his mandate in the course of the last session during a difficult period in the history of the United Nations\nOur Organization has reached the years of full maturity, strengthened by the experience acquired over its 43 years of existence and tempered by the tests it has undergone in the midst of profound upheaval on the international scene since its establishment. The United Nations, which began a process of reform over two years ago, may well be proud today of the decisive and significant results achieved.\nIn this respect I should like to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General, who has spared neither his time nor his energy to ensure the continuity of the work of the United Nations in spite of the financial crisis, while making it perform more efficiently and effectively. Of course any social entity must be ready to respond at all times to the demands of its environment, and in this respect reform will remain an ongoing concern. But it is also up to us, as Member States, to abide by the rules of the game we agreed to and the decisions arising therefrom.\nThis attitude is necessary more than ever now that a climate of harmony, d\u00e9tente and openness is emerging and real prospects are taking shape for the settlement of many international crises in respect of which the United Nations , already involved, will necessarily be called upon to play an increasingly important role in the finding of solutions  guaranteeing and implementing them in such a context, characterized by agreement and dialogue, with respect for the fundamental principles of the Charter, everyone is becoming aware of the irreplaceable role of the United Nations as a centre for harmonizing efforts towards shared goals.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, which, throughout the sessions of the General Assembly and the work of the United Nations, has always demonstrated a pragmatic and responsible approach, strongly supports the Secretary-General's appeal, in his report of 14 September 1988, for avoidance of rhetorical inflation in General Assembly debates and the adoption of ineffective, stock resolutions, and for the strengthening of the essential effectiveness of the Security Council through the- unreserved support of all Member States for its decisions on given disputes, by simply accepting a text but supporting it resolutely at the diplomatic level.\nWe must not lose sight of the fact that all these mechanisms which have to reconcile diverging interests, must be based on the ethical foundation that is the guarantee of the durability of the Organization - that is, the upholding and safeguarding of dignity and the fundamental rights of the human person.\nIt is our duty, as we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the universal Declaration of Human Rights, to work together in all international bodies to guarantee the development of man's full potential, eliminate all discrimination, condemn unreservedly the odious crime of apartheid, and denounce violations of human dignity of any kind.\nThe remarkable contribution of the United Nations to the establishment of the conventional and institutional framework for the definition of, and respect for, human rights must be accompanied by the widest possible support for international covenants, so that there may be full observance of the universal humanist values that are the foremost prerequisite for and the objective of peace.\nThe unbridled arms race and the continued development of weapons of mass destruction constitute a danger to international peace and security and threaten the very survival of mankind. This is why the international community, which noted with satisfaction the conclusion by the two major Powers, in December 1987, of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is justified in expecting that other agreements will be reached, especially in connection with strategic weapons and denuclearisation, in order to preserve whole regions from the danger of nuclear confrontation.\nWe regret that the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament held last June did not achieve the expected results. We hope that none the less it contributed to enabling the big Powers to reduce strategic weapons and promoting the early adoption of appropriate rules and mechanisms for the prohibition of the production and use of chemical weapons, and the destruction of existing stockpiles.\nThe building of a peaceful and just society undoubtedly depends on the efforts of all countries, regardless of size or strength, and on the commitment of all concerned to take additional measures, in a spirit of solidarity, to prevent conflicts, extinguish hotbeds of tension rapidly and establish relations of good-neighbourliness on a stable and mutually advantageous basis.\nMy country, which works unceasingly for the peaceful settlement of disputes and the development of co-operation at the bilateral, regional and international levels, welcomes the new spirit that inspires this session and the favourable atmosphere in which it is taking place.\nThe well-deserved award of the Noble Peace Prize to the United Nations forces and observers is timely confirmation of the expanding role of the Organization and the recognition of its efforts towards the establishment of peaceful, just international relations. We commend the sacrifices made and the courage shown by the missionaries of peace, and we hope that, as their field of activity widens, they will be given the unanimous support of the international community so they may discharge their noble task in the best possible conditions.\nFor the past eight years a conflict of exceptional violence has left two brother Muslim countries - Iraq and Iran - in mourning. Throughout these years we have appealed from this rostrum, and in other international forums for a cessation of hostilities so that the conditions may be created for a constructive dialogue and a final settlement of this crisis. My country therefore welcomed with great satisfaction and relief the Secretary-General's announcement, on 20 August, of the cease-fire and its acceptance by the two parties. With the unanimous and sustained support of the Security Council, Mr. Perez de Cuellar was succeeded, through his intensive mediation efforts, in bringing to an end one of the most devastating conflicts since the Second World War, thus paving the way for appropriate discussion of all outstanding problems and to the working out of a just, honourable and lasting settlement.\nThe withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan was the prerequisite for genuine national reconciliation and for the assumption by that country of control over its own future. Thanks to the patient work and constant readiness of the Secretary-General, that is, day by day, becoming a reality. The process of good offices set in motion, and the political will shown by the parties, made possible the conclusion of the Geneva Accords, on 14 April 1988, guaranteed by the two big Powers. We are convinced that the implementation of that agreement in good faith and under the supervision of the United Nations will be the prelude to a new era in Afghanistan, in which that suffering country will be able to heal its wounds and begin the crucial work of reconstruction and development, to the benefit of its entire population. We hope, therefore, that in the near future Afghanistan will be able to resume the place it had always held in the Islamic community.\nThere are some glimmers of hope in other regions of the world. These must be encouraged and supported to make possible the beginning of the peace process and the removal of all obstacles to the self-determination of the peoples concerned.\nThis is the case with regard to the Brazzaville talks, the aim of which is the creation of conditions conducive to the prompt implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1987), which concerns the peace plan for Namibia. Pending the successful conclusion of these talks, we shall continue to give our full support to the Namibian people in seeking the fulfilment of its legitimate aspiration to independence and unity.\nWe are also pleased that there has been substantial progress towards ensuring the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Angola. But the stability and security of that brother country can be definitively guaranteed only through true national reconciliation. Morocco, which has spared no effort to that end, will continue to work side by side with other brother African countries towards a settlement, through dialogue, of the problems that remain between the parties to the conflict in Angola.\nIn Asia, the Jakarta meeting last July, convened at the initiative of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, for the first time  tabled all the parties directly involved in the question of Kampuchea to meet. It is important that these efforts be continued to get under way a comprehensive political solution by organizing the withdrawal of foreign troops and, thereby ensuring that the Kampuchean people has control of its own destiny.\nIn Cyprus, the mission of good offices gave both parties the framework for the constructive dialogue that began in Nicosia last month, the purpose of which was to smooth out the difficulties that were still pending and to arrive at a global and mutually acceptable settlement plan. This new breakthrough in favour of peace will, we hope, be the first step towards harmonious relations between the two Cypriot communities.\nWith regard to Central America, the Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its support for the action taken by the Contadora Group and the plan proposed by President Arias of Costa Rica to enable the region at last to enjoy peace and stability, free from any foreign interference.\nUnfortunately, these happy breakthroughs towards peace did not benefit the Middle East, a region which for more than 40 years has been shaken by a cycle of violence and war though it is of crucial importance to the balance and stability of the world.\nWhile the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories is essential, no lasting peace will come about in that region of the world without the recognition of the Palestinian people's right to an independent State. That people is experiencing the tragedy of occupation, exile and deprivation of its most fundamental rights. To the poignant appeal of the Palestinians for justice, Israel has responded so far only by increasing repression, imprisonment, expulsion and assassination. Now that all energies are focused on the peaceful solution of conflicts and the safeguarding of the rights of the human communities concerned, it is unacceptable that the tragic fate of the Palestinian people should be ignored and the future of its children be at \u0430 total impasse.\nIt is no wonder therefore that this generation of despair has no alternative but daily to face danger, unarmed, in order to affirm in the eyes of the world its right to freedom and to an independent homeland. The intifada, which has lasted almost a year now in the occupied Palestinian territories, should awaken us to the urgent need for a solution to this crisis, which is gaining in intensity and cruelty with each passing day. Every effort should be made to hold an international conference on the Middle East as soon as possible, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people.\nThe tragic situation prevailing in the Middle East did not spare Lebanon, which, because of foreign interference, was plunged into disarray, instability and the horrors of civil war. The Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its solidarity with the Lebanese people  for the safeguarding of its territorial integrity, national unity and sovereignty. My country calls for the cessation of all foreign interference which represents a real threat of partition for this Arab land, once a model of tolerance and coexistence among communities and religions.\nBecause of its geopolitical location the Kingdom of Morocco attaches great importance to the stability and security of the Mediterranean. Our constant concern to see this area freed from the nuclear threat by the elimination of missiles on naval fleets in the Mediterranean is therefore understandable. We remain convinced however that the development of harmonious relations between the two shores is a necessary element in the establishment of genuine regional peace and security. For that reason the Mediterranean policy of my country stresses co-operation with Europe and so last April Morocco signed agreements with, the European Economic Community (EEC) following its expansion to include Spain and Portugal. It is undeniable, however, that this relationship, which we should like to be an exemplary one, will not come to fruition without an abatement in some of the sources of tension remaining in the Mediterranean.\nThus it is important to resolve the dispute concerning the enclaves of Sebta and Mellilia and other Moroccan islands and islets under Spanish occupation, in order to prevent this anachronistic situation - remnant of a past era - from affecting the harmony that should preside over the relations between the two shores of the Straits of Gibraltar. We are convinced that the recent agreements, signed at bilateral and EEC levels, will facilitate the settlement of these territorial disputes in the mutual interest of the two countries. We in Morocco would like to preserve the manifold ties which throughout history have existed between the Moroccan and Spanish peoples.\nSecurity and development are indivisible. Unfortunately, in the field of development this decade has been one of disenchantment an   the failure of the North-South dialogue. Global negotiations to counter the crisis and bring about balanced economic growth did not go beyond statements and declarations.\nIn this regard, even though political stability in Africa hinges on real development and in particular on the settlement of the crucial debt problem, the special session devoted to that continent did not measure up to expectations.\n Standing as we are on the threshold of a new century, it is essential that we meet the unavoidable challenges facing us and focus all our energies on the establishment of global patterns of development that take account of existing complementary factors and fundamental needs in order to guarantee for all a decent quality of life based on respect for socio-cultural differences. While pursuing this great ambition we should, at the same time, seek urgent solutions to the most pressing problems. Therefore it is important to deal as soon as possible with the external debt crisis in its political, economic and social dimensions. This calls for an innovative strategy since the conventional approach based on annual rescheduling alone is proving to be ineffective.\nWhile acknowledging the merits of bilateral and multilateral initiatives taken in favour of low-income debtor countries, it is time to recognize the importance of reducing the outstanding debt and the debt servicing of medium-income debtor countries and of resolutely tackling the commercial debt of heavily indebted countries.\nIn this context, ray country supports the recent additional proposals made by His Highness Arair Jaber Al-Sabah of Kuwait, by President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and by Prime Minister Takeshita, aimed at alleviating the public and commercial debt burden.\nAt the same time, we must take advantage of the forthcoming multilateral talks, especially the Uruguay Round, to improve the international economic environment in the spheres of the flow of .net resources, trade and the stabilization and rising of commodity prices.\nMy country intends to shoulder its -share of the responsibility and make its contribution to the solution of problems at the regional and international levels. Thus, Morocco recently hosted the conferences of the Non-Aligned Movement on food and agriculture and on the foreign debt crisis, as well as the first meeting of African experts on geophysical threats in Africa. In order to mobilize all\nresources and involve the countries concerned in the struggle against the danger of locust infestation. His Majesty King Hassan II has taken the initiative in 'convening an international conference at a high level, which will be held in Morocco on 25 October. It is also on Morocco's initiative that the first ministerial conference on co-operation with regard to fisheries between African countries bordering on the Atlantic Ocean will be held at Rabat next March. We hope that these meetings, in addition to creating a spirit of solidarity, will make it possible to establish complete and lasting co-operation, especially in Africa.\nGiven the impasse in the North-South dialogue, co-operation and regional integration are increasingly felt to be a vital necessity. In the Maghreb, the building of a unified area is not a new idea; it is something that from the outset has been part of the struggle of our country for national liberation. Thus, in his statement in Tangiers in 1947, His Majesty Mohammed V appealed for the independence of Morocco within the framework of the unification of the Maghreb. Since its independence Morocco has worked unceasingly, with faith and determination, for the construction of a Maghreb whose peoples are united by ties of brotherhood, that stem naturally from their history, culture and shared religion and from their united struggle for liberation. We are pleased to be able to say that the Maghreb project is now gaining ground. Strengthened by our respective experiences, we are now making realistic, considered progress towards a regional integration that can be a source of co-operation and development and \u03b1 factor of stability and peace for the peoples of the Maghreb.\nThus, in June of 1988, for the first time since my country's independence, a summit meeting of five Maghreb! Reads of State was held in Algiers and agreed on the establishment of a Maghreb High Commission, which during its inaugural meeting distributed responsibilities equitably among the five countries of our region, each being responsible for a commission on the economic, financial, socio-cultural, institutional and human aspects of regional integration.\nA second session of the Maghreb High Commission will be held in Rabat at the end of this month in order to continue the already well advanced work of integrating the Maghreb.\nMorocco solemnly reaffirms its complete readiness to do all in its power to fashion at a steady pace a peaceful, united Maghreb that responds to the profound aspiration of our peoples.\nMy country is especially pleased by the climate of peace that has characterized inter-Maghreb relations over the past few months, in that the beneficial impact of this now is apparent with regard to the final settlement of the question of Western Sahara. I would remind members that as soon as Mr. Perez de Cuellar took the initiative of extending his good offices for the settlement of this question, we expressed our complete confidence in him and our determination to co-operate fully for the success of the process that he was preparing to undertake. This process has now made decisive progress. Thus, a technical Mission of the United Nations visited the region in November 1987 to gather at first hand all the necessary data for the establishment of a cease-fire and the organization of a referendum on self-determination.\nA decisive step was taken on 30 August last when the parties accepted the proposals made by the Secretary-General, in co-operation with the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). These proposals, which are based on the principles and the practice of the United Nations in this field, constitute a final settlement plan for the problem of the Sahara.\nThe plan provides for the appointment of a representative of the Secretary-General, the proclamation by the Secretary-General of a cease-fire, under the guarantee and supervision of United Nations Observers and verification by means of impartial and objective procedures of the persons entitled to participate in the referendum. Lastly, under the terms of this plan the referendum will be prepared and organized under the authority of the representative appointed by the Secretary-General for that purpose.\nWhen presenting his peace plan to the Security Council, on 20 September, the Secretary-General indicated that the progress achieved towards a settlement of the question of Western Sahara constituted\n\\\"a preliminary ... result, which it is extremely important to consolidate in order to preserve the momentum of the process.\\\" (S/PV.2S26, p. 8)\nMorocco, which attaches great importance to the establishment of a genuine climate of peace and trust in the region, welcomes the support given by the Security Council to the good offices mission by its adoption, on 20 September 1988, of resolution 621 (1988), in which the Security Council \\\"1. Decides to authorize the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative for Western Sahara;\n\\\"2. Requests the Secretary-General to transmit to it as soon as possible ' a report on the holding of a referendum for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara and on ways and means to ensure the organisation and supervision of such a referendum by the United Nations in co-operation with the Organization of African Unity.\\\"\nThe unanimous support of the Security Council for the proposals made by the Secretary-General in co-operation with the Chairman of the OAU is of great Importance. The good offices process has now entered its last and practical stage, leading in the near future to the establishment of the cease-fire and the organization of the referendum on self-determination. We were particularly pleased by the unanimity in the Security Council in adopting resolution 621 (1988). That unanimity is reflected in the extremely favourable way in which the entire International community has welcomed the Secretary-General's peace plan.\nSince the various regions of the world, through un unprecedented progress in cooperation, are well tuned to each other and simultaneously share the same emotions, it is time to emphasize the positive factors of unity and harmony. The United Nations provides us with a unique forum for the harmonization of views and the establishment of universal consensus, so long as unity of purpose prevails over the outdated reflexes of sterile distrust.\nThe current situation inevitably invites us to the dialogue and mutual understanding that led to the noble ideals which inspired the drafters of our Charter and which must now guide our approach to the evermore complex realities of our present world\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\nLet me first congratulate Mr. Caputo on his election as President of the General Assembly. His wisdom and experience will, I believe, make this a particularly productive session.\nIt is an honour to be here today speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the crucible of human hope for peace in a troubled world. I believe we are on the brink of a new age, one in which the differences that have divided us are becoming less important than the dangers we must face together. It is a new age in which concrete acts that make our world more secure must and can be matched by tangible commitments to reduce poverty in the developing world and protect our common environment.\nFor two generations the world has lived in the shadow of nuclear war, but today we meet at a time of significant achievement in arms control.\nThe Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles is a historic first step in arms reduction for which, I believe, we owe a great debt of gratitude to the courage and leadership of President Reagan of the United States of America and of General Secretary Gorbachev of the Soviet Union. They have laid a foundation, and we can now build upon it.\nWe must cut strategic weapons. We can limit the spread of nuclear weapons. We can limit nuclear testing, and every step in this direction takes us closer to a comprehensive test ban. We must redouble our efforts to reach a treaty banning chemical weapons.\nIn this respect, I welcome President Reagan's proposal for an early meeting of the signatories of the Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of chemical weapons. We must also control conventional weapons. Let us not forget that it is in conventional wars that people are still dying today. I encourage this Assembly to provoke and provide even more achievements in the field of disarmament. \nWe have also seen progress on regional security issues this past year, progress of which Member nations could only have dreamed in the past.\nIn Afghanistan, the attempt to impose solutions by invasion and occupation has failed, and the Soviet Union is withdrawing its forces. The United Nations remains heavily involved in the search for solutions. In the Gulf, no country has been able to impose its will by force. Representatives of the United Nations, including 500 Canadians, now patrol in peace where hundreds of thousands recently died in combat.\nCanada's role in these events is consistent with our long tradition - more than four decades - of peace-keeping, a role we have always willingly assumed. Canada has participated in every United Nations peace-keeping force since its foundation, and we are proud of this contribution, costly and difficult though it has often been, because we believe it has assisted in bringing stability to explosive regions of the world.\nToday a significant portion of our armed forces is either involved in peace-keeping around the world or training for further duty in the service of peace. The award today of the Nobel Peace Prize for peace-keeping is a splendid tribute both to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to those courageous men and women from all countries who patrol the world's danger spots in the pursuit of a durable peace. May I, on behalf of everyone, offer the Secretary-General our very sincere congratulations.\nBut not everywhere do we see the progress we would wish. The vicious cycle of repression and violence is unbroken in South Africa. We all know the cause: the massive and institutionalized violation of human rights called apartheid. Internationally, pressure is increasing and is having an impact. The entire world finds apartheid repugnant: the whole world must now join forces to bring it to an end. Canada has taken strong measures on its own to rid our civilization of this unique evil known as apartheid.\nWe are under no illusions about the effectiveness of our efforts alone, and so we have actively pursued objectives in co-operation with other Governments, especially in the Commonwealth and in Francophonie. From the outset we have applied all the sanctions agreed to within the Commonwealth we will continue to do so and we will seek to broaden their application, increase their effectiveness and encourage others to join in adopting and applying them.\nConsistent with our policy of moving systematically and deliberately to increase pressure on South Africa, our Government announced earlier this week specific new measures to tighten the ban on government contracts with South African companies and a further ban on high technology, together with initiatives designed to add practical support to peaceful efforts to work against apartheid. Because of threats to major development projects in the front-line States we intend to provide assistance, in concert with others, to preserve these development initiatives.\nThe movement in favour of human dignity is now irreversible. There can be no doubt that fundamental change will come to South Africa. The only questions are when and how and at what cost in human life. We must make sure the answers come soon, and peacefully - and that a framework is preserved that will give rise to a non-racial democratic South Africa. Only then will the children of Mandela know the gifts that freedom brings.\nThe problems of the Middle East have preoccupied this Assembly since the creation of the United Nations. Peaceful solutions have proved elusive, and in their absence violence and extremism have increased. But that is an argument for redoubled effort, not for despair. \nThere is today growing support for a properly structured international conference based on Israel's right to exist and recognition of the rights of Palestinians. Canada believes that such a conference can provide a path towards dialogue and away from a situation that appears to promise little but further suffering.\nSome regional conflicts continue to challenge our courage and imagination; but, in just a short period of time, progress towards a more peaceful world has been dramatic and deeply encouraging. Who would have predicted a year ago that today Soviet forces would be withdrawing from Afghanistan; that Vietnamese forces would begin withdrawing from Cambodia; that United Nations peace-keepers would be patrolling the Iran-Iraq border; that negotiations on Angola and on Western Sahara would be starting to beat fruit; that the Secretary-General would be discussing the independence of Namibia with the South African Government? \nThose who have doubted both the value of multilateralism and the United Nations surely must be reassessing their views today. The Secretary-General's recent report on the work of this Organization is a document which should inspire the deliberations of this Assembly.\nIn this dawning hope for peace, the path we ought to take is clear. It is towards conciliation and not confrontation between East and West. It is towards co-operation and generosity, not recrimination and rigidity, in North-South relations. It is towards negotiation, not warfare, in regional disputes. It is towards implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted 40 years ago.\nWe must give hope to those who today find their rights to free expression silenced by gunfire. We must provide sustenance to the flame of liberty in all regions where fundamental rights are being abused. He roust reinforce the role of the Security Council in the pursuit of peacemaking and peace-keeping around the world. It can be done, but only with the help of everyone in this Assembly.\nFor many generations the arms race, regional disputes and the threat of nuclear annihilation have been a central preoccupation of the United Nations, and so they will remain. But I believe that we are at a point in history when we must devote significantly more political energy to problems other than security, problems perhaps just as important but until now accorded a somewhat lower priority.\nI want to speak specifically about the twin challenges of severe poverty and our endangered environment. I believe we shall not have true security until these problems have been successfully resolved. These issues were high on the agendas of the summit meetings chaired last year by Canada - from the Commonwealth and la Francophonie to the Economic Summit Meeting in Toronto, at these meetings I found a growing conviction among national leaders that these problems can and must be tackled, and must be dealt with before, the end of this century. These problems command the same priority here in the United Nations.\nPoverty undermines security. It compromises equality. It denies hope. Today it is estimated that at least one billion people live in absolute poverty. They are hungry. They ate often sick. They are uneducated. They die young.\nAlleviating poverty must be given a new priority on national and international agendas. We must work to achieve social justice for the poorer t of our world and economic growth which does not destroy our magnificent environment.\nAt Toronto the leaders of the major industrialized countries renewed their commitment to work towards continued growth for the benefit of both the industrialized and, particularly, the developing countries. We are also working towards a trading system which is more open and more beneficial to all nations. I believe it will be strengthened bilaterally, as In the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, the largest commercial agreement in the history of two-way trade. It can also be strengthened regionally, as in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and in Europe as 1992 approaches.\nIt must be strengthened, too, through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and multilateral talks such as the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. Progress in those talks is essential at the GATT mid-term review to be held in Montreal this December.\nIncreased development assistance, especially to the poorest countries, is another imperative. Canada has just completed a review of its official development assistance policy. We have reset our bearings to improve the quality and increase the quantity of the help we give, to recognize the special role of women in development and to concentrate on the poorest people in the poorest countries.\nThat is why Canada has completely written off the official development assistance debts of a large number of countries. It is surely reasonable that loans given for development purposes should not be allowed to become hindrances to that same development. None of this is altruism. All countries North and South, rich and poor, have an equal stake in a world in which wealth must be more equitably shared. That is why out assistance programme is now composed entirely of grants. We have affirmed that Canadian assistance will continue to increase to reach the target of 0.6 per cent of gross national product by 1995 and the desired 0.7 per cent target by the year 2000 - now less than 12 years away.\nI can best illustrate the importance that we attach to the United Nations by pointing out that Canada is the fourth largest contributor to the United Nations system. Most of its contributions are directed towards development assistance. But Canadians generally feel that more could and should be done. Africa is a very special case. Canada has taken seriously its responsibilities under the United Nations Programme for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. In 1986-1987, Canada disbursed a total of almost 31 billion in Africa, through all channels, multilateral, bilateral and non-governmental. Nearly half of our bilateral assistance will be directed to Africa over the next five years. But poverty in Africa and elsewhere cannot be ended solely through trade and help from developed countries, although these are vital parts of any effective international programme. It will require as well sound national economic and development strategies, and the Governments of the developing countries have a very direct responsibility to their own people to achieve substantial progress.\nI have said that we must devote the energies freed by greater security to two equally pressing problems. One is poverty; the other is environmental protection. The world is facing an environmental crisis of unparalleled magnitude. Nature is sending us an urgent message that we ignore at our peril. The signs of this crisis are all around us; shortages of timber, exhausted soil, desertification, depleted fish stocks, seals dying in the North Sea, beluga whales washing ashore in the St. Lawrence River in Canada itself. Some even maintain that we have reached the point where the survival of mankind is at risk.\nThe Chairman of the World Commission on Environment and Development, Prime Minister Brundtland, has said that the threat to our environmental security is \\\"second only to nuclear war\\\". Now that we have lessened the likelihood of global nuclear war, we face invasion by rising seas, polluted air and encroaching deserts. \nThere is a growing awareness that the environment, the economy and human health are inextricably linked. At the same time as we in the North suffer the effects of our industrial society's lack of regard for the environment, the South suffers from the environmental degradation engendered by poverty, by population growth and by pressure for immediate economic development.\nDestruction of the rain forest in Brazil, deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa and the pollution of drinking water in the sprawling cities of the developing world are the consequences, the simple, direct and inevitable consequences, of people in poverty seeking the simple means to survive. Without improved development opportunities they cannot be expected to do other than search for fuel, shelter and livelihood as best they can. We must help them, with their co-operation and friendship, to protect these precious resources. We require a new era of economic growth, but we need growth that sustains and expands the resource capital of all the countries of this planet, not growth that poisons the air we breathe and the water we drink.\nAn aboriginal elder in Canada, speaking to a Canadian Government commission, said it best:\n\\\"We did not inherit the Earth - we only hold it in trust for our children.\\\"\nIn a world in which rivers and winds cannot be contained by laws or borders it is clear that domestic initiatives by themselves are inadequate. Canadians know all about this. Our economy, as well as our environment, is being damaged daily by acid rain. We have taken important internal measures to address the problem. We have urgently pressed our neighbour to follow suit and to conclude a treaty with us that would reduce the environmental damage from this blight by stated amounts within specific time-frames. But acid rain is not limited to one nation or one continent: it is an international problem and it demands, I believe, a viable international solution. The greenhouse effect, the deterioration of the ozone layer and the disposal of toxic wastes are causes for legitimate concern both here and around the world.\nI am encouraged by the strong emphasis given to the environment by others in this year's debate. Problems of environmental protection require strengthened international co-operation, and the United Nations has a key role to play.\nAs with security issues, important action has been initiated. The signature a year ago in Montreal of the Protocol on the protection of the ozone layer is a landmark example of what nations working together can accomplish. \u00cf urge all States which have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Protocol without delay. The increasingly urgent question of global warming and climate change received serious attention at the International Conference on the Changing Atmosphere in Toronto last June. Our goal should be an international framework convention for the protection of the atmosphere by 1992.\nWe applaud the work of the United Nations Environment Programme in developing a global convention on the trans-frontier movements of hazardous wastes. We hope that it will be ready for signature by Member States next year. This powerful momentum must be maintained and even strengthened. Other steps are needed.\nCanada is supporting a feasibility study on a world conservation bank to work in concert with the World Bank. Canada is asking the World Bank at its annual meeting in West Berlin to strengthen the integration of environmental concerns into the design and implementation of its own projects. \nCanada fully supports the holding of an environmental summit at the Heads of Government level. Canada urges all corporations and international industrial and trade associations to develop, strengthen and vigorously apply environmental codes of conduct.\nObviously, wealthier nations have to offer more assistance and greater support to help developing countries achieve growth which does not destroy their environment. And for that reason, the Canadian International Development Agency makes environmental protection one of its criteria for development projects. I want to announce today that Canada will establish a centre which will promote internationally the concept of environmentally sustainable development.\nThis centre will be located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and will work closely with the United Nations Environment Programme and other like-minded international institutions and organizations.\nCanada strongly supports the call for a United Nations conference on sustainable development in 1992.\nThe global challenges we face are great, but we are proving that they can be met and that they can be resolved.\nMankind is not destined to destroy itself. War is not inevitable. Poverty can be alleviated. The environment can be preserved. Injustices can be redressed.\nThe United Nations is not and never will be - ever - a perfect institution. But in the last few years the United Nations has proved that it can make needed reforms and emerge as a stronger and more effective body. We must continue to improve this irreplaceable Organization. Our citizens will judge the United Nations not by the rhetoric of which we are capable, but by the actions that we have achieved in the past and of which are capable again in the future, by our practical successes in working together. An immunization programme that saves children's lives in a developing nation is, in itself, an enduring monument to the profound value of this institution. And surely, there are enough such monuments around to persuade any objective observer of the profound and ongoing value of an institution that treats its Members on a basis of equality and mutual respect. Because now, as the international political climate improves, the United Nations can play the role intended in the Charter.\nLester Pearson, a great Canadian statesman who was present at the creation of this Organization, once observed that the United Nations is the \\\"living symbol of out interdependence, and embodies that emerging sense of international community, going beyond nation and region, which alone can save us in this nuclear age\\\".\nThe United Nations, in my judgement and in the judgement of my Government, reflects the vision of our predecessors and the hope for our children.\nThe agenda before the United Nations is compelling, and the choices are clears to manage the irresistible forces of change that swirl about us> to acknowledge the intimate interdependence of our world and of the issues before us; to ensure a more peaceful, more prosperous, more humane world, a world in which the strong nations are just, in which the rich nations are generous, a world in which all nations - all nations without exception - have the legitimate hope for greater economic and social justice, understanding as we all must that there is but one Earth for us to preserve for all of our children.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate the President on his election to guide the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I am confident that his wisdom and experience will contribute effectively to the achievement of the results we all seek through strenuous efforts to find constructive solutions to the problems of international peace and security through the co-operation of all the peoples of the world. My pleasure is all the greater because the President represents a country with which mine maintains positive and constructive co-operation.\nThe experienced leadership given by his predecessor at the forty-second session of the General Assembly earned him the gratitude and recognition it is now my pleasure to express.\nWe also wish to express our appreciation and thanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his distinguished service to our Organization in pursuance of the goals and political objectives of the Charter.\nWe are now witnessing hopeful international developments in the direction of dialogue and peaceful coexistence after a critical period of tension and confrontation. We join with the international community in hailing these welcome developments. We hope that this new atmosphere will help bring about just solutions to problems affecting many of the peoples of the world, f ere race t among which are problems such as regional wars, foreign occupation, denial of the rights of other peoples, external hegemony, economic exploitation, terrorism end degradation of the environment. It is encouraging to note the new awareness of the impasse reached in the arms race and, as a result, the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles between the United States and the Soviet Union. We also welcome the agreement on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, and the first steps taken towards solving the problem of Namibia, the Iran-Iraq war, and a number of other regional issues. We hope that this new awareness of the futility of military force will pave the way towards the settlement of other conflicts around the world and that the year 1988 will be the gateway to world peace.\nMy delegation salutes the popular uprising - the intifada - in the occupied territories of Palestine against the Fascist policies, encroachments and depredations of the Zionist entity in the holy places of Palestine, We strongly condemn the violent repressive measures, including deportation and the use of terrorist tactics practised by the Zionist entity against the unarmed Palestinian people, including women, children and the elderly.\nThe valiant resistance and steadfastness of the Palestinian people under occupation are the measure of its categorical rejection of the status quo imposed by Israel and of that people's Insistence on its right to self-determination, to preservation of its national character and the full exercise of its national rights on the whole of its territory.\nThe intifada and the new facts it brought to light have negated Israeli propaganda's false claims to democracy. The new facts expose Israel before the whole world and starkly underline its Fascist practices and expansionist policies expressed in such abhorrent measures as deportation, imprisonment without due process, demolition of homes, confiscation of property, the establishment of colonial-type settlements and the continued transgression on the al-Aqsa mosque and other holy places in Palestine. \nIsrael has to learn the lessons of history and reconsider its policies in light of these new facts which belie the \\\"secure boundaries\\\" argument invoked as a pretext for continued occupation and creeping annexation, in violation of the United Nations Charter and its resolutions, the norms of international law and the Geneva Convention of 1949 on the protection of the civilian population in time of war.\nWe reaffirm our unlimited support for the Palestinian people's uprising and call upon the world body and all peace-loving forces in the world to shoulder their historic responsibilities and do what is necessary to put an end to attempts at genocide and the policy of expulsion and deportation practised by Israel and aimed at driving out the legitimate inhabitants o\u00a3 Palestine and the occupied territories from their homeland.\nJust and comprehensive peace in the Middle East cannot be founded on repression, terrorism and killing. It can only be built on a foundation of justice and respect for human rights and international norms of conduct. This can only be achieved by recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among which is the right to self-determination and the establishment of its own State on its national territory.\nFrom this perspective, the Amman summit meeting of Arab States unanimously declared that the only way to solve the problem in a fair and comprehensive manner is the convening of an international peace conference, with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO), on an equal footing, as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The international community is leaning towards reaching a definitive solution along those lines.\nThe State of Qatar declares its support for all steps the PLO might take in its capacity as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We welcome the acceptance by Iran of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which had been accepted by Iraq when it was adopted. This acceptance carries great potential for the establishment of a just peace between two neighbourly Muslim nations, Iran and Iraq.\nWe express the hope that Iran and Iraq will be able to resolve all the problems between them in a peaceful, just and comprehensive fashion, thus safeguarding their respective interests and consolidating the peace and stability of the region in the best interests of their peoples and of the whole Arab and Islamic world.\nIn this regard, we commend the fruitful efforts of the Secretary-General, which were crowned by a cease-fire between the two warring neighbours. We reaffirm our support for his continued efforts to achieve the lasting peace for which we all yearn.\nThe State of Qatar, together with the other sister nations members of the Gulf Co-operation Council, stands ready to make every effort to ensure the success of the peace talks between Iran and Iraq. Despite all the difficulties, we are confident that negotiations will continue until a real, just and permanent peace is achieved and the stability of the Gulf region restored.\nThe State of Qatar welcomes the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and hopes that conditions in that country will be stabilized so that the Afghan people can devote its efforts to rebuilding the country and determining its own course.\nThe current situation in Africa is one of our main concerns. The South African regime represents the antithesis of what the United Nations was intended to embody, namely, the negation of repression and discrimination. The United Nations should intensify its efforts aimed at putting an end to the inhumane and immoral regime of apartheid. That regime cannot be reformed; it must be dismantled. We condemn the new racist legislation on residential segregation and fully support the just struggle of the peoples of South Africa, Namibia, and the other countries in southern Africa. We call upon the international co unity, especially those countries which can influence South Africa's policies, to support the struggle of the people of southern Africa and compel South Africa's racist authorities to renounce their policies of apartheid and their attempts at destabilising the neighbouring countries.\nWe commend the efforts of those parties which seek a solution to the problem of Namibia by putting an end to South Africa's illegal occupation and paving the way foe Namibia's independence. We hope that the current negotiations will bring a halt to military operations on the Angolan border, ensure Namibia's independence and eventually do away with apartheid. The ever-growing nuclear arsenals of the two super-Powers are a persistent threat to the survival of the human race. We therefore welcome the initial agreement reached by the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles. We hope that this agreement is the harbinger of other agreements on radical reductions of their strategic missiles and on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. The decision to conduct negotiations on nuclear testing should lead to the early conclusion of a treaty banning all such tests. At the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, the adoption of a convention prohibiting chemical weapons seems now more than ever before to be within ready. That result should speedily be achieved.\nAnother Important problem is that of international terrorism. It is a complex problem that endangers the stability of States and affects their mutual relations. Moreover, terrorist activities pose a wanton threat to life, limb and property. While international co-operation and the enactment of co-ordinated measures at the domestic level are needed to combat terrorism, it is necessary also to understand the true nature of international terrorism.\nWe must also condemn terrorism practised by or under the direct supervision of States. Colonialism, Zionism and racist and hegemonist regimes indulge in State terrorism through armed aggression against sovereign States and interference in their internal affairs, and the expulsion from their homes and assassination of Innocent people. Colonialism, Zionism and racism are all sources of widespread international terrorism, which constitutes a threat to peace and security and is condemned by the peoples of the world.\nIt is of prime importance to draw a clear distinction between evil acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggle of national liberation movements. \nThe state of the world economy is a source of deep concern. Despite all efforts to assemble the prerequisites for development, the rate of growth in industrialized nations has been less than expected. In the developing world, dwindling returns on the export of raw materials and high interest rates on foreign debts have critically affected the financial resources of developing countries. This situation has a negative impact on economic performance and diminishes the possibility of growth through development.\nThe indebtedness of the developing world continues to be the main obstacle to growth. It lowers the already low standard of living of the poorest of the poor. The heavy debt burden complicates all attempts at structural improvements in the economic policies of the countries concerned. All efforts at restructuring and at better mobilization of local resources are hampered by the immediate claims of debt servicing and thus fail to produce the expected rapid results. The problem of the effects of debt servicing on developing countries needs to be re-examined in a world-wide context. In allocating financial aid, the needs of the least developed countries should be given the special consideration they deserve.\nAgainst that background, the State of Qatar welcomes the positive achievements of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Implementation of the recommendations in the Final Act of that session could lead to specific progress in co-operation in dealing with the current acute crisis in international economic relations.\nIn conclusion, I wish to state that, even though changing conditions since the inception of the United Nations may have required changes in the Organization's methods of work, the lofty purposes and principles of the Organization remain as relevant as ever. The importance of the role played by the United Nations on the world scene has been enhanced. It is more than ever necessary for us all to renew our commitment to the Charter principles, for the sake of a better world for our peoples and the future of mankind in general.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nHalf a world away from this place of peace, the firing, the killing, the bloodshed in two merciless conflicts have for the first time in recent memory diminished. After terrible new names, names such as Halabja, Maidan Shahr and Spin Buldak, have been added to the toll-call of human horror, there is today hope of peace in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan.\nSo too, in the highlands and coastal cities of southern Africa, places of civil war, places of occupation by foreign troops, talk of peace is heard, peace for the tortured nation of Angola. Sixty-five hundred miles east, in the South-East Asian country of Cambodia, there is hope now of a settlement and the removal of Viet Nam's occupying forces. Finally, in this hemisphere, where only 12 years ago one third of the people of Latin America lived under democratic rule, some 90 per cent do so today. And especially in Central America, nations such as El Salvador, once threatened by the anarchy of the death squad and the spectre of totalitarian rule, now know the hope of self-government and the prospect of economic growth. \nAnother change, a change that if it endures may go down as one of the signal accomplishments of our history, a change that is cause for shaking the head in wonder, is also upon us; a change going to the source of post-war tensions and to the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the twin threats of our time - totalitarianism and thermonuclear world war.\nFor the first time, the differences between East and West - fundamental differences over important moral questions dealing with the worth of the individual and whether Governments shall control people or people control Governments - for the first time these differences have shown signs of easing, easing to the point where there are not just troop withdrawals from places such as Afghanistan, but also talk in the East of reform and greater freedom of the press, of assembly and of religion. Yes, fundamental differences remain, but should talk of reform become more than that, should it become reality, there is the prospect of not only a new era in Soviet-United States relations but a new age of world peace; for such reform can bring peace. History teaches, and my country has always believed that, where the rights of the individual and the people are enshrined, war is a distant prospect. For it is not people who make war; only Governments do that.\nI stand at this rostrum, then, at a moment of hope; hope not just for the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union, but for all the peoples of the world, and hope too for the dream of peace among nations, the dream that began the United Nations. Precisely because of these changes, today the United Nations has the opportunity to live and breathe and work as never before.\nAlready, Mr. Secretary-General, you, through your persistence, patience and unyielding will, have shown in working towards peace in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf how valuable the United Nations can be. We salute you for these accomplishments. In Geneva at this very hour there are numerous negotiations under way: multilateral negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament, as well as bilateral negotiations on a range of issues between the Soviets and ourselves. These negotiations, some of them under United Nations auspices, involve a broad arms-control agenda: strategic offensive weapons, strategic defence and space, nuclear testing, and chemical warfare - whose urgency we have witnessed anew in recent days.\nAnd the negotiators ate busy. Over the last few years they h iv/e been engaged in more than an academic exercise. There is movement; the log-jam is broken. Only recently, when the United States and the Soviet Union signed the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) agreement, an entire class of United States and Soviet nuclear missiles was eliminated for the first time in history. Progress continues on negotiations to reduce strategic weapons in massive number, with effective verification, and talks will begin soon on conventional reductions in Europe.\nMuch of the reason for all this goes back, I believe, to Geneva, to the small chateau beside the lake where I and the Soviet General Secretary had the first of several fireside chats - exchanges characterized by frankness, but friendliness too. I said at the first meeting in Geneva that this was a unique encounter between two people who had the power to start a third world war or to begin a new age of peace among nations. I also said that peace conferences, arms negotiations and proposals for treaties could make sense only if they were part of a wider context, a context in which we sought to explore and resolve the deeper underlying differences between us. I said to Mr. Gorbachev then, as I have said to the Assembly before, that nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed; they are armed because they mistrust each other. \n\nIn that place, by that peaceful lake in neutral Switzerland, Mr. Gorbachev and I did begin a new relationship based not just on engagement over the single issue of arras control but on a broader agenda about our deeper differences, an agenda of human rights, regional conflicts and bilateral exchanges between our peoples. Even on the arms-control issue itself we agreed to go beyond the past, to seek not just treaties that permitted building weapons to higher levels, but revolutionary agreements that actually reduced and even eliminated a whole class of nuclear weapons.\nWhat was begun that morning in Geneva has shown results: in the INF Treaty? in my recent visit to Moscow; in my opportunity to meet there with Soviet citizens and dissidents and speak of human rights; and to speak too, in the Lenin Hills of Moscow, to the young people of the Soviet Union about the wonder and splendour of human freedom. The results of that morning in Geneva are seen in peace conferences now under way around the world on regional conflicts and in the work of the United Nations here in New York as well as in Geneva.\nBut history teaches caution. Indeed, that very building in Geneva, where important negotiations have taken place - those on the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan, and the Iran-Iraq negotiations, for example - we see today as stone-like testimony to a failed dream of peace in another time. The Palais des Nations was the headquarters of the League of Nations, an institution that was to symbolize an end to all war. Yet that institution and its noble purpose ended with the Second World War; ended because the chance of peace was not seized in the 1930s by the nations of the world, ended because humanity did not find the courage to isolate the aggressors, to reject schemes of government that served the State, not the people. We are here today determined that no such fate shall befall the United Nations. We are determined that the United Nations shall succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind.\nSo we realize that, even in this time of hope, the chance of failure is teal, but this knowledge does not discourage us: it spurs us on. For the stakes are high; do we falter and fail now, and bring down upon ourselves the just anger of future generations? Or do we continue the work of the founders of this institution, and see to it that, at last, freedom is enshrined and humanity knows war no longer, and that this place, this floor, shall be truly \\\"the world's last battlefield\\\"?\nWe are determined that it shall be so. So we turn now to the agenda of peace. Let us begin by addressing a concern that was much on my mind when I met with Mr. Gorbachev in the Kremlin as well as on the minds of Soviet citizens I met in Moscow. It is also an issue that I know is of immediate importance to the members of this Assembly who, this fall, commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThat Declaration says plainly what those who seek peace can forget only at the greatest peril that peace rests on one foundation; observance of the \\\"inalienable rights of all members of the human family\\\". In a century where human rights have been denied by totalitarian governments on a scale never before seen in history, with so many millions deliberately starved or eliminated as a matter of State policy - a history, it has been said, of blood, stupidity and barbed wire - few can wonder why peace has proved so elusive.\t\nWell, let us understand. If we would have peace, we must acknowledge the elementary rights of our fellow human beings, in our own land and in other lands. If we would have peace, the trampling of the human spirit must cease. Human rights is not for some, some of the time. Human rights, as the Universal Declaration adopted by this Assembly in 1948 proclaims, is \\\"for all peoples and all nations\\\". And for all time.\nThis regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at the heart of the United Nations. Those who starve in Ethiopia, those who die among the Kurds, those who face racial injustice in South Africa, those who still cannot write or speak freely in the Soviet Union, those who cannot worship in the Ukraine, those who struggle for life and freedom on boats in the South China Sea, those who cannot publish or assemble in Managua - all of these are more than just an item on your agenda. It must be a first concern, an issue above others. For when human rights concerns are not paramount at the United Nations - when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not honoured in these halls and meeting rooms - then the very credibility of this Organization is at stake, the very purpose of its existence in question.\nThat is why, when progress is made in human rights, the United Nations grows stronger and the United States is glad of it. For example, following a two-year \u00a1 effort led by the United States, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights took a major step towards ending the double standards and cynicism that had characterized too much of its past. For years, Cuba, a blatant violator of its citizens' human rights, has escaped United Nations censure or even scrutiny. This year, Cuba has responded to pressure generated by the Commission on Human Rights by accepting an investigation into its human rights abuses. Fidel Castro has already begun to free some political prisoners, improve prison conditions, and tolerate the existence of a small, independent national human rights group.\nMore must be done. The United Nations must be relentless and unyielding in seeking change, in Cuba and elsewhere. And we must also see to it that the Universal Declaration itself is not debased with episodes like the resolution \\\"Zionism is racism\\\". Respect for human rights is the first and fundamental mission of this body, the most elementary obligation of its members. Indeed, wherever one turns in the world today, there is a new awareness, a growing passion for human rights. The people of the world become united: new groups, new coalitions form, coalitions that commit: government, that work against discrimination, that fight religious or political repression, unlawful imprisonment, torture or execution. As those I spoke to at Spaso House said to me last June: Such movements make a difference.\nTurning now to regional conflicts, we feel again the uplift of hope. In the Gulf War between Iran and Iraq - one of the bloodiest conflicts since the Second World War - we have a cease-fire. The resolution and the firmness of the allied nations in keeping the Persian Gulf open to international shipping not only upheld the rule of law, it helped prevent further spread of the conflict and laid the basis for peace. So, too, the Security Council's decisive resolution in July a year ago has become the blueprint for a peaceful Gulf. Let this war - a war in which there has been no victor or vanquished, only victims - let this war end now. Let both Iran and Iraq co-operate with the Secretary-General and the Security Council in implementing resolution 598 (1978). Let peace come.\nMoving on to a second region, I would recall that when I first addressed the United Nations General Assembly in 1983, world attention was focused on the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of Afghanistan. After nearly nine long years of war, the courage and determination of the Afghan people and the Afghan freedom fighters have held sway - and today, an end to the occupation is in sight. On April 14, the USSR signed the Geneva Accords, which were negotiated under United Nations auspices by Pakistan and the Kabul regime. We encourage the Soviet Union to complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date, so that the Afghan people can freely determine their future without further outside interference.\nIn southern Africa, too, years of patient diplomacy and support for those in Angola who seek self-determination are having their effect. We look forward to an accord between the Governments of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa that will bring about a complete withdrawal of all foreign troops - primarily Cuban - from Angola. We look forward as well to full implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and our longstanding goal of independence for Namibia. We continue to support a growing consensus among African leaders who also believe there can be no end to conflict in the region until there is national reconciliation within Angola.\nThere are new hopes for Cambodia, a nation whose freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we sought the freedom and independence of Afghanistan. We urge the rapid removal of all Vietnamese troops and a settlement that will prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge to power, permitting instead the establishment of a genuinely representative government - a government that will, at last, respect fully the rights of the people of Cambodia and end the hideous suffering they have so bravely and needlessly borne.\nIn other critical areas, we applaud the Secretary-General's efforts to structure a referendum on the Western Sahara. In the Mediterranean, direct talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot common ties hold much promise for accord in that divided island nation. Finally, we look to a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. So, too, the unnatural division of Europe remains a critical obstacle to Soviet-American relations. \nIn most of these areas, then, we see progress and, again, we are glad of it. Only a few years ago, all of these and other conflicts were burning dangerously out of control. Indeed, the invasion of Afghanistan and the apparent failure of will among democratic and peace-loving nations to deter such events seemed to cause a climate where aggression by nations large and small was epidemic, a climate the world had not seen since the 1930s. Only this time, larger war was avoided - avoided because the free and peaceful nations of the world recovered their strength of purpose and will. And now the United Nations is providing valuable assistance in helping this epidemic to recede.\nAnd because we are resolved to keep it so, I would be remiss in my duty if I did not now take note here of the one exception to progress in regional conflicts. I refer here to the continuing deterioration of human rights in Nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling that nation to honour promises of democracy made to their own people and to the international community. This elite - in calling itself revolutionary - seeks no real revolution; the use of the term is subterfuge, deception for hiding the oldest, most corrupt vice of alls man's age-old will to power, his lust to control the lives and steal the freedom of others.\nThat is why, as President, I will continue to urge the Congress and the American public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to impose a totalitarian regime on the people of Nicaragua; that the United States will continue to stand with those who are threatened by this regime's aggression against its neighbours in Central America.\nToday, I also call on the Soviet Union to show in Central America the same spirit of constructive realism it has shown in other regional conflicts; to assist in bringing conflict in Central America to a close by halting the flow of billions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to the Sandinista regime; a regime whose goals of regional domination, while ultimately doomed, can continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and risk to Soviet-American relations unless action is taken now.\nWith regard to the arms reduction agenda, I have already mentioned the importance of the INF Treaty and the momentum developed in the strategic arms reduction talks (START). The draft START treaty is a lengthy process filled with bracketed language designating sections of disagreement between the two sides. But through this summer in Geneva, those brackets have diminished; there is every reason to believe this process can continue. I can tell this Assembly that it is highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few months, but I can tell you that a year from now is a possibility - more than a possibility. But we have no deadline. No agreement is better than a bad agreement. The United States remains hopeful, and we acknowledge the spirit of co-operation shown by the Soviet Union in these negotiations. We also look for that spirit to be applied to our concerns about compliance with existing agreements.\nSo, too, our discussions on nuclear testing and defence and space have been useful. But let me here stress to the General Assembly that much of the momentum in nuclear-arms-control negotiations is due to technological progress itself, especially in the potential for space-based defensive systems. I believe that the determination of the United States to research and develop and, when ready, deploy such defensive systems - systems targeted to destroy missiles, not people - accounts for a large share of the progress made in recent years in Geneva. With such systems, for the first time, in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman somewhere, major Powers will not be faced with the single option of massive retaliation, but will instead have the chance of a saner choice: to shield against an attack instead of avenging it. So, too, as defensive systems grow in effectiveness, they reduce the threat and the value of greater and greater offensive arsenals. Only recently, briefings I have received in the Oval Office indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid and less costly than we had at first thought. Today, the United States reaffirms its commitment to its strategic defence initiative and our offer to share the benefits of strategic defences with others.\nAnd yet, even as diplomatic and technological progress holds out the hope of at last diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror we have lived under in the post-war era, even at this moment another ominous terror is loose once again in the world, a terror we thought the world had put behind, a terror that looms at us now from the long-buried past, from ghostly, scarring trenches and the haunting, wan faces of millions dead in one of the most inhumane conflicts of all time.\nPoison gas; chemical warfare: the terror of it; the horror of it! We condemn it. The use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, beyond its tragic human toll, jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held those weapons in check since the First World War. Let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the Geneva Protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons. I call upon the signatories to that Protocol, as well as other concerned States, to convene a conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty. We urge all nations to co-operate in negotiating a verifiable, truly global ban on chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.\nIt is incumbent upon all civilized nations to ban, once and for all - and on a verifiable and global basis - the use of chemical and gas warfare.\nFinally, we must redouble our efforts to stop further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world. Likewise, proliferation in other high-technology weapons such as ballistic missiles, is reaching global proportions, exacerbating regional rivalries in ways that can have global implications. The number of potential suppliers is growing at an alarming rate, and more must be done to halt the spread of these weapons. This was a matter of discussion last week between Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze. Talks between American and Soviet experts begin on this today; and we hope to see a multilateral effort to avoid having areas of tension like the Middle East becoming even more deadly battlegrounds than they already are.\nRut in most of these areas we see not only progress but also the potential for an increasingly vital role for multilateral efforts and institutions like the United Nations. That is why now more than ever the United Nations must continue to increase its effectiveness through budget and programme reform. The United Nations already is enacting sweeping measures affecting personnel reductions, budgeting by consensus, and the establishment of programme priorities. These actions are extremely important. The progress on reforms has allowed me to release funds withheld under congressional restrictions. I expect that the reform programme will continue and that further funds will be released in our new fiscal year.\nLet me say here that we congratulate the United Nations on the work it has done in three areas of special concern. First, our struggle against the scourge of terrorism and State-sponsored terrorism must continue; and we must also end the scourge of hostage-taking. Second, the work of the World Health Organization in co-ordinating and advancing research on AIDS is vital. All international efforts in this area must be redoubled. The AIDS crisis is a grave one; we must move as one to meet it. \nSo, too, is the drug crisis. We are moving now toward a new anti-drug-trafficking convention. This important treaty will be completed in December. I am confident that other strong United Nations drug-control programmes will also follow. The American people are profoundly concerned and deeply angered. We will not tolerate the drug traffickers. We mean to make war on them - and we believe this is one war the United Nations can endorse and participate in. Yes, the United Nations is a better place than it was eight years ago - and so, too, is the world. But the real issue of reform in the United Nations is not limited to fiscal and administrative improvements; it includes also a higher sort of reform, an intellectual and philosophical reform, a reform of old views about the relationship between the individual and the State. \nFew developments, for example, have been more encouraging to the United States than the special session on Africa that this body held two and a half years ago - a session at which the Members of the United Nations joined in calling as one for free-market incentives and a lessening of State controls to spur economic development. \nAt one of the first international assemblies of my presidency, in Cancun, Mexico, I said that history demonstrates that, time and again, in place after place, economic growth and human progress make their greatest strides in countries that encourage economic freedom; that individual farmers, labourers, owners, traders and managers are the heart and soul of development. Trust them, because where they are allowed to create and build, where they are given a personal stake in deciding economic policies and benefiting from their success, societies become more dynamic, prosperous, progressive and free. We believe in freedom; we know that it works.\nThis is the immutable lesson of the post-war era: that freedom works; that, even more, freedom and peace work together. Every year that passes, everywhere in the world, this lesson is taking hold - from the People's Republic of China to Cameroon, from Bolivia to Botswana, and, yes, in the citadel of Marxism-Leninism itself. No, my country did not invent this synergy of peace and freedom, but, believe me, we impose no restrictions on the free export of our more than two centuries of experience with it. Free people, blessed by economic opportunity and protected by laws that respect the dignity of the individual, are not driven towards war or the domination of others. Here, then, is the way to world peace. But we Americans champion freedom not only because it is practical and beneficial but because it is also just, morally right.\nHere I should like to note that I have addressed this assemblage more often than any of my predecessors and that this is the last occasion on which I shall do so. Therefore I hope that I may be permitted some closing reflections.\nThe world is currently witnessing another celebration of international co-operation. At the Olympics we see nations joining together in the competition of sports, and we see young people, who know precious little of the resentments of their elders, coming together as one.\nOne of our young athletes, from a home of modest means, said that she drew the strength for her achievement from another source of wealth. \\\"We were rich as a family\\\" she said about the love she was given and the values she was taught. I dare to hope that in the sentiment of that young athlete we see a sign of the rediscovery of old and tested values; values such as family - the first and most important unit of society, where all values and learning begin, an institution to be cherished and protected\u00b7, values, too, such as work, community, freedom and faith, for it is here we find the deeper rationale for the cause of human rights and world peace.\nOur own experience on this continent, the American experience, though brief, has had one unmistakable encounter, an insistence on the preservation of one sacred truth: it is a truth that our first President, our founding father, passed on in the first farewell address made to the American people; it is a truth that I hope you will permit me to mention in these remarks of farewell, a truth embodied in our Declaration of Independence: that the case for inalienable rights, the idea of human dignity, the notion of conscience above compulsion, can be made only in the context of higher law, only in the context of what one of the founders of this Organization, Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, called \\\"devotion to something which is greater and higher than we are ourselves.\\\"\nThis is the endless cycle, the final truth to which humankind seems always to return - that religion and morality, faith in something higher, are prerequisites for freedom, and that justice and peace within ourselves is the first step toward justice and peace in the world and for the ages.\nYes, this is a place of great debate and grave discussion. Yet I cannot help but note here that one of our founding fathers - the most worldly of men, an internationalist, Benjamin Franklin - interrupted the proceedings of our own constitutional convention to make much the same point.\nI cannot help but think this morning of other beginnings - of where and when I first read those words \\\"and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares\\\" and \\\"your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams\\\". This morning, my thoughts go to her who gave me many things in life but whose most important gift was the knowledge of the happiness and solace to be gained in prayer. It is the greatest help I have had in my presidency, and I recall here Lincoln's words when he said\n\\\"Only the most foolish of men would think he could confront the duties of the office I now hold without turning to someone stronger, a power above all others. \\\"\nI think, then, of her and others like her in that small town in Illinois, gentle people who possessed something that those who hold positions of power sometimes forget to prize. No one of them could ever have imagined that the boy from the banks of the Rock River would come to this moment and have this opportunity. But, had they been told that it would happen, I think they would have been a bit disappointed if I had not spoken here for what they knew so wells that when we grow weary of the world and its troubles, when our faith in humanity falters, it is then that we must seek contort and refreshment of spirit in a deeper source of wisdom, one greater than ourselves.\nSo, if future generations do say of us that in our time peace came closer, that we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice, it will be cause for pride. But it will be a cause of greater pride still if it is also said that we were wise enough to know that the deliberations of great leaders and great bodies are but an overture, that the truly majestic music, the music of freedom, justice and peace, is the music made in forgetting self and seeking in silence the will of Him who made us.\nThank you for your hospitality over the years. I bid you now farewell, and God bless you.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the delegation of Guatemala, which I have the honour to head, I wish to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. He enjoys the support of the international community represented here, because of our esteem for his country and his well-known diplomatic skills and personal attributes.\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm my admiration for the work carried out by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. During his term he has set an example of dedication to the Organization, placing his talent, enthusiasm and tenacity at the service of the United Nations and the cause of international peace and security.\nI wish also to congratulate the United Nations peace-keeping forces on having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThe international peace and security guaranteed by the United Nations requires that we focus our efforts on the strengthening of our institutions, both within our countries and in our international relations and our gradual adaptation to the demands of the realities of the time. The United Nations must gradually become an instrument enabling the principles of its founding Charter to be fulfilled in all nations. All countries must strive towards institutional compliance with the obligations set out in the Charter.\nOver the past 32 months my country has shown its belief in compliance with the principles of the United Nations, and we shall not rest but do everything necessary to remain firm in that determination. Obviously, the noble purposes of the United Nations cannot be achieved while a part of mankind continues to live in poverty and ignorance. All human beings have the right to dignity, progress and intellectual and spiritual development. The priority task of the United Nations, apart from the quest for international peace and security, must unquestionably be to strengthen co-operation in promoting the all-round development of the poorest countries. \nWe are convinced of the value of dialogue as the most effective way of settling disputes and removing tension, and our foreign policy is based on the basic need for peace. In our international relations we reject the threat and use of force and spare no effort in the quest for peaceful political solutions. We continue to observe these essential values both internally and externally. We condemn human rights violations wherever they occur. That clear and definitive stand has been recognized by the international community. Because of all our efforts in this important task, international personalities and organizations understand that in my country the Government of the Republic guarantees the full enjoyment of human rights and unrestricted exercise of all freedoms. Our foreign policy is in keeping with the purposes and principles of the charters of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. \nWe reaffirm our belief in the self-determination of peoples and in non-intervention; in ideological and political pluralism; and in the settlement of disputes through peaceful means. Our international policy at the Central American level is one of solidarity and fraternity, continuously promoting the values that sustain our convictions. We recognize and promote a Latin Americanist sentiment and we stand in solidarity with the just aspirations of ail third-world countries. We too wish for an international order based on justice and equity.\nIn this context, I wish to refer to my country's deep concern over the external debt problem, given its overriding importance for our countries. More than five years have elapsed since the first initiatives were taken in this area, but not only does the problem persist but there have been no positive prospects for a solution. I believe that the time has come to analyse the problem once again, the\u00b7 time through a more realistic and pragmatic approach, lb this end a basic strategy should be established by taking account of the positions and interests of the debtor and creditor countries alike, not only in financial terms but also through a broader, more comprehensive approach, without underestimating other problems such as political, social and economic problems which stem from or are the cause of the debt problem.\nOur countries cannot afford not to grow, sacrificing their economic expansion to honour 'their financial commitments. Neither can we forget the impact this is having on the standard of living of the majority. On the contrary, Governments are accountable to their peoples; that is why my Government has decided gradually to take care of the social debt consisting of the accumulation of health, education and housing needs which for years had not been met. \nHence my country is in favour of holding a meeting to seek multilateral, comprehensive solutions to the anguishing problem of foreign debt. The Central American crisis is deeply rooted in past injustices - social injustice, economic injustice and political injustice. Our recent history is replete with examples of institutional needs - the lack of democratic processes, the absence of pluralism and the denial of democratic participation. There has been much speculation on the peace process in Central America. I wish at this time to state the following: peace in Central America will not result solely from the political will of Central American Governments or peoples; peace in Central America as a fundamental goal will entail a long, difficult and complex process. The root causes of the crisis obtaining today in Central America are authoritarianism, misunderstanding. Intolerance, alienation of certain groups, poverty and illegitimate government. That means that the peace which is so deeply desired by 25 million Central Americans, and sought by almost all countries of the world cannot be attained solely through good will on our part.\nThe goal of peace urgently requires clear and transparent processes of internal democratisation in each of our countries, so that every citizen In Central America will enjoy a certain and secure area so that our peoples will become the protagonists of their own destinies, the builders of their own future. We require all the inhabitants of Central America to play a leading role in forming their social model and their historical destiny. To this end, it is essential and urgent to bring about the basic conditions needed for the comprehensive development of the human person - and that means social justice, economic justice and political justice.\nIf we truly wish for peace for each and every one of our countries, as we stated in the document entitled \\\"Procedure for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America\\\", we must continually, in the eyes of the world and before history which is our judge, give testimony of our resolve to maintain, above all, a leading role for our peoples, legitimate government, pluralistic and democratic participation and the unalterable applicability of fundamental human rights and freedoms.\nIt is not enough to speak out and to make promises) we must take action and demonstrate that we are taking action.\nOn 14 January 1986 President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala initiated and promoted steps at the Central American level with a view to arriving at an instrument for peace. It was in Guatemala that the two historic meetings of Esquipulas were held, meetings which gave form and content to the Esquipulas II plan, the Guatemala procedure to maintain \u0430 firm and lasting peace in Central America. It was President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala who proposed forming a Central American parliament - an appropriate forum and a fitting instrument for discussing the political problems of the area, the economic problems that weigh upon us, and Central American integration as a model of unity to which we Central Americans have aspired for so long.\nPresident Cerezo, the Government of the Republic and the people of Guatemala have spared no effort to promote peace in the Central American subregion. We have drawn up procedures and proposed actions} we have accepted advice and criteria; we have done everything within our means and we will not rest until we attain the goal we have set ourselves. After 32 months of work on, involvement in and commitment to this process, we are able to say to the peoples of the world that we in Central America are continually making progress in building this model - a model in which Central Americans have taken on the leading role that history requires of us, valiantly and resolutely shouldering out own responsibilities  We are facing up to the complexity of our problems with goodwill, imagination, resolve f 1 faith. Today Central America is not the Central America of two years ago, nor is it the Central America we hope to see in a short time, but in Central America today new areas have been opened up and we are marching towards the fu Lure\u00b7, above all, we know full well that we cannot turn back. We know that the task ahead is difficult but we will continue to strive to find appropriate, timely and correct solutions. In this process, we require the goodwill, solidarity and co-operation not only of international institutions but also of all the peoples of the world.\nHere I wish to refer in parenthesis to the valuable and noble solidarity of the Contadora Group and Support Group countries. Those brother countries became involved in our problems and opened up for us valuable and worthwhile opportunities, putting us on the path we had to follow.\nX also wish to express gratitude on behalf of my country, Guatemala - and I am sure that I am reflecting the feelings of the 25 million Central Americans - for the valuable and timely co-operation given us by the United Nations, which is actively seeking mechanisms to implement a plan for the economic and social development of Central America.\nWe are also grateful for the solidarity and co-operation of the European Economic Community, which, in many forums and institutions, has joined us in the quest for peace in Central America. We thank the United States of America for its constant display of solidarity and co-operation, and all the peoples of the world which have joined us in pursuing the cause of peace.\nI am happy to take this opportunity to state that the Government of the Republic of Guatemala has fulfilled, and will continue firmly to fulfil, the commitments entered into within the framework of Esquipulas. We have maintained, and will continue to maintain, a policy of active neutrality with regard to the Central American crisis, so that the peace process may result in the establishment of conditions of democracy, freedom, prosperity and respect for the human rights of Central Americans, their eight to the territorial integrity and their right to self-determination and to choose their own way of life.\t.\nWe are giving new evidence of that, with President Cerezo, a number of us last week visited the other countries of Central America to propose new mechanisms to revitalize and reinvigorate the procedure for seeking peace in Central America. I can tell our friends throughout the world that in November there will be another meeting of the Central American Presidents, in the sister Republic of El Salvador, to assess - and this way involve self-criticism - the extent to which we have not been able to comply with Esquipalas II, and to strengthen the will and the commitment to comply with all its provisions \nThe path that we have followed in Guatemala to achieve a democratic Government that is respectful of its role, the guarantor of freedoms and the faithful interpreter of the aspirations of the Guatemalan people has been long and difficult. My Government faced a difficult task 32 months ago - that of rebuilding a country that was just awakening to the dawn of a democratic era. It is no easy task to initiate and consolidate a de no era tic process in such a short time. Its enemies are many, as are misunderstandings and frustrations. In ray country the majority were forgotten, only marginally benefiting from development and enjoying only minimum respect for their fundamental rights. Today we are learning how to live in a democracy. Guiding a people with a tradition of lack of understanding and intolerance requires moral strength and a firm commitment. Our daily struggle is hard, as we wish to build a truly free, truly just and truly united land. Our commitment is the result of our unbending will, our democratic faith and our historical experience.\nHowever, as we strive to consolidate democracy we face the intransigence of extremist elements using every means available to them to deny us democratic opportunities, slandering and discrediting the process and using international forums and the good will of some representatives to mislead and to distort the truth of what is happening in my country, presenting pictures of earlier times, not of what is now going on in Guatemala.\nHere I would appeal to the international community not to allow itself to be misled by groups that politicise human rights committees, thus trying to win outside the country battles that they have lost within it. Condemnation and criticism of countries that have started on democratic consolidation are no help. We have this year worked closely with the expert adviser rightly designated by the Commission on Human Rights, with whom we have prepared a plan of support for national institutions that promote respect for human rights and monitor compliance with the law and its correct implementation.\nThis is not the appropriate forum in which to go into details about the progress made in this matter. However, I would refer to the case of Guatemalan refugees outside the country, who have continued to return. This year there was a 300 per cent increase in the numbers of those returning, encouraged by the internal democratic climate and by the support that the State, in co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is offering them. In this regard, I wish to emphasize the importance of the choice o\u00a3 Guatemala as the host country of the first international conference on Central American refugees, to be held next year. We hope that the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, will honour us by opening the session.\nWe are determined to maintain and consolidate not only political democracy, but also economic democracy, eliminating the serious inequalities that exist, the alienation of many groups in our population, and extreme poverty, and overcoming the lack of opportunities for our young, all with the aim of achieving true social justice.\nWe seek to establish a broad-based, non-sectarian Government, and we ate achieving that. With social and human sensitivity and a sense of tolerance, but modestly, we are establishing a Government based on participatory democracy, with profound respect for every citizen. The policy that we are carrying out is based on the conviction that man can and must play a central part in his own history. The Government is working with justifiable optimism, aware of the hard, creative to assess - and this may involve self-criticism - the extent to which we have not been able to comply with Esquipulas 11, and to strengthen the will and the commitment to comply with all its provisions.\nThe path that we have followed in Guatemala to achieve a democratic Government that is respectful of its role the guarantee of freedoms and the faithful interpreter of the aspirations of the Guatemalan people has been long and difficult. My Government faced a difficult task 32 months ago - that of rebuilding a country that was just awakening to the dawn of a democratic era. It is no easy task to initiate and consolidate a democratic process in such a short time. Its enemies are many, as are misunderstandings and frustrations. In my country the majority were forgotten, only marginally benefiting from development and enjoying only minimum respect for their fundamental rights.

Condemnation and criticism of countries that have started on democratic processes is not helpful. We put forth our efforts together with all the people of Guatemala, who because of their patriotism, their hardworking spirit, their moral and spiritual stature and their readiness to overcome difficulties and adversities, have been called upon to fulfil a great destiny.\nI can give an assurance at this world forum that the democratic Government of Guatemala is meeting the challenge of history with unshakeable will and resolve. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to extend to you. Sir, our warn congratulations on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly, which reflects the confidence of the international community in your skill, long experience and well-known wisdom, and is also an expression of appreciation of your friendly country, We are confident that you will lead the work of the session- to achievement of the positive results we all hope for,\nI would also express my delegation's deep appreciation of the skill and competence with which your predecessor served as President of the last session of the General Assembly.\nIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Secretary-General on his valuable report on the work of the Organization and efforts in support of international peace and security.\nThis year the world has witnessed important events and developments which have great significance for the efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security. It has also witnessed serious natural disasters that have inflicted grave damage on the infrastructures of a number of countries and impeded their efforts to achieve development and progress. \nIn this context, I would like to recall the Treaty between the United States of America and the Soviet Union on the elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, as well as other agreements reached by the two countries at the Washington and Moscow summit meetings of 1987 and 1983, respectively. These developments came as an expression of the peaceful approach adopted by the two super-Powers, the policy of d\u00e9tente, and the improvement of the international climate, and also as an indication of the beginning of the movement towards disarmament and the reduction of risk of a nuclear war. While welcoming these steps towards peace, we call on both countries to continue to move in that direction, and we hope to see this policy of reconciliation applied in solving regional and world problems, eradicating racial discrimination and promoting respect for peoples\u2019 rights to independence and sovereignty.\nAmong the most outstanding issues that should be given more attention by the super-Powers and the United Nations are the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East, which increasingly endanger international peace and security because of Israel's defiance of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and of the unanimous will of the international community, resulting in its savage acts of terrorism against the defenceless Palestinian people.\nPeace can never be achieved in the Middle East region unless it is based on the principle of absolute justice. The question of Palestine is the origin and crux of the conflict in the region. Therefore Israel must unconditionally withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem. In this respect, we reiterate the importance of holding the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. \nThe uprising of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has continued, for almost a year, to cause the loss of life of many martyrs, who have fallen under the fire of Israeli, terrorises and occupation. The militant Palestinian people has proven once more that its resolve will not be weakened and that its determination will increase even more, even at the cost of the greatest sacrifices, due to Israeli terrorism. My delegation wishes therefore, from this rostrum, to commend the struggle and brave resolution of the \\\"stone children. They have brought an ingenious innovation to the struggle of the Palestinian people and, with unique courage and unwavering determination have exposed the machinery and power of the systematic terrorism pursued by the Tel Aviv government. This people will inevitably triumph, however great the sacrifices may be.\nWe view with deep appreciation the efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to restore peace and to end the war between Iraq and Iran, efforts which culminated in the recent cease-fire. We sincerely hope that the negotiations currently under way will succeed and pave the way to a permanent, comprehensive, peaceful settlement of the conflict between the two countries.\nThe situation in southern Africa is another source of grave concern. The people in that area are still suffering under the yoke of domination and the abhorrent apartheid regime, which is the most rapacious, fascist and racist colonial system. Despite international condemnations, the apartheid regime still persists in its crimes against world conscience and humanity, we salute the people of South Africa for their relentless struggle to attain their legitimate rights and achieve their just demands under the leadership of their legitimate representatives, the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC).\nThe apartheid regime is an affront to humanity. We call upon the international community to help eradicate it by increasing its isolation and by carrying out comprehensive economic sanctions. We also call for support for the efforts that are being made to achieve Namibia's independence and to strengthen the means of implementing the United Nations resolutions aimed at putting an end to Namibia's illegal occupation by South Africa and at supporting the struggle of its people for liberation and sovereignty under the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), their legitimate and sole representative.\nWe hope that the continuing efforts that are being made in the current negotiations to achieve a practical solution that would benefit the Namibian people, on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1987), will succeed, so that an end may be put to Namibia's illegal occupation by Pretoria, that Namibia may be granted its independence and that favourable conditions may be created for the achievement of this objective.\nThe Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan signed last April are outstanding achievements on the road to establishing peace and reaching a comprehensive settlement of the problem of Afghanistan. We hope that the national reconciliation endeavours currently under way will bear fruit, so that Afghanistan and its people may enjoy security and stability.\nThe success of the United Nations endeavours inspires the hope that peace and security may be attained in other regions of the world. Cambodia still awaits a comprehensive, just and peaceful solution, one that would involve the withdrawal of all foreign forces from its territories and would help create a favourable climate that would enable the Cambodian people to exercise their right to independence and sovereignty. \nWe hope to see the Korean people attain their aspirations and reunite their homeland in peace and without foreign interference.\nWe also hope that political economic and social stability will be achieved by the peoples of Central America.\nMr. President, we support what you said in your statement concerning the increasing effectiveness of the United Nations in arriving at a new pattern of international relations based on the belief that the force of arms, however strong, will not solve the problems of the world.\nThe developments the world has witnessed this year have proved the effectiveness of the United Nations and its ability to contribute to the strengthening of peace and stability. We would like in this context to commend the Secretary-General for his wise leadership and efforts to achieve the goals of the United Nations. We congratulate the United Nations on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its peace-keeping operations. We call upon Member States to respect the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations.\nMy country is following with deep concern the exacerbation of the acute crisis in the present international economic order and the negative impact on developing countries, especially the least developed among them. No one can deny the fact that the roots of the crisis lie in the continuation of structural imbalances in the international economic order. This is evident in the decline of the terms of international trade, the decrease in the prices of raw materials exported by developing countries, and the exacerbation of the foreign debt crisis to such an extent that it is now threatening the future of all economic and social developments. It also has political and social repercussions arising from the stagnation of the rates of growth and the decrease in the flow of development assistance. We would like in this context to mention in particular the tardiness of developed countries in fulfilling their obligations to implement resolutions on the International Development Strategy for the second and third development decades, which call upon those countries to allocate .07 per cent of their national income as official assistance for the financing of development in developing countries. The situation is also aggravated by the failure of developed countries to adhere to the decisions contained in the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries, despite the international consensus reached at the Paris Conference in 1980, which resulted in a serious set-back to economic development in the States of this group. \nThe foreign debt crisis in developing countries has begun to assume serious dimensions, posing a major obstacle to the economic and social development of developing countries in general, and of the least developed countries in particular. We are convinced that the crisis is caused mainly by the structural imbalances in the present international economic order. The debt-servicing burden is worsening daily and giving rise to grave dangers as a result of the wrong policies being imposed by some international financial institutions, the stagnation of official development assistance, protectionism, the closure of markets to the exports of developing countries, and the instability of financial markets. This deterioration endangers not only the stability and security of developing countries, but also international stability and security. Therefore, my country would like to appeal from this rostrum for urgent international action to deal with the foreign debt crisis on a general, comprehensive and systematic basis, taking into account the importance of recognizing the principle of the common responsibility of both developing and developed countries, and the necessity of dealing with the debt crisis within a comprehensive international strategy.\nIn this context, my delegation wishes to mention some positive signs at the international level, in particular the increasing awareness of the necessity of finding urgent and just solutions to the debt problem. In this vein, my delegation commends and welcomes the decisions taken at the industrial nations' summit ' meeting, held in Toronto, Canada, last June. Those decisions contained the first clear and explicit consensus among the major industrial nations on the importance of taking practical and concrete steps towards alleviating the debt burden of the poorest countries, especially those of Africa. In particular we would recall the recommendation calling for the writing off of the debts of poor African countries, which we believe would constitute an extremely important step towards containing this serious crisis.\nThe critical economic situation in Africa also causes deep concern. The already grave economic crisis in Africa that has resulted from several external and internal factors has been exacerbated by natural disasters such as drought, desertification and floods. \nIn this context my delegation expresses total support for implementation of the decisions contained in the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, which was unanimously endorsed by the General Assembly at its thirteenth special session in May 1986. We observe with regret that several developed countries have failed to fulfil their obligations concerning the implementation of decisions contained in the Programme of Action, especially in the area of providing financial resources to finance development, as clearly shown in the medium-term evaluation of the African Programme of Action at the meetings of the Committee of the Whole held last month in this Hall. My delegation expresses its full support for the recommendations of the Committee of the Whole on the medium-term evaluation of the African Programme of Action and appeals to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations in order to secure the success of common efforts before 1990.\nMy delegation stresses its firm belief in the principle of interdependence and organic integrity of the international economic order for the benefit of all, which can only be achieved through the devising of full and comprehensive solutions based on the principles of equality, justice and equitable opportunities. Accordingly, the activation of constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries constitutes an urgent and vital demand at this critical juncture, at which the international community faces major dangers and challenges which require wisdom, courage, clarity of vision and political will. We believe that the gravity of the present international economic crisis requires the intensification of efforts to devise a complete strategy, to reopen the channels of North-South dialogue in order to restructure the present international economic order, and to establish a new international economic order with a view to accelerating economic and social development in developing countries within the framework of interdependence and common benefit. The people of the Sudan have confirmed their determination to uphold the democratic option by establishing a national-accord Government which is a clear manifestation of the unanimous will of the people. That Government is supported by 90 per cent of the members of the Constituent Assembly. Its support is also rooted in a wide popular base, and is based on the rule of law, judiciary independence, freedom of expression and association, and respect for human and fundamental rights.\nThe Sudan is not content with absolute-majority democracy; it transcends that, aspiring to reach the goal of total national unity through integral conciliation by accommodating the minority. Thus, the Sudan called for a constitutional conference attended by all political forces to discuss questions and problems in order to reach solutions by peaceful means. Accordingly, the Sudan adopted a consistent position vis-\u00e0-vis the rebellion movement in the south, based on inviting it to enter into a dialogue instead of fighting.\nThe Government 's peaceful initiatives coincided with efforts to improve relations with neighbouring countries on the basis of the Sudan's foreign policy principles - that is, commitment to international and regional covenants, respect for sovereignty, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and pursuing a policy of maintaining good relations with its neighbours.\nOn the basis of those firm principles of our foreign policy, we moved to conduct more serious dialogue with our friendly neighbour Ethiopia in order to solve problems between our two countries and promote prospects for co-operation, with a view to establishing more stability in the region. We even aspire to making the whole region of the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa a secure and peaceful place far from the rivalries and conflicts of the great Powers.\nMy country is now faced with extremely difficult economic conditions. It is earnestly trying to cope with them through a four-year programme for salvation, rehabilitation and development and the formulation of strict substantive policies to restore balance and enable the economy to advance in a negative international economic climate. The Assembly is well aware of the adverse effects of that climate on the economies of the developing countries, especially the least developed countries.\nMoreover, we have been faced with great challenges and successive natural disasters. Our country, as the Assembly is aware, is host to more than 1 million refugees, due to my Government's commitment to international and regional covenants which regulate refuge. However, the burden of hosting refugees, given our country's complicated economic circumstances, which I have indicated, has surpassed our absorptive capacity and adversely affected our economic and developmental environment and efforts. The Assembly made reference to this in its resolution 42/129 by emphasizing the heavy burden on the people and Government of the Sudan and the serious social and economic impact caused by the presence of large numbers of refugees and its effect on development and infrastructure.\nIn this context, I should like to renew our thanks and appreciation for the generous appeal made by the General Assembly to the international community last Match to render immediate assistance to my country in order to enable it to cope with the increasing consequences of hosting increasing numbers of refugees. We also thank the Secretary-General for the joint missions we sent to the Sudan. It gives me pleasure to express our appreciation for the reports and recommendations which these missions have presented to the General Assembly.\nWe hope that at this session the General Assembly will be able to study the important proposal included in the Secretary-General's report (A/41/264) which calls for the establishment of a new group constituted of the States called \\\"refugee affected countries\\\", and that those States can obtain preferential treatment as regards international developmental aid.\nApart from the refugee crisis, my country has been exposed to a wide migratory ' movement from the south to the north as a result of the rebellion movement, which is increasingly supported from outside the country. My Government strives to provide those migrants with shelter, food, education and medical treatment. The United Nations and the international community have been helping us deal with this formidable disaster, which involved the migration of more than 1 million persons to the north and a consequent burden in terms of refugees. Even as that help was being tendered my country fell victim last August to a serious disaster caused by torrential rain and flooding, resulting in huge losses and the destruction of roads, railways, farms, houses, public facilities, communications systems and power networks. More than 2 million individuals lost their houses in Khartoum and the northern province.\nBefore these torrential rains and flooding ended, wide areas of the Sudan were invaded by locusts, posing a genuine threat to agriculture and the environment not only in the Sudan but in all the States of the region.\nWe extend our sincere thanks and appreciation to our sister States and Governments and to non-governmental organizations for their help in providing relief for the victims. At the same time, we hope that support will continue beyond the time of emergency to consolidate our efforts to rebuild infrastructure, public facilities and various projects concerned with production. In that connection, we consider it necessary to conduct studies of the increase in natural disasters, to which a number of speakers have referred. Studies have shown that in the 1960s disasters claimed 5 million victims, they claimed 15 million in the 1970s, and that figure has doubled before the end of the 1980s. I hope that phenomenon will prompt the United Nations and the entire international community to study the question seriously, to reconsider the performance of existing machinery, and to devise the best practical means and efficient methods and machinery to handle such disasters.\nWe hope also that the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its last session, which declared the 1990s as the international decade for natural disaster reduction, with a view to enhancing international co-operation in this field, will help consolidate ongoing efforts to confront these increasing disasters more effectively.\nFinally, I should like to reiterate our confidence in the United Nations and its leadership and in its capability to make an active contribution to strengthening international peace and security. Its achievements have confirmed its credibility and effectives as an invincible fortress of peace, prosperity and progress for the human race in line with the purposes and the spirit of the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with great pleasure and satisfaction that I have the honour of congratulating Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of this session. His vast experience in international relations and diplomacy gives legitimacy to our expectations that our deliberations will be successful. I should like to assure him of my delegation's determination to work closely with him as he discharges the responsibilities unanimously entrusted to him. I take this opportunity to recall the recent visit President Chissano made to his beautiful country, Argentina, during which we had an opportunity to explore ways for strengthening further the friendly bilateral relations of our countries.\nSimilarly, I should like to salute the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, for the efficient and commendable way in which he presided over the deliberations of the forty-second session and the special session devoted to disarmament.\nI take this opportunity also to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr, Javier Perez de Cuellar, on his commitment and devotion to the search for solutions to international problems as well as the promotion of better understanding and co-operation among nations. We have learned with great satisfaction tills morning of the decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. That fact represents a singular recognition of the outstanding, indeed unique, role played by the United Nations in promoting peace.\nThe situation in Mozambique continues to be characterized, on the one hand, by war imposed on us from outside and, on the other, by our firm determination to defend our independence and promote peace and progress.\nWhen addressing the last session of the General Assembly, in this Hall, His Excellency President Joaquim Alberto Chissano of the People's Republic of Mozambique referred to the massacres, the widespread destruction of social and economic infrastructures and the extremely large number of displaced Mozambicans, both inside and outside the country. In general terms, that situation still prevails today. The criminal acts of the armed terrorists continue to spread sorrow, pain, famine, insecurity and homelessness to many Mozambicans.\nBut that is just one side of the coin. The other gives rise to increased optimism in our people as a result of the victories we have scored on the military, economic and diplomatic fronts. On the military front, our armed forces have been able to restore peace and tranquillity to various parts of our country previously affected by the criminal acts of the armed terrorists. In this endeavour, the support and participation of the front-line States, notably Zimbabwe and Tanzania, continue to be important and greatly appreciated. Equally worth mentioning is the contribution of the Malawian forces in the protection of the Nacala railway.\nThe Mozambican Government is aware that these efforts intended to eliminate terrorism must be complemented by the adoption of other measures designed to integrate into Mozambican society the terrorists who have repented. As a result, our People's Assembly approved in December 1987 an important law - the law of amnesty. This law forgives those who have committed crimes, massacres and other abominable acts perpetrated against our people and the State. As a result of the application of this law, many terrorists have been granted amnesty and have returned to normal life.\nThe birth of the law of amnesty translates the deep-rooted nature of the humanitarian policy of clemency adopted by FRELIMO since the times of the armed liberation struggle for our motherland.\nAt the proclamation of our independence in 1975 a situation arose in which some Mozambicans were found to have committed, at the invitation of colonialism, heinous crimes against their own people or to have been collaborators with the colonial repression system. All these individuals were integrated into our society, and today they are working as valid citizens with other Mozambicans in national reconstruction.\nThe law of amnesty constitutes an integral part of our efforts to bring about reconciliation, unity and the rehabilitation of those Mozambicans who were brutalized through crime and terrorism and were turned into tools of our enemy. We are ready to welcome them in to our midst and to help them regain their dignity, rights and duties as citizens of a free, independent, sovereign, non-aligned and democratic State.\nThis process is taking place at a time when the Mozambican people are engaged in the preparations for the Fifth Congress of the PRELIMO Party and ace involved in the revision of the Constitution. These two processes constitute an example of the exercise of democracy in our country. They will strengthen democracy there and reinforce the fundamental freedoms of our citizens.\nWe are aware that our project and our dream of building a peaceful and happy society are shared by all peoples of the world and that they enjoy the sympathy of the international community at large.\nOne manifestation of such feeling is the visit of His Holiness Pope John Paul II to Mozambique. He was welcomed enthusiastically by the whole people, regardless of their religious belief, in a massive demonstration of national unity. We hope that his message of solidarity with, and wishes of peace to, the Mozambican people will find an echo in every corner of our globe.\nThose efforts go hand in hand with the economic and social recovery measures we have embarked upon. As we have repeatedly stated in the past, the war of aggression against Mozambique by armed terrorists is responsible for the overall retrogression of our development, not only because it entails the diversion of efforts and means away from other endeavours to the defence of our motherland, but also because economic sabotage and the destruction of socio-economic infrastructures were the most favoured policy of our enemy in such a war.\nThose who conceived the strategy of destroying our country first set out to destroy our economic base. During the last few years they have embarked upon wanton massacres, which have received widespread international condemnation. As a result of such a strategy, education and health care, which experienced considerable advances during the first seven years of our independence, are now confronted with serious and numerous difficulties, as can be seen from the following figures: 2,269 primary schools destroyed, affecting half a million pupils and 700 teachers; 400 teachers murdered, kidnapped or mutilated; 22 secondary schools destroyed, affecting 80,000 students; and 36 boarding schools and 4 teacher training centres destroyed.\nAs I pointed out earlier, terrorism does not affect only the economy, education and health. It also affects the Mozambican man and woman, the Mozambican child, the Mozambican youth and the Mozambican family, as the following figures illustrate: 1.1 million people have been displaced from their usual places of work and residences, and 800,000 of them are in neighbouring countries; 3.3 million citizens are seriously affected; 5.9 million citizens are in a difficult situation, affected by severe shortages, in both rural and urban areas; and 200,000 children are in a difficult situation - fundamentally they are orphans, abandoned children and children who had been utilized by the terrorists to carry out their criminal acts. In addition, there are a large number of mutilated citizens and citizens with physical disabilities. \nIt was in this dismal scenario of socio-economic conditions that we introduced the economic recovery programme and the emergency programme. As a result of the implementation of the former, it was possible to reverse the downward trend of the economy which had been taking place in the last few years.\nTo illustrate this, the data available for the first six months of 1988 suggest overall economic growth of 5 per cent. This percentage is higher than that registered in 1987, when the gross domestic product experienced a 4 per cent growth. This growth is primarily due to the positive evolution in the agricultural sector.\nDespite this positive trend, our country's economic and financial situation remains difficult. Foreign debt still constitutes an enormous burden to our economy, negatively conditioning its growth. Although there has been some significant progress in the debt-rescheduling process, there has been no generalised application of the more favourable conditions we have been seeking.\nThis situation leads to a net outflow of resources and thus prevents the allocation of finances required for the development of the productive sectors of the economy. Therefore, we hope that the consensus reached at the Toronto summit meeting regarding the provision of debt relief measures for low-income African countries will be vigorously and expeditiously implemented by all creditors. We call upon our development partners for renewed efforts aimed at an effective reduction of the stock of debt and debt-servicing obligations. In turn, in spite of its difficulties, our country will continue to do its utmost to honour its foreign debt obligations.\nIt is with high expectations that we look forward to the forthcoming second meeting of donor countries in support of our economic recovery programme, to be held in Paris next November. It is our hope that this meeting will mobilize adequate resources that will enable us to move to the second phase of our programme for economic recovery, which contemplates the rehabilitation of infrastructures.\nIn order to cope with the emergency situation, our Government has had to mobilize both internal and external resources. In April this year the Second International Conference on Humanitarian Assistance to Mozambique was held in Maputo, with satisfactory results.\nWe were particularly encouraged by the fact that the international community has recognized that it is imperative to supply the affected people with the means of production and building materials and other means required for the recovery of the infrastructures destroyed or damaged by the criminal acts of the armed terrorists, so as to enable the affected people to resume their normal way of life and production and become self-sustaining. I would like to seize the opportunity to express our gratitude once again to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, to-donor Governments, to organizations and agencies of the United Nations system, to governmental and non-governmental organizations, and to humanitarian and religious institutions, for the support they have been rendering to our people.\nLet me turn my attention to the situation in southern Africa. Only a few weeks ago the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique, His Excellency Mr. Joaquim Chissano, described the situation in the region as follows;\n\\\"Southern Africa is experiencing contradictory processes. One such process is the conflict which is rooted in the colonial past, in the persistence of the ambitions of domination, in the survival of apartheid, a political system based on inequalities of man and on racial discrimination. The other is that of solidarity amongst the peoples and States that pool their efforts together and combine their resources to promote social and economic development.\\\" The state of affairs in southern Africa could not be better characterized. Indeed, the front-line States realized at a very early stage that their fate is intertwined by roots which can be traced back to a common history of domination, colonialism and exploitation. Thus, they have found that pooling together their resources and potentials is a definite way out of servitude to alien interests.\nThe moral, political, diplomatic, material and military support that the front-line States are rendering to the People's Republic of Mozambique is a manifestation of this solidarity. When the blood of soldiers from the brotherly countries of Zimbabwe and Tanzania mixes with that of our SOLDIERS to safeguard sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, this solidarity acquires an historic dimension.\nMozambique, in its turn, made its modest contribution to the liberation struggle of other countries and peoples. Although Angola is experiencing difficult conditions, it has offered its territory as a rear base in the struggle for Namibia's independence, as did Tanzania, Zambia and others.\nThe Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) constitutes one manifestation of this common objective, as well as the affirmation of the unanimous will of the countries in our region to free themselves from oppression and economic domination through the integration of their economic potential on the basis of solidarity and co-operation. This solidarity is an important factor in the establishment and preservation of peace, stability and security in the region. The People's Republic of Mozambique is proud to be part of such solidarity. Southern Africa will owe its future of peace and prosperity to this unity, cohesion and solidarity.\nIn such an endeavour, however, we come across negative and destructive factors, which must be urgently eliminated. More specifically, we are referring to the persistence of values that are both as anachronistic and as abominable as only apartheid can be. In South Africa these factors manifest themselves through the institutionalisation of inequality, racial discrimination, injustice, division, depersonalisation, repression, oppression and refusal to recognize the fundamental rights of the majority of the people.\nIn Namibia, colonialism still persists and represents a source of violence and conflict. In other words, colonialism constitutes a serious obstacle to peace and development.\nPeace initiatives aimed at bringing about a negotiated solution to these problems are now taking place. The quadripartite negotiations involving Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States of America are developments in line with the wishes of the region and of the world. It is our duty to encourage the parties concerned to proceed, with seriousness and responsibility, in the negotiation process so as to ensure success and implementation. We also commend the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General in order to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nIn the framework of the peace initiatives in the region, a summit meeting between the People's Republic of Mozambique and South Africa was held in Songo. Its objective is to ensure the implementation, in letter and in spirit, of commitments entered into at Nkomati. These developments cannot, and must not, in any way be used as a pretext for certain members of the international community not to fulfil their duties and responsibilities to contribute to the eradication of the apartheid system.\nWe are aware that these efforts can bring about peace and stability only if South Africa honours its obligations., for this reason, the international community is called upon to intensify its pressure on South Africa to abolish its policy of apartheid and engage in the process of negotiations leading to the establishment of a democratic society in South Africa.\nA just and lasting peace in South Africa demands that an end be put to the state of emergency, repression and violence, as well as to other measures adopted by the South African regime with a view to silencing the voice of justice and reason. It also demands the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, with whom the regime must entertain a dialogue in order to find a just and equitable solution to South Africa's problems. Refusal to have dialogue with the legitimate and genuine representatives of South Africa's majority people can only delay further the solution of the problem and will certainly result in a greater heightening of tension in South Africa and in the region as a whole.\nThe People's Republic of Mozambique reiterates its support for the African National Congress (ANC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) - the authentic representatives of the peoples of South Africa and of Namibia respectively.\nThe People's Republic of Mozambique further reiterates its readiness to contribute to the process of negotiations currently under way in southern Africa.\nAs we review the international situation we cannot help but express our satisfaction at the positive trend we have witnessed in the last few years. The climate of dialogue between the two major nuclear Powers undoubtedly brings renewed hope for the future of international relations. We are increasingly witnessing recourse to the provisions envisaged in our Charter in the search for solutions to conflicts. They are peaceful alternatives based on the most elementary norms governing relations between nations.\nIn this context, we can cite such delicate conflicts as the Iran-Iraq war and those in Western Sahara and in south-west Asia as examples of the important role that the United Nations, given the opportunity, can play in the maintenance and the preservation of peace. We hope that the commitment undertaken by the parties concerned will be honoured and that peace, stability and security will prevail in those regions.\nIn South-East Asia, there is a willingness to embark on dialogue. We hope that such willingness will materialize so that, sooner rather than later, it can bear fruits that will contribute to the reduction of tensions in the region. Chad and Libya have given an example of political maturity as they choose to try peaceful means to solve the conflict between them.\nCentral America also aspires to peace and stability - objectives that can be realized only when there is respect for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries in the region. The dialogue now taking place must be encouraged. We would like to reiterate our appreciation of the efforts being undertaken by the Nicaraguan Government in order to find a peaceful solution to the problems of the region.\nAs I salute this positive trend in international relations, I cannot help but point out that other challenges still await us.\nThe Palestinian question, which is the core of the Middle East problem, must find a rapid and immediate solution so that the Palestinian nation can be established in peace, freedom and independence in its own territory. We consider that an international conference on peace in the Middle East would contribute to the solution of those problems. Therefore, we want to stress that such a conference should be convened with urgency. Similarly, an urgent solution must be found to the conflict in East Timor, where foreign forces have invaded and occupied that territory. We sincerely hope that the Secretary-General will be able to reactivate the process leading to self-determination and independence for the people of East Timor in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.\nThe reunification of the Korean nation has not yet taken place despite various initiatives and repeated efforts in that direction, which we support. We hope that the day will come when a unified Korea will be admitted to our family of nations.\nWe expect that the consensus reached at the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean establishing 1990 as the date for the convening of the Colombo Conference will be respected. We must therefore start acting now with vigour so as to ensure its success.\nThe sacrifices our people have made in order to defend our freedom and independence are truly enormous. Despite the generalized campaigns of terror and the crimes committed against our people, despite the destruction of social and economic infrastructures, the Mozambican people remain undeterred in the defence of their motherland and in the building of a future of peace, progress and happiness. It is in the search for attaining such goals, which ate much cherished not only by our people but also by the whole world, that we have been treading on such a hard and difficult path for about a quarter of a century.\nWe want peace. It is only with peace that we can rebuild out fatherland, use all available resources in our country, extend education and health care to everyone, eradicate famine, remedy the lack of clothing and overcome misery and underdevelopment.\nWe should like to reiterate our appeal to the international community to continue providing its multifarious assistance and support to our people so that they can as soon as possible ease their suffering and attain a lasting peace.\nThe struggle continues.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\nLet me join the speakers who have preceded me and extend Botswana's heartfelt congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. Your country and my own enjoy the happiest of relations, and it is with great pleasure that I assure you of my delegation's unstinting support and good wishes as you pilot the deliberations of this session.\nYour predecessor, the eminently respected Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Peter Florin, deserves the fullest measure of our gratitude for the very able manner in which he guided the work of the forty-second session. We will miss his unshakeable composure in the face of even the most trying circumstances.\nBefore I turn to the issues before us, let me reiterate on behalf of my country and my delegation our sincere condolences to the peoples of Jamaica and Bangladesh, who have recently fallen victim to natural disasters due to cyclones and monsoons. Precious human and animal lives have been lost, and untold damage to property has been registered. We hope the international community will be generous in its response to those two Member States' appeal for assistance. ,\nThis year, 1988, has been a watershed year for the United Nations despite the intractable financial and other problems the Organization has continued to face. With patience, perseverance and a complete understanding of the workings of world politics and diplomacy, our Secretary-General has demonstrated to us all that the United Nations is alive and well and capable of responding decisively to the crises of our troubled world, given the active support of its Members. Never before have we witnessed such prevalent and pervasive rumblings of peace occurring, as they have, in such a torrent, thanks to our Secretary-General's unyielding tenacity of purpose. We salute him and his team of men and women here at Headquarters and abroad, who have given the best of themselves and even risked their very lives in the service of world peace.\nIn this regard, I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General and the United Nations peace-keeping forces on the forces having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988.\nYet we cannot pretend that all is well in our Organization. We are all aware of the serious financial crisis the Organization is facing even as it is called upon to undertake a multiplicity of missions all over the world. How ironical: Even as the United Nations is daily demonstrating its capacity to fulfil its mission as the instrument of peace in the world, given the necessary wherewithal, we are told it must reform itself in order to earn the right to have, or to receive, the financial resources which are due to it in accordance with its Charter. The result is that the Organization has no resources to perform the most central and sacred of its duties: the maintenance of international peace and security.\nThe efficient deployment of resources by the United Nations is not the unilateral concern and preoccupation of one Member or a few Members; it is the common concern and preoccupation of all of us. That is why we all supported the work of the Group of 18 and its report, and continue to do so. The report of the Group of 18 vas, in our view, never intended to transform the United Nations into a plaything of the big contributors. Its purpose was to improve the functioning of the administrative and budgetary management of the United Nations, and not to  introduce weighted voting by stealth. It is in the interest of all of us to live up to our obligations under the Charter by the payment of our financial contributions to the Organization.\nThere has been a marked improvement in the international situation since the last session. There is a flowering spirit and atmosphere of rapprochement between the super-Powers, so happily evidenced by the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - the first of its kind in this cold-war era, and by the current negotiations on the reduction of strategic nuclear arsenals by 50 per cent, h welcome sense of realism about the dangerous folly of the philosophy of peace through nuclear terror seems to have taken root in both the East and the West. We have not seen the end - or the beginnings of the end - of the cold war not yet. But there are encouraging signs that at least the Powers that hold the destiny of our world in their hands are prepared to coexist peacefully across the chasm of their mutual suspicions and animosities.\nThe recent rapprochement of the super-Powers should augur well for international peace and co-operation. Co-operation of the super-Powers in the adoption and implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), on the Iran-Iraq war, for instance, would have been wishful thinking only a year ago, not to mention the pleasant novelty that is Moscow's and Washington's apparent convergence of purpose and interest in the ending of violence and strife in south-western Africa. This is a development we must welcome with genuine enthusiasm, because the efficacy of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular rests on the willingness and readiness of the super-Powers, in the first instance, to co-operate in carrying out the vital decisions of this world body. Their urge to wage their ideological war through reckless resort to their veto power in the Security Council will recede as they begin to reap the benefits of co-operation and as they realize that the United Nations is in fact the best vehicle for the promotion of their own interests.\nThough the stability of our world remains precarious, we have every reason to breathe a sigh of relief that some of the roost painful regional conflicts that have often threatened ignition of a global conflagration seem to be ready for resolution. As we meet here, the withdrawal of foreign forces is in progress in Afghanistan, a non-aligned South-West Asian nation that has endured a painful war since the turn of the 1980s. Thanks to the mediation of the United Nations and the unswerving determination of so many of us in this Assembly to stand by the people of Afghanistan in their time of trial and tribulation, a new era has begun in that war-weary country, an era which we pray and hope will be crowned with peace and stability. \nEven painfully hapless Kampuchea has become the subject of a growing series of consultative encounters among the countries of the region. The Jakarta consultations of 25 to 28 July 1988 are among those encounters, which we hope represent the beginning, however tentative, of the end of the terrible carnage that has been the lot of that tormented country for so long. For our pact, here at the United Nations, and at this session, the message must remain clear, unequivocal and uncompromising. Kampuchea belongs to its own people and in no circumstances should the United Nations, by silence or indifference, give comfort to the presence of foreign troops in that country of South-Eastern Asia. The people of Kampuchea, like those of Afghanistan, must be left alone to regain their inalienable right to self-determination after many decades of suffering.\nWe are somewhat encouraged by the visible signs of contact between the two Koreas, Our great hope is for this development to assume a more meaningful dimension leading to the peaceful reunification of Korea and this, to our understanding, can be fostered only through dialogue among the Korean people themselves; without external interference.\nThe Middle East remains a hotbed of strife and conflict. Although Iran and Iraq are currently seized of the arduous task of laying the foundations for a durable peace, the rest of that part of the world continues to endure turmoil. The tragedy of Lebanon remains unmitigated. Its territorial integrity continues to be flouted and violated with reckless abandon. We insist that Lebanon be left alone to seek its own path to Its own salvation. Keeping that tortured country in a permanent state of internecine strife does no service to the cause of peace in the Middle East. \nThe heartrending scenes that flash almost daily on television screens, depicting what passes for life in the West Bank and Gaza, are horrid indeed. For us from Southern Africa such scenes are a painful reminder of the horrors of apartheid. No day passes without an innocent and defenceless Palestinian demonstrator being maimed or shot dead for wanting to be free in the land of his or her ancestors. And we honestly wonder by what logic the senseless carnage on the West Bank and in Gaza and other occupied Arab lands is supposed to enhance the security and survival of the State of Israel, or of any other nation in the area.\nWe remain convinced that for Israel, as for the rest of the Arab world, including Palestine, there is only one sensible and realistic path to salvation and survival - the path of mutual accommodation and acceptance. We commend to all countries of the region the resolving of their differences through negotiation rather than by the use of force or confrontation.\nIn the South Pacific the people of New Caledonia continue to invest their hopes in the traditional an\u0402 mandatory responsiveness of this our United Nations as a vital and crucial complement to their own efforts to achieve self-determination. We take the view that New Caledonia is a legitimate candidate for self-determination under General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960 and Chapter XI, Article 73, of the Charter.\nIn Central America peace and stability still remain a distant dream. The peace agreement signed by the five Presidents of Central America in Guatemala on 7 August 1987 has not served the lofty purpose for which it was intended. The agreement has not been found to be in any way so flawed as to be un-implementable rather it has become a bone of contention in the debate on how peace and democracy can be achieved in Central America. There are those in the region who hold the view that more aid to keep the flame of the contra revolution in Nicaragua will do the trick, that anything else can only prolong the agony of the people of Central America, and Nicaraguans in particular. We beg to differ. We continue to support the Central American peace agreement and urge that it be implemented without delay.\nIn South America, the Falklands/Malvinas Islands dispute remains a source of concern and anxiety to us all. There does not seem to be any meaningful effort on the part of the parties concerned to work towards the resolution of the dispute. The bitterness of the 1982 conflict over the islands has lingered on and is clearly serving as an impediment to the resumption of the pre-1982 negotiations on the future of the Islands. Our view is that neither Argentina nor the United Kingdom can escape the fact that the only way for the Falklands/Malvinas dispute to end is for them to negotiate. We therefore appeal to the two countries to proceed to the conference table without delay.\nAllow me now to focus attention on my own region of southern Africa. No changes of major consequence have come about in the political fortunes of the region since the last session, even though there has been a lot of talk going on since May this year. This Assembly has already been fully briefed on the talks, the quadripartite meetings involving Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States, with a view to finding peace for what is called south-western Africa, namely, Angola and Namibia.\nTo the extent that the talks have so far produced some results that we can live with, inasmuch as they have not prejudiced any principles we hold dear in southern Africa, we certainly welcome them. For us the bottom line, the irreducible minimum demand, is independence for Namibia through the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and respect for the inviolability of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the People's Republic of Angola. Nothing less is acceptable. \nIn South Africa itself nothing less than the total abolition of apartheid is acceptable. Even if the quadripartite talks succeed in bringing about peace in Angola and the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in Namibia, the root cause of the problems of southern Africa as a whole will still remain unresolved. Apartheid in South Africa will continue to pose a threat to all the people of the region as it seethes with fury, waiting to erupt like a volcano, unless it is eradicated without further delay.\nBotswana would like to believe that the South African authorities have realized that the use of military force, such as the invasion and occupation of parts of southern Angola, was a dangerous venture which served no useful purpose as regards South Africa itself or the region as a whole. For our part, we would like to reaffirm our faith in the principle of peaceful resolution of disputes, which we commend to the authorities in Pretoria. But we are concerned that time is fast running out.\nIn order to create a climate productive to negotiations, the state of emergency must be lifted and all political prisoners and detainees released. Nelson Mandela and Zephania Mathopeng must be released, not only because of their age or illness but also because their continued incarceration deprives South Africa of what may be its only hope for salvation. Nelson Mandela, in particular, is the embodiment of the aspirations of the oppressed majority people in South Africa and there can be no meaningful negotiations while he remains incarcerated.\nThe violence of apartheid is the issue in South Africa, not the reaction of the African National Congress to it. That is what is to be negotiated; the end of the violence of apartheid and the democratization of South Africa, so that all its people, black and white, may at long last live in peace in a just society. Apartheid is the source of destabilisation and destruction in southern Africa. The front-line and other neighbouring States, some more than others, have all suffered as a direct consequence of apartheid. My own country has had continuously to run the gauntlet of South Africa's State terrorism, bomb explosions and murder and maiming of its citizens and South African refugees under its care, all for no other reason than the simple fact that we have become one of Pretoria's most readily available scapegoats as the anti-apartheid strife intensifies inside South Africa itself.\nLook at the destabilization the destruction, that has been wreaked upon Angela and Mozambique over the years by South Africa and its proxy armies of bandits, all in an attempt by Pretoria to preserve apartheid, For thE People's Republic of Mozambique, in particular, the United States State Department report issued earlier this year says it all. Nothing could be more horrifying, more heart-rending, than the revelations of that report, which we hope will awaken the conscience of those who support the objectives of the RENAMO bandits.\nOf late South Africa has launched a diplomatic offensive to conduct dialogue with African countries and thus break out of the prevailing state of diplomatic isolation it has brought upon Itself. This offensive will not help solve South Africa's internal problem. The solution roust be found inside South Africa by conducting meaningful dialogue with genuine leaders of the whole spectrum in that country.\nElsewhere in our continent we continue to be troubled by lack of progress in the search for a lasting solution to the question of Western Sahara. We continue to uphold the principle that the people of Western Sahara, like all other colonial peoples, are entitled to exercise their right to self-determination. In this regard, we commend the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for their tireless efforts to find a lasting solution to the question.\n  \n\nThe question of the Camorian island of Mayotte will never cease to exercise our minds so long as it remains unresolved. We therefore urge the French Republic and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the dispute.\nCyprus remains a nagging issue here at the United Nations and in the Non-Aligned Movement and the Commonwealth. We are adamant in our conviction that the solution to the problems of this divided island lies in the cultivation of mutual confidence between the Greek and Turkish communities. The current bi-communal talks must therefore be encouraged so that they may succeed. We continue to call for the withdrawal of foreign troops, as that would contribute towards a peaceful resolution of the dispute. We urge all concerned to co-operate with the Secretary-General in his untiring efforts to reach some accommodation.\nThe international economic system continues to be a cause of concern. Economic growth decelerated in the Western industrialized countries from 2.9 per cent in 1986 to 2.3 per cent in 1987. Because of their fear of high rates of inflation such as were experienced in the early 1980s, those countries refrained from providing the stimulus to their economies that would have maintained, or even accelerated, their rates of economic growth.\nThe impact of this economic sluggishness in the Western industrialized nations was felt in the developing countries, where the rate of economic growth slowed from 4 per cent in 1986 to 3.3 per cent in 1987 with the rate of population growth in many of the developing countries still in excess of 3 per cent per annum, this implies stagnation in the standards of living of the people. And even here it should be noted that most of the growth in the developing countries was recorded in the newly industrializing countries of Asia. Growth in African countries as a group either stagnated or was negative. \nFor the developing countries the prices of primary exports rose slightly, for others the prices of exports remained depressed. The rapid increases in the prices of manufactured imports led to a serious deterioration in the terms of trade for the developing countries and aggravated inflationary pressures within their economies. They experienced considerable strain on their foreign exchange reserves because of the inadequate purchasing power of their export earnings. The debt-service burden, in conjunction with the inadequate levels of export earnings greatly constrained the resources available for development and resulted in less than satisfactory economic performance.\nThe issue of indebtedness has attracted considerable attention recently, both at the international level and within the African region. Some donor countries and financial institutions have undertaken to convert some loans to grants, extend some grace periods and maturities on outstanding debt and reschedule debt payments. These concessions are expected to provide much-needed relief. The programme co-ordinated by the World Bank is designed to provide concessional assistance, on terms of the International Development Association (IDA) type, to heavily indebted IDA-eligible countries in Africa which are implementing structural adjustment programmes. It is hoped that the benefits accruing from these developments will not be offset by a further deterioration in the terms of trade or a reduction in current levels of resource transfers.\nAs 1988 draws to a close, despite the many favourable outcomes that have been recorded on the African and world economic fronts, there are various disturbing signs of accelerating inflation, rising interest rates, weakening commodity market prices and growing protectionism in the industrialized world that threaten to disrupt the modest gains that have been achieved. \nLast, but not least, my delegation welcomed at the outset the historic signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and the ongoing negotiations on the reduction of strategic arsenals. That is concrete progress at the bilateral level. We hope that the momentum will be maintained so as to yield fruitful results in the general question of disarmament.\nht the multilateral level, real progress towards disarmament remains elusive. This past May and June a special session of our Assembly, which had been expected to push a little further along the road to disarmament, ended without achieving the desired results. The failure of the special session to produce the desired results was discouraging, but it cannot and must not In any way signal the end of the disarmament effort. We must continuous to encourage the spirit of multilateralism.\nThe scourge of terrorism is still with us - terrorism perpetrated against innocents by individuals, groups of individuals and some States. It is a scourge that no explanation can justify, and it must be condemned unequivocally, regardless of its author. The typical imprint of what terrorism perpetrated by a State can do is there for all to see in the front-line States of southern Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere where whole villages have been reduced to rubble and hundreds upon hundreds of graves of innocent victims of midnight commando raids and aerial bombardments dot the ravaged landscape like bales of hay. This is terrorism in every conceivable sense, and it must be condemned without equivocation.\nI end my statement as I started it, by paying homage once more to this, our United Nations, for what it stands for to our Secretary-General for his inspiring and productive leadership\u00b7, and to his staff for their selfless devotion to their international duty. Our faith in this vital world institution remains strong and unstilted. It is our determination to preserve it, to strengthen it, to infuse it with a new sense of purpose and mission. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nit is indeed a pleasure and an honour for me to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo, on behalf of the Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago, our sincere congratulations on his election as President of this forty-third session of the General Assembly. In the light of the political and diplomatic experience which he brings to this office, we are assured that the deliberations of the Assembly will be conducted in a manner that will redound to the credit of his own country, Argentina, as well as to our region of Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIt is also with considerable pleasure that I commend his predecessor,\nMr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, for the efficient manner in which he per sided over the forty-second session of the General Assembly and the third special session of the Assembly devoted to disarmament.\nTrinidad and Tobago fully shares the view which the President of the Assembly recently expressed on the role of the United Nations as an instrument of survival for the small and medium-sized countries of the world. For that reason, we attach a very special significance to our member ship in the United Nations. We remain firmly committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Indeed, we steadfastly believe in the sovereign equality of all States, in the peaceful settlement of international disputes, in respect for human rights, and in international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character. We acknowledge that the Organization has not always lived up to the expectations which we harboured when Trinidad and Tobago joined the United Nations 25 years ago. Its role, clearly identified by the founding fathers in 1945, as the guardian of international peace and security and as the conscience of mankind has not always been fulfilled.\nHowever, there Is a mood of optimism which suggests that 1938 may well be recorded as the year in which the international community rediscovered the potential of the United Nations for solving seemingly intractable problems. The recent award of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces bears ample testimony to this resurgence of faith in the ability of the Organization to achieve its objectives.\nTrinidad and Tobago salutes the Important contribution made by the super-Powers in lessening international tensions. It also highly commends the work of our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose Indefatigable efforts in the cause of peace have contributed to, and continue to influence positively, the current international climate.\nIn this regard, I wish to allude to the signing of the Geneva Accords in April, which was achieved through the good offices of our Secretary-General and, in particular, the tireless efforts of Mr. Diego Cordovez, the former Under-Secretary-General for Special Political Affairs. We welcome most whole-heartedly the successful outcome of those negotiations between the United States, the Soviet Onion, Pakistan and Afghanistan, which has now set the stage for the resolution of the situation in Afghanistan. My Government wishes to place on record its appreciation of Mr. Diego Cordovez's services to the cause of international peace and security and to extend to him our congratulations and best wishes on his appointment as Foreign Minister of Ecuador. Lest his efforts be wasted, we urge the parties to the Accords to respect their terms and the spirit in which they have been agreed, so as to facilitate the work of the United Nations Good Offices Mission for Afghanistan.\nYet mother event which has given us cause for optimism is the recently concluded cease-fire agreement in the Iraq-Iran war. The Secretary-General is to be complimented on his success in achieving this first step in what is likely to be a long and difficult road to a final settlement. My delegation assures the Secretary-General of its complete support in his efforts to implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987), and takes the opportunity to urge both parties to do all that is possible to arrive at a permanent peace settlement.\nFurther, in Western Sahara the Secretary-General's mediation efforts, conducted jointly with the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, aimed at ending the war between the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARSO Front, appear to be bearing fruit. The recent agreement in principle between the disputants on a United Nations peace plan, which provides for a cease-fire, the deployment of United Nations peace-keeping forces and the conducting of a referendum on the future status of the Territory, is most encouraging. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago will continue to support this peace process, which should result in the just and permanent resolution of the Western Sahara conflict.\nThese successes represent signs of encouragement for the peaceful settlement of disputes and generate an element of hope and optimism about the willingness of nations to co-operate in the resolution of their problems. Small States in particular welcome these developments, since invariably such States stand to benefit greatly from an improved international climate. \nBut  while in these instances we have cause to rejoice, the situation elsewhere is far from  comforting. The disturbances in the Israeli-occupied territories have exposed the inevitability of change, as millions of Palestinians continue to be deprived of their basic human rights. We in Trinidad and Tobago strongly support the proposal for an international conference on peace in the Middle East, and feel that the terms of any settlement to emerge from such a conference should include a clear recognition of the right of all States to exist within secure and recognized boundaries, and the guarantee of a homeland for the Palestinian people.\nThe problems posed by the racist regime in Pretoria continue to plague the lives of millions of black people in southern Africa. There the white minority seeks to perpetuate its virtual enslavement of the black majority by banning and imprisoning its leaders, incarcerating children and denying fundamental human rights on the basis of race and colour of skin. For us in Trinidad and Tobago, 1 August 1988 brought poignant memories of the inhumanity of slavery, for we commemorated on that day the 150th anniversary of the emancipation of the slaves in the English-speaking Caribbean. As members of the Organization and of the world community, we cannot consider ourselves to have been truly emancipated so long as the black majority in South Africa is enslaved in the name of an absurd and discredited concept of ethnic superiority. For this reason, the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago once more calls upon the international community to bring about a speedy end to the system of apartheid by the imposition of a comprehensive regime of mandatory sanctions,\nTrinidad and Tobago are encouraged by recent indications that implementation of Security Council Resolutions 43S (1978), on independence for Namibia, may be imminent. However, the international community has too often witnessed the machinations of the Pretoria regime. We therefore view this development with guarded optimism, for we are painfully aware that many details of the process of withdrawal of armed forces from Namibia and preparations for the holding of elections in that Territory are still be to worked out. Many opportunities exist, therefore, for the South Africans to derail the process of implementation at any time. Trinidad and Tobago attaches great importance to the question of Namibia and will be paying close attention to progress in implementing the Security Council decision on the matter. We would like to think that at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly we shall have the opportunity to join others in supporting the admission of a free and independent Namibia to this world body.\nTrinidad and Tobago recognizes the limited progress made in respect of the problems related to Kampuchea and Cyprus, and we hope that the new initiatives being taken at the present time by the parties concerned will lead to a peaceful resolution of these outstanding issues.\nIn like manner, ray delegation has noted with some satisfaction that positive efforts are being made by both parties to bring about a settlement of the Korean problem through dialogue and negotiation. It is our fervent wish that this process will result in the resolution of the problem in accordance with the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the Korean peninsula. Coming nearer to home, my delegation notes with regret that progress towards peace in Central America has slowed down somewhat during the past year. The delegation of Trinidad and Tobago is firmly of the view that the spirit of co-operation that resulted in the Contadora initiatives and, more recently, in the Arias plan and Esquipulas II is a demonstration of the ability of the peoples of Latin America to devise appropriate solutions to their problems. We believe that progress towards peace can be achieved only where mutual trust and understanding prevail. We would therefore urge the countries of the region to work assiduously to create those conditions in their continuing search for a negotiated and lasting solution.\nIn this nuclear age, in which man possesses the capacity to obliterate life and civilization as we know it with his own weapons, the issue of nuclear disarmament will continue to be a major source of concern to all mankind, and rightly so. During the past year action in this critical area of international relations has produced decidedly mixed results.\nIn many respects arms reduction and arms control are a litmus test, not only of bilateral relations between the two major nuclear Powers, but also of the present state of multilateralism. The signing and subsequent ratification of the Treaty between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - were encouraging developments which, it was hoped, would have had beneficial effects on both bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament.\nUnfortunately, such has not been the case. The initial optimism brought about by the resumption of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction of their strategic arsenals has waned. Problems concerning verification procedures and differences over \\\"Star Wars\\\" testing still exist. \nIn like manner, the high hopes invested in the success of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ran afoul of unresolved political differences. The States Members of the United Nations failed to agree on the content of a declaration outlining a new programme for global disarmament.\nIt is also a source of deep regret to my Government that, 25 years after the signing of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, the international community has not yet succeeded in reaching agreement on a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We continue to believe that such an agreement could be achieved if the requisite political will were to be displayed. In addition to curbing the qualitative spiral of the arms race, the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago believes that a test-ban treaty would have an incalculably advantageous effect on both bilateral and multilateral disarmament negotiations.\nHalting and reversing the nuclear-arms race should not prevent us from focusing greater attention on the issue of conventional weapons. These have become more sophisticated, more devastating, and certainly more costly. Their use in the developing regions of the world since the end of the Second World War has brought untold misery, destruction and death. Their procurement has burdened, and continues to burden, too many economies in the developing world.\nThere is increasing awareness today that the accumulation of weapons, nuclear or conventional, does not guarantee security and that greater importance must be attached to social, economic, environmental and other factors that have hitherto been neglected. Is it not paradoxical that, despite this, we continue to squander stupendous amounts of financial, material and human resources on the development and acquisition of armaments?\nThis waste of resources is all the more deplorable when sickness, starvation, malnutrition and deprivation ,re still the daily lot of a large percentage of the world's population. It is the firm belief of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago that if only a fraction of the resources frittered away on armaments were to be devoted to developmental activities, it would result in a tangible improvement in the living standards of that vast proportion of humanity whose basic needs for food, shelter and health care remain unfulfilled.\nMany speakers from this very rostrum have reminded the Assembly of the dismal economic performance of the developing countries. That issue is of particular importance to Trinidad and Tobago, which, like roost other developing countries, is now threatened by rising levels of unemployment, falling export revenues, low commodity prices, and spiralling external debt. It is clear that in this decade the momentum of development achieved in previous decades by the countries of the South has been reversed. A great deal of the regression - and certainly of the stagnation ~ we have endured can be attributed to an international economic system that has not supported our efforts and that, at times, has even been openly hostile.\nIn response, developing countries are now implementing structural-adjustment programmes with the objective of reviving their flagging economies through the rationalization of their economic structure. The individual and collective experiences of our countries have demonstrated that this process of structural adjustment is painful and, at best; difficult. It must be handled sensitively and sensibly so as not to sow the seeds of political and social instability and unnecessary discontent.\nTo be successful ultimately, structural adjustment must be bolstered by a favourable international economic environment. An indispensable component of such an international economic environment is a free and open trading system that offers competitive prices for our products and allows us to exploit whatever comparative advantage we may possess. Trinidad and Tobago therefore looks forward to positive results emanating from the ongoing multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and, in particular, from the ministerial session in December 1988. We hope that the requisite flexibility will be displayed and will result in progress on issues of importance to the developing countries. We share the view that in the negotiations special attention should be given to completing the unfinished work of previous rounds before moving on to net; issues. The international community should take full advantage of this opportunity to restore discipline and equity to the international trading system.\nIt is imperative that there be an increased flow of financial resources to developing countries. Flows of concessional resources in particular, which have stagnated in recent years, need to be increased if developing countries are to obtain new money for investment. Such action would contribute to a reversal of a situation in which some developing regions have become net exporters of capital as a result of their obligations to service their external debt.\nThe Assembly must also address itself to the issue of debt, which is a major barrier to development and which, if neglected, will render futile all efforts at adjustment. Since the Assembly last met, there has not been any major breakthrough in the identification of a comprehensive strategy acceptable to debtors, creditors, commercial banks and multilateral financial institutions. In the interim, a series of new and innovative mechanisms, such as debt-equity swaps, exit bonds, secondary market trading, and conversion of debt into securities, have been introduced. Those new instruments, by themselves, will have little success in reducing the stock of debt and will merely reduce the exposure of some of the creditors. \nClearly, such an anomalous situation cannot be sustained. The community of nations, therefore, has no alternative but to elaborate a new and comprehensive strategy that takes into account the capacity of debtor countries to repay their debt to developed countries and financial institutions  and at the same time allows room for economic growth. I suggest that the search for such a strategy is not beyond the collective imagination, capability and wisdom of this Assembly.\nThe major multilateral financial institutions, particularly the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, must play a more constructive, supportive and progressive role in the global economy. They must critically examine their portfolios and disbursement practices. In keeping with their influence and prestige, they must respond to the demands of a constantly changing global economic environment.\nThere is no doubt that for many countries of the South there would be increased access to financial resources if the question of graduation were reviewed favourably by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Bretton Woods institutions, using the most recent information available. Trinidad and Tobago, which saw its per capita gross national product fall dramatically by 69 per cent from over $US 7 \u00a3,000 in 1983 to just over $US 2,000 in 1987, welcomes the decision of the World Bank to degraduate it. We call on the World Bank to review the graduation of other countries that we similarly experienced a fall in their gross national product. We call also on the UNDP to recognize the importance of using the most recent data available in its application of the concept of net-contributor status, and to follow the principle of the World Bank in identifying criteria which would ensure greater equity in the process of graduation.\nThe interdependence of the global economy requires the major industrial countries to recognize that the co-ordination of their macro-economic policies is a responsibility which devolves on them, owing to the substantial power and influence they exert on the international system. It is therefore incumbent on these States to reduce and eliminate the imbalances in and among their economies which have created distortions in the international economy. My delegation welcomes the corrective measures that have so far been taken and urges that they be continued and strengthened.\nIt is crucial for the community of nations to give form and substance to the reality of interdependence. It is necessary, therefore, to revive immediately the dialogue between North and South on the full range of issues encompassed in the concept of a new international economic order, To this end, the Trinidad and Tobago delegation supports the call for a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to address the interrelated problems of uneven growth rates, increasing protectionism, low commodity prices and the net transfer of resources from the South to the North.\nAmong the countries of the South there has been a growing awareness that we need to reverse the roles that we have been assigned in the international economy and to become active participants in, and contributors to, our own development. Reinforced by a shared perception and a common desire for a just and equitable global community, we, the countries of the South, need to stand together to tap and explore our tremendous potential and strengths. Our aspirations have found expression in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Group of 77 and, recently, the South commission. Trinidad and Tobago has supported, and will continue to support, the efforts and initiatives of these groupings and to encourage other developing countries to make greater use of the South-South dimension and thus translate rhetorical allusions to co-operation into concrete action. \nIn addition to the economic vicissitudes that developing countries have been encountering, we are faced with other threats to our sovereignty, security and well-being, in the form of cross-border criminal activities, including the traffic in illicit drugs and the highly immoral and reprehensible dumping of toxic waste.\nIn recent times the dumping of toxic waste in developing countries, particularly those in the Caribbean and in Africa, has become a matter of great concern. It is unconscionable that industrial agencies from certain developed States, oblivious of the serious threat to the health and the environment of the peoples of the regions affected, seem prepared surreptitiously to use developing countries as a dumping-ground for highly toxic wastes which they find difficult and/or expensive to dispose of at home. Furthermore, these activities place an unreasonably severe burden on the slender technical and management expertise of developing countries in monitoring this illegal dumping. We therefore join with others in deploring in the strongest possible terms this irresponsible conduct on the part of those industrial enterprises which are engaged in this pernicious practice.\nMy delegation has noted with appreciation the several international and regional initiatives being undertaken to address the dangers of trans-boundary movement of hazardous wastes. We urge the Assembly to request the competent specialized agencies, acting jointly, to take appropriate measures to formulate as a matter of urgency a comprehensive global convention to regulate and/or prohibit the trans-boundary dumping of toxic and other hazardous wastes. Pending the decision of an international convention, my delegation proposes for the Assembly's consideration that a moratorium be declared on further trans-frontier movement of hazardous and toxic waste. The second concern that Trinidad and Tobago has voiced on other occasions and in other forums relates to the illicit production of, trafficking in and abuse of drugs and to the interrelated trafficking in destructive weapons. My Government continues to be committed to the eradication of this scourge. We believe, however, that, in the strategies adopted to combat the drug problem, greater emphasis must be placed on efforts to reduce demand  as well as to improve facilities for treatment and rehabilitation. It will be necessary to continue to intensify and co-ordinate efforts to tackle this problem at all levels.\nIt is with grave disquiet that my Government views the callous disregard with which international conventions prohibiting the use of certain types of weapons have been flouted. In this context the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago proposed, in June of this year during the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament, that the United Nations commence discussion on the criminal responsibility of individuals who act in breach of relevant norms of international law. The Prime Minister also requested the Secretary-General to prepare, for submission to the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly, a report on the criminal responsibility of persons who use, or authorize the use of, prohibited weapons and weapons that cause unnecessary human suffering, or who engage in illegal drug trafficking across national frontiers. We are gratified that, at our request, an item dealing with this matter has been included on the agenda of this session. During the discussion of that item it will be necessary eventually to examine the existing international criminal codes and the possibilities of using international commissions of inquiry and of instituting, in the long term, an international criminal court. We are convinced that we can count on the support of other concerned delegations when the item is discussed. \nOver the last three years the United Nations has been in the throes of a financial crisis that threatens the viability of the Organization. There is no need to labour the point. The solution to the problem lies in the full and timely payment of all assessed contributions and the full payment of all arrears.\nMore recently, the United Nations has been engaged in reform mandated by General Assembly resolution 41/213, and much of the focus has been on a tightening of expenditures. It would seem, however, that due attention should also be devoted to the income side of the balance sheet and, since United Nations income derives almost exclusively from the contributions of Member States, a re-examination of the present methodology for calculating the scale of assessments appears necessary. One of the major drawbacks of this scale is that it is based primarily on per capita income figures - data which were never intended as a measure of capacity to pay.\nMy delegation believes that each country's gross national income is the \u00b7 corner-stone of that country's budgetary process, in that it in effect finances the country's expenditure. Naturally enough, each country's pattern of expenditure responds to its own needs, including its basic requirements of food, housing, health, education, public utilities and transport. These are some acceptable basic requirements - that combination generally defined as the infrastructure. It is my contention that the degree to which a country must concentrate its resources on the provision of this minimum standard is a significant factor in determining its capacity to meet its other financial commitments. Furthermore, measures such as the percentage of one or a few main export commodities to total exports, food imports as a percentage of domestic use, and external debt as a percentage of export earnings, among other things, determine each individual State's capacity to pay. \nMy delegation believes that the Committee on Contributions should focus on its consideration of the use of social and economic indicators with a view to devising a basket of minimum requirements which could be used to construct what I will loosely call a development index. This index, reflecting each country's developmental status along the continuum from least developed to developed countries, could then be used as a factor, a multiplier, convert caw per capita income into assessable income from which a United Nations rate of assessment could be calculated. The ultimate aim would be to adopt a simple, transparent formula for determining the scale of assessments, which it is hoped would be a straightforward process not requiring ad hoc adjustments or further resort to the mitigation process.\nThe issue of a programme of action for small Island developing countries is of utmost Importance to Trinidad and Tobago. As early as 1976 the General Assembly issued a call for attention to be paid to the special needs and problems of such countries, as reflected in resolution 31/156 and others, the most recent being resolution 39/212.\nAmong the catalogue of difficult problems faced by island developing countries the General Assembly identified their vulnerability to natural disasters - a vulnerability demonstrated very dramatically in the devastation wrought by hurricane Gilbert on our sister island of Jamaica. We therefore call on the United Nations to render all possible assistance to Jamaica and to accelerate the larger process by which the particular problems of these countries may be successfully addressed.\nIn conclusion, the Trinidad and Tobago delegation wishes to note that the improved climate of relations between the super-Powers, the recent successes of the United Nations in bringing to an end a number of long-standing conflicts and the  improved administrative capability of the Organization have confined to restore in some measure the credibility of the United Nations. However, notwithstanding these achievements, this body still has a long way to go to achieve the goals of the Charter and fulfil the expectations of the peoples of the world, to do this, it must be provided with adequate resources. More important, Member States must conduct their relations in accordance with their obligations under the Charter. Heedless to say, at this moment all the ingredients are present for bringing about a revitalization of the United Nations.\nAs we painstakingly pursue this formidable task, we must ensure that the basic principles that are the corner-stone of the Organization are strictly observed. We must seize the opportunity at this important juncture in the history of the United Nations, for it is only by continuous and universal adherence to the principles enshrined in the Charter that we shall truly embark upon a new and more positive phase in international political, social and economic relations and help to create a better civilization for all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Gabonese Government Sir, I offer you most cordial and heartfelt congratulations on your election to preside over the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that your experience, your long and praiseworthy career in international affairs, and the fact that you are a man of culture whose depth is recognized by all, augur well for a successful outcome to the session.\nI am also happy to take this opportunity to greet in you, Sir, the representative of a great country, the Argentine Republic, with which the Gabonese Republic, my country, has commendably close relations.\nI wish also to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Ambassador Peter Florin, your predecessor, for the outstanding way in which he guided the work of the forty-second session.\nThe Gabonese delegation includes in these congratulations and tributes to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. No praise is too high for his admirable initiatives and the action he has taken, aimed at calming tensions and securing the peaceful settlement of disputes, to give concrete form to the contribution of the United Nations, the strength of its principles and the soundness of its purpose of bringing about world peace and prosperity. \nGabon continues to be dedicated to those fundamental principles of international life as set forth in the Charter, just as we reaffirm that our foreign policy, based on the permanent quest for solutions conducive to peace and development, manifestly serves noble causes.\nThe work of this session is beginning at a turning-point in international relations, first with the commemoration this year of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, an ideal common to all peoples and all nations, and, secondly, with the setting in motion of a process of ending regional conflicts and eventually securing their definitive settlement by peaceful means.\nOn a number of occasions Gabon has emphasized that the establishment of the United Nations constituted a decisive phase in the history of the world and has expressed the hope that everything will be done to attain the goals and principles enshrined in the Charter in San Francisco. The fact that the Organization is contributing to the settlement or adjustment of conflicts by peaceful means demonstrates its ability to promote peace and international security. It is a source of satisfaction for m/ country to see the United Nations carrying out one of its missions in this way, thus earning the Nobel Peace Prize, which has been awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. This is a fitting occasion to point out that this event received special attention from the President of Gabon, Mr. Omar Bongo, who addressed a special message of congratulations to the Secretary-General in this connection. \nHow can we fail to express our satisfaction at the series of negotiations now going on in order to resolve the problems of the independence of Namibia; the frontier dispute between Chad and Libya, the Western Sahara and the Iran-Iraq conflict - to mention only those, we can only welcome the positive developments in each of those disputes, at the same time urging the concerned parties to show a spirit of open-mindedness and dialogue.\nThe commemoration of World Namibia Day on 26 August last provided us with an opportunity to note with great interest the development of the situation in that part of Africa, which we believe is destined to achieve independence in the near future.\nGabon welcomes the conclusion of the Geneva Accord providing for the withdrawal of South African troops from Angola and has been following with interest the modalities of its implementation, which, to be effective, require the consent of the parties concerned, particularly the front-line States. It was in that spirit that the President of the Republic of Gabon took the initiative of meeting, on 1 October this year, at Franceville in Gabon, with the Heads of State of Angola and Congo. There they discussed the question of the peace and security in Angola and the independence of Namibia, noted with satisfaction the positive development of the quadripartite talks which will shortly resume in Brazzaville and welcomed the efforts made by the People's Republic of Congo in order to secure the successful conduct of the negotiations. Further, they encouraged the parties to the negotiations to do their utmost to achieve a final agreement: as soon as possible, this being a prerequisite for lasting peace in the subregion. Without any doubt, such \u0430 meeting augurs well for the implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accord, the purpose of which is to organize free elections, under United Nations supervision, in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). \nThe entry into force of the cease-fire in southern Angola aid on the Namibian border, in accordance with the provisions recently accepted by the parties, confirms the positive role which they have played.\nWhile we therefore welcome developments in southern Africa, we must remember that southern Africa consists of more than just Namibia. The problem of apartheid is more than a source of concern in that part of the continent and it remains as grave as ever. Apartheid is considered a crime against mankind, as it excludes from the exercise of power some 20 million blades, who are constantly the victims of aggression and torture and whose lives were always in danger. It is thus a factor of permanent insecurity in international relations. Far from being excessive, the description of apartheid as a crime against mankind is now clearly widely accepted by the international community. Recently, under the auspices of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), two meetings were held in Harare, in Zimbabwe - an international conference of children against apartheid and a symposium of persons involved in science, the arts and letters, to promote the survival and development of children in the front-line States. That double meeting was an opportunity to re-emphasise the indignation felt throughout the world at the atrocities and sufferings inflicted on the black majority in South Africa.\nAt the Conference of Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries just held, in September, in Nicosia, representatives of States from all continents once again agreed on the wisdom of the description of apartheid as a crime against mankind and emphasised that its regime constitutes an insult to the universal conscience. The United Nations must attach prime importance to that judgement by the Non-Aligned Movement and find within itself the resources to meet this historic challenge. \nThe frontier dispute between Chad and Libya has always been in the forefront of the concerns of Gabon, particularly since the Organization of African Unity conferred upon it in 1977 the mandate of chairmanship and entrusted it with the work of the Ad Hoc Committee of Mediation charged with finding ways and means of bringing about a settlement. The forty-second session of the General Assembly has already given roe the opportunity to report on the conclusions of the first summit meeting of that Ad Hoc Committee, held in Lusaka, Zambia, in September 1987. I now take pleasure in reporting that in fulfilment of the decisions taken at that time the second summit meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee met in Addis Ababa last May, during the twenty-fourth summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity. In accordance with a resolution adopted by that body, and on the invitation of the President of Gabon, the Foreign Ministers of Libya and Chad met at Libreville from 7 to 9 July last for the first time, it should be noted, since the outbreak of the conflict. The representatives of the two parties then broached, in a spirit of open-mindedness and candour, all questions which needed to be discussed in order to bring about an atmosphere of trust conducive to the normalization of their relations in spheres of common interest, particularly those of diplomacy and co-operation. \nThe recent release by the authorities in Tripoli of Chadian prisoners, the recognition of the Ndjamena Government by Libya, affirmed here again by my Libyan colleague, and the recent decision by the two countries to restore diplomatic relations are the logical sequence to the meetings that I have described. We can only welcome these events and express our keen hope that the two parties, in good faith, will make whatever effort's are necessary to resolve all the questions still pending in accordance with the charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations Charter, in a spirit of fraternity and responsibility and in co-operation with the Ad Hoc Committee.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, the Secretary-General's visit to Africa in February 1988 enabled him to focus attention on this issue. The decision taken at the forty-second session of the General Assembly by the Chairman of the OAU and the Secretary-General to send a technical mission to that region for fact-finding purposes and to secure acceptance by the two parties of the proposed United Nations peace plan, which provides for a cease-fire followed by a referendum on self-determination, is a source of satisfaction for my country. We follow this momentum for peace with particular attention, since it will lead to a climate of detente and co-operation in the inter-Maghreb zone.\nWith regard to the Iran-Iraq conflict, my country wishes to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General and his Persons! Representative for their efforts to ensure the successful outcome of the Geneva negotiations aimed at finding a compromise satisfactory to the two parties in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987). My delegation takes this opportunity to appeal most emphatically once again to those two brother countries to associate themselves fully and in good faith with the process for the settlement of this conflict that la new being pursued under United Nations auspices,\nThe situation in the Middle Beat, particularly recent developments in the occupied Arab territories, is a threat to international peace and security. That is why Gabon reaffirms and supports our organization\u2019s Insistence that any settlement of the Middle East crisis must necessarily Involve the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied since 19671 de jure recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people; and recognition of the Palestinian right to the free exercise of their right to self-determination and, especially their right to their own State with internationally recognized borders.\nGabon also endorses the holding of an international conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned. Including the PLO.\nThe situation in Lebanon causes us great concern in particular because of the excellent relations between Lebanon and Gabon. That is why we call upon all the parties concerned to put an end to this fratricidal struggle, and for an end to all the foreign interference that has caused the threat of partition to hang over that country.\nWith regard to the situation in Afghanistan, Gabon endorses the principle of the right of the Afghan people to decide for itself the form of its own government and to choose its economic, political and social system without foreign Interference. My country welcomes all the efforts and initiatives that have resulted in the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghan territory, thus helping to bring about the political solution of the situation in that State.\nWe are also convinced that the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea is a prerequisite for a just and lasting settlement of the problems of that country, which must regain its inalienable right to choose freely its political, economic and social system.\nThe situation in the Korean peninsula is still deadlocked. Gabon, which is pleased to count both Koreas among its best friends, will support whole-heartedly any initiative aimed at the reunification of Korea. The agreement which the two Koreas have reached on the inclusion in the Assembly's agenda of an item entitled, \\\"Promotion of peace, reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula\\\" is an encouraging development and prompts us to urge them to persevere in their search for a negotiated solution, for a United Korea would be a guarantee of peace and stability in South-East Asia.\nThe mounting tension in Central America is also a source of great concern to my country. Gabon reiterates its support for the Contadora Group and welcomes the additional contribution made by the Lima group, since these provide the framework necessary for dialogue and better mutual understanding in the region. \nIn mentioning these various conflicts I intend only to highlight the commitment of the United Nations and various Member States, particularly the super-Powers, to reach a settlement with the increasing help of the Secretary-General.\nThe third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which was held in New York from 31 May to 24 June last, was preceded by the American-Soviet agreement on the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - in December 1987, demonstrated that the protagonists on the international scene are acting in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nParticularly meaningful in this general movement are the agreements that have been reached and the events that have taken place in the field of disarmament in the course of this year between the two super-Powers which will contribute to reinforcing detente in international relations. That is why my country welcomes with interest not only the American-Soviet agreement, but also the inclusion in the agenda of the current session of item 72, \\\"Review of the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security\\\".\nGabon considers, in particular, that resolution 42/92, adopted at the previous session of the General al Assembly and containing a provision calling upon members of the Security Council to take appropriate and effective measures to turn Africa into a nuclear-free zone, deserves practical follow-up. It is specifically in this context that Gabon, concerned about the future of Africa, notes with alarm and is watching the compelling manoeuvres, both treacherous and illegal, directed towards making our continent the depository, the rubbish-bin, for the toxic wastes of the industrialized countries. The agreements entered into for this purpose between some African countries and multinational enterprises have quickly been revealed as fool 's bargains.\nHence, at the roost recent summit meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa last May, such an operation was viewed as constituting a criminal act against Africa and African populations and that meeting recommended that member States of the OAU should participate in a working group to prepare a world convention to monitor trans-border carriage of harmful wastes.\nMy country can all the more easily endorse that step because it has not responded to the various offers that have been extended to it to give all or any part of its territory to those new merchants of death for the purpose of storing their dangerous products. Similarly, it endorses any initiative that has been taken within the United Nations directed towards preparing an international convention on the transfer of waste. We are therefore pleased to see that this question has been included on the agenda of our work and we express the hope that the General Assembly will consider it with all due attention. For our part, we are convinced that the industrial development of Africa must not become counter-productive, in particular by destabilizing its ecological and human balances. Development must be achieved in security in order truly to be a bearer of peace.\nHence, security and development ate interconnected. Disarmament and development are as well. This is a concern which, upon the initiative of our Governments, is being discussed in various international bodies, both at the world level and at the regional level. In this connection, my country approves the work that has been carried out by the Regional Centre of the United Nations for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, which met in Lom\u00e9, Togo, last February. \nIt is easy to note that, beginning from our Organization and its own involvement, this wind of peace that is blowing throughout the world is dependent upon the will of the parties to conflicts themselves, and, generally speaking, upon the restored spirit of mutual trust in the conduct of current international relations.\nThe work of the United Nations is not solely restricted to the political sphere. All Member States will agree in noting that the United Nations recently has been concerned at the particularly critical economic situation on the African continent. A number of its initiatives have led to the establishment, in December 1986, of a Steering Committee composed of the directors of United Nations agencies, as well as the establishment of an Advisory Group on Financial Flows to Africa. Each of these mechanisms is to recommend to the United Nations solutions which can limit the serious financial problems which our countries are experiencing.\nWith regard to the Advisory Group on Financial Flows to Africa, the roost recent Conference of Ministers of the Non-Aligned Countries noted that it had estimated a yearly shortfall of approximately SS billion between the real needs of African countries and prospective contributions. On the basis of that estimate, the Conference felt that it should emphasize the urgent need to reduce that shortfall. It seems timely to me to point out that the economic situation in Gabon clearly deteriorated in 1986, just at a time when its fifth five-year plan, begun in 19\u03b84, had very nearly achieved its objectives. In the course of that difficult year, the average price of Gabonese oil, our main source of revenue, fell by more than one half, the slump of crude and the decline in the rate of the United States dollar being at the root of that movement. The outcome has been a drastic decline in our gross national product. This handicaps our development and prevents us from finding solutions to our ills. These include insufficient infrastructure in river transport and telecommunications\u00b7, the use of migrant labour, which is expensive for the country, and the weakness of the agricultural sector, sharpened by the rural exodus.\nWith regard to this last point, I should like to tell you that Gabon is able only to meet 20 per cent of its food needs itself. The remaining 80 per cent dangerously affects our balance of payments, resulting in insufficient savings and systematic recourse to loans in order to finance any projects, to such an extent that debt servicing is becoming ever more heavy.\nHere and now 1 should like to thank the authorities of the United Nations Development Programme which, in the course of its work in the Governing Council in Geneva, from 6 June to 1 July last, annulled Gabon's obligation to become a net contributor to reimbursing pre-financing of some of our projects. This evidence of attention and pragmatism on the part of international organizations towards our country constitutes assistance which we appreciate at its proper value.\nHowever, these are not the only reasons why we are concerned when we know that, between 1985 and 1987, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa paid the International Monetary Fund a net amount exceeding $2.2 billion and, as was noted in 1966 by the Executive Secretary of the United 'Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Mr. Adebayo Adedeji, the decline in commodity prices and debt servicing caused an outflow of capital at an amount of 334 billion while, at the same time, Africa received no more than 318 billion.\nThe Final Declaration of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Geneva in July-August 1987 sheds a new light on our apprehensions in that, in view of the instability in export revenue from our commodities and the resultant vulnerability of the economies of our countries, UNCTAD is advocating a diversification of exports on the one hand and the preparation of studies of phenomena that impede such diversification. Despite a slight increase in commodity prices in 1983-1984, the unfavourable conditions that weighed on our markets since the beginning of the 1980s continued in 1985. The weakness of commodity prices in the course of recent years is due to the fact that despite increased supply of products, demand has hardly increased.\nWith regard to debt, in order to avoid its increase, our countries have had to reduce imports and sums reserved for investment. Despite this, the debt of Africa exceeds $200 billion. The debt and its servicing, between 1984 and 1986, averaged 310 billion a year. The figure will exceed 315.5 billion between 1987 and 1989.\nIn its 1988 report the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) emphasized that in sub-Saharan Africa the per capita gross national product had declined by 14 per cent in real terms between 19 80 and 1987, and said that this debt burden had destabilized internal economies by sharpening social conflicts and affecting expenditure on improving the human resources and material infrastructures essential for future development.\nThese data, which were reported to the Society for International Development by Mr. Stephen Lewis, the former Permanent Representative of Canada to the United Nations and now the Secretary-General's Special Adviser in connection with the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, revealed the extraordinary situation that our countries are confronting. That is why the member countries of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) defined a common position regarding the urgent convening of an international conference on African debt, since it is the aim of our countries to embark resolutely on the path of economic growth and development. The recent proposal of the Head of State of Gabon for a discounting of African countries' debts has the same objective.\nTaking all this into account, the Secretary-General has emphasized that the margin of manoeuvre available to Africa in the implementation of the Programme of Action has been reduced by an unfavourable financial climate. This justifies his conclusion that it is essential for the international community to act speedily to free additional financial resources and increase flexibility. \n\nI cannot conclude without referring to some social and cultural aspects of man's development in his dual dimension, individual and collective, which has been one of the concerns of our country, and, first and foremost, human rights, which cannot be forgotten this year as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nCareful thought and the expedience gained regionally, nationally and internationally have convinced us that there can be no development without a policy of promoting and protecting human rights, just as there can be no promotion and protection of human rights without a peace policy.\nGabon, a delegation which participated in the work of the meeting of the Governing Council of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in New York from 18 to 29 April 1988, greatly appreciates the recommendations made by that institution for overcoming the present particularly difficult economic situation. Among the measures proposed, the promotion of \\\"human adjustment\\\", which is designed to protect vulnerable groups while struggling effectively against the economic crisis, and the Bamako initiative, designed to lead towards the establishment of a self-help system with regard to medical assistance, enjoy our country's support.\nAs UNICEF has indicated in its 1988 annual report, the mortality rate for children under 3 years of age remains very high, at approximately 174 per 1,000. My country is pursuing a social policy with the following objectives\u00b7, to contribute to protecting the family, children and youth; to participate in the fight against such major endemic social scourges as tuberculosis, leprosy, alcoholism, venereal diseases and diarrhoea, epidemics, mental illness and juvenile delinquency. \nIn the context of this policy, vaccination, thanks to the expanded vaccination programme, carried out in our country with the assistance of UNICEF, had covered more than 50 per cent in 1987. Paediatricians noted five times fewer cases of measles than in previous years. Our country is pleased to see that UNICEF\u2019s activities have found their place within the broader context of the Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. This satisfaction extends also to the recommendation made by the Governing Council of UNICEF that the needs and priorities of women are taken into account in all projects that receive its assistance.\nWith regard to all these activities, Gabon would like to express its special gratitude to the United Nations for its pragmatism and effectiveness which certainly remains to be done. That is why I take this opportunity to assure the Assembly of my country's readiness to co-operate with the Organization so that together we may contribute to the progressive improvement of the social condition of mankind.\nAt this moment, as we reaffirm our dedication to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, we must declare faithfully that we will do nothing that might impede their achievement. Let us commit ourselves to do our utmost to ensure that these words become a reality, that the Organization truly becomes an effective tool in the service of peace, freedom, security and justice - values which mankind has perhaps lost, but which it hopes to regain in order to recover its self-esteem.\nThis is the message that I address to the representatives of other nations meeting in this Assembly, and the commitment that I reiterate on behalf of the President of the Republic, Mr. Hadj Omar Bongo, and the Government and people of Gabon as a whole. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset, on behalf of the delegation of the State of Bahrain to extend to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and our best wishes for success in fulfilling his task. Confident of his able leader ship, we assure him of our readiness to co-operate with him in the successful accomplishment of the work of the session.\nI should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend our thanks and appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, for his dedicated efforts, wisdom and skill in guiding the proceedings of the last session.\nPermit me also to express our deepest gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General, for his persistent endeavours firmly to entrench the objectives and principles of our Organization and enhance its role in achieving peace and co-operation among nations, for the well-being of all peoples of the world. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is perhaps a most eloquent testimony and convincing proof of the importance of the role played by the United Nations and its Secretary-General in the maintenance of peace and security in the world.\nThe year 1988 is reminiscent of a time when the United Nations, through its effective contributions to the resolution of conflicts between States, the maintenance of international peace and security and interaction with the policies of the various Powers that influenced international relations, was able to play a vital role in world events as a principal party in the new world order that emerged as a result of the realities of the period following the Second World War. It seems the international community once again feels the pressing need for the United Nations as a median for finding just solutions to international issues within the framework of the principles enshrined in its Charter and believes it has revitalized the role of collective diplomacy in dealing with outstanding regional conflicts and solving the worsening economic and social problems of the world.\nThus the United Nations has proved that international co-operation has become an urgent necessity at this time in the history of our contemporary world. The fact that most parties to regional conflicts are today resorting to negotiations through the United Nations is in itself the best indication of the trust States place in the Organization and the role it can play to achieve harmony and understanding among the peoples of the world. It is from this perspective that we call for concerted efforts to promote the effectiveness of the world Organization and strengthen its capabilities in facing the challenges that threaten peace and security and hinder programmes of economic and social development.\nResort to the Security Council and the General Assembly as effective organs capable of finding acceptable formulas to solve international disputes, and create favourable conditions for ending them, is a matter that demands our support and backing. Another cause for optimism in this connection is the budding positive relations between the five permanent members of the Security Council, the effects of which have been noticeably reflected in the collective decision-making process with regard to certain issues affecting world peace. It is to be hoped that this spirit will continue to prevail and that the foundations of understanding and accord among those members of the Security Council will become firmer and encompass all chronic issues. We further trust that this development will mark the dawning of a new era in which the spirit o\u00a3 the Charter will guide the rebuilding of bridges of trust and co-operation between all Members of the Organization.\nThe events that have occurred on the international scene since the last session carry the seeds of a new era in international politics, and a growing trend towards finding peaceful solutions to many of the important international and regional issues and problems in various parts of the world, such as the Iran-Iraq war, the questions of Afghanistan, Cyprus, Namibia, Kampuchea and Western Sahara, and the problems of Central America. However, despite such detente, other problems and issues still remain outstanding on our agenda, foremost among them the question of Palestine and the situations in the Middle East and southern Africa, which all call for efforts by the international community to create the right climate for the attainment of just and lasting solutions to those important and decisive issues. \nThe recent Moscow summit meeting of the two super-Powers was a historic event, an event of great importance that added a new dimension to international relations and has had a positive effect on several complex regional issues and crises. Furthermore, the great Powers are now more convinced than ever before of the necessity of finding common ground for peaceful coexistence and co-operation among nations. The frequent meetings between the leaders of the two super-Powers, their agreement to solve the question of Afghanistan and their ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - are a clear indication of the vital change of course so conducive to reconciling conflicting interests, overcoming ideological differences and reducing the possibilities of the confrontation that was the salient feature of relations between the bigger Powers during the previous period. For our part, we welcome with great satisfaction this important change in relations between the two super-Powers. We hope that their rapprochement will be used in the interest of settling fundamental international issues, so as to move from a stage of tension and suspicion to one of tranquillity and openness.\nBahrain welcomed the start of direct negotiations between Iraq and Iran under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It hopes that the two will be able to work out a comprehensive settlement of their armed conflict and establish comprehensive, lasting peace in the region, in strict accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 598 /\\\"87 which provides the just and honourable formula for ending that bloody war, which has been haemorrhaging for eight years now.\nIt should be noted, in this connection, that the Co-operation Council of Arab Gulf States adopted from the earliest days following the outbreak of that war a clear policy that was reflected in the decisions of the consecutive summit meetings of its observer States and reaffirmed at their eighth summit meeting, in Riyadh, in December 1987. In this connection, the Council had expanded considerable efforts to contain that destructive war and to restore peace to the region.\nIran's decision to accept the Security Council resolution, which our brother Iraq had already accepted upon its adoption by the Council, and Iran's agreement to the cease-fire and the commencement of discussions at Geneva constitute an important step towards peace. It is our hope that Iraq and Iran will be able to overcome their difficulties, overcome the psychological effects of the war and re-establish normal relations, within the framework of the principles of good-neighbourliness, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, to be able to devote all their efforts to the reconstruction made necessary by the devastation of the war, provide for the safety and peace of mind of their two peoples and restore security and stability in the Gulf region.\nThe negotiations between Iraq and Iran are now in a delicate phase, which calls for the utmost prudence and self-restraint, and the avoidance of any action that might hinder the peace process. We therefore call upon all nations of the world to shoulder their responsibility to help both countries overcome this difficult phase, and to exert greater efforts aimed at securing the success of these negotiations and the full implementation of the provisions of the Security Council resolution, so that a new era can begin when guns fall silent and peace prevails.\nIn this respect, I cannot but note the strenuous efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, so deserving of all our praise and appreciation, aimed at securing the implementation of Security Council 598 (1987), whose objective is the end of one of the longest and fiercest wars of our times. The role of the United Nations and the Secretary-General will remain central to the process of restoring peace to this vital region of the world.\nThe question of Palestine, though marked by more than 40 years of the conspicuous failure of right in the face of might, represents a major historic tragedy of an exceptional kind, as the international conflict fraught with the most danger for the peace and security of the world.\nInternational interest in this issue, ever since the adoption by the General Assembly in 1947 of resolution 181 (II) on the partition of Palestine, has been ebbing and flowing with the changing tide of international events and developments. It was not until December of last year that the question of Palestine began to experience a major change of course and to acquire a new measure of interest by the world public. This brought it once again to the forefront of the issues on the agenda of the United Nations. This was the result of the all-encompassing public uprising in the occupied territories, the intifada, which has become the major feature of the life-style of the Palestinian people in their steadfast resistance to the Israeli occupation, which has now continued for more than 21 years.\nThe intifada is a historic event replete with examples and lessons. It is the genuine human expression of man's rejection of occupation and oppression. The Zionist entity, falling victim to its own illusions, convinced itself that the Palestinian people had fully absorbed the meaning of Israeli supremacy in terms of physical power, and forgot, or chose to ignore, that sources of moral power have a massive momentum in the lives of peoples. Israel has tried to no avail, to contain the Palestinian uprising by resorting to the most brutal methods, such as burying people alive, breaking bones and limbs, shooting at unarmed women and children, burning crops and plantations, expulsions, and the assassination of Palestinian leaders, a recent victim of which was the well-known freedom-fighter Khalil al-Wazeer.\nDespite the escalating brutality of the Israeli acts of suppression aimed at quelling the Palestinian uprising, a number of basic facts remain unchanged and un-obscured and Israel can no longer disregard or deny them.\nFirst, the Palestinian struggle has acquired a new dimension since the inhabitants of the occupied territories developed their uprising from spontaneity to calculated confrontation and conscious initiative.\nSecondly, the Palestinian people, through their steadfastness and persistence in their heroic uprising, decided definitively any question of coexistence in the conditions of occupation. It has become impossible, to continue to disregard their inherent right to self-determination.\nThirdly, the policies of settlement and annexation, resulting in permanent tensions and flagrant violations of the United Nations resolutions and international law, have met with complete failure.\nFourthly, the cause of the Palestinian people is gaining more support and greater solidarity day by day from peace-loving peoples and countries throughout the world, thus increasing Israel's international isolation.\nIn view of these basic and established facts, and in the light of recent events following the decision by our brother Jordan to sever its legal and administrative ties with the West Bank, it is now more than ever before incumbent upon the United Nations, to shoulder its historic responsibility regarding the Palestinian people and make the necessary arrangements to put into action the mechanism for a solution by convening the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, vested with full powers and backed by International guarantees. In that conference the Palestine Liberation Organization will participate on an equal footing with the other parties to the dispute and the five permanent members of the Security Council will also take part, with a view to guaranteeing a just and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, securing Israel's complete withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied in 1967, particularly Jerusalem, and enabling the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate and inalienable rights, including their right to return'-and their right to self-determination and to establish their own independent State on their national soil.\nNot content with carrying out its expansionist designs against the territory of Palestine, Israel has continued its assaults on and acts of aggression against other Arab States. Thus, it declared its annexation of the Syrian Golan in 1981, it attacked the Iraqi nuclear installation that same year, and it bombarded the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis in 1985. Furthermore, the misfortune that had beset fraternal Lebanon and left it with a legacy of disasters from which it continues to suffer would not have worsened had it not been for Israel's continuing aggression. Israel's recurrent attacks and violations of the territorial integrity and political independence of Arab States constitute flagrant breaches of the Charter and United Nations resolutions. That serious situation underlines the need for a just peace and for stability in the Middle East region, both of which can be achieved only if the international community, represented by the United Nations, moves to exert pressure on Israel to force it to comply with international principles and instruments.\nBahrain welcomes the responsible position taken by sisterly Morocco reflected in its wise and far-sighted decision regarding settlement of the dispute in Western Sahara by peaceful means, in accordance with Security Council resolution 621 (1988). It is our hope that the endeavours of the Secretary-General in that respect will meet with success.\nThe sorry state of the Afghan people, which has lasted for more than eight years, is now approaching its end as a result of the Geneva Agreements of 14 April 1988 relating to the political settlement of the various aspects of the question of Afghanistan. In our view, that development is a practical translation of the relevant United Nations resolutions calling for restoration of Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity and marks an important step towards enabling the Afghan people to exercise their right to choose their own political and social system without foreign interference and to create conditions favourable to the return of the Afghan refugees to their homeland in dignity and safety.\nWe are hopeful - indeed, we are optimistic ~ that the Geneva Agreements will create a positive precedent for solving other regional conflicts such as those in Kampuchea, Cyprus and elsewhere. \nWith regard to the Korean question, we trust that the consensus reached on inscribing it on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly will be another serious step towards the resumption of negotiations between the two sides, with a view to achieving the reunification of the Korean peninsula and realising the desire of the Korean people for restoration of their national unity.\nThe situation in southern Africa is continuing to deteriorate, and this in turn affects peace and security in that important part of the African continent. That deterioration is reflected in its ugliest forms in the violence, terrorism and oppression of every kind being perpetrated by the Pretoria racist regime against the black majority in contempt of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe worsening conditions in South Africa confirm our deep conviction that attempting to reform the apartheid regime is futile: it must be dismantled - indeed, eradicated - and replaced by a democratic system based on justice, equality and respect for human rights, as called for by the United Nations in its numerous resolutions. In our view, that can be achieved only through concerted international efforts to Isolate that regime and impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against it in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\nA harbinger of Namibian independence appears on the horizon this year thanks to the talks that have taken place between Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States of America. It is cause for optimism that the United Nations plan for the Independence of Namibia, which represents the common aspiration of the international community on this tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), will be implemented\u00b7\nThe crisis that continues to beset the international economic order is still having an adverse effect on the economies of the developing countries. Regrettably, the favourable climate in international relations that has prevailed this year has not been matched by any perceptible progress in economic co-operation at the international level. It is self-evident that the lack of economic stability in most developing countries was due to the imbalances in the world economy that resulted from increased protectionist measures, the lack of equilibrium in the balance of world trade, -the foreign-debt crisis, the fluctuations in the rates of exchange, unfair trade practices, the instability of the prices of commodities and raw materials, the plummeting oil prices, and deteriorating terms of trade.\nThe debt crisis of the developing countries is the major item on the agenda of many international conferences. The question how to resolve that crisis has become the subject of continued study and research in various international organs, agencies and forums. While we welcome the satisfactory results achieved at the Toronto summit meeting of the major industrial States with regard to settling the debts of the least-developed countries, we feel that the time has come for advancing from the phase of partial solutions to the adoption of an integrated global strategy for solving the crisis. In this context we emphasize the importance of financial-assistance flows from multilateral development institutions and developed countries to the developing countries on concessional terms and under reasonable conditions. This would enable them to implement their development plans and to achieve economic recovery and prosperity for their peoples.\nIn today's world of interrelated interests the United Nations has become an indispensable need, since it is the only international machinery capable of solving complex problems and settling international dispute. Despite the crises it has encountered since its inception and the shortcomings that have marred its experience during the past 43 years, the United Nations remains a unique and pioneering experience in international relations; it remains a permanent body for collective diplomacy through which the peace and security of the world can be maintained and solutions can be found for the political, economic and social international problems and issues that States, at various levels, capabilities and capacities, are no longer able to solve unilaterally.\nTherefore we must work shoulder to shoulder. Governments and peoples together, in order to strengthen and uphold this important international institution as an imperative necessitated by the living conditions of the modern international community in order to enable the United Nations to be more capable of meeting the requirements of the future and of building a better world for coming generations, especially as we stand at the threshold of the twenty-first century, with its promise of immense scientific progress and advanced technologies in all fields.\nIssues of disarmament and arms control occupy a prominent position on the list of the international community's concerns. One can only hope that concrete achievements at the international level will be an incentive for all to join in the efforts being exerted in that field.\nConsistent with the principle of the maintenance of international peace and security enshrined in the Charter, and without conviction that it is imperative to create a less-heavily armed and more secure world, I take pleasure in announcing from this rostrum today that the Government of the State of Bahrain has decided to accede to the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the 1925 Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare and to the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxic Weapons and their Destruction. Ever since it achieved its independence Bahrain has called upon all nations of the world to pursue balanced policies in their relations with one another, to resort to dialogue for settling disputes through the diplomacy of understanding and the renunciation of the use of force in order to promote the principles of peace based on justice.  Peace is the strategic front-line of Bahrain's foreign policy. It is also the true key to realizing national aspirations and objectives in conditions of stability and development. The peace in which Bahrain believes is equitable peace fostering relations of friendship and understanding among the world's States and peoples, based on good-neighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, equal sovereignty and rights, and respect for the rules of international law. This has been enunciated clearly by His Highness Sheikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa, of the State of Bahrain.\nThe State of Bahrain bases its relations with other States in the world on equality and mutual respect. Proceeding from our firm belief that peace and security are the foundations on which mankind builds its progress, we shall always endeavour to strengthen them and respond sincerely to anyone who supports international legality and aims to strengthen the underpinnings of truth, justice and peace in the world.\\\"\nIn conformity with that firm, clear line for Bahrain's foreign policy, the State of Bahrain expresses once again its readiness to co-operate with the other countries of the world to achieve the lofty goals of the United Nations, and it stresses its commitment to the diplomacy of peace in line with the principles enshrined in the Charter of our Organisation.\n"

Just recognition of these efforts is clearly expressed by the recent award of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, to our great satisfaction.\nSince 1945 the Republic of Paraguay has never doubted that the world needs an Organization respected by all States, based on international law and the noble principles of justice, peace and security, which would at all times guarantee the peaceful settlement of disputes, continuing social and economic development, respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, and other no less important principles, such as the territorial integrity of States and the equality of all countries under the law.\nWe have never understood the position of those States which, forgetting their moral obligations to the Organization, do not take advantage of this forum for the settlement of international conflicts, thus depriving the United Nations of its leading role, which must be recognized because of the purposes for which it was founded.\nToday our hopes are rising once more because the importance of the United Nations is being recognized with new understanding wherever problems of international law have to be solved, thanks to the productive work of the Secretary-General and his special representatives and to the change of attitude which at last seems to have occurred, so that States are  prepared to reach solutions to their disputes with the help of our Organization.\nOn behalf of the Republic of Paraguay, I wish to express our satisfaction at the good news that preceded the opening of this session of the General Assembly of the possibility of chronic conflicts being solved through the effective intervention of our Organization. We hope that time will prove that we are right, that what now presents itself as merely the glimmer of a solution will become an effective reality, to the benefit of all peoples, and that It may be said once  again that there was a moment in history when Governments gave the United Nations effective means of solving problems that had seemed insoluble. Such is the case with regard to the Persian Gulf war the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, the possibility that foreign soldiers will be withdrawn from Cambodia\u00b7, the possibility of a peace agreement between Angola, Cuba and the Republic of South Africa; and the beginning of a dialogue, in auspicious conditions, between the two communities in Cyprus.\nI cannot do better than recall here certain passages from the statement made in this forum by the President of the Republic of Paraguay, General Alfredo Stroessner, at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We said: \u201cI am honoured to bring to this lofty forum the voice of the Republic of Paraguay, the thinking of a nation truly dedicated to peace, which shares universal ideals of security, freedom, justice and development. The Republic of Paraguay firmly upholds the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, the legal equality o\u00a3 nations and the self-determination of peoples. In all international forums we maintain clear positions in favour of relations between nations based on fair legal principles of mutual respect and co-operation.\nIn the United Nations and in the Organization of American States (OAS), we uphold the principles of friendship and co-operation, with full confidence in the beneficial results that accrue whenever relations between States are established with goodwill and in a spirit of solidarity. At all international events, conferences and meetings we speak the constructive language of peace, thus projecting the reality being led by the Republic of Paraguay. Paraguayan constitutional law takes as its essential principles respect for international law; condemnation of wars of aggression and conquest and all forms of colonialism and imperialism, the peaceful settlement of international disputes by lawful means; respect for human rights and the sovereignty of peoples; and the aspiration to live at peace with all nations.\\\" (A/S-lS/PV,e, pp. 3, 4)\nThe desire of the peoples for a genuine peace that will improve their relations with each other is universal. Nations, without exception, cherish international law and view with concern the unilateral decisions taken by certain States in their relations with other countries, which damage not only the prestige of the United Nations but also the essential principles of its Charter, the purpose of whose adoption was to banish the evil of war, injustice, the predominance of brute force, foreign intervention in the affairs of other States, and all the other evils that affect the relations between peoples.\nMy country takes this opportunity to express its gratitude to the whole United Nations system for the work it does in all areas, and especially for the efforts made on behalf of land-locked countries with a relatively low degree of development. We are grateful for the continuing assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which has carried out and follows up so many projects all over the world to reset the need for technology to be at the disposal of less developed countries. At the risk of repeating ourselves, we must say that this victory of our times puts an inescapable moral obligation on the wealthiest countries at a time when extreme poverty robs men of their dignity in so many parts of the world. The poor in La tin America number 173 million. Of this number, in 1985, 61 million lived in extreme poverty. If this trend continues, the poor in Latin America will number 204 million by 1990, according to the UNDP. That body also says that there is a social debt of 3280 million - the sum that these countries would have to invest to eradicate poverty.\nThese really shocking figures must, of course, be seen in relation to the foreign debt problem of the countries of Latin America, at a time when development demands new investments, and the prices of raw materials from the developing world are not remunerative. Although the Republic of Paraguay, fortunately, is not in the same situation as many other countries of the region, we feel complete solidarity with all those who see their future jeopardized by this problem, which is so radically bound up with development and the improvement of living standards. This problem requires not only economic but also political solutions which recognize the moral obligation of the super-industrialized world to the less developed countries. In 1987 the regional foreign debt amounted to $410 billion, and in the last five years the continent has remitted 3150 billion to the international banking system just for debt servicing, amortization and interest, without reducing the capital debt, which in fact has increased because of new loans, in a dangerous race between attempts to improve the life of the majority of our peoples and the unfair distribution of income between North and South.\nThe problem of the foreign debt is so serious that recent United Nations reports advise creditors to reduce the amounts owed by up to 30 per cent, because otherwise there will be no possibility of fulfilling commitments or resolving satisfactorily the problems deriving from this troubling question. Highly specialized Latin American technical organizations have expressed the opinion that solution of the foreign debt problem is very closely related to an increase of trade in the region and a substantial improvement in the prices for commodities at which the debtor countries sell to the industrialised world.\nThe Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization deserves our praise. We ate familiar with the Secretary-General's commitment to fulfil his difficult and noble responsibilities as a man of peace, conciliation und dialogue at the international level. There are always factors which undermine world order and peace and which are not precisely within the area of competence of the United Nations, but time has shown that selfish, unilateral decisions are becoming more rare, especially in the light of what is happening at the present time, which shows that the work of the Organization and the Secretary-General is having positive results, despite the many difficulties on the thorny path of peace, justice and the peaceful settlement of disputes. \nThe Republic of Paraguay is experiencing an encouraging growth in its economy. For example, the rate of growth of our gross national product, which was 4.3 per cent in 1987, has reached almost 6 per cent this year as a consequence of good prospects, basically in the agricultural sector. Therefore, despite the adverse world economic conditions, the Republic of Paraguay - according to a report by the World Bank - is among the countries with the highest average rate of growth during the past two decades. Sources in the Economic Commission for Latin America confirm that the cumulative growth rate of the gross national product from 1980 to 1987 was 16.9 per cent - one of the highest rates among the Latin American non-oil-exporting countries.\nThis forward movement of the Paraguayan economy is the result of putting into effect a plan to give an impetus to the economy, that has been done with discipline and austerity, in a climate of peace and serenity.\nThe economic and financial strategy and the great efforts that have been exerted have had and still have the objective of achieving continuing development, to counteract the adverse trends in the terms of trade, the burden of amortizations and interest payments, and the low investment inflow. Those factors compel all the developing countries to take strong economic adjustment measures.\nNevertheless, despite the unsteady evolution of the world economy owing to restrictions on international trade and the Latin American external-debt problems, the Republic of Paraguay continues its efforts to promote a better quality of life, education and public health within the country; it also continues to encourage agricultural and industrial development as well as doing a great deal of work on the basic infrastructure. On the other hand, because of the brotherly ties of friendship between my country and its neighbours, we have in mind large-scale integration projects which will have a broad and favourable impact on development within Latin America. In that regard, it should be noted that, with the beginning of the commercial operation of turbines 12 and 13, envisaged for the end of this year, Itaipu - the largest dam in the world, built jointly with the Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil - will generate 9,100,000 kilowatts. Similarly, there has been no interruption in the construction of the Yacireta hydroelectric dam on the Parana River, with a power of 4,050,000 kilowatts, or the construction of an international 2,600-metre bridge, which is now nearing completion. Both projects are being carried out in conjunction with the Argentine Republic. These large undertakings have already had the following positive effects\u00b7, the availability of abundant electric power\u00b7, possibilities for electro-intensive industries and the export of the energy from those industries\u00b7, the electrification of villages and towns in the interior of the country, from which 289 communities have so far benefited.\nWe should also emphasize the facilities that are granted to us by brotherly countries in free ports such as Paranagua and Rio Grande do Sur in Brazil, Rosario and Buenos Aires in Argentina, Nueva Palmira and Montevideo in Uruguay, Antofagasta in Chile, and Matarani in Peru\u00b7, the latter two are on the Pacific coast.\nI mention those examples of growth, efforts and sacrifices in order to demonstrate the vigour of a Government that is aware of its responsibilities and is seeking a quality of life for its people that is in keeping with the progress of our civilization.\nOn 15 August this year, a new period in the life of the Government began, in conformity with the national Constitution. That Constitution was promulgated in 1967; it was the undisputed product of the National Constituent Assembly, made up of four political parties. The elections for the five-year period 1988 to 1993 were free and direct, in accordance with the provisions of the electoral law. The right to vote was exercised, as usual, with many options and within the specific time-limit established by the law. The three branches of State power are functioning freely, and the nation is moving towards the attainment of better goals of progress and development in a multi-patty environment open to all democratic political trends that are in keeping with legal rules that are the same for everyone.\nThe Persian Gulf war has been and still is a matter of concern to the Republic of Paraguay. It appears that the war has come to an end, thanks to the skilful negotiations carried out by the Secretary-General and to the moral authority of our Organization. We applaud the good spirit shown by the parties involved, who have rejected intolerance and chosen, instead, conciliatory dialogue. The Republic of Paraguay hopes that these efforts will succeed, so that world peace may be strengthened.\nAnother cardinal subject among the International conflicts threatening international peace and security continues to be the thorny question of Afghanistan. That question can be summed up as armed intervention by a super-Power that shows contempt for the principles of the self-determination of peoples and non-intervention in the internal affairs of nations. The news about the gradual withdrawal of the occupying troops indicates another extraordinary achievement by the United Nations. That is a source of satisfaction to the international community and a sign that international practice is again moving towards respect for the sovereignty of States, in accordance with another principle, the juridical equality of nations. We hope that the withdrawal of all the troops will soon be a fact, for the sake of the institutions on which the ethical order of international life and respect among nations is based. \nWe note with interest the developments in the informal talks that were held recently, at the request of Indonesia and other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, to consider the serious problem of Kampuchea in the context of the search for a long-term political solution in keeping with the resolutions of our Organization. The withdrawal of the foreign military forces remains the pre-condition for the restoration of Kampuchea's sovereignty, independence and self-determination.\nThe problems of the Middle East and Lebanon persist. There has still been no positive response to efforts by the international community to restore peaceful and tolerant coexistence to that region. In response to the call for a peace conference concerning the region, dissident voices have been raised alleging that such a peace conference would be useless; but no suggestions have been made for an alternative under which the parties could give up their radical, conflicting positions. The Republic of Paraguay repeats that any arrangement that is reached must be in accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), and that two fundamental principles must be respected in any resolution that may be adopted full recognition of the sovereign existence of the State of Israel, and the Palestinian people's right to exist and to have a homeland. The problem of Lebanon continues to be of concern to all men and women in the world. It is time to end this irrational war that has destroyed a country which was a centre of peace and progress but in which today these is an ever-increasing spirit of belligerency and destruction.\nThe recent events with regard to the Cyprus question open up encouraging prospects for the solution of the problem, as the Secretary-General points out in his report. The parties have resumed their talks, and with the good offices which the Security Council has requested the Secretary-General to exercise, commitments to co-operate have been made. The Republic of Paraguay very much hopes that through direct dialogue between the parties, and with the Secretary-General following up the progress achieved in the preliminary stages, the fundamental objective desired by the international community can be achieved - that is, to see the people of Cyprus living in peace and harmony within the concert of nations.\nThe Government of the Republic of Paraguay, in accordance with a tradition that has not varied since it participated in the founding of the United Nations, will lend its solidarity and co-operation to any initiatives that obtain the required consensus to be put into effect, for the good of the Organization and the international community - initiatives ranging from the financial strengthening of the institution to the peaceful solution of the various problems with which it is confronted. The position of Paraguay on human rights has always been one based on justice without giving offence, with a view to maintaining the highest levels of coexistence between Governments and nations. Similarly, the right to life, liberty and property are and will continue to be guaranteed by the terms of the Constitution and by law, in keeping with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThe Republic of Paraguay has in all forums always rejected both the nuclear and the conventional arms race, since it entails wasting billions of dollars while there is an urgent need for economic and social development. International security, the process of development and peace based on respect for the dignity of all nations, law and the right to life can be achieved only by the cessation of the arms race both in the rich industrialized countries and in countries that need these resources to promote their development.\nAnother scourge on mankind that negatively affects the very structure of human life is terrorism. This practice continues to undermine the moral order of human existence and its fatal consequences have shocked nations that cherish peace, order and respect for human life without distinction of any kind, such as nationality, colour, origin or opinion. It is time to be frank and ask ourselves whether our countries and our Organization have done enough to put an end to this horrendous scourge, for there is nothing so cowardly in the world and in the history of mankind as the murder of innocent human beings under the pretext of calling attention to certain issues that cannot be resolved in this way, by destroying man and his social institutions. The Republic of Paraguay, which has not experienced this madness that is terrorism or armed violence, urges all Member States which usually blame the existence of this evil on underlying causes to change their attitude and unreservedly support all initiatives to eliminate terrorism from the world. There is only one alternative for our Organization; either all countries agree to combat this cruel and bloody practice with all the force of morality and law or the Organization will lose its prestige and credibility before the peoples of the world, who see in the United Nations a valuable and irreplaceable instrument for putting an end to international terrorism.\nMy country's Government is combating the scourge of drugs with all its legal and moral strength. As the President of Paraguay, General Alfredo Stroessner, said before the General Assembly.\n\\\"With the Constitution and the laws, we are confronting those who are trying to weaken our free institutions, the detestable agents of that social cancer, the drug traffic.\\\" (A/S-15/PV.8, p. 11)\nOur country has joined world efforts to terminate this pernicious activity. It took part in the last Vienna Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking and is giving full effect to the Declaration and broad plan of action which emanated from that international conference. Our legislative branch is currently engaged in preparing a new law to suppress drug trafficking, for we know that our legislation must reflect this sad moment for mankind which is destabilizing its free institutions and corrupting the human person.\nVie firmly believe that our Organization has now readied a high point in its activities for international peace and security. We trust that its valuable co-operation with the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Latin American Economic System (SBLA) will continue to increase in the quest for a better future for our region and for all the world, for no one doubts the need for the existence and activities of regional organizations. The Republic of Korea has always been a country under international strict juridical order, respecting the law, ethical norms and international law. My Government understands that there is no obstacle standing in the way of its admission to the Organization, while keeping open the possibility for the People's Republic of Korea to do likewise. This request is justified by the fact that the United Nations must become increasingly universal, without any exceptions.\nWe fully appreciate what the law of the sea means to the world in the context of an increasingly interdependent and participating international community where countries are seeking agreements on improving the use of the resources of the sea without discrimination. My country firmly believes that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is proof of the progress made by mankind towards fairer goals. The Republic of Paraguay ratified that international instrument and will support its applicability in all forums of the world.\nThe world is closely following the work of this session of the General Assembly in this crucial time for the peaceful coexistence of peoples, when the media are reporting the activities of the Organization with regard to well-known hotbeds of conflict, death, desolation, misery and pain.\nIt is necessary to redouble our efforts in order to promote peace and security and overcome understandable differences and existing ideologies, united in our desire to serve mankind, making sure that the terror of war and the next war could indeed be the last if nuclear weapons are used - will never again grip the world. Let us continue together in the search for a future of love and understanding between men and peoples where no room is left for the hatred that kills, the hunger that undermines the dignity of the King of Creation, the terror that petrifies and converts us into wild beasts, and the intolerance that denigrates the moral quality of life in society. That is the only hope left to us in view of the arsenals that have been built up in the world. It is up to us, through conciliation, to convert this aspiration into reality.\nWe trust that the Supreme Creator will enlighten us and give us the necessary moral strength to continue to work for a world of peace and justice.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of Thailand, and on my own behalf, I should like to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. As relations between Argentina and Thailand have been and continue to be very close, his election to his high office is a source of gratification for my country. We are confident that his great wisdom, vast experience and proven diplomatic ability will ensure that the Assembly will conduct its work in an effective manner, leading to the fruitful conclusion of this important session.\nI should also like to pay a tribute to His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin, President of the Assembly at its forty-second session, for the skilful and able manner in which he performed his tasks during his tenure.\nDuring the forty-first session of the General Assembly, in 1986, I stood at this rostrum and voiced my deep concern about problems and conflicts around the world. I said then with deep regret that it was hard to remain an optimist. I declared that we needed a new world order of peace and justice within which all nations could co-operate peacefully with one another and live in harmony. But today, two years after my somewhat pessimistic observation, the world appears to be a different place. In contrast to 1986 it is now easier for me to be an optimist. This year, 1983, has marked a new and more encouraging trend in international relations  a trend towards peace and accommodation\u00b7, a trend towards co-operation and even consensus among the permanent members of the Security Council\u00b7, a trend towards a world in which peaceful relations between States is no longer an abstract dream but is gradually becoming a part of reality. My Government welcomes these new trends and this new momentum with enthusiasm.\nIt is apparent to all that this momentum owes a great deal to the success of multilateral diplomacy. It owes a great deal to the dedication, perseverance and tireless efforts of the United Nations and its able Secretary-General.\nThailand's faith in the United Nations has never been shaken. Over the years, even during less optimistic times, commitment to the United Nations has always been a cornerstone of Thailand's foreign policy. Now, with seemingly increased political will for accommodation and peace around the world, the United Nations chances for success in achieving its noble tasks have become greater.\nEvents of recent months testify to the enhanced value and effectiveness of the United Nations when it is able to function in an environment of international accommodation between the super-Powers and of closer co-operation among the permanent members of the Security Council. The Afghan peace accords bring closer to reality the total withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and the exercise by the Afghan people of their right to self-determination, as has been called for by successive General Assembly resolutions. The cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war offers renewed hope for peace in the Persian Gulf. Recent talks between the two Cypriot communities provide the basis for lasting peace and stability on that island. The acceptance by Morocco and the POLISARIO Front of the Secretary-General's peace plan could bring to an end the conflict in Western Sahara. The recent breakthrough in the Namibian question offers hope for the attainment of self-determination and Independence by the Namibian people.\nMy delegation hopes that the breakthrough with regard to the Namibian question will have a spill-over effect on the prospects for the realization of peace and justice in the southern African region. We hope that this breakthrough will mark the beginning of the end of South Africa's apartheid system. Peace and justice in southern Africa will be possible only after the eradication of apartheid.\nIt is expected that progress towards peace in the Persian Gulf and in other regions of the world will help revitalize the peace process in the Middle East. For a permanent peace in the Middle East to become a reality, the question of Palestine must be resolved. It must be resolved in such a way as to take into consideration the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people as well as the legitimate security concerns of all States in the region. My delegation hopes that all these encouraging trends towards peace and harmony in the various regions of the world will gain momentum in the days and months ahead.\nOn the question of Kampuchea, this year also witnessed some movement towards a comprehensive political settlement of the problem. The most recent development was the Jakarta Informal Meeting held in Indonesia in July this year. It brought together for the first time the conflicting parties, including Viet Nam, the occupying Power. Representatives of other countries concerned in the region were also present.\nHowever, in spite of those new developments, many obstacles still remain. The main objectives of the United Nations concerning Kampuchea, as reflected in repeated United Nations resolutions on the subject, remain implemented. As we meet here today, Vietnamese troops remain in Kampuchea. The restoration and preservation of Kampuchea's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity has yet to be achieved. The Kampucheans have not been allowed to exercise their right to self-determination.\nThailand and the other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) would like to see a comprehensive political settlement of the Kampuchean problem as soon as possible. Ito this end, we are again submitting a draft resolution on the item \\\"The situation in Kampuchea\\\", in which we have included elements which we believe are necessary components of such a comprehensive political settlement. We believe that it is a fair and balanced draft resolution worthy of the full support of the members of the Assembly.\nA first step in this process is the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea. There must also be an effective international presence, perhaps including peace-keeping forces, to ensure the withdrawal of foreign forces and to help maintain law and order in Kampuchea. We also envisage the formation of an interim administering authority to oversee the transition period and to prepare for free elections, which we hope will lead to true national reconciliation among the Kampuchean people. We remain hopeful that the future Kampuchean nation will be neutral, independent and non-aligned, posing no threat to any of its neighbours. \nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to the President of the International Conference on Kampuchea\u201e Mr. Leopold Gratz, for his continuing effort towards finding a lasting political solution to the Kampuchean problem.\nMy delegation would also like to express its deep appreciation of the continuous efforts of the Secretary-General to find a lasting political solution to the Kampuchean problem. We hope that the international community will give the necessary support and encouragement in this another important mission for peace undertaken by the Secretary-General.\t\nIn East Asia, my delegation maintains a deep interest in the Korean question. Thailand supports the proposal for detente between North and South Korea and my delegation hopes that both Koreas, through dialogues and political settlement, can realize their aspirations for eventual peaceful reunification.\nThe refugee problem in South-East Asia remains one of the most tragic consequences of the Indo-Chinese conflicts. With each passing year, the refugee problem has become increasingly complicated. Instead of genuine refugees, we have seen systematic migration of those seeking a better life. The alarming upsurge in boat arrivals from Viet Nam in 1987 and early 1988 and the unresolved dilemma of \\\"long-stayers\\\" warrant a more innovative and effective strategy to deal with this problem. When I met my ASEAN colleagues in Bangkok this past summer we called for the convening of a new international conference on Indo-Chinese refugees, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, by early 1989. Such a conference would provide an appropriate forum in which to set out such strategies. In this regard, the United Nations, in particular the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, should play a central role in persuading all concerned to participate in the common effort to meet this great and sad challenge to humanity.\nOn the question of disarmament; there is no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that genuine, symmetrical and verifiable arms limitation leading to general and complete disarmament is the means to achieve international peace, harmony and security. My delegation therefore welcomes the recent success in bilateral discussions and negotiations between the two super-Powers with a view to implementing a 50 per cent reduction of strategic weapons. My delegation also welcomes the ratification by the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Social is t Republics of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. Those two events give a powerful momentum to the efforts to achieve general and complete disarmament. My delegation is hopeful that this momentum will provide a significant impetus to further progress in the multilateral disarmament process.\nIn our interdependent world, bilateral diplomacy must be complemented by multilateral diplomacy, and vice versa. My delegation therefore firmly supports United Nations efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons and all weapons o\u00a3 mass destruction. Although no immediate breakthrough was accomplished, the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament served a useful purpose. It brought the members of the international community together and focused their attention on disarmament. During the session extensive exchanges of views took place. Those exchanges will undoubtedly serve as building blocks for the future. In addressing ourselves to the question of general and complete disarmament we must always be mindful that this includes chemical and biological as well as conventional weapons. Thailand supports the tireless efforts of the United Nations and the members of the international community to reach a verifiable agreement to control and eliminate chemical weapons. \nIn regard to the question of disarmament in general, Thailand has always been concerned about the diversion of financial, material and human resources from development and welfare to armaments. My delegation therefore welcomes the growing recognition of the linkage between disarmament and development. We are encouraged by the success of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development.\nAnother serious problem for mankind is that of narcotic drugs. Thailand has always been in the forefront in the global war against narcotic drugs. Drug abuse is destructive to our generation, and will be to future ones as well. The United Rations campaign against illicit drugs must be strengthened and sustained. To fight this global menace we need to act decisively and in a concerted way. We need an increased world-wide commitment and co-ordination within the United Nations framework to combat the international drug problem.\nLet us turn our attention to the question of human rights. A new world order of peace and justice cannot come about without universal respect for human rights. Indeed, faith in fundamental human rights is a corner-stone and a guiding principle of the United Nations. Lessons of history have shown us that disregard for human rights and fundamental freedoms has always been a major cause of international tension and conflict. As we mark the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year, let us reaffirm our commitment to honour all the provisions of the Declaration.\nTurning to the subject of economic development, I cannot hide the fact that Thailand's economic growth rate of 7.1 per cent for the year 1986 to 1987 and expected rate of 8 per cent for this year are a source of gratification to my delegation. Although we are becoming increasingly industrialized, Thailand remains overall an agricultural society. The livelihood of approximately 80 per cent of Thailand's population depends on agriculture. \nThailand's economic progress owes a great deal to the existence of a stable form of government, a sizeable domestic market and efficient economic measures as well as the endowment of a skilled and semi-skilled labour force. It also owes a lot to the practice of forward-looking planning. In all, hard work and responsible behaviour have contributed substantially to Thailand's economic success. It is hard-earned and indigenous.\nThailand remains concerned with rising protectionist measures. The existence of trade barriers, farm subsidies and other support programmes in developed countries has adversely affected the export earnings of developing countries and the well-being of their peoples. That directly hurts Thailand, the majority of whose population is dependent on agricultural earnings. We join the world community in urging those countries to reverse these protectionist trends. In this connection, Thailand attaches great importance to the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations, which should bring liberalization of and better discipline in the world trade system.\nOn agriculture in particular, Thailand, along with other free-agricultural trade advocates, especially the Cairns Group countries, is seeking comprehensive reform through liberalization. We also look forward to seeing tangible progress in negotiations on this important issue by the mid-term review at Montreal this December.\nOn the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, my delegation feels that it is important for the countries in Africa to pursue and deepen their reform processes. Moreover, the international community should try to mobilize additional resources to assist African countries during the remaining term of the Programme of Action. Thailand, for its part, will continue to do its best to facilitate the comprehensive implementation of the Programme of Action. \nThe awarding of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is another reflection of international recognition of the valuable contribution by the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security. I should like to pay a warm tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His tireless efforts to ensure world peace and justice have clearly borne fruit. We have our full support in the continued performance of his noble and difficult task. I once again salute him and the able members of the United Nations Secretariat for their hard work and dedication.\nHaving reviewed the recent developments around the world, I can conclude that the general outlook is encouraging. It does seem that there is increased momentum towards a new world order of peace and justice. We must work hard together to keep this momentum alive. Each and every one of us must do what we can to contribute to the cause of world peace, justice and progress.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, I have the honour to convey to you and, through you, to this assemblage of representatives greetings from my august sovereign. His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, and his best wishes for the success of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\nOn behalf of the Nepalese delegation and on my own behalf, I congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Your election is as much a reflection of the high esteem that the Argentine Republic enjoys in the international community as it is of your well-known diplomatic skill and dynamism. My delegation feels confident that under your guidance the Assembly will achieve its goals.\nOn this occasion I should like to express my delegation's deep appreciation to Mr. Peter Florin, Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, for the exemplary manner in which he guided the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly as well as the regular and resumed meetings of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a richly deserved tribute to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his admirable endeavours in promoting the cause of international peace and co-operation in general, and, in particular, to congratulate him on the award of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. \nAfter years of frustration we meet today in an atmosphere of renewed hope. The restoration of peace on several fronts, as has been understood so well in the report 'of the Secretary-General, has been a source of satisfaction and encouragement to all. At a time when the United Nations is emerging as an effective instrument for peace we find it somewhat ironic that it should be subjected to financial commitment. It is our fervent hope that peace will be given a chance, while welcoming recent moves in some quarters to meet their financial commitments the United Nations, we urge all Member States to rise to the occasion by underwriting the costs involved in the ongoing and future peace-making and peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.\nAs a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, which has all along been working for the reduction of cold war tension, Nepal is naturally happy to note the recent signs of improvement in East-West relations, particularly those of the two super-Powers. Its ripple effects have wafted across the wide international horizon. The most visible manifestation of this change was reflected in the signing and ratification of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty.\nNepal warmly welcomed this disarmament agreement as a landmark of historic dimensions, aimed as it is at the elimination of an entire category of nuclear missiles. We are hopeful that this will pave the way for serious negotiations and the early conclusion of an agreement on a 50 per cent reduction in their arsenals of strategic, offensive arms. Given the latest technological advances and innovative verification median isms incorporated in the INP Treaty and, more important, a continued climate of mutual respect and trust between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, we believe that such a disarmament objective is attainable. \nLike other Member States, Nepal attaches the highest urgency to nuclear disarmament concerning as it does the very survival of humankind. At the same tine, given the all-too-frequent resort to conventional warfare and the ever increasing destructive capacity of conventional weaponry, Nepal can hardly overlook or minimize the importance of conventional disarmament. My delegation is concern \u03c4 over the repeated use of chemical weapons in recent years and joins with other countries in calling for the complete and effective prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons, and their destruction.\nNepal shared the disappointment of the majority of Member States when the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which convened here this summer, could not adopt a consensus document. There was solace, however, in the fact that it could generate an enhanced understanding of the triangular relationship between disarmament, security and development.\nAppreciation of such a relationship, indeed, lies at the very core of Nepal's long-standing policy of support for initiatives that seek to promote disarmament through the establishment of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace, whether they relate to the Indian Ocean or the South Atlantic, the Mediterranean or South-East Asia, the South Pacific or the continents of Africa and Latin America.\nThe concept of an intimate linkage between peace and development and its corollary - that a durable peace is a prerequisite for meaningful development - is the foundation on which rests His Majesty Ring Birendra's proposal that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. I should add that the peace proposal is an effort on our part to give practical expression to the basic ideals of the United Nations and the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement. In this context, I am pleased to disclose that 97 Member States have thus far extended their valuable support, for which I once again express my deep appreciation. Similarly; it gives me great satisfaction to inform the Assembly that consequent upon a mandate from the forty-second session of the General Assembly, the United Nations Centre for Disarmament in Asla has been set up in our capital, Kathmandu. His Majesty's Government has extended all possible co-operation towards its establishment and hopes it will receive active support from interested countries and non-governmental organizations.\nI have referred briefly to some positive developments with regard to the present international political climate. Among them must be mentioned, of course, the very welcome cease-fire and ongoing peace negotiations between Iran and Iraq following their acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). I assure the Secretary-General, and his Personal Representative, Mr. Jan K. Eliasson of Sweden, of the continued support and co-operation of Nepal in the Security Council in the urgent task of the speedy restoration of a lasting peace in the Gulf.\nSince December last year, we have watched the developments in the Middle East with increased anxiety. These have created new political realities on the ground and completely altered a 21-year occupation imposed by military might. This has only reinforced our view on the desirability of convening an international conference on peace in the Middle East. The three essential elements of a durable peace in the Middle East, in our view, are a recognition of the right to an independent homeland for the Palestinian people, whose sole, legitimate representative is the Palestine Liberation Organization\u00b7, the withdrawal by Israel from territories occupied since 1967; and recognition of the right of all States in the region, including Israel, to exist within secure, internationally recognized borders.\nAnother area in the Middle East that has been caught in an endless cycle of violence and strife is Lebanon, which has been the unfortunate focus of competing foreign and sectarian interests for more than a decade. While recent events in Lebanon have increased our concern, Nepal is proud to be making a small contribution to the cause of peace in the southern part of the country by participation in United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) operations. \u0410s a country that yearns to be universally recognized as a zone of peace, Nepal will naturally continue to endorse any proposal that ensures Lebanese sovereignty over all Lebanese territory and secures not only the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon but also acceptance by all concerned of commitment to non-interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.\nNepal was encouraged by the recent meeting in Geneva between the Cypriot leaders, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, which led to peace talks in Nicosia last month on all aspects of the unification of Cyprus, under the auspices of Mr. Oscar Camilllon, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. I take this opportunity to reaffirm Nepal's strong support for an independent, non-aligned, federal and bi-communal Cyprus.\nNepal warmly welcomed the signing in Geneva on 14 April 1988 of the Accords on ending the conflict in Afghanistan. Admittedly, the process envisaged in the Geneva Accords has yet to be completed and some uncertainties remain. Nepal is nevertheless heartened by the fact that the foreign military presence is withdrawing, thus preparing the way for the voluntary return of millions of Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran in conditions of peace and security for the region and beyond. Nepal has also been encouraged that such a turnabout has taken place thanks to the painstaking efforts, over six years, of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Mr. Diego Cordovez. It was a matter of considerable pride and honour for Nepal to be invited to participate in the United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGDMAP) set up to monitor the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.\nNepal has been following with considerable interest recent developments with regard to the situation in Kampuchea, including the Jakarta Informal Meeting held at Bogor, Indonesia, from 25 to 28 July 1988. We have also taken note of recent high-level talks between China and the Soviet Union on the situation in Kampuchea and the initiative of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries before, during and after the Bogor talks. While Nepal notes that some progress has been made, we remain convinced that a peaceful settlement of the Kampuchean problem requires, first and foremost, the unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea and the full and free exercise by the Kampuchean people of their right to determine their own future.\nThe situation in the divided Korean peninsula still remains potentially explosive. Nepal is greatly pleased that the Seoul Olympic Games have been brought to a successful conclusion on an overall; note of sportsmanship and harmony between participating countries and athletes. It has observed and welcomed endeavours for broadening ties and contacts and initiating dialogue between the two Koreas. It thus remains Nepal's hope that the Korean people will address the important question of reunification with their age-old wisdom and customary ingenuity, without outside interference. \nAuspicious harbingers or change have been discernible in Africa in the recent past. Among those that Nepal views as positive end hopeful are the efforts of the Organization of African Unity and the quadripartite negotiations can Angola and Namibia. The recent visit of the Secretary-General to Pretoria has paved the way for the dispatch of a United Nations technical team to Namibia to prepare for the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and has given rise to hope that South Africa may actually begin the Implementation of Security Cornell resolution 435 (1978), which it accepted in principle 10 years ago. Nepal would be honoured to co-operate in any Security Council endeavour to implement its resolutions on Namibia particularly resolution 435 (1978), if such a Council meeting were convened during Nepal's current tenure of non-permanent membership of the Security Council. On this occasion I should like to place on record Nepal's recognition of the contributions to Namibian independence made by the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)\nIn South Africa, despite the clearly and repeatedly expressed will of the international community, the racist regime tenaciously clings to its abhorrent system of apartheid. As the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and the anti-apartheid movement worldwide gain new momentum every day, there are welcome signs that a growing segment of South Africa's white community is increasingly beginning to see the writing on the wall. Nepal remains convinced that comprehensive and mandatory economic: sanctions, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, represent the most effective and peaceful instrument for dismantling the apartheid regime and installing a truly representative, multiracial society in South Africa. \n\nA note of optimism is also in order# we believe, with respect to the conflict over Western Sahara following acceptance by parties to the conflict of proposals for a peaceful settlement put forward by the Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. Nepal was privileged to have joined in the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 621 (1938) authorizing the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative on Western Sahara.\nLast year from this rostrum I welcomed the Central American peace plan signed by the five Central American Presidents on 7 August 1987, based & that document greatly was on a commitment to strict observance of the principles of non-interference and non-intervention by all States with concerns and contacts in the region. That being so, it is only natural for us to be disappointed at the lack of substantial progress in the consolidation of peace in Central America since then. Nepal appeals to all concerned Governments to continue to demonstrate political will in favour of peace and commends those which have already fulfilled their commitments as enumerated in the Central American peace plan.\nThis year we have witnessed a tragic number of natural disasters and calamities that have struck various parts of the globe, including our region of South Asia. Coming as this does when broad global environmental concerns such as those relating to the depletion of the ozone layer and the increase in the greenhouse effect, among others, have spurred calls for a comprehensive study on climate and man's environment, my country welcomes the inclusion of the item entitled \\\"Conservation of climate as part of the common heritage of mankind\\\" in the agenda of this General Assembly session. As the Himalayas in Nepal constitute a very important climatic determinant for much of South and Central Asia, we would certainly co-operate in any regional or international effort aimed at a better understanding of the crucial, if often fragile, linkage between roan and the biosphere of environment in our part of the world. \nA further matter of grave concern is the prolonged crisis in the international economic system and its adverse effect on the economies of the developing countries and the sharp decline in the general level of international economic assistance. This phenomenon, we have long maintained, has its origins in the structural inequities and imbalances in the present international economic order. It has been exacerbated by the anti-inflationary policies pursued by sons developed countries, adversely affecting the prices of and demand for products from the developing world, including commodities and oil. While industrial market economies appear to be progressing through the longest period of prosperity since the Second World War, this has coincided with the most prolonged and severe structural development crisis in the developing countries. As a consequence, over the past 10 years many developing countries have experienced stagnant or declining growth rates, in stark contrast to the goal of a 7 per cent growth rate set in the International Development Strategy. It is also quite contrary to the targets and objectives of the United Nations Substantial New Programme of Action for the 19e0s for the least developed countries, into which category ray country falls. \nNepal is concerned at the deteriorating external debt situation of many developing countries. That is a cause of grave economic and political anxiety, severely threatening as it does their very political stability. Ws believe that a lasting and mutually acceptable solution of the current external debt of developing countries is feasible only through an integrated growth-oriented strategy. In this context, we hold that debt rescheduling merely postpones the problem of indebtedness. Hence, in addition to reducing debt .repayment, whenever possible, we believe that a substantial portion of such debts of the least developed countries should be written off. Nepal also supports the call made in Geneva last month by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for commercial banks to reduce by 30 per cent debts owed by developing countries.\nWhat is clear, in any case, is the urgency of the revitalisation of the stalled North-South dialogue, based on a shared and enlightened community of interest. We therefore endorse the Economic and Social Council's recommendation to the forty-third session of the General Assembly to call a special session of the Assembly in 1990 to examine ways of a maintaining sustained growth in the world economy. Such a special session, we maintain, would not only assist in solving the problems facing the world economy but also help to improve the overall climate of international economic co-operation. Similarly, we support the Economic and Social Council's call for chalking out an international development Strategy for the fourth United Nations decade, from 1991 to 2000.\nOver the years, Nepal has sought and welcomed assistance from friendly countries and development agencies to complement its own efforts to ensure planned economic development. In this context, Nepal is deeply grateful to Japan not only for its recent decision to convert official loans into grants but also for its long association as a major partner in Nepal's development efforts. On this occasion, I should like to express again the appreciation of His Majesty's Government of Nepal for the sympathy and the timely and generous support extended by friendly countries and non-governmental organizations in the aftermath of the severe earthquake that struck eastern Nepal in the early hours of 21 August 1988.\nDevelopment assistance is welcomed across the spectrum of planned development activities in Nepal, international assistance is especially invited for the exploitation of Nepal's well-known potential in water resources and for the expansion of its own determined and urgent - but necessarily limited - forestation endeavours. Besides helping Nepal to meet the chronic fuel and energy needs of its rising population, such assistance would, we sincerely believe, also have a profound and salutary impact in preventing further ecological degradation of the Himalayan foothills.\nWe have long held that the annual flooding of the plains that stretch from the foothills of the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal - of which the recent devastating floods in Bangladesh were such a stark example - is inextricably linked to, among other factors, the denudation of those once verdant and densely forested hillsides. One direct by-product has been this\u00b7, every year, from Nepal alone, an estimated 250 million cubic metres of precious topsoil is washed away into the Bay of Bengal. On this occasion X should like to recall and reiterate the proposal made by His Majesty Ring Birendra as far back as 1977 indicating Nepal's readiness to co-operate with all countries in its region in any joint ventures to marshal and exploit its water resources for the common good of the region. Such benefits could be realized in the area of flood control and regulation, in the production of new and renewable sources of energy and in the provision of additional navigation and irrigation facilities, including those of my landlocked country. \nAs a least developed country, Nepal finds it most disturbing that in today's unfavourable economic situation there should be a general decline in official development assistance (ODA) including that to the least developed countries. In this context we regret that the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product called for in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and the ODA target for the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the least developed countries remains unfulfilled.\nThe full and timely implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action is of vital importance for Nepal which is making serious efforts to ensure that our people's minimum basic needs for food,  grains, clothing, fuel, wood, drinking, water, primary health care and sanitation, primary and skill-oriented education and minimum rural transport facilities are met before the turn of the century. \nUnder the dynamic and forward-looking leadership of His Majesty King Birendra of Nepal has for many years been engaged in an all-out war on poverty and - underdevelopment. This is a battle that is being waged against such formidable foes as the legacy of a century-long period of isolation a rapidly expanding population and a difficult topography within the confines of a landlocked configuration\nI wish to record ray country's commitment to the eradication of the social cancer of drug abuse and illicit trafficking. In that regard# I should like also to recall that Nepal has been co-operating with its South Asian neighbours within the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC).\nWith respect to another scourge of our times - terrorism - I am pleased to inform the Assembly of the signing at the third SAARC summit in Katmandu last November of the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. I am also pleased to confirm that the cause of regional co-operation in South Asia has been further boosted since last addressed the General Assembly. Agreement on the establishment of the South Asian Food Reserve and the declaration of the SAARC member countries on initiating the process of dealing with the causes and consequences of natural disasters can be cited as two positive examples in that context. My delegation has every reason to believe that, given the grave dimension of the natural calamity that struck our friendly neighbour Bangladesh last August, the next SAARC summit - scheduled for December at Islamabad, Pakistan - will provide further momentum and urgency for such a study.\nIn conclusion, I take this opportunity to reaffirm our steadfast adherence to the principles and purposes of the United Nations - a commitment that is enshrined in the Directive Principles of the Constitution of Nepal. Similarly, I wish to express again Nepal's continuing support for the Non-Aligned Movement.\nNepal is convinced that the United Nations Charter provides the most universally accepted legal framework for conducting international relations. If recent developments have tended to rekindle new hopes in the future of the United Nations, the materialization of those hopes will largely depend on the active support of Member States for the principles of the world order to which the United Nations is committed. In our view, the continued credibility of the United Nations will also depend, in our dangerous nuclear age, on how effective the United Nations can be as an instrument of multilateral diplomacy at the preventive level.\nSince January Nepal has had the great honour of sharing in some of the responsibilities of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security, by virtue of its non-permanent membership of the Security Council. I should like to assure the Assembly that Nepal will continue to uphold the cherished values and ideals of the United Nations Charter in the discharge of its duties in that principal United Nations organ. \nNepal will, naturally, be extending its unstinting support and co-operation to you, Mr, President, for the success of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. As in the past, Nepal will continue to join in any concerted endeavour that is aimed at the realization of the noble objectives of this world Organization, convinced as it is that the United Nations remains not only an accurate mirror of an ever-changing world but also the most effective international agent for affecting timely, peaceful and meaningful change.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the President, the Government and the people of Liberia, I warmly congratulate the President on his election to preside over this forty-third session of the General Assembly. His wide experience and well-known diplomatic skills fully assure us that this session, under his leadership, will achieve very positive results. We can count on the usual co-operation and support of the delegation of Liberia in the months ahead. Permit me also to extend well-deserved thanks and appreciation to the President's predecessor, Ambassador Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic who conducted the affairs of the forty-second session with great aplomb and distinction.\nSpecial commendation is likewise due our illustrious Secretary-General for the skill and courage with which he has been serving the international community, my Government will continue to do everything to assist him in upholding the credibility of the United Nations and ensuring that its mandates are fulfilled.\nFinally, allow me to take special note of the opportunities which the annual sessions of the General Assembly offer us for fruitful bilateral and multilateral consultations on issues of mutual interest.\nThe tragic experiences of two world wars and the imminent danger of nuclear catastrophe have made the search for peace and development the paramount concern of our time. The principles and ideals by which peace is to be achieved and development attained have been fully set out in the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the Assembly.\nFor 43 years, guided by those principles and ideals, we have come here with various problems, disputes and ideas. Here we have debated the issues, grappled with the problems and their possible solutions, and expressed both our frustrations and our aspirations.\nIn spite of our varying dispositions and our cultural, economic and ideological differences, we have always acknowledged and professed the continuing relevance of the United Nations in the search for peace, security and development. It is against this background that my delegation, in addressing the specific issues before the Assembly, will give renewed emphasis to the need for strengthening the role of dialogue and solidarity for the betterment of the human condition. \n\nMy delegation welcomes the stirrings of peace that have greeted this forty-third session and given the international common new hope for the efficacy of multilateralism in the resolution of conflict.\nIn this connection, we note with satisfaction the Peace Accords with regard to Afghanistan, signed last April, which are facilitating the withdrawal of foreign troops from that country. We also applaud the acceptance by Iran of the provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which has brought about the cessation of hostilities in the Persian Gulf and made possible the on-going peace talks between Iraq and Iran under the auspices of the United Nations. We are also pleased that, through the mediation of the Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, Morocco and the POLISAR10 Front have consented to the holding of a referendum, which constitutes an important step towards resolving the question of Western Sahara. Moreover, we note that negotiations between the two communities in Cyprus are progressing satisfactorily, also under the auspices of the United Nations.\nIt is in this context that we must highly commend the Nobel Prize Committee for being so thoughtful as to award its 1983 Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. And we congratulate the Secretary-General on this achievement. At the same time, ray delegation appeals to all the parties involved to continue to work co-operatively for the final resolution of these problems.\nBut we must resist every temptation to be lulled into a state of complacency by these recent successes, as our present agenda still contains a number of unresolved issues which must claim the Assembly's urgent attention.\nDespite the best efforts of the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), a just and lasting settlement to the Kampuchea dispute has remained elusive. We therefore support the Jakarta Informal Meeting, which seeks to bring together all the parties concerned in an effort to resolve the problem of Kampuchea. A comprehensive settlement of the dispute roust take into account the exercise by the Kampuchean people of their inalienable right to self-determination, free from foreign interference.\nWith regard to the Korean question, my delegation urges acceleration of efforts to bring about a constructive and fruitful dialogue in the peninsula. The special declaration, by President Roh Tae Woo of July 1988, in the interest of national self-esteem and prosperity, constitutes a positive step towards easing tension and leading to the peaceful unification of the two Koreas.\nWe congratulate the Governments and peoples of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the commemoration of their fortieth anniversary of nationhood. We wish them a prosperous and bright future and the attainment of unity, peace and stability as soon as possible. In Central America various peace plans proposed by the countries of the region have not yielded the desired results. My delegation would therefore hope that the people of Central America could be left alone to chart their own course on the path of restoring peace, fostering democracy and strengthening regional unity and economic co-operation.\nA sad episode in the Middle East crisis is the tragedy of Lebanon, a country with which Liberia has enjoyed close ties of friendship over the years. Once a prosperous nation, Lebanon is today ravaged by years of incessant civil strife, aggravated by unwarranted external interference. We therefore urge respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon the safeguarding of its independence, an end to violence, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly a year ago the crisis in the Middle East has escalated significantly despite the various peace initiatives undertaken. In this connection, we call on Israel to exercise restraint in its enforcement of law and order in the occupied territories. It continues to be the view of my Government that a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East conflict must take into account the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people, as well as the right of all States in the region, including Israel, to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.\nIn this regard we reiterate the call for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East, with the participation on a basis of equality of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the authentic representative of the Palestinian people. Such a conference should certainly enhance the peace process in the region. \nA few days ago General Moussa Traore, President of Mali and current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity, eloquently outlined to the Assembly Africa's position on a number of important issues, including the vexed question of southern Africa.\nMy delegation therefore wishes only to stress Liberia's grave concern that the racist minority regime in Pretoria, aided and abetted by its collaborators, has continued to defy with impunity the collective will of the international community by its flagrant disregard of the fundamental rights of the black majority in their own land. Furthermore, there can be no denying the fact that the extremity of the cruel and degrading treatment meted out to black South Africans bears a disturbing and chilling resemblance to Nazi practices. To date, the brutal and remorseless Pretoria regime has kept hundreds, if not thousands, of children in detention, subjecting them to systematic torture and even genocide. Reports of such horrors perpetrated by the regime' leave my Government in no doubt that the international community has not done enough to destroy apartheid.\nSo entrenched is the racist minority regime's policy of apartheid that no other peaceful means short of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter can eradicate that system and save the country from an eventual bloodbath. Those who argue that sanctions will only bring hardships to the blacks of South Africa and to the front-line States are either simply against the aspirations of black people or interested only in their investments and profits. For the persistent rejection of apartheid by the black South Africans themselves has surely, demonstrated that they at least would prefer hardship in freedom to prosperity under apartheid.\nMy delegation holds the view that, if the racist regime in South Africa truly desires genuine peace, it must, in good faith and without pre-conditions, immediately release Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners as a first step towards reconciliation and the institution of a non-racial democratic society based on universal franchise. In this context, Liberia wishes to associate itself with those delegations that have called for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly in 1989 to consider the overall situation in southern Africa, including the question of Namibia.\nA clear demonstration of South Africa's arrogance is its illegal occupation of Namibia, in utter contempt of the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations, and its continued use of that Territory to launch subversive, aggressive and destabilizing policies against neighbouring States.\nWhile we take note of the recent quadripartite discussions on the Namibian question, there is nothing in the negotiating record of the racist regime to justify any reliance on its commitments. The Security Council should therefore proceed to take such measures as may be necessary to carry out its mandate, as set forth in its resolution 435 (1978), As we observe the tenth anniversary of that resolution, we reaffirm Namibia's right to self-determination and independence within a united territory, including Walvis Bay, the Penguin Islands and all other offshore islands, and under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people. It is our fervent hope that, when the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly convenes, a free and independent Namibia will be able to take its rightful place as a full Member of the United Nations.\nI wish to turn now to the question of disarmament, which for my delegation at least has real implications not only for peace and security but for development as well. Liberia maintains its position that if peace and development are to be fully achieved the international community simply cannot continue to spend so many billions of dollars each year on armaments and related activities. In seeking to ensure security we have somehow unleashed a costly arms race, which has diverted resources from development needs, thereby exacerbating social problems in developing countries. This point was well articulated by a number of speakers at the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, held last year.\nThe recent ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - by the United States and the Soviet union marks a new and encouraging beginning in bilateral disarmament efforts. On the other hand, the failure of the third special session devoted to disarmament to arrive at a consensus represents a serious setback to multilateral disarmament initiatives. My Government continues to believe that bilateral and multilateral efforts complement each other am d that the United Nations remains the central forum for disarmament issues.\nLiberia considers the Non-Proliferation Treaty an important international instrument and its ratification a vital first step towards nuclear disarmament. In this connection, we are particularly concerned that South Africa's nuclear capability has continued to frustrate the attainment of the objective of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa, to make it a zone of peace. Indeed, the credibility of the Treaty will remain doubtful as long as measures are not taken to ensure the subjection of the nuclear capability of South Africa and other countries to safeguards and inspection under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nThus we favour the convening of the Fourth Review Conference of States Patties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1990 to consider suds matters, among others.\nMy delegation joins previous speakers who have condemned the use of chemical weapons in contravention of the 1925 Geneva Treaty banning the use of such weapons. Similarly, we are gravely concerned about the dumping of toxic and other hazardous waste on African soil, an act which is tantamount to a declaration of chemical war on our people. This multifarious environmental abuse endangers the well-being and lives of all our peoples. Such waste not only poisons the air we breathe but also pollutes our water resources and contaminates the very soil upon which we depend for the cultivation of food. But is there not an ethical question also? At the close of the twentieth century, should Africa still be facing such a threat to its survival? Was slavery not enough? Was colonial exploitation not enough? Is the present critical economic situation made worse by various natural disasters not enough? Must we now be exposed also to poisonous and radioactive substances that threaten our very survival as a people?\nSo serious is this problem of toxic waste disposal that we must urge the Economic and Social Council to expedite the adoption and implementation of its draft convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes, we also welcome the call for the Conference on Disarmament to draft a convention on the prohibition of the dumping of radioactive and toxic wastes for hostile purposes.\nUnlike the political environment in which significant progress towards the relaxation of tension has been observed, it is regrettable that no comparable development in the economic sphere was attained during the year. \nSince the last session of this Assembly, the international economic environment experienced further decline and disequilibrium. The fall in commodity prices, the decrease in the flow of official development assistance and the crushing debt burden have continued to be the most serious factors responsible for the net outflow of capital from developing to developed countries.\nIt was this very serious predicament that led to the convening of the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly, on the critical economic situation in Africa, a little over two years ago. In this connection, the mid-term review and appraisal exercise undertaken last month has confirmed that the international community has not fulfilled its commitment under the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development.\nIn the meantime, African countries themselves, in spite of the unfavourable international economic climate, have endeavoured to pursue structural adjustment programmes, institutionalized or otherwise. Liberia, for instance, has undertaken certain measures within its own capabilities, to establish conditions for economic recovery. I refer  to attempts being made, through a green revolution programme, to expand agricultural production with a view to attaining food self-sufficiency. Moreover, steps have been taken, not only towards efficient management of the public sector, but also towards the encouragement and promotion of private initiative and enterprise in economic growth and development.\nIn view of the foregoing, ray delegation joins previous speakers who have called on the international community to live up to its commitment under the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, and in particular to accelerate the flow of resources to the continent. Our common heritage and interdependence demand the concerted effort of all for the attainment of the conditions that will ensure a higher standard of living for the peoples of the developing countries.\nThis planet on which we live may have its imperfections, but until scientific exploration can confirm otherwise, it remains the only homo we have. It is therefore our sacred obligation to create in it a wholesome environment: for ourselves and for posterity.\nIn this connection, we must strive for a political environment free from conflicts and war\u00b7, we must strive for an economic environment that provides for a just, equitable and efficient production and distribution of goods and services, and we must pursue sustainable development policies that will ensure the protection of our eco-system.\nWhen we pollute the oceans, the rivers and streams, when we denude our forests, when we violate the human rights of our fellow man, and engage in various forms of warfare without neighbours, when we exploit the poor and the weak, we do great harm to the human environment and thereby undermine the peace and security of our world.\nThe task of facing the future and safeguarding the interest of succeeding generations requires our collective moral commitment and co-ordinated political will and action.\nIn the view of my Government, the United Nations is still the best instrument at our disposal for the attainment of that wholesome environment envisaged and desired by all, and we thus reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the principles and purposes enshrined in its Charter. \n"

As you are well aware, Cameroon owes its existence to the United Nations. It is therefore deeply attached to this Organization, which played a decisive role in its accession to independence.\nI would like to express our sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for his devotion to the service of our Organization. I take this opportunity also to reiterate our support for the considerable efforts he is making to promote peace and co-operation in the world in spite of the prevailing economic difficulties.\nI also wish to extend my congratulations to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, which have just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. We are on the eve of the year 2000, a turning point in the history of mankind. We will also be responsible for the smooth or faulty take-off of this new millennium.\nThe duty of each and every one of us is to ensure the future of generations to come in the best possible circumstances. If we take a quick look at the world today the words that keep coming up are: crisis; conflicts; poverty; ignorance; disease; disasters; and injustice. Yet never before have science and technology offered the opportunities they offer today for us to overcome poverty and disease and never before have the various means of communication offered such tremendous possibilities for abolishing distances; but never before has a political and economic crisis reached the extent of today's crisis.\nThe United Nations, it must be recognized, is doing what it can to improve international relations from both the political and the economic points of view. All these efforts notwithstanding, much still remains to be done. Every conflict stands in the way of progress. Progress depends inevitably on entente, consultation and mutual respect.\nBecause of their unavoidable interdependence, States should regard the United Nations as a neutral forum wherein they harmonize their positions and settle their disputes in a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner - and this is possible. Politically, the new climate between the Soviet Union and the United States is an example. The commitment of those two great nations to report to the international community, in particular to the Conference on Disarmament, on the progress and results of their negotiations is a decisive step towards peace.\nThe determination of the major Powers to work more closely together leads us to expect other encouraging results. In Afghanistan, the partial withdrawal of Soviet troops holds out hope for new developments. In the Western Sahara, the peace plan proposed by Mr. Perez de Cuellar has been accepted. The Chad-Libya border conflict appears to be moving towards a negotiated settlement. Many leading African Presidents have made ceaseless efforts to achieve a peaceful settle it. Such a settlement would certainly constitute a great victory for them and for the whole of Africa. The situation in the Horn of Africa also allows us to be hopeful. Efforts to normalize relations between Ethiopia and Somalia should be encouraged and supported. In Angola the peace talks between the parties concerned are continuing in Brazzaville. Following the cease-fire agreement in August, the talks between Iran and Iraq begun in Geneva are to be resumed.\nHowever, the odious system of apartheid is still thriving in South Africa and, to date, in spite of United Nations Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 601 (1987) Namibia continues to be deprived of its independence, A solution to this conflict would also enable the independent States of the subregion to continue, in an atmosphere of peace and security, the work of nation-building which has been undermined by the attacks and acts of economic sabotage perpetrated by the rebels armed by racist South Africa. We will continue to support a people fighting for a just cause, namely human dignity.\nOut present economic difficulties should not prevent us from honouring our commitments to the Special Fund of the Co-ordinating Committee for the Liberation of Africa and to the Action for Resisting Invasion, Colonialism and Apartheid (AFRICA) Fund. We should also continue to help the freedom-fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC), as well as the front-line States.\nOnce more I call on all forces of peace, on all nations, to exert pressure and to adopt comprehensive and mandatory economic sanctions against the racist regime of Pretoria.\nThe situation in the Middle East remains disturbing. Cameroon, which maintains relations of friendship and co-operation with all States of the region, condemns the escalation of violence. I sincerely hope that dialogue will replace such violence and enable all parties concerned to seek a just and lasting peace. It is high time for the international community to find an appropriate solution.\nNumerous hotbeds of tension still persist also in Latin America and Asia, and we must commit ourselves to restoring calm. \nThe encouraging results achieved in the Sahara, in Afghanistan, in Angola and in Chad are proof that it is always possible to find an appropriate solution: what is needed is to demonstrate seriousness and good faith.\nUnwavering determination must be applied to resolving the severe economic crisis afflicting the third world. Consultation designed to find solutions to the poverty in which three fourths of mankind is living is as necessary and as important as the quest for solutions to  inflicts. The economic picture of the past few years has been appalling. Imbalances are worsening. Rich countries are enjoying growing prosperity. Whereas the natural resources of developing countries no longer suffice even to meet the basic needs of their peoples. The African countries have now come to realise that they must first count on themselves and on their own efforts.\nConfronted with this very serious situation we have taken measures aimed at stabilizing our economy and, in the long term, bringing about its recovery. We no longer want to be dependants. We have either abandoned or reconsidered certain development projects and we have cut down on State expenditure. Certain companies have been obliged either to close down or to lay off staff. We are all aware of the gravity of the situation.\nThe special session of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Plan of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. However, within the context of the world crisis it is not enough to constitute subregional bodies or to define short-term priorities to stimulate our growth and reduce the vulnerability of our economies.\nThe prices of our basic products have reached the lowest level in the past 50 years. Our export earnings have dropped alarmingly, while the prices of the capital goods and finished products we import are continually rising. As if that were not enough, our manufactured goods meet with the protectionist policies of the industrialized North.\nThe result is that our balance of payments is registering a serious deficit. That deficit is further aggravated by the burden of our external debt and by monetary disorders. It is true that we want to settle our debt, but we do not have the means to do so. It is therefore logical and imperative that we examine with our creditors those solutions that will allow us to replay our debts and still save our economies from total collapse.\nEverything that has been done to contain this situation has come up against a hostile International environment. We are working more, we are managing better, we are producing more, yet the sharp drop In the prices of raw materials, the reduction of financial aid for development, the enormous debt burden, inflation and fluctuating exchange rates, the lack of dialogue, which is crucial to bringing about a more just economic order - all those elements constitute impediments to the progress of the African continent and threaten the future of the world.\nAs we are well aware, world stability concerns both developed and developing countries. We are waiting for the international community to make greater efforts and to adopt concrete measures. Decisions taken by a certain number of developed countries, such as Canada and France, and those taken at the summit meeting of the Seven in Toronto, constitute the beginning of positive action.\nWe ate not asking for charity, we are seeking help in order to resolve the serious problems that concern us all. Every one of us has a stake in this - it is not a one-way street. Assisting developing countries out of the crisis means opening up new markets to industrialized countries, new markets for their products. The solutions exist, and all we need is to seek them whole-heartedly.\nPolitically, the major Powers have demonstrated that when they want something it can be achieved. That applies to the economic crisis as well. We need only have the Will.\nFor us, the United Nations represents a forum for consultation and for seeking solutions. The United Nations reflects the common determination of nations to work together. The United Nations is an assembly. It is a force to reckon with, a powerful tool for development. Let us learn to use it together.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like, through you. Sir, to extend to Mr. Dante Caputo our congratulations on his election to the important post of President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session and our sincere wishes for all possible success in carrying out his responsible and difficult duties.\nI wish to pay a tribute to the representative of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Peter Florin, for his able guidance of the work of the General Assembly during the past year.\nThe general debate has been going on for nearly two weeks. The diverse and varied conclusions and assessments expressed by delegations in their statements describing present-day international relations share one common feature: the present state of these relations is characterized as encouraging for the achievement of new, real and positive results. Joint efforts have fulfilled the first prerequisites for limiting the arms race, reducing the threat of nuclear war and settling protracted regional conflicts.\nThe will and readiness of the USSR and the United States to begin actual nuclear disarmament are of paramount importance.\nProgress in nuclear disarmament has undoubtedly given an impetus to the working out of specific measures for the limitation and elimination of other means of warfare. It is impossible to deny the relationship between disarmament and the strengthening of international security. New political thinking is increasingly becoming the dominant reality of today's world and steadily making headway through the barriers of enmity and suspicion.\nIn his address to the session of the USSR Supreme Soviet on 1 October 1988, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mikhail Gorbachev, said:\n\\\"Our policy in international affairs is clear. It is aimed at eliminating the threat of nuclear catastrophe, normalising international relations, establishing equal and mutually beneficial relations among countries and peoples of the world, achieving broad-bas e d co-operation in various areas and ensuring each people the right to a free choice of its future ... We shall continue to follow this policy unswervingly.\\\"\nWhile emphasizing the significance of peaceful coexistence as the highest universal principle ensuring mankind's progress in security, we believe that the Internationalisation of the efforts of States faced with global challenges and the joining of their forces for the protection of common human values constitute another pillar of universal security. Ito act from positions of reason and realism and to strive persistently to find generally acceptable solutions, no matter how difficult that may seem - that is the imperative of our time. Pluralism of Interests, the principle of freedom of choice, the priority of shared human values and the primacy of international law cannot be ignored in international affairs.\nIn this sense, the importance of the United Nations can hardly be overestimated. Throughout the existence of the Organization, the Ukrainian SSR has consistently supported the most effective implementation of its function of maintaining peace and security, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\nOur delegation believes that the enhanced role and authority of the United Nations will make it possible to move successfully towards a comprehensive system of international security, thus providing for a gradual process of demilitarization, democratization and humanisation of international relations and the achievement of the security of States on the basis of political interaction and unconditional compliance with international obligations in all spheres - military, political, economic, ecological and humanitarian. A comprehensive system of international security should be worked out on the basis of the Charter and in strict compliance with Its principles.\nThe extensive discussion of these problems in the United Nations testifies to their urgency and importance. The concept proposed by the socialist countries is not a dogma. We are open to all constructive proposals on the subject from any State.\nThe Ukrainian delegation believes that the forty-third session of the General Assembly can make a substantive contribution to a businesslike discussion of the concept of comprehensive security. We hope that this session will step-up the search for common approaches by states to specific aspects of world security. The objective is to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations and its principal bodies, to enhance the role of the Secretary-General, inter alia in the settlement of conflicts between States through negotiations, good offices and mediation, and to make better use of military observers and United Nations peace-keeping forces. United Nations actions in this area should be developed and expanded. It was with great satisfaction that we learned of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. We believe that these forces will continue to be worthy of this trust and this honour. We are firmly convinced that the United Nations should play a decisive role in mankind's progress towards a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world. It is important to ensure in practice that the United Nations and its bodies are effective in implementing their function of maintaining peace and security. It is our view that the political conditions now exist for the full realization of the peace-making potential of the United Nations in accordance with its Charter.\nThe main road to comprehensive security lies through disarmament. We note as a very positive sign the emerging understanding of the need to adopt a comprehensive approach to disarmament issues, combining a strengthening of confidence and the establishment of an affective verification mechanism with the preparation of realistic programmes for the reduction and elimination of specific types of armaments, based on a balance of Interests rather than a balance of forces. Nuclear disarmament is the most important part of the disarmament process. An early agreement on a 50 per cent cut in the strategic offensive arms of the Soviet Union and the United States is among the urgently necessary measures leading to this goal. Unquestionably, this problem is not a simple one. It is probably the most complicated problem in the post-war world politics. However, given the necessary political will on both sides, a treaty could be concluded in the near future.\nThe world community should concentrate on making nuclear disarmament a continuous, ever-growing and deepening process. Only through joint efforts by all States will it be possible to eliminate nuclear weapons completely and guarantee that they will never reappear. We believe that to this end the potential of the United Nations, especially of the Security Council, should be used to the maximum extent, and that better use should be made of all existing negotiating mechanisms, including that most important body, the Conference on Disarmament.\nIn practical terms, it is necessary to concentrate on implementing United Nations decisions on key problems associated with curbing the arms race - particularly those measures adopted by consensus. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR shares many of the ideas contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization in 1988 and considers particularly pertinent his comment that\n\\\"... the great Powers need to show a sensitivity to the expressed wishes of the majority of Member States.\\\" (A/43/1, p. 8)\nThe noble goal of ridding mankind of weapons of mass destruction will remain an empty dream if weapons are not effectively barred from outer space. Therefore, no attempts to establish a need for the strategic defence initiative can be accepted, from either the moral point of view or that of strengthening security. Much has been said, at this rostrum and elsewhere, about its non-defensive and destabilizing nature and its serious dangers for all mankind.\nThe Ukrainian SSR believes that compliance with the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems (ABM), signed in 1972, and the commitment not to withdraw from it for specified period guarantee world stability, the successful solution of the problems of strategic offensive weapons and greater international security. It is important that this be reflected in the agreement currently being negotiated in Geneva between the Soviet Union and the United States, in strict conformity with the Washington understanding of 10 December 1987.\nWe also favour supplementing the bilateral negotiations between the USSR and the United States with effective multilateral efforts, in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament, to prevent an arms race in outer space. Today the interests of common security dictate that we work actively on agreements to ban all anti-satellite weapons, ensure the immunity of artificial earth satellites, and institute an international system to verify that no arms of any kind are placed in outer space.\t'\nAt the same time; international mechanisms should be established within the framework of the United Nations which could specifically address the issue of multilateral co-operation in outer spice. A number of initiatives have been advanced in this regard the task now is to implement them. The proposal to set up a centre for international co-operation on the peaceful uses of outer space on the basis of the Krasnoyarsk radar station deserves special attention.\nA ban on nuclear testing is a key aspect of nuclear disarmament. It is necessary to take one more decisive step to achieve an agreement on a comprehensive and total test ban. If the ongoing negotiations between the USSR and the United States are supplemented by appropriate multilateral efforts in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament, this could bring us very close to completion of an agreement in the Interest of all countries. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR believes that a combination of bilateral and multilateral efforts in this manner will lead to an early, successful solution to this important question.\nThe atom must be used only for peaceful purposes. The socialist countries, rejecting nuclear intimidation, have proposed the concept of using nuclear energy for the benefit of mankind. That concept, in its most concentrated form, is expounded in the programme for the establishment of an international regime for the safe development of nuclear power put forward by the Soviet Union. Implementation of this programme would promote closer international co-operation in the area of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and make the work more systematic and purposeful. In this context, the Ukrainian delegation believes that it is important to strengthen further the existing relevant international instruments, while strictly enforcing non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nThe international community has come close to resolving the vital question of the conclusion of a universal convention on the complete and comprehensive prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons. This is one of the priority objectives in the field of disarmament. The elimination of chemical Weapons would be a real contribution to ensuring genuine and equal security for States. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR hopes that the General Assembly, at its forty-third session, will direct the efforts of the negotiators towards the early conclusion of the drafting of the convention, and will promote opposition to chemical weapons and their use.\t.\nIn our view, the process of disarmament becomes pointless if, at the same time as certain types of arms are eliminated, steps are taken to build up military power or introduce so-called compensation measures. This runs, counter to basic logic. That is why, while giving understandable priority to the elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, we favour significant cuts in conventional arms and armed forces.\nOn the basis of principle, the position of the socialist countries on the issue was formulated as far back as 198S, in Budapest. It was supplemented and made more specific at a recent meeting in Warsaw of the Political Consultative Committee of the member States of the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The documents of that meeting stress that the interests of European and common security make it imperative to move towards significant cuts in armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals. Negotiations on this could get under way this year. Their primary objective must be radically to reduce the military potential of both alliances, and to create in the continent a situation in which the countries of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Treaty Organization would retain the forces and means necessary for defence, but insufficient for launching a surprise attack or conducting offensive operations.\nThe more real the disarmament process becomes, the greater the importance that must be given to verification mechanisms, as a vital means of ensuring security. At the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament a number of socialist countries put forward specific proposals for the establishment of broad international verification procedures, under the auspices of the United Nations, to monitor compliance with agreements, reduce international tensions, limit arms and review the military situation in areas of conflict. In our view, we should proceed immediately to develop the main parameters of the future verification mechanism.\nConfidence and openness are major factors in establishing security in the military sphere. It is necessary to promote a transition from individual confidence-building measures and openness to broad-scale policy in this area. The Ukrainian SSR supports the appeal of the General Assembly to ensure the widest possible dissemination of objective information on military questions. It is time to begin to work out, in the framework of the United Nations, objective criteria and parameters to ensure openness and thus facilitate the process of real disarmament. We actively support disarmament and we believe that demilitarisation will have tangible results for mankind as a whole. Among other things it will help to release vast material and intellectual resources for the purposes of social and economic development.\nFinding solutions to regional conflicts is a matter of the highest priority and immediate concern for our Organization. We are pleased to note that in recent months there has been a positive movement in some of these areas.\nA genuine breakthrough has been achieved in resolving the Afghan problem. A precedent has been set that goes far beyond the framework of that question. The prestige of the United Nations has been considerably enhanced and its effectiveness and great potential for settling regional conflicts have been demonstrated.\nThe provisions of the Geneva Agreements elaborated under the auspices of the United Nations must be strictly observed by all parties. As is well known, the Soviet Union fully complies with those Agreements. We expect others to do likewise. The United Nations, and in particular the present session of the General Assembly, is called upon to play an important role in securing a comprehensive and all-round solution to the Afghan problem.\nThe eight-year-long tragic and destructive war between Iran and Iraq has been halted. Thanks to the efforts of the United Nations, its Secretary-General and the members of the Security Council, it has been possible to begin to implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987). It is our hope that the people of Baghdad and Tehran will never again have to look up to the sky with fear or to hear the sound of artillery fire. We hope that tankers will no longer be going up in flames and that fishermen and innocent passengers will no longer be victims of the concentration of naval forces in the waters of the Persian Gulf. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic welcomes the readiness of the five permanent members of the Security Council to contribute to settling the conflict, with the mediation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nSerious progress has been made in resolving the situation around Kampuchea. It is based on realistic, specific proposals made by the Governments of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Indonesia and other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, proposals that are aimed at a political settlement of the conflict in the spirit of national reconciliation. In this context, recognition of the Kampuchean people's right to a free social and political choice is of fundamental significance. It is incumbent on all States to promote a favourable political climate for the continuation and fruitful completion of the negotiating process on this issue.\nThere have been certain changes in the situation in southern Africa. The Ukrainian SSR looks for the successful and early completion of the quadripartite negotiations with a view to settling the situation in the region. The international community should exert pressure on the South African racist regime and ensure the implementation of appropriate United Nations resolutions, ' particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1973). The Ukrainian SSR firmly supports the speedy eradication of the shameful system of apartheid.\nThe transition from confrontation to the political settlement of conflicts with the active participation of the United Nations could and must become an important feature of the late 1980s.\nWe believe that during this session of the General Assembly the adoption by consensus of a declaration on the prevention and elimination of disputes and situations that might threaten international peace and security, and on the role of the United Nations in this area, could become a landmark for progress in this direction.\nAt the same time we must note that some regional conflicts have not yet reached the stage of practical settlement and continue seriously to threaten international peace and security. We are particularly concerned about the situation in the Middle East. The conflict in that region can be resolved only through political means. The International Peace Conference on the Middle East could become an effective instrument for a Middle East settlement and, within its framework, a solution to the key Palestinian problem. The Conference should be attended by all parties concerned, including the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, the PLO, and the permanent members of the Security Council. We call on the world community to speak out unambiguously, in the course of the present session of the General Assembly, in favour of the prompt convening of that Conference.\nThe situation in Central America remains a complex one. Interference in the affairs of the States of the region obstructs positive trends towards a peaceful settlement on the basis of the efforts of the Contadora Group. The validity of this conclusion is widely recognized throughout the world, including the United States. The main responsibility for tensions in the region rests with the United States Administration. It should indeed give serious thought to this fact, rather than lecturing others on how and which God to worship. The Nicaraguan people must be given the opportunity to exercise their right to a free choice of their path of development.\nAs in the past, we support the peace-loving initiatives of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. The realization of the Republic's proposals with regard to turning the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-weapon-free zone and with regard to seeking large-scale, stage-by-stage reductions in armed forces and withdrawing United States troops from South Korea would make a tangible contribution to strengthening peace on the Korean peninsula. We strongly oppose intentions of perpetuating the division of Korea.\nToday there is no need to prove that the elimination of existing crisis situations and the prevention of new ones is the highest priority task of the world community.\nAnother imperative of our time is the prevention of irreversible changes in the environment and the preservation of the planet's natural resources for succeeding generations. This has become an urgent matter both for the international community as a whole and for each of its individual members. The Earth, together with Nature and its resources, is a common heritage. That is why it is essential immediately to change ways of thinking and conduct at national and international levels in order to protect the environment.\nThese objectives could be served by the concept of international ecological security set forth by the socialist countries, which has a clear and practical orientation; to utilize the median ism of the United Nations and begin the elaboration of the norms of ecological behaviour of States and basic guidelines for co-operation in the area. We hope that the United Nations will play a decisive role in mobilizing the efforts of the international common to resolve the task of preserving the environment. The expanding political dialogue on numerous vital problems of concern to mankind creates a rather encouraging background for the development of international economic relations. The state of the world economy continues to be extremely unstable. Of particular concern is the worsening economic situation of the developing countries, which suffer both from their unequal status in the world economic system and from the ever growing volume of foreign debt.\nThe existence of difficulties in international economic relations, which are being further exacerbated, is indicative of the need to democratise the entire system of world economic ties, to establish a new international economic order and to ensure the international economic security of States.\nIn the context of the growing internationalisation of world economic ties and the interdependence of national economies, there is a need for joint action by all countries and peoples to develop stable and predictable international economic exchanges   as well as broad co-operation on an equitable and just basis, in order to ensure for all countries a way of life worthy of man. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic is in favour of intensifying universal dialogue on international economic policies in the United Nations.\nThe Ukrainian SSR is prepared to co-operate actively with all those who are striving to contribute to the democratization of international relations and to the strengthening of comprehensive security. The profound processes of perestroika, now under way in the Ukraine, as in the entire Soviet Union, envisage intensification of our foreign policy activities on the basis of realism and take into account the diversity of interests and priorities of values common to all mankind. According to First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine, Vladimir V, Shcherbitsky,\n\\\"perestroika ... is exerting an ever-growing influence on developments in the modern world and, primarily, is creating a favourable situation for the strengthening of international security\\\".\nWe hope that efforts to create a world founded on reasonable and civilized relations between States and peoples will be supported by all delegations. We believe that the forty-third session of the General Assembly will give a fresh impetus to mankind's progress towards a safer future and will help transform the United Nations Into an effective instrument of peace.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, I extend to Mr. Dante Caputo sincere congratulations on his election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I know that his wisdom and competence will enable him to guide the present session to a fruitful conclusion. My delegation also pays a tribute to his predecessor, Comrade Peter Florin whose talents as a diplomat and dedication to peace and disarmament contributed to the success of the work of the General Assembly during a particularly difficult period. \nWe should also like to take advantage of this opportunity to reaffirm our confidence in the Secretary-General in carrying out his outstanding role in strengthening peace and co-operation among people and his efforts to resolve the very sensitive international problems that have arisen during the past years.\nThe international situation as a whole has shown signs of improvement. Since the four Soviet-United States Summit Meetings which made it possible to ratify the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - signed in Washington, a new era has opened in the history of international relations. The period of the extended cold war between East and West, characterized by mutual distrust, confrontation and the use of force in the settlement of conflicts is drawing to a close and seem gradually to be giving way to a new era in which the primacy of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter, namely, those of dialogue and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, is reaffirmed. \nIn the context of the implementation of the provisions of the INF Treaty, a control and verification commission has been established by the two parties, and it is encouraging to note that so far its work has been extremely satisfactory. Our delegation sees in this a commendable effort by all concerned gradually to achieve nuclear disarmament, which, if it is to be effective, requires other more energetic measures which can make a significant contribution to halting the nuclear arms race. In this context, the Lao delegation hopes for a speedy conclusion by the two great Powers of another treaty on a 50 per cent reduction in strategic offensive weapons, thus opening the way to the creation of a new, safer, non-nuclear world, as proposed by the Soviet Union on 15 January 1986 in its programme for the progressive elimination of all nuclear weapons by the end of the century. \nThe disarmament process is extremely complex. While the danger of nuclear war continues to be the most serious threat to mankind, other categories of weapons of mass destruction also threaten the security of peoples. We are thinking of chemical weapons and, in particular, binary, neutron and radiological weapons. In this regard, it is urgently necessary that greater progress be made in the Conference on Disarmament in working out a convention prohibiting the production and use of such weapons.\nIt is true that the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, held in New York last June, did not achieve the expected results, because of the lack of political will on the pact of certain imperialist Powers. Nevertheless, it provided an opportunity for the international community to become more aware of certain new, positive developments in the world situation and, consequently, to agree to devote greater efforts to achieving the desired objective, namely, general and complete disarmament under effective international control.\nThe world of today, whether we like it or not, is becoming increasingly interdependent. In the nuclear and space age, security can be conceived only comprehensively, and must be equal for all countries and peoples regardless of their size, their social and economic system and their level of development. It is therefore essential for the international common to contribute actively to exchanges of views and frank and constructive discussions on ways and means to achieve the formulation and establishment of a general system of peace and international security designed to cover the political-military sphere as well as the economic, humanitarian and ecological spheres. The Lao Government reaffirms its full support for both the concept and the effective implementation of that system. \nThe favourable international atmosphere created by the Soviet-American summit meetings has undoubtedly made a positive contribution to the search for solutions to certain regional conflicts, including some of the roost complex of our century. However, obstacles to the equitable settlement of certain other conflicts continue to exist.\nIn southern Africa, following serious military setbacks in Angola since the beginning of the year, the myth of the military invincibility of the Pretoria Government has become untenable. Faced with such a situation and given the strong pressure being exerted by the international community. South Africa has had to beat a retreat with regard to its criminal policy of apartheid, without, however, renouncing its fundamental desire to persecute the black majority of the South African population, its continued illegal occupation of Namibia, or its acts of aggression and destabilization against independent, sovereign front-line States. The racist regime has had to agree recently to a series of negotiations with the representatives of Cuba, Angola and the United states aimed at reaching a lasting political solution to the Angolan and Namibian problems. The Lao Government reaffirms its full solidarity with the oppressed peoples of South Africa and Namibia in their heroic struggle under the leader chip of their respective national liberation movements to regain their right to self-determination and independence in accordance with the spirit and letter of the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nIn the Maghreb, a climate of understanding has been established recently, thus opening the way to the settlement of the conflicts in the region. In this context, our delegation welcomes the efforts made by the United Nations Secretary-General, in carrying out his mission of good offices, to achieve a just and final solution to the problem of Western Sahara. We favour a speedy settlement of this problem, that guarantees the exercise by the people of Western Sahara of its inalienable right to self-determination and independence, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\nIn the Indian Ocean region, the imperialist Powers continue to maintain their military presence, thus causing a permanent threat to the independence and security of the coastal and hinterland States. It is essential that in the interest of peace and international co-operation, the International Conference on the Indian Ocean be convened in Colombo at an early date, and in any event not later than 1990, in consultation, as proposed by the General Assembly, with the host country. \nIn the Middle East given the policy of oppression and barbaric Zionist aggression the heroic Palestinian people, both in the occupied territories and outside Palestine continues to struggle for recognition and the recovery of its fundamental inalienable rights including that of founding its own State in Palestine. The international community can only welcome the resolutions of the Arab summit meeting held last June in Algiers and its insistence on the need urgently to convene an international conference peace in the Middle East, with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on an equal footing with the other parties involved.\nThere has been an important new positive development in the situation in the Persian Gulf following the establishment of the cease-fire concluded under the aegis of the United Nations between Iran and Iraq. Mow that prospects for peace seem to be emerging in the region everything possible should be done to ensure integral implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1988).\t\nThe Lao Government and people are gratified by this and consider it an important step towards the definitive cessation of this terrible conflict. They support the sincere and tireless efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General in the search for a just and honourable conclusion to this war which has lasted too long. Moreover the Lao delegation calls on the great Powers immediately to put an end to their military presence in the region a presence which up to now has served only to' aggravate the situation. The withdrawal from the Gulf of foreign military force would in our view create favourable conditions for the integral implementation of Security Council resolution 5S8 (1988). \nIn Central America and the Caribbean the peoples of Nicaragua, Panama, Argentina and other countries are continuing to wage their determined struggle to preserve their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and to recover their inalienable rights to self-determination and genuine independence. The Lao Government deems it its duty to support that struggle in order to thwart and stop in time any manoeuvres based on aggression, intimidation, destabilization and sabotage undertaken by the imperialist circles of a certain great Power regarding the regional peace process.\nThe Lao Government and people welcome and firmly support the tireless efforts of the coastal countries of the Mediterranean to transform this strategic region into a zone of peace, security and co-operation. Thus they are following the development of the situation in Cyprus with concern and sympathy and express their full solidarity with the people and Government of the Republic of Cyprus in the struggle they are waging to preserve their independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and the non-aligned status of their country, by demanding the immediate cessation of all separatist actions and by actively encouraging the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his mission of good offices in order to achieve a just and lasting solution to the grievous problem of Cyprus.\nThe international community welcomed with satisfaction and hope the agreements concluded in Geneva on the Afghan problem but for the time being it would seem that its greatest concern is focused on their sincere application by all signatory States. While up to now the Soviet Union and the Republic of Afghanistan have correctly and rigorously applied them, it is regrettable to note that other parties to the agreements have not fully honoured the commitments they have undertaken. The international community must therefore encourage and urge them scrupulously and sincerely to carry out those agreements.\nA situation of tension still prevails in the region of Asia and the Pacific because of the neo-globalist policy pursued by an imperialist super-Power. The Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms its support for the constructive proposal of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea regarding the gradual reduction of armed forces of the two parts of Korea and opposes any attempt to push through the admission of the two parts of Korea to the United Nations, which would hamper efforts aimed at the peaceful and independent reunification of that country.\nAnother highly relevant proposal, advocated by the People's Republic of Mongolia, the goal of which is to promote a climate of peace and co-operation in the region, provides for the establishment of a regime of non-use of force in relations among the countries of the region. My Government firmly supports that proposal.\nThe situation in South-East Asia has developed in accordance with general world trend towards the search for the settlement of conflicts through negotiation. Following the proclamation last year by the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea of its policy of national reconciliation, the President of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Hun Sen, and Prince Sihanouk held two series of important talks in Paris. In addition to the informal meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, Mr. Hun Sen once again put forward on behalf of his Government a seven-point proposal to find a political solution to the Kampuchean problem. That proposal attests to the growing development, maturity and political wisdom of the Government of the Peopled Republic of Kampuchea. The Lao People's Democratic Republic greatly appreciates the results of that meeting and firmly supports the joint position adopted by the latter, namely, that the. problem of Kampuchea must be resolved by political means leading to the building of an independent Kampuchea, a sovereign, neutral and non-aligned country, on the basis of national reconciliation and respect for the right to self-determination of the Kampuchean - people, and that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea must proceed  together, with the non-return to power in Kampuchea of the Pol Pot clique, which practises a policy of genocide and with a guarantee of the cessation of foreign interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea as well as of military assistance to the opposing Kampuchean forces. Ito move forward the encouraging results of their Informal meeting, Mr. Hun Sen and Prince Sihanouk have taken the wise decision to meet again in Paris at the end of this year. \nWe also welcome the positive initiative recently taken by the current Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement for a technical meeting in Heir are to discuss the question of Kampuchea and to establish for that purpose an ad hoc committee of the non-aligned.\nThe Lao Government is firmly dedicated to the fundamental principle of settling all disputes between States by negotiation. We believe that on the basis of the Bandung Principles, the 1971 Kuala Lumpur Declaration of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the seven-point proposal that the Lao delegation put forward at the Jakarta Informal Meeting in July, the countries of the region will be able to consult regularly to bring their points of view closer together and to strengthen mutual understanding in order to transform South-East Asia into a zone of peace friendship and co-operation thus meeting the legitimate aspirations and interests of their respective peoples.\nIn this context it is regrettable that the border dispute between my country and Thailand has not yet been resolved. The two rounds of negotiations which took piece last March in Bangkok and Vientiane have not yet yielded concrete results. The third round of negotiations could not be held in Thailand because of the recent political crisis in that country. Following general elections a new Thai Government has been established and since then exchange visits of delegations at different levels between the two countries have been carried out in a genuine search for better mutual understanding. Given that atmosphere we believe it is high time for the two countries to open new negotiations as the Lao side has proposed. The Government of the Lao people's Democratic Republic is ready to do everything in its power to settle the border dispute between it and Thailand immediately and finally. \nSince the forty-second session of the Assembly the lot of the peoples of the third world has not notably improved. Poverty, hunger, sickness and backwardness are still the daily plight of the great majority of them.\nThe restrictive macro-economic policy pursued by certain market-economy developed countries has only aggravated the effects of the world economic crisis, and it is the developing countries, particularly the least developed, that have suffered the most. The resurgence of protectionist measures, high interest rates, the deterioration of the terms of trade and the crushing burden of the external debt, which has continued to grow over the years, are all major reasons for the gravity of the situation.\nMy Government believes that in the struggle to establish a more just and equitable new international economic order the strengthening of collective autonomy must take pride of place. The Lao Government sincerely welcomes the first results of the implementation of the process of co-ordination and harmonization of programmes of action for economic co-operation between the non-aligned countries and the other developing countries. In the light of its growing Interest in International co-operation for development, and in order to make its participation in the struggle to establish a new international economic order more effective, the Lao Government recently announced its new economic policy, which includes a law on foreign investments, under which it intends to develop and expand its economic and trade relations with all other countries.\nThe present session of the General Assembly is taking place in a climate that is both encouraging and alarming. Numerous challenges continue to emerge on the way to a new era of a non-violent world free of nuclear weapons. However, it is encouraging that there is unanimity in the Assembly in favour of peace, thus attesting to the unquestionable desire of Member States to live in universal understanding and full security, lb achieve that objective and thus meet the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the world, our Organization must undertake enormous, complex task which requires of us all a sense of responsibility and common political will. The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms its unswerving dedication to the cause of peace, peaceful coexistence and international co-operation and will associate itself with the efforts of the\ninternational community to attain that common goal.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and my delegation I would like to present our warmest congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. His election is certainly a testimony to the high appreciation that his country, Argentina, deserves from the international community  and an additional acknowledgement of his well-known qualities as a diplomat and statesman. I would like to assure him of the complete co-operation of my delegation in the fulfilment of his mandate.\nAllow me also to take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, on the highly satisfactory results achieved during his presidency of the forty-second session.\nAllow me to express my most profound admiration to the Secretary-General, for his dedication and dynamism in handling the questions under consideration by our Organisation and for his enlightened,\u00b7 dedicated and courageous actions in search of solutions to some regional conflicts affecting the world.\nWe note with satisfaction that the United Nations is currently experiencing a fruitful period; its role and the role of the Secretary-General are considered to be important, I would even say indispensable, by all countries. As the culmination of this universal acknowledgement of the relevant action of the United Nations, the peace-keeping forces were awarded the Nobel Peace Prise, a highly significant event. We note that all countries, including the super-Powers, which is an important point, by virtue of their position and above all by their behaviour, define the United Nations as a place uniquely suited to the multilateral examination at political level of issues that are crucial to the future of humanity. In this context, the United Nations will be better able to operate more efficiently towards achieving the objectives and principles on which it was founded and will, it is to be hoped, be able to promote peace and security in the whole world and international co-operation for the multilateral development of all peoples.\nIndeed, peace and development are the two main concerns of the world. Regarding peace, we have lately witnessed promising developments, thanks to the new relationship now existing between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, and to prospects for a peaceful solution of the various conflicts that exist in the world.\nIndeed, 1988 has been marked by events that constitute a crucial turning-point in the panorama of international politics. There is a climate of relaxation, of detente, between East and West which does not seem to be only temporary. It does not seem to be a cyclical phenomenon such as we have so often observed in international relations during past decades, which often disappeared under the stormy waves of ideological and expansionistic conflicts.\nThis relaxation is based ultimately on a rational approach to the opposition between the two main socio-political systems of the world. There is a new awareness of the absurdity of entertaining ideas of military supremacy in order to impose one's ideology upon others, since, in the nuclear era, that would be an irreversible path which not only could lead to the complete destruction of everything man has built, but might also mean the end of all forms of life on the surface of the earth. \nHowever  it is clear that as long as there are people and ideas competition must serve as an important factor in progress, both through the improvement necessary to maintain competitiveness and through the progressive integration of opposed theses into a global synthesis. But peaceful competition is the only option.\nWe may say that a new political and military mentality is emerging at the international level  creating the possibility of true coexistence among nations in a contradictory but interconnected and interdependent world  coexistence based on the principles of a \\\"humanized\\\" international law which really takes into consideration the interests of all countries and peoples of the world.\nRespect for the equality of the rights of States  for national independence and sovereignty, for the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs and for the right of peoples to choose the social and political system best suited to their specific characteristics ~ that will be the possible outcome if this new political mentality prevails as a palpable reality and not as mere rhetoric. If it does triumph  we will see peace flourish and international co-operation broaden, to the great benefit of all the peoples of the world.\nIn December last year Washington became the unique arena for events which brought hope to the world  events such as the historic landmark represented by the signing by American and Soviet leaders of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, the IMF Treaty.\nThis significant event, interpreted as a precursor of nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament - the great aspiration of all the peoples of the world - means in our opinion the final elimination of the obsolete cold war, and indicates the beginning of an era in which confrontation is replaced by co-operation in the relationship between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, with important and very positive results, not only for their respective peoples, but also for the entire international community.\nThe four Reagan-Gorbachev summit meetings confirmed the existence of a dynamic favourable not only to positive progress on the path towards disarmament, but also to the stabilisation of Soviet-American relations. For developing peoples, if this dynamic continues to consolidate until a world without weapons and without violence may be built, there is the possibility of seeing the enormous amounts absorbed by the arms race being used for man's development and happiness.\nIf universal human values finally become a priority in relations among States and nations, there would be some hope of putting an end to the regional conflicts which bathe our countries in blood and destroy them, causing misery, hunger and suffering. \nWe note this evolution with satisfaction: it has led to specific results in the search for peaceful solutions to the conflicts in various regions of \u0386\u00a9 world. In some of those conflicts, recourse to the principles and mechanisms of the United Nations has been decisive.\t'\nEvidence of this development is to be found in the peace agreements signed in Geneva with regard to Afghanistan, in the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the consequent beginning of direct negotiations between the parties with a view to the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), and in the progress currently being made in finding a peaceful solution in Western Sahara, Central America, Kampuchea and south-east Africa.\nIn southern Africa, in our solidarity with the People's Republic of Angola, we are following with deep interest the progress of the quadripartite peace negotiations and the prospects opened up for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We praise the constructive, discerning and courageous spirit with which the Government of the People's Republic of Angola is seeking a peaceful, fair and permanent solution to the conflict.\nIn spite of these new prospects for negotiation, the international community must intensify its efforts to exert pressure on South Africa, with a view to speedy implementation of the process of independence for Namibia end to the establishment of a democratic and multiracial society in South Africa. \nThe positive evolution observed in the approach to the above-mentioned conflicts is, unfortunately, not seen in other regions of the world. This is especially true in the Middle East, where only Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination will permit the achievement of a just and permanent solution to the conflict.\nWe reiterate once more our belief that the International Conference on the Middle East should be convened as soon as possible, with the participation of all the parties involved, including the Palestine Liberation Organisation, as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nMoreover, we cannot but express our concern regarding the continued aggression and occupation of East Timor and the fact that it is impossible for its people to enjoy their legitimate rights to self-determination end independence.\nWe appeal to Indonesia, in the light of its historic tradition as a founding member and champion of the principles of the Movement of Hon-Aligned Countries, to co-operate with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the continued efforts being made within the framework of General Assembly resolution 37/30 to bring about a just solution of this matter.\nSince the beginning of the 1960s, special emphasis has been laid on the need to make changes in international economic relations, especially in the areas of trade and price mechanisms for raw materials, with stress on the principle of reciprocity of advantages in international trade. In this regard, a number of initiatives have been widely debated, and important decisions Have been taken by the United Nations and the various specialised agencies in the United Nations system. By examining the various agreements and resolutions, however, we may conclude that there have been too many partial solutions and too many broken promises.\nThe economic crisis besetting the developing countries does not allow them even to solve their food deficit. At the same time, all of them are in a situation in which they cannot comply with their foreign debt obligations and the servicing of that debt, the majority are becoming increasingly dependent on elements outside their region, and their development is accordingly blocked. In this context, the urgent convening of an international conference on the African foreign debt, in accordance with the decision of the Heads of State and Government of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), is of the highest importance to our countries.\nThese measures have not contributed effectively throughout the years to narrowing the gap between developed and developing countries, or to diminishing the economic and social imbalances existing in the world.\nIf, in the past, industrial countries could not, or did not want to, face up to the deep structural imbalances observed in the economic situation of the world, today it is no longer possible to continue to ignore the need to take a number of joint decisions if we wish to address the whole problem of underdevelopment effectively.\nThe interdependence of all countries and the global nature of current problems are not compatible with short-sighted egoism, which seeks to ignore the fact that the development of all peoples is a fundamental condition for international peace and security.\nSince each country has the responsibility of designing and choosing the model of development which is most appropriate for its specific characteristics, it is important for the international community to undertake a joint project for all countries, accepting international co-operation as a complement to everyone's individual efforts based on the democratic principles of solidarity and mutual interest. \nAmong the fields in which international co-operation is required, we can also mention the protection of the environment. Today, the relationship between environment and development is unquestionable and It has become urgent for us to take a global approach to the problem, which should lead to appropriate follow-up action.\nWe cannot fail to denounce the criminal complicity of certain economic agents of the West and some of their corrupt African allies, who are trying to use Africa as a depository for toxic and radioactive waste, and we hope that the analysis of the question during this session will culminate in a vigorous condemnation of those practices.\nAt this session the General Assembly will examine, among other items, the results of the application of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development adopted in 1986 at its thirteenth special session. The recent meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly entrusted with the assessment of that Programme completed its work here in the United Nations with satisfactory results, since it provided an opportunity for the parties concerned, two years after its adoption, to make an in-depth analysis and to consult with each other in an attempt to find the best ways of enhancing co-operation between Africa and the international community and of bringing about recovery in the impoverished African economy. \nWhile acknowledging the fundamental role to be played by African Governments in the elaboration of strategies for the implementation of the programme and taking into consideration the current serious economic situation in Africa, the meeting rightly emphasised the need for the international community to take urgent measures to speed up implementation over the next few years, especially by increasing the financial contributions to our countries on a predictable and sustained basis, thus supporting the efforts of the continent, especially in the field of agriculture.\nIn order to overcome underdevelopment, we need to be clear and consistent in our analysis and denunciation of, and our battle against, factors brought about by our own mistakes. We must recognize that co-operation and solidarity among developing countries have not been taken sufficiently into consideration; it might even be said that they had been neglected. We must take specific and decisive measures towards the improvement of South-South co-operation and mutual assistance as an essential element in the establishment of a new international economic order.\nIn the case of the African continent, there are various initiatives towards subregional economic integration that absolutely must be consolidated so that we may overcome the current balkanization, which is one of the reasons for our difficulties in achieving endogenous and self-sufficient development.\nOn the other hand, we must have the courage to recognize the relationship between political power as it is exercised in many of our countries of the third world and underdevelopment. It is incontestable that development is essentially a cultural phenomenon, which requires the active participation of conscientious and responsible citizens. We must fight for the generalisation and consolidation of democracy, without which there can be no flowering of the people's creative spirit, which is the foundation that supports true development.\nIn Sao Tone and Principe we are promoting an experiment in the involvement of the people in the political, economic and social life of the nation and the society, an experiment that we hope will be successful. After thorough, open, critical and outspoken debate on the problems that slow down our economic development, we decided that the State must withdraw from the management of productive units and that the citizen must bear the main responsibility for initiatives designed to bring about the economic recovery of the country. At the same time we took a historic step tower\u00b7 \u0437 wider democratisation of our political life when we decided to grant freedom of expression to all political tendencies within the sole party. And we do not reject the idea of future evolution towards a plurality of parties, when the social, political and cultural contest justifies this.\nWhile this situation of democratic tolerance in our small country, as witnessed by Amnesty International when it visited Sao Tome and Principe a few weeks ago at our invitation, is a comforting reality for us, we cannot but be concerned about what is happening in more than half the countries of the world with respect to civil and human rights, as revealed by that same organisation a few days ago in its report, in the very year in which we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This historic Declaration acknowledges that respect for the inalienable rights of all the members of the human family is the basis of freedom, justice and peace in the world. \n\nAlthough the objectives established by the Declaration may have seemed too ambitious for its tine, the progressive translation of its principles into rules of international law is today a reality which, in many parts of the world, stimulates and inspires all those who are fighting for respect for the inherent dignity of all human beings.\nThe Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, aware of its responsibilities in this field and wishing to participate in the international movement to safeguard and protect human rights, has recently ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in the belief that all human rights are indivisible and interrelated.\nI conclude by wishing this Assembly every success in its work, so that it may contribute effectively to the establishment of understanding among men and among nations, and to the material and spiritual progress of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me particular pleasure on behalf of the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania, to convey to you, Mr. President, as well as to the Secretary-General, cordial greetings and best wishes for success in your highly responsible function; strengthening the role of the United Nations in, and its contribution to, the solution of crucial issues of our world.\nIt is my great privilege, on the instructions of the President of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, to present his thoughts and proposals on the main issues of international life, which are to be found on the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. Romania considers that, although in the year which has elapsed since the preceding session some steps have been taken in the direction of nuclear disarmament and the solution through negotiations of international disputes, the situation in the world continues to be particularly grave and complex. No radical turn has been achieved towards peace, security and co-operation, the increase of mutual confidence, respect for equality between States, non-interference in their internal affairs, and respect for the independence and sovereignty of each State.\nThe quantitative and qualitative arms race has continued unabated, stimulated by research and the development of new nuclear weapons. Grave conflicts are continuing in some parts of the world, constituting potential threats to world peace and security. The world economic crisis, which has particularly aggravated the condition of the developing countries, has resulted in deepening the gap between the rich and the poor countries and has become a real obstacle to the progress of all States.\nIn view of the danger that the arms race presents for the present and the future or mankind, Romania submitted to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament its considerations and proposals on disarmament issues and on the course of action that States should take for their solution.\nAs members know, the special session concluded with no decision, thereby disregarding the wishes and expectations of the great majority of the peoples of the world. Nevertheless, it strongly demonstrated the almost unanimous decision of all States and peoples to put an end to the harmful policy of armaments and to proceed resolutely, before it is too late, with concrete disarmament measures.\nThe interests of world peace and security require the United Nations to make full use of the many proposals and ideas put forward by all States at the special session, in order further to increase its role in multilateral negotiations. In view o\u00a3 present international conditions and proceeding front the reality that the intensification of the arms race, especially the nuclear across race, constitutes a grave danger for international peace and security, Romania submits to the attention of this world forum the following measures which it believes should be taken: the adoption by the United Nations of a comprehensive programme for nuclear and general disarmament, which would take into account the proposals submitted by all States at the recent special session; the adoption by the General Assembly of a call on the Soviet Union and the United States of America to conclude the treaty on the 50 per cent reduction of their strategic weapons at the earliest possible time; the prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests and the curbing of the development of all such weapons, as well as of new military technologies and weapons of mass destruction; the prevent \u043b of the extension of the arms race into outer space and the adoption of measures conducive to the renunciation of the militarization of outer space, which should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes; the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons, along with actions aimed at reducing and eliminating nuclear armaments; the reduction of military budgets, including the adoption of unilateral measures and the basis setting of mutual examples; the undertaking of measures conducive to \u03b5 sizeable reduction In the number of troops and conventional armaments and military expenditures - in this respect, negotiations on conventional disarmament In Europe should start later this year; encouragement by the United Nations of the creation of zones free of nuclear and chemical weapons in the Balkans and in other regions of the world; the strengthening of the role and the capacity of the United Nations to act in the field of peace and disarmament, as well as the role of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. \nAmong the actions to be taken in order to proceed with the implementation of concrete disarmament measures, ate the finalization and adoption by the United Nations of the principles to govern the negotiation and conclusion of agreements on the reduction of military expenditures. Likewise, we propose the adoption of the report on the economic and social consequences of the arms race and military expenditures, prepared by the Secretary-General with the assistance of a group of experts. The report should be brought to the attention of States, negotiating bodies and public opinion.\nWe also believe that, in order to promote peaceful solutions to disputes and conflicts, the General Assembly should prepare a mandate that would enable it to bring to a successful outcome the initiative submitted by Romania at previous sessions on a procedure to establish a commission of good offices, mediation or conciliation for the peaceful settlement of disputes. At the same time, we believe that work should be continued to identify and clarify the elements which are to constitute the background for an international document on the development and strengthening of good-neighbourly relations among States. \nThe creation of a climate of durable peace and security requires resolute action by all states to educate peoples, including the young generation, in the spirit of mutual confidence and respect, and of the need for co-operation among peoples. It also requires repudiation of any action that would contribute to discord between nations. \nWith this in mind, Romania requested the inclusion of a new item on the agenda , entitled \\\"Responsibility of States to ban in their territory, and to refrain from instigating or supporting in the territory of other States, chauvinistic, racist and other manifestations that may cause discord between peoples and involvement of Gov err n \u00a1cents and the mass media in combating such manifestations and in educating peoples and youth in the spirit of peaceful co-operation and international entente} and evaluation of the implementation of the Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace, Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples\\\".\nTb this end, Romania submits the following\nUnited Nations programmes should provide that Governments will not permit such manifestations and activities and will not instigate or support such acts on the territory of other States. At the same time, United Nations programmes should emphasize the need to promote measures to educate peoples and the young generation in the spirit of the noble ideals of peace, mutual respect and understanding among peoples.\nThe United Nations should address a call to all States for the adoption of concrete measures against those political circles and groupings which promote chauvinism, racism and apartheid and which foster an atmosphere of mistrust between States, discord between peoples and misinformation vis-\u00e0-vis international public opinion.\nWe believe that the Commission for Social Development should be entrusted with the task of reviewing the Implementation of such measures and submitting a report thereon to the General Assembly at its next session. Taking into account the fact that the year 1990 will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption  at the initiative of Romanian of the Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace, Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples, it would be useful to evaluate the practical results of this international document.\nA dramatic reality of our days, which deeply affects the health and the environment of our planet and of its-peoples  is the continuous proliferation of ail sources of pollution of the atmosphere, soil, marine environment and outer space. At the same time, in some countries large quantities of toxic radioactive and polluting substances and wastes continue to accumulate. Lately there has been an increase in attempts to transfer such wastes abroad and deposit them on the territories of other States, usually in less developed countries, or dump them in international waters.\nIn order to eradicate this phenomenon, Romania requested the inclusion on the agenda of a special item entitled: \\\"Responsibility of States for the protection of the environment and prevention of environmental pollution as a result of the accumulation of toxic and radioactive wastes, and strengthening of international co-operation for the purpose of resolving the problem.\\\" To this end, we submit the following.\nA system of universal norms should be established aimed at preventing, by all possible means, such practices and at prosecuting those responsible for such offences. Specific rules should be adopted which would establish the concrete responsibility of States under whose jurisdiction activities resulting in radioactive and toxic wastes are taking place, as well as the responsibility of the producing firms, for the damage caused by fraudulent trans-boundary movements and the dumping of wastes on the territories of other States or in international waters. \nA group of experts should be established, within the framework of the United Nations Environment Programme, which would consider the question of adopting certain guidelines and mandatory norms to be observed by all States.\nPreparatory work should be started with a view to convening, in 1992, a Second United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which would lay the groundwork for broad international co-operation in the field of environmental protection, taking account of the concerns and proposals of all States.\nRomania is deeply concerned about the world economic situation, which continues to deteriorate, and the worsening condition of the developing countries, whose external debt exceeds one trillion dollars. The problems of the world economy cannot be resolved by a few countries alone, however developed they may be. It requires the active participation of all States. In this light, we submit the following.\nThe United Nations should make a thorough assessment of the way in which the principles and the essential provisions of the Declaration and of the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, as well as of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, have been implemented. Such an assessment could be done next year, in view of the fact that, in 1989, 15 years will have elapsed since their adoption. It should result in the preparation of some guidelines for United Nations action in the field of the world economy until the year 2000.\nIn this regard, particular attention should be paid to finding ways and means for resolving the external debt crisis of the developing countries; to revitalizing the world economy and ensuring conditions for reviving the active role of the developing countries in the general process of economic growth; to restructuring the monetary and financial system and to democratizing international financial organizations to eliminating discriminatory practices and barriers from world trade; to refraining from the imposition of trade embargoes and other measures of economic coercion on political grounds} and to ensuring unrestricted access by all States to science and technology.\nThe General Assembly should call upon all States to assume a greater responsibility for the present state of the world economy and to engage fully in genuine negotiations on those issues within the framework of the United Nations. Such negotiations should be attended by all States, both developed and developing, and pursue the objective of reactivating the international economic dialogue. They should be aimed at solving the serious problems of the world economy, eliminating underdevelopment and restructuring international economic relations on a new, more just and more equitable basis.\nA special body should be established within the United Nations to deal with the problem of external debt, and a corresponding organizational structure should be set up within the United Nations Secretariat, through redistribution of existing personnel. Such a body would consider the various aspects of the external debt problem and elaborate specific proposals for solving it, in the multilateral framework offered by the United Nations system.\nIn line with its general policy of peace and broad co-operation with all countries, Romania advocates elimination of the use or threat of force in international relations. It upholds the solution of conflicts and disputes in all parts of the world solely by political means, through negotiations and strict observance of the right of each people to independence and free development, without any interference in its internal affairs and with full respect for its vital interests. Along these lines with regard to the situation in the Middle East, it would be of particular importance to convene as soon as possible a conference under the auspices of the United Nations, in which all interested countries should participate. Including the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel, as well as the permanent members of the Security Council.\nHe welcome the cessation of the war between Iran and Iraq and we hope that, in the framework of the negotiations which started under the auspices of the United Nations, all necessary efforts will be deployed - by each of the two sides - to find mutually acceptable solutions leading to a final settlement of the Gulf conflict. Thus a dangerous hotbed and a threat to peace and security in that region and in the world as a whole would be eliminated.\nRomania has been actively supporting the national liberation struggle of peoples and is firmly in favour of the elimination of any neo-colonial policies and strict observance of the right of every nation to assert itself according to its own aspirations. In this spirit, we support the efforts made, in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978), for the accession of Namibia to independence, which would eliminate one more remnant of colonialism. Likewise we support all initiatives for the peaceful settlement of other problems in the south and west of Africa, as well as in other regions of the world.\nWe also reiterate our solidarity with and active support for the initiatives of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and its political and diplomatic efforts and actions aimed at the peaceful, democratic and independent reunification of Korea. \nThe evolution of international events makes it necessary, today more than ever, that the United Nations act with all resolve to strengthen its role and its contribution, as well as to increase the efficiency of its decisions, in solving the crucial problems of our world. That would fully respond to the aspirations of all peoples for peace, co-operation, independence and social progress.\nTo attain that goal we support the need to improve and simplify the machinery of the United Nations Secretariat and to reduce budgetary expenses. This should be done, however, in such way that the basic political and economic activities of the United Nations are not diminished and its democratic structures not affected.\nTo that end we should consider whether a larger part of the United Nations activities could not be organized on a voluntary basis, without financial implications for the budget of the Organization. We believe that the General Assembly's decisions to cut the staff from 15 to 25 per cent could be implemented at a more speedy pace and that expenses for existing staff be given a more rational basis.\nIn our view, consideration should also be given to the possibility that a State whose nationals in the Secretariat exceed the quota allotted to it be requested to cover the expenses incurred for that part of its personnel above the quota.\nThe final result of the implementation of such measures would be to cut administrative expenses in half. A part of the resources thus saved could be allotted to setting up funds intended for specific activities of the United Nations, mainly for the support of the developing countries, or for other fundamental objectives incumbent upon the United Nations in solving the major issues of international life.\nWhile submitting these considerations and proposals, the Romanian delegation is ready to act in close constructive co-operation with all other delegations, in a spirit of mutual receptivity, so that the decisions adopted fully respond to the trust placed in the United Nations by peoples all over the world. Our actions should respond to their aspirations for the cessation of the arms race and the elimination of under-development, for a better world.\nAs President Nicolae Ceausescu recently emphasized: \\\"Although the world situation, as a whole, is complex and serious, we share the confidence that the peoples and the progressive political forces, have the necessary strength to change for the better the course of events, to ensure and impose disarmament, peace and a new economic world order.\u201d\nFrom this rostrum I would like to reaffirm the unflinching resolve of the Socialist Republic of Romania to act along with the rest of the international community, within the framework of the United Nations, for peace, co-operation, disarmament and security in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI bring greetings from the Government and people of my country. My delegation joins. Sir, in the many expressions of esteem, felicitation, confidence and goodwill addressed to you as you assume the high office of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly, to which the world looks with high expectancy and fervent hope for abundant success.\nAdditionally, grateful appreciation is extended to your immediate predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, for his skilful and expeditious conduct of the historic forty-second session of the General Assembly.\nMy delegation wishes to place on record its pride in and gratitude for the outstanding contribution that the Secretary-General is making to the international community through his sound, skilful, judicious, committed and unobtrusive leadership.\nIt is no accident that in many areas of the world peace appears to be springing forth. This can be attributed to the realization that there is nothing to be gained by the indefinite prolongation of conflicts within and among nations. On the contrary, so much is lost in terms of human lives and scarce resources that if conflicts are allowed to continue indefinitely, there can be neither winners nor losers in the end. \nThe wind of change that is blowing in the direction of peace in the international community provides a favourable climate for its enhancement. The Secretary-General, a tireless disciple of peace, in his report on the work of the organization, dated 14 September 1988, said of the United Nations \\\"the small boat in which all the people of the Earth were gathered seemed to have caught a light but favourable wind.\\\" (A/43/1, p. 2). Continuing that nautical metaphor, permit me to quote the words of the immortal William Shakespeare: \\\"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; emitted, all of the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries.\\\" (Julius Caesar, IV: ill) The pieces of peace - if I may be permitted this clumsy pun - that are breaking out in certain regions of the world, afford the international community, whose prestige is on the rise, the opportunity to sail with the flood tide in the pursuit of peace.\nGrenada reaffirms its unswerving commitment to the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Commonwealth, the Caribbean community and all other regional or international organisations which assist us in achieving our foreign policy objectives, the centrepiece of which is peace.\nMy delegation notes with profound satisfaction the new detente and rapprochement between the super-Powers, whose relationship has for so long been a cause of concern in the international community. We hope that the improvement in relations will continue and serve to reduce tensions around the world. We take this opportunity to congratulate President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev on their contributions, and to urge them to continue their dialogue so that the process now begun may lead to a significant and internationally acceptable level of arms reduction, both nuclear and conventional - the kind of contribution to international peace and security that the world so desperately needs.\nAgainst this background, the international community notes with pleasure the strides made in the past months to secure peaceful solutions to seemingly intractable situations in certain regions of the world.\nIn Afghanistan, the Geneva Accords, negotiated under the auspices of the Secretary-General and guaranteed by the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, afford the region the first real opportunity for the peaceful resolution of the conflict, which can provide the basis for self-determination by the Afghan people.\nThe cease-fire, on 20 August, in the long and costly Iran-Iraq war, followed by face-to-face talks five days later in Geneva between high level representatives of the two countries, with the Secretary-General as mediator, gave hope to the world that at long last a long and costly conflict would finally come to an end. I wish; however, to remind the Assembly of the continuing plight of the members of the Bahai faith in Iran. They continue to suffer persecution and death because of their religious belief. The continuance of that problem will always be a hindrance to the attainment of peace and stability in that country, and I again call upon this body to take such steps as would cause the Iranian Government to grant to the Bahais their God-given right to the sacred freedom to worship God in their own way.\nThe quadripartite discussions taking place among Angola, Cuba and South Africa, with the United States as mediator, offer some hope that with goodwill, good judgement and, whenever possible, resort to non-confrontational and non-adversarial positions, the independence of Namibia may be possible without further bloodshed or delay.\nIn the interval between the last session of the General Assembly and the present, the situations in Cyprus, Kampuchea and Western Sahara have shown encouraging signs of peaceful resolution through political and diplomatic negotiations. There remain, however, other regional problems of concern to the international community. In the Middle East the festering relationship between Israel and the Palestinians has been further exacerbated by recent events on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. It is the hope of my delegation that those who preside over the destiny of nations, espousing first as individuals peace in their own hearts, will be capable of devising a formula that will be acceptable to all parties, that is to say a formula that satisfies the quest of the Palestinians for a homeland and protects their right to self-determination and recognizes the existence of Israel as a sovereign, independent State and also its right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries.\nThe situation in Central America, where it was hoped that the signing of the Guatemala Procedure in August 1987 by the five Central American Presidents would quickly bear fruit, remains a matter of cautious optimism.\nNevertheless my delegation views with a tremendous measure of satisfaction the efforts of the people of the region collectively to assess and define their security needs and to minimize the threat to the peace and stability of the area. We laud the leaders of the region for their initiatives to resolve their problems within the framework of consultation, co-ordination, co-operation and joint endeavour.\nThe fate of the Korean peninsula - basically one family, now divided into two parts as a result of the Second World War - is a perfect example of the futility, Idiocy and tragedy of war. This dichotomous arrangement has resulted in prolonged human suffering of the roost heart-rending kind, where families related by affinity, consanguinity and spiritual relationship have been torn apart with only occasional opportunity to visit one another.\nMy delegation spoke in the general debate last year. We expressed the view that, through the universal medium of sports and through the universal language of music, the world stood the best chance of attaining the universal goal of brotherhood. My delegation is still of that opinion. This reference was made in connection with the XXIV Olympiad recently completed in Seoul. We extend heartfelt congratulations to the Government and people of the Republic of Korea for successfully hosting the twenty-fourth Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, substantially free from politically motivated boycotts and tragedies.\nMoreover, it is the prayer and hope of my delegation that the inclusion of the item entitled, \\\"Promotion of peace, reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula\\\", in the Assembly's agenda at this session will be debated constructively, rationally and in the spirit of conciliation, to the end that a satisfactory resolution of the Korean dichotomy might appear on the horizon. In the case of the Korean peninsula, as in the case of so many areas of conflict, we need to explore the many hidden similarities in our apparent diversity. Let us concentrate on our collective strength rather than on our individual frailty.\nIn view of the recent successes of the United Nations in mediating disputes in the international community, the time has come for us to consider seriously whether or not the objective of attaining national reunification between North and South Korea through dialogue and negotiation would be realized if both countries were granted full membership of the United Nations. We have a moral obligation to attempt to ensure that peace, stability and reconciliation do not continue to elude the people of the Korean peninsula. I therefore wish to propose that this question of membership be given immediate consideration so that the over 70 million people of the peninsula could be accorded their right to representation among the membership of this Organization.\nI crave the indulgence of delegations to speak a few words with respect to my country, Grenada, five years after it was rudely and abruptly thrust upon the national and international some following the execution of the Prime Minister and a number of innocent citizens as a result of a vicious intra-party struggle for power. This dramatic and cataclysmic episode took place on 25 October 1983. After law and order were restored, an interim administration was created. Its main term of reference was to create the climate and prepare the country for general elections and the return to pluralistic, participatory, parliamentary democracy, which Grenada had always enjoyed except in the period 1979 to 1983, when ideological bigots came into power, having overthrown the elected government by force. In the general elections one year later, in December 1984, the people of Grenada elected my party by an overwhelming majority. I am happy to report to this fraternal forum of the United Nations that today Grenada is at peace and that human rights and individual freedoms are scrupulously guaranteed.\nA few cardinal principles inform and constitute the basis of our conduct within the global family, that is, equality, respect for the sovereignty and independence of States and for their right freely to choose their social and economic systems. Grenada does not subscribe to reproach and recrimination in pursuit of its international relations.\nMy delegation wishes to refute as utter nonsense the propaganda of a few disgruntled members of this fraternal forum to the effect that there are still foreign forces in my country. The few countries which persist in this course of conduct have neither a democratic experience nor a democratic culture. I am pleased to report that the ballot-box replaced the gun as the ultimate instrument of political discourse in Grenada and to state boldly, categorically and without fear of challenge that there are no foreign troops in my country and that this has been so since 1985.\nGrenada shares the concerns and suffers the consequences of the vulnerability of island developing countries, in particular, and of developing countries, in general. With regard to the question of the specificity of the problems of island developing countries, the destruction recently visited upon Jamaica by Hurricane Gilbert also brings into sharp focus the vulnerability of islands to natural disasters.\nIt is to be hoped that in devising a strategy of emergency assistance to Jamaica the international community would bear in mind the fragility of island economies. Moreover, under agenda item 82 (b), the General Assembly is being called upon to countenance a series of measures that could alleviate the problems experienced by this specific category of developing countries.\nMy delegation issues a call to United Nations agencies and individual nations to respond more favourably to our valid appeals for special consideration.\nThe General Assembly should also be cognizant of the threat to the ecosystem of island developing countries posed by coastal pollution resulting from the dumping of wastes at sea. Indeed, the recent unpleasant experiences of marine pollution in several parts of the world have highlighted the deleterious effects of resorting to the ocean as a giant dumping-ground. Thus, over and above the concerns being addressed under agenda item 64 (k), it is imperative that a programme of action against all types of dumping of harmful wastes at sea - be they nuclear, industrial or medical - be devised, thereby saving future generations from potential environmental suicide.\nIn the matter, of the effective functioning of the United Nations my delegation would like to register its concerns regarding the financial situation of the Organization. The fact that there are in essence two agenda items which address the issue, items 50 and 116, is indicative of the paramount importance of the question. It is to be hoped that any revision of the scale of assessments will adhere to the principle of \\\"equitable apportionment\\\" and will respect the capacity of Member States to pay. There should not be the anomaly of developed countries benefiting from a reduction in their scale of assessed contributions, while certain debt-distressed developing countries are burdened with an upward revision of their financial obligations to the Organization.\nThe external debt problem with its adverse global economic consequences, especially in the developing countries, is a perfect example of how international peace and security can be threatened by a situation which can have dire social, political and economic consequences,. Debt repayment and debt-servicing pose a hardship for, and stranglehold on, the economies of many developing countries, akin to a millstone around their necks. While the repayment of debt is a legal and moral responsibility of the debtor, debt relief should be a humane and moral consideration of some of the creditors, who, in the context of the present global situation, may be practising simple justice, by putting back into the good earth a little of what has been taken out. History is replete with examples of how exploitation and injustice could have contributed to the debt problem. \nTo the least developing countries, whose social and humanitarian programmes are held in abeyance because of debt repayment and debt-servicing, the cynicism mingled with humour of a socio-economist can be applied, namely that the inherent vice in some economic systems is the unequal sharing of blessings, while the inherent virtue in others is the equal sharing of miseries. In the final analysis, if the external debt problem is allowed to remain unsolved and unmitigated the economies of both developed and developing countries stand to suffer.\nAn area of global interest and common concern is the illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which, like the plague, is spreading over the face of the earth and gnawing at the very fabric of society. Concomitant with the craze for these dangerous substances is the proportionate increase in the level of violence which is fast becoming a seamy sub-culture in some societies. It is generally believed that drugs and international terrorism have a direct relationship. This twin menace is growing bolder every day and wreaking havoc on innocent and unsuspecting people. We favour a multidimensional approach to the tackling of this awesome problem involving the agencies of education, health and law enforcement in the three crucial areas of the production, trafficking and consumption of drugs.\t'\nAnother area of global concern is the rapid spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which, like a scourge, is approaching pandemic proportions. In this regard the United Nations prestigious world Health Organization (WHO) should continue to focus on the aetiology, prognosis and therapy for this health hazard, which has dangerous social consequences.\nThe odious and pernicious practice of racial hatred, apartheid, in South Africa remains the greatest impediment not only to peace in southern Africa but to world peace generally. This institutionalized and systematized phenomenon of racism attempts to place a stranglehold on democratic advancement in southern Africa and continues to deprive the black man of his rights to freedom and self-determination.\nIf our response is to apply pressure on the South African Government to dismantle the apartheid system, then towards that objective ray delegation favours the employment of collective, comprehensive, mandatory sanctions against South Africa, we are not persuaded by the arguments advanced by a few influential actors in the international community that sanctions will adversely affect the black majority in South Africa. We observe with interest that the imposition of sanctions is a potent and attractive option which is applied selectively as a punitive measure or as one designed or calculated to draw concessions. In any event, it is folly and presumptuous on the part of other countries to attempt to speak on behalf of the black majority of South Africa. Rather, their concerns should be reflected in concerted appeals to the authorities in South Africa to initiate negotiations with the legitimate leaders of the people.\nIf it is determined that a spokesman is required, then pressure should be directed at the South African Government to release  unconditionally, the most articulate and authoritative spokesman of the black cause. Nelson Mandela. This drum major for justice in South Africa has been imprisoned unjustifiably for 26 years. We call upon the Government of South Africa to free him now so that he may be able to participate effectively in shaping the destiny of his country and his people.\nWe call on South Africa to suspend armed intervention in the front-line States and to respect their sovereignty and territorial integrity. Tremendous progress towards a peaceful and amicable resolution of the regional conflict could be achieved with the speedy implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978) for the independence of Namibia which, in my delegation's view, constitutes the only real basis for the attainment of this objective. \nFinally, the curtain has risen on the forty-third session of the General Assembly under favourable auspices. The contours of peace are beginning to appear in many regions, the erstwhile battlegrounds of ideological conflicts and actual war. Just as we know in the physical sciences that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction which can be measured quantitatively, so too, to a limited extent, we can extend the same idea to the social sciences in which peace is central, by applying a qualitative measurement of the promising peaceful events taking place in many regions of the world. The centrifugal forces of discord and disquietude are beginning to yield to centripetal forces of peace and concordance within nations and among nations. \nThe Washington and Moscow summit meetings between President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, with verification provisions, are factors which we hope will contribute further to long-term global peace. My delegation wants to believe, however, that the triad of disarmament, development and solidarity, which have a syllogistic relationship, affords humankind the best hope of attaining the universal goal of peace and brotherhood for which the world has been waiting so patiently and so long.\nMay God bless us and guide us as we continue our deliberations in pursuit of these lofty aims.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI ask the President to accept our congratulations on his election and elevation to his most illustrious and profoundly important position. We are not unaware of his formidable credentials, and I am as confident as we all are that this session will be as fruitful as any.\nAfter several years of being shunted into the shadows, of having its moral authority undermined, and consequently driven into decline, the United Nations is again on the ascendancy, though still threatened by the ultimate modern Damoclean sword of financial strangulation. Once again, the phoenix rises from the ashes, as it rose some 43 years ago from the burning heat and debris of conventional and nuclear conflagration, man's greatest folly.\nFour and a half decades ago we fought the war to end all wars. But the result left us angry and bitter, locked in a new cold war and frightened, because the result of that war was the birth of a new weapons system that in itself had the power to end all wars. But to end all wars - indeed to end it all - we should have to use the new weapons system, whose use would end everything, would end us all. But the solution had itself created a new problem. So we created the United Nations to do for us what we could not do for ourselves: stop the ridiculous carnage.\nBut the Organization quickly got in the way of ambitious men, men of power> so we sidestepped it, emasculated it, asked it not to interfere, and turned to it only when convenient to seek maximum propaganda value for our cause. We thus created a vast dichotomy between what we say within the Organization and what we do without. That is a fact.\nThirty years ago, while still standing in the rubble of the Second World War, we joined, with alacrity, in adopting a General Assembly resolution calling for general and complete disarmament and charged this Organization to oversee it. Yet, since that time we have more than quadrupled our military expenditure in real terms to over $1 trillion a year, all the time adopting more resolutions, now almost 1,000, calling for serious measures towards disarmament. That is also a fact.\nThe paramount raison d'\u00eatre of the United Nations really must be that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. We all share this view. Nevertheless, we have stockpiled over 13,000 megatons of them, just in case. And since a nuclear war cannot be won, those whose ambition it is to win wars roust fight conventional ones, and so we have had more than 150 in the last 40 years, killing more people than those that died in the last great war. That is yet another fact.\nUpon the Organization we piled indignity upon indignity, and allowed it to become nothing more than our best excuse. When we looked into the mirror of the United Nations we saw not ourselves, but a giant piece of machinery, infused with energy to do work. So the United Nations should keep the peace, we said; and our citizens believed it. \nIt is no wonder that they began to lose hope not in their Government, but in the United Nations ~ faith misguided. I am proud to say that Saint Lucia was not among those who had lost hope, and we will never lose hope in the importance, effectiveness, or continued viability of this Organization.\nFrom the initial use of the term \\\"United Nations\\\" by the American President Franklin Roosevelt, through the San Francisco Charter, to the official dawn of this Organization on 24 October 1945, the United Nations as an organization has been locked in a battle for supremacy of will over the always parochial, often bellicose, actions and intentions of nation States. We are often reminded by our Secretary-General that the United Nations is not a supranational authority. It cannot, without the combined will of all the members of the Security Council, impose its own will upon its Members. It is an Organization made up of independent and sovereign nations. But the Organization has no sovereignty of its own, so it can only initiate, harmonize and encourage its Members to take effective actions which are in keeping with the spirit of the Charter.\nIn many respects, then, this remarkable Organization, despite the machinations of Member States, has proven to be exceedingly resourceful in meeting the challenges that daily confront it. So, once again, exhausted by the international tribulations of our own creation, we turn to it in a desperate search for respite.\nWe have always looked to the Organization in the social and economic spheres, but now it seems that we have returned to it in attempting to solve our political problems. For the past eight years Saint Lucia has been among those countries that have called for the preservation of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and non-aligned character of Afghanistan. We have also repeatedly reaffirmed the right of the Afghan people to determine their own form of and to choose their economic, political and social system free from outside intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever. We also called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, and urged all parties concerned to work for the urgent achievement of a political solution in accordance with the spirit of the Charter, and the creation of the necessary conditions that would enable the Afghan refugees to return voluntarily to their homes in safety and honour.\nThanks to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General, and his representative, Mr. Diego Cordovez, we witnessed the conclusion of the Geneva Accords last April as a major point of departure in the long effort to find a peaceful solution to the situation in Afghanistan. We therefore urge all parties to live up to the letter and spirit of the Geneva Accords so that we may soon realize the outcome which we all desire.\nThe fratricidal eight-year-long armed conflict between Iraq and Iran has been among the bloodiest in this century. From the start of the war in 1980, the United Nations has been active through various channels in trying to get the parties to compose their differences. Saint Lucia is gratified by the cease-fire that was finally secured on 20 August this year. We urge both parties to bring the necessary political will and flexibility to the table to assure the effectuation of a just and lasting peace in the region.\nThe question of Cyprus, too, has for long been a troubling one. We have dealt with this question, in one aspect or another, for the past 25 years. The decision by the leaders of the two sides, upon an initiative of the Secretary-General, to meet without any pre-conditions and to attempt to achieve by 1 June 1989 a negotiated settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus problem is particularly welcome at this time. \nAlso in South-East Asia there has been positive movement. Nine years ago, the General Assembly called upon all States to refrain from any interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea and resolved that the people of Kampuchea should be enabled to choose democratically their own government without outside interference, subversion or coercion. Saint Lucia has actively supported this principle every year since then. We are therefore heartened that, encouraged by indications that all parties concerned are now interested in achieving a political solution to the problem, the Secretary-General has presented to the parties a number of specific ideas intended to facilitate the elaboration of a framework for a comprehensive political settlement. We urge them to consider those ideas seriously.\nSince 1946 we have dealt with the question of Namibia at 42 successive sessions, at three special sessions, and at one emergency special session of the General Assembly. We have repeatedly demanded that the apartheid regime of South Africa immediately and unconditionally withdraw its illegal administration, occupation army and police force from Namibia, but the racist regime has persisted in its refusal to comply with the resolutions and decisions of the Security Council, thus violating the principles of the Charter and defying the authority of the United Nations.\nAfter more than four decades of intransigence on the part of South Africa, there are now some signs of movement in the right direction. Saint Lucia fervently hopes that the Brazzaville agreements will be successful.\nThe South African regime has thumbed its nose at the international community for so long. We hope, however, that these first steps in the right direction ate merely the beginning of a journey which will lead soon to the release of Nelson Mandela and the dismantling of the heinous apartheid system.\nSaint Lucia is encouraged by the atmosphere of conciliation which seems to surround the peace plan of the Secretary-General and the head of the Organization of African Unity that was submitted to the concerned parties in Western Sahara. We hope that this spirit of conciliation will lead to a speedy, just and lasting negotiated solution to this problem. \nThe situation in the Middle East remains our most intractable problem. Saint Lucia wishes to reiterate its view that the question of Palestine is at the core of the conflict in the Middle East and that no comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region can be achieved without the full exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable national rights and the immediate withdrawal of Israel to internationally recognized and secure boundaries.\nIn the Korean peninsula, the problem of a divided Korea is also still with us, and Saint Lucia looks forward to the peaceful reunification of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Saint Lucia therefore welcomes the continuation of dialogue among all parties concerned with a view to achieving this objective, and we believe that, in the interim, membership of the United Nations for both Koreas will not hinder the attainment of that goal.\nSaint Lucia is concerned that there seems to be a reduction in momentum of the Esquipulas II agreement of the five Central American Presidents signed on 7 August last year. We continue to support a peaceful, negotiated solution to the conflicts in Central America.\nIn the Caribbean itself, we have been concerned at the developments that have occurred in our sister country of Haiti. Over the past year, Saint Lucia has repeatedly called for a return to the democratic process, for selection by election, and not by dictation, for the fulfilment of the provisions of the new Haitian Constitution, and for the creation of an opportunity for the re-flowering and rebirth of the spirit of a people whose forefathers pioneered the path to freedom in this hemisphere. It is not too late. We urge the new leaders in Haiti to seize the time to launch their country firmly on the path of democratic process, as so many other dictatorships in the hemisphere have recently done. Those who first lit the revolutionary torch so many decades ago should not now be lagging behind in the wake of change. The region awaits a new and democratic Haiti. The people of Haiti desire it. The moment is in their hands.\nWe approach the end of the third United Nations Development Decade with many of the developing countries poorer now than they were 10 years ago. International political gains cannot be sustained without concomitant international economic development. With decreasing per capita gross national product in many countries, deteriorating terms of trade in others, and still others staggering under Tolstoyan debt burdens, the developing countries face an uncertain future. These problems are compounded by an alarmingly high level of net transfers of resources from the developing to the developed countries, and a sharp fall in resource flows to the developing countries. In Latin America and the Caribbean, chronic poverty still plagues more than 130 million people, or over one third of the aggregate population. And the debt burden hovers at $400 billion.\nWe need to deal with these problems quickly and effectively. My delegation therefore strongly supports both the convening of an international conference on money and finance for development, with universal participation, and the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the reactivation of economic growth in the developing countries.\nWe are all in sympathy with the peoples of Jamaica and Mexico who suffered so terribly from the devastation of hurricane Gilbert. We in Saint Lucia consider ourselves fortunate by comparison, having escaped with only a few million dollars' worth of damage, caused by flooding and landslides. We urge the international community to support the resolution on emergency assistance to Jamaica to be introduced later this year. \nIn the past 20 years, natural disasters have claimed the lives of over 3 million people and caused more than 323 billion in damage. We in the small island developing countries are particularly prone since natural disasters show a marked concentration in tropical and sub-tropical climates. Hurricanes, tropical cyclones and typhoons are essentially a feature of warm oceans and coastal regions. Over larger land masses and temperate seas their violence decreases rapidly.\nIn this century alone, in my own sub-region, hurricanes have struck Barbados, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and my own country. Many of these Islands have been hit several times. Volcanic eruptions have devastated Guadeloupe, Martinique and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Earthquakes have caused damage in Antigua and Barbuda, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Puerto Rico.\nThe effects of any disaster are more pronounced for a small island than for a larger country with a wide variety of products, back-up facilities and resources for recovery. We therefore eagerly lend our support to the adoption of General Assembly resolution 42/169. Last year, the 1990s were designated as the international decade for natural disaster reduction, a decade in which the international community, under the auspices of the United Nations, will pay special attention to fostering international co-operation in the field of natural disaster reduction. We commend the Secretary-General for his efficiency in establishing an international ad hoc experts group for the international decade.\nBut, as if natural disasters such as Hurricane Gilbert were not enough trouble for the island developing countries of the Caribbean, we in this region are being threatened with man-made catastrophes, potentially more devastating. Over the past year, Caribbean countries have been alarmed at reports that a number of companies, particularly in the United States, were making arrangements to dump tons of hazardous industrial and nuclear waste in the Caribbean. In fact, in one recent particularly callous incident, a ship dumped such waste on a beach in Haiti after Haitian authorities had denied it permission to enter its territory. A few months later, the Caribbean was placed on the alert for another such ship which seemed headed for our waters with another shipment of that horrible cargo.\nThe dangers of toxic waste for the Caribbean are enormous, even more so than for those countries of affluence which refuse to accept their own industrial effluence. Given the porous nature of the soils in the tropical Caribbean, the toxins contained in the waste can spread rapidly through the food chain. The threat therefore is not merely to our tourism industry from the damage to our beadles, but to life itself - to marine life, the environment, to human life. In the small islands of the Caribbean, life as we know it can therefore easily disappear.\nWe call upon those countries whose companies are engaged in this nefarious activity to take action to halt this trend. We are particularly concerned where secret deals and arrangements are worked out between some companies and Government officials, where waste is shipped under false labels, and we urge our sister Caribbean countries to be vigilant In this regard and to preserve the integrity and purity of our environment. We are encouraged that the United Nations In the spirit of General Assembly resolution 42/183 (1987) which condemned waste trafficking, is attempting to regulate the trade, and we hope that the international community will adopt the proposed global Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of hazardous waste when it becomes ready for signature in 1989. \nIn general, as we approach a thirteenth-year review, as it were, of the special needs of island developing States, we are pleased that there is a growing recognition of the special problems and needs of island developing countries as reflected in the resolutions passed unanimously in the General Assembly over the past decade on island developing countries, and in the Declaration of the twelfth Annual Meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of Seventy-Seven.\nSince the early 1970s the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has contributed to a better understanding of island developing countries and has been a determining factor in assisting the international community to recognize their specific problems. Numerous analytical and descriptive studies have shown that small island developing countries have characteristics distinct from those of developing countries in general. As a result, the type of development strategy regarded as appropriate in general is, in many respects, inappropriate for those countries in particular.\nAs we undertake the long-overdue review of the question of island developing countries this year, my delegation hopes that we can move from the stage of the purely academic to one of putting in place specific mechanisms to assist those countries in particular and effective ways.\nWe now have, so to speak, a second chance to make this Organization what it was supposed to be, In 1969, U Thant, then Secretary-General, warned us that we had little time left in which to subordinate our ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race, to improve the human environment, to defuse the population explosion and to give the required momentum to development efforts. And, to be sure, it is a truism, as laid down in the principles of the Inter-Allied Declaration of 12 June 1941 that: \\\"The only true basis of enduring peace is the willing co-operation of free peoples in a world in which, relieved of the menace of aggression, all may enjoy economic and social security. It is up to us.\\\"\n\u0386 second dawn has broken and a new opportunity arisen to take a truly global approach to solving hat, in the final analysis, are all global problems. Let us not waste this second chance.   \n\n"

We ask him to convey friendly and brotherly greetings to Argentina from the Government and people of Benin r which is happy to see the representative of a country with which it shares the sane aspirations to peace and social justice preside over the General Assembly of our irreplaceable world Organization. \nI should like to take this opportunity to convey the heartfelt congratulations of our delegation to Mr. Peter Florin, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, who, throughout the work of the forty-second session of the General Assembly, showed such competence wisdom and statesmanship.\nOur congratulations also go to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I should like once again, on this solemn occasion, to say how much the people and the National Executive Council of Benin admire him for the dynamism, patience, tenacity and competence, with which he has served the United Nations, and in particular for the professionalism - each day more decisive - that he has shown in finding solutions to the various crises that our world has been witnessing. On behalf of Benin, we wish to extend to him our full support in the discharge of his onerous and delicate responsibilities.\nThe award this year of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations Peace-keeping Forces is a well-deserved tribute to the work of the Organization and the Secretary-General. This great honour conferred upon our Organization has created a new climate of optimism and confidence in the search for ways and means that might lead to peace.\nThe forty-third session of the General Assembly has opened in an atmosphere of d\u00e9tente and hope, indicating that international peace and security, which our Organization has been striving to attain, should be understood as a pre-condition for promoting development in all fields and for ensuring the right of peoples to life, freedom and dignity.\nWhen they adopted the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, in 1945, or when they acceded to them later the States represented here showed their determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to promote social progress and better standards of life in fuller freedom. We thus proclaimed our faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity of the human person, in the equal .rights of men and women and of nations large or small.\nThree years ago we commemorated here, and in our country, the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter in a political climate that was marked by many areas of tension and by the mad rivalry between the nuclear Powers.\nThis year we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in an environment marked by glimmers of hope, thanks to the determination of the two nuclear super-Powers to reduce and gradually eliminate nuclear weapons, which are a real threat to international peace and security. It is therefore ray honour and pleasure to state before the Assembly that may government is preparing to implement, within the context of the celebration of this fortieth anniversary, a diversified programme of events, ranging from a national seminar on human rights, which will follow :p the international seminar on human rights and economic and social progress hosted by my country in May-June of 1988, to a number of cultural and sporting, events in all parts of our country, information meetings about this Declaration, and its publication in French and in most of the national languages of our country.\nBy signing the agreements to dismantle nuclear weapons, both medium-range and shorter-range, the USSR and the United states of America established a basis for a real nuclear disarmament process and detente. On behalf of my country, I salute the initiatives taken by the President of the United States of America and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and I wish the leaders of those two countries ever greater success in following up their negotiations with a view to the gradual reduction of strategic weapons until they are completely eliminated. \nThe peoples of the whole world want peace. They want all other nuclear Powers to follow the example of the United States and the Soviet Union, to stave off, once and for all, the risk of a nuclear war, which would be the last one.\nConsensus with regard to the means of achieving nuclear disarmament seems to be emerging. Out the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament showed what a long way we have yet to go to establish the basis of general and complete disarmament. We must therefore reverse intransigence, national selfishness, differences and ideological barriers, in order to promote the primacy of the United Nations in disarmament.\nWe must recognise that there is a logical link between disarmament and development, almost a mathematical ratio between them, as the special session of our Organisation, held from 24 April to 11 September 198?, established so eloquently.\nSo we have grounds for hope. Remarkable progress has been made in settling various regional conflicts, all of which are deadly and run counter to our aspirations for peace and progress. There is no doubt that the path leading to peace is long and difficult, but there is no alternative to peace except peace itself, Accordingly, it is good that, instead of confrontation the enemies of yesterday have today chosen the way of dialogue and negotiation, like in the Persian Gulf, the Middle East, Western Sahara, southern Africa, Central America, Afghanistan or Kampuchea.\nZn Africa the apartheid system of the Pretoria regime, which our universal conscience condemns vociferously and which no country or Government could justify or legitimise, is at the very core of the tragedy suffered by the blade peoples of Southern Africa\u00b7 The racist regime continues, despite common sense and reason to divide the international community in its quest for peace, security and social progress. \nThe policy of apartheid of the South African regime is still very much a crime against humanity and an affront to the universal conscience. The assassination of September, in Paris on 29 March 1988, shows that the leaders of that country will stop at nothing even at the most heinous crimes.\nPretoria is being obstinate, despite the protests of the whole world, in insisting on keeping Nelson Mandela in its gaols, thus seriously damaging his health. It continues to impose a state of emergency on black South Africans in order to further suppress their legitimate aspirations to dignity and well-being.\nIn its solidarity and unswerving support for the struggle of the African National Congress all other democratic anti-apartheid forces, my country appeals to the reason and common sense of all States Members of the United Nations to see to it that at this forty-third session the General Assembly will once again demand the imposition of comprehensive, mandatory sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nIt is our collective responsibility - and one we must shoulder - to work to restore all the inalienable rights of the South African people and the independence of Namibia, and to guarantee to the front-line countries the enjoyment of security, stability and territorial integrity. The front-line countries, the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the ANC, and all other democratic forces defending their inalienable rights in southern Africa can be assured of the solidarity and support of the entire people of Benin until their cause triumphs - the cause of justice and freedom for which they have been shedding their blood.\nWe hope that the dialogue that is now going on and that is developing in the negotiations between Angola, South Africa, Cuba and the United States, will result in a just peace in that part of Africa which has been ravaged by so many years of armed conflicts. In the Western Sahara, the People's Republic of Benin is pleased that the two parties to the conflict r Morocco and the POLIS ARIO Front, have finally chosen the path of dialogue in accepting the peace plan of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, relating to conditions for the organization of a referendum on self-determination for the Sahraoui people. However, on this question, as on so many others, the international community must remain vigilant in order to avoid bitter disappointment.\nWe are pleased that relations between Chad and Libya have been improving. The return to peace between these two fraternal countries will enable the Chadian people to start the work of national reconstruction and economic recovery for the greater well-being of all Chadians.\nLike other peoples, the Palestinian people is entitled to an independent homeland. Hence a stop must be put to its suffering by way of the restoration of all its national rights in a Middle East that is reconciled and at peace.\nThe Palestinian question is one to which my country hopes the General Assembly will attach special importance this year, especially since we shall be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hence Benin looks forward to the convening as soon as possible of the international conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, and with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (\u0420LO), on an equal footing.\nIn the Persian Gulf, reason and dialogue have finally replaced the language of violence in a war that foe eight years has ravaged that part of the third would.  We welcome the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and hope that the Secretary-General's tireless efforts will be successful, so that the people of that region can finally enjoy peace. \nIn Afghanistan, we hope that the normalization process will continue on course, thanks to the full implementation of the Geneva Accords by all parties concerned. This will permit the reconciliation of all the country's people, foe it is high time to end the suffering and the dispersal of men, women and children in refugee camps.\nThe trend in international relations is towards dialogue and the peaceful settlement of disputes, and the talks that have been started by the political forces in Kampuchea must also lead to the establishment of a democratic, political and administrative system in keeping with the interests of a free Kampuchean people on a territory free from any hint of a return to the notorious past, as well as the return of any foreign troops.\nThe withdrawal of foreign troops from the Korean peninsula is a guarantee for the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas. The international community should work to ensure that this divided people can recover its unity and greatness.\nIn Central America, the peoples and the States of that region have the right to live in peace, harmony and mutual respect, free from interference or foreign intervention, and, above all, with each respecting the political, economic and social choices of the others. In this context, the hopes raised by the Arias plan and the Esquipulas agreements should be supported, as well as the efforts of the Contadora Group to establish lasting peace in the region.\nIn contrast to the relief brought about by the positive developments we have seen in various war-torn parts of the world, the rather grim picture of the international economic situation is, to say the least, distressing. Indeed, the international economic climate is now characterized - particularly with regard to the developing countries and mere specifically, the African countries - by increasing protectionism by the industrialized countries, a sharp drop in commodity prices, and the inverse transfer of financial flows. The combined cumulative effects of these trends have seriously affected development prospects for our countries and have made any efforts at economic recovery highly unpredictable.\nWars and prolonged tension have disorganized the economic and social life of many countries to such an extent that no security can be guaranteed for any length of time. In many regions of Africa and elsewhere food production has fallen below survival needs, thus bringing about a situation of permanent hunger and, in some cases, famine of catastrophic proportions in the warring countries.\nNatural disasters of incalculable consequences have often added to these scourges. Following the recent torrential rains experienced in the People's Republic of Benin, entire regions were flooded, causing considerable material damage and seriously disrupting the lives of many people. Out of the six provinces in Benin, four were particularly badly hit and declared emergency areas by the Government. Given the magnitude of the disaster, the major national effort we have made - despite my country  difficult economic situation - will not be enough to put an end to the tragedy of the people concerned. Therefore, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Benin made an urgent appeal for international solidarity in providing emergency assistance to the affected peoples and towns.\nOn behalf of my country I should like to seize this opportunity to thank all friendly countries and governmental and nongovernmental organizations which, in a burst of solidarity, have started to provide valuable assistance to the victims of this disaster.\nIn the circumstances to which 1 hove just referred, the determination of the developing countries to implement meaningful and economic social reforms is coming up against exogenous constraints connected with the hostile international and economic climate. In order to deal with this situation, a large number of countries have established special recovery measures through structural adjustment programme which do not often lead to any significant improvement in the lives of their peoples \nWith regard more specifically to the critical economic situation in Africa, it is appropriate to point out that two years after the adoption by our Organisation of a Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 the economic and social situation of all African countries continues to deteriorate. It must be said that the international community has not kept the pledge it made at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to Africa to provide sufficient resources to back up and supplement Africa's development efforts. The aid-terms review of the Programme our Organization has just carried out should prompt Africa's partners to increase their efforts to enable us to achieve our goals.\nThe rich countries must be seriously concerned about the external economic factors that have so obviously compounded Africa's present difficulties. In this connection, genuine auspices to relieve the enormous debt burden of sub-Saharan Africa and to increase the flow of resources to the region should be encouraged.\nIn spite of everything, we still hope that the present d\u00e9tente in relations between the two Powers and the rebirth of a climate of trust within the international community - because of the various ongoing peace initiatives on many war-fronts - can be considered as a prelude to a new era of co-operation and dialogue among nations. It is our duty to work forcefully and with faith our total commitment to the values that identify and underpin the ideals of our Organisation as we \u00b7 celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is our duty to enhance these values to defend then whenever they could be violated, because in then lies the survival and grandeur of Mankind. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me pleasure to join those who have spoken before me in extending to Mr. Dante Caputo, on behalf of the Malawi delegation, heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. Preceding speakers have eloquently spoken of his long experience of international affairs, his deep commitment to the promotion of: international peace and co-operation and his great diplomatic skills. On our part, we have already observed the effective manner in which he has been conducting the business of the Assembly. Ws are therefore confident that under his leadership and guidance the Assembly's deliberations will come to a successful conclusion. I therefore wish to assure him of my delegation's full co-operation at all times.\nThe forty-second session was perhaps among the busiest sessions in recent years, as the Assembly had to be called back so many times in resumed session. The Assembly was also called upon to deal with many very complex issues, some necessitating late-night sessions of the plenary in search of solutions.\nFortunately for us, we had in Mr. Peter Florin, Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, a President whose outstanding fortitude, exemplary dedication to duty and inexhaustible patience, confidence and good humour made the work that was before the Assembly easier. My delegation extends its best wishes to Mr. Florin, and congratulates him on his successful accomplishment of his duties and responsibilities.\nThe Malawi delegation has pleasure also in expressing its best wishes to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. We have noted with much satisfaction the many achievements scored by the United Nations during the past 12 months. Among the most outstanding are the successful negotiations leading to the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan and to the cease-fire in the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran. Those achievements have clearly vindicated those who, despite the doubts expressed by some in recent years about the Organization's relevance to today's international political environment, continued to believe that the United Nations remained the most appropriate forum for the search for solutions to International disputes, and also that, given the opportunity, it could be a very effective instrument for resolving conflicts between States,\nMr. de Cuellar has never wavered in his belief in the efficacy of the United Nations, nor has he ever doubted the Organization's potential as an instrument for bringing about peace, we thus consider the award of this year's Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces to be a most fitting recognition of Mr. de Cuellar's personal efforts in keeping the United Nations at the centre of international affairs and a long overdue but welcome tribute to the outstanding contribution of the United Nations towards international peace during the past four decades. My delegation joins others in expressing to Mr. Perez de Cuellar and, through him, to the peace-keeping forces, well-deserved congratulations.\nA writer in one of the local newspapers observed this past summer that \\\"peace has broken out\\\". Although his comment was made rather cynically, in fact it aptly designated the extraordinary phenomenon of the past few months. Indeed, throughout the summer we marvelled as almost everywhere came news of breakthroughs in deadlocks long considered intractable. For once it did seem as though peace had, finally, been declared.\nWe in Malawi welcomed the news of the successful conclusion of the Geneva Agreements, under which it was finally possible for foreign troops that had been in Afghanistan for eight years to withdraw from that country. We hope that the withdrawal of those forces will be completed as agreed in the Agreements so that the people of Afghanistan may move on to the important process of determining their country's political future and embark on the urgent tasks of rehabilitation and reconstruction.\nIn the Persian Gulf we note that, following acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) by both Iran and Iraq earlier this summer, a cease-fire came into force on 20 August. We further note that negotiations towards a permanent peace agreement between the two former belligerents are continuing under the auspices of the United Nations. The road towards that goal will not be an easy one, but we believe that the parties concerned understand the high cost of failure.\nWhen the Malawi delegation addressed the Assembly last year, we noted with regret that the flurry of diplomatic activity earlier in 1987 centred on the question of Kampuchea appeared to have led to no change. My Government has therefore been encouraged by recent signs of the apparent beginnings of a genuine dialogue between the various parties concerned. We note, for instance, that following the meeting held in July, under the auspices of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), all the parties have indicated their readiness to continue the search for a mutually acceptable solution. Allow me to express my Government's full support for those efforts and its sincere hope for a positive outcome.\nIn the first direct political contact between the two countries in years, parliamentarians of North and South Korea met in August to discuss relations between the two sides of their divided motherland. My Government was pleased to learn that further talks could take place very soon. Malawi supports the decision by the two sides to keep their lines of communication open so as to facilitate the continuing search for a peaceful solution. We remain firmly convinced that through\nhonest dialogue between North and South Korea a viable solution can be achieved. Meanwhile, Malawi welcomes South Korea's call for the cessation of hostilities between North and South Korea. Malawi also welcomes the other proposals by the two sides for easing tension between them.\nMalawi has followed very closely the quadripartite negotiations involving representatives of the United States, South Africa, Angola and Cuba with the ultimate aim of bringing about the independence of Namibia, within the context of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). In this connection, my Government has been greatly encouraged to learn that, if everything goes well, implementation of the transitional process envisaged in resolution 43 5 (1978) could begin as early as next month, with independence elections coming by 1 June 1989.\nWhilst its optimism is tempered somewhat by the experience of the international community in having come to the well more than once before and drawing no water, my Government would like to look forward to Namibia's independence and to welcoming Namibia as a fully-fledged member of the international community. My Government therefore hopes to join other members in welcoming the new independent State of Namibia as a participant, in its full sovereign right, at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly next year.\nIn 1986, for the first time in nearly 40 years, and also last year, the Assembly was seized of the question of the dependent territory of New Caledonia, where the indigenous people and the administering Power were deadlocked over the question of the territory\u2019s political future. We now understand that the administering Power, having reviewed its policy on the Territory, has recently reached agreement with representatives of the indigenous people on a formula for a solution which envisages the early granting of independence to that Territory. My delegation welcomes these developments. We applaud the Government of France for its courage in not only conceding the right of the New Caledonian people to self-determination but also in acknowledging its obligations towards the realization of that right. Malawi looks forward to seeing Kew Caledonia take its rightful place as an independent and sovereign Member of the community of nations, we hope in the very near future.\nWe have followed closely the Secretary-General's continuing efforts to find viable formulas for solutions to the questions of Cyprus and Western Sahara.\nWith regard to Cyprus we have noted that the apparent emergence of a congenial atmosphere in relations between certain parties whose role would be most vital in assuring any solution has seemingly brought about a positive change in the attitudes of the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. In this connection we note that both parties have declared their readiness to co-operate with the Secretary-General in facilitating the resumption of the inter-communal talks and that formal talks have already been scheduled for early in 1909. My Government welcomes these developments, for Malawi remains convinced that only a formula arrived at by or through the participation of the Cypriot people themselves can produce a meaningful and permanent solution to that country\u2019s political problems.\nOn the question of Western Sahara, my delegation wishes to reiterate Malawi's support for the right of the people of that territory to self-determination, whether as an independent sovereign State of otherwise. We therefore support the Secretary-General's initiatives on this issue and are pleased to note that the proposals which he recently presented to both the Government of Morocco and the POLISARIO provide for a referendum to enable the Sahraoui people to indicate their preference as to whether they should be part of Morocco or have their own independent sovereign State.\nWe have noted particularly the similarity between the Secretary-General's proposals and the formula adopted en the same question by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) almost 10 years ago. The OAU formula has as a main principle the holding of a referendum supervised by the United Nations. My Government is therefore happy to learn that both the POLISARIO and Morocco have now accepted the Secretary-General's proposals and we hope that this clears the way for the early holding of a referendum OR Western Sahara.\nAt the forty-second session of the General Assembly, the Malawi delegation joined others in welcoming and expressing support for the peace plan for Central America initiated by the Costa Rican leader, President Oscar Arias, and agreed to by all the leaders in the region. Despite the promise held cut by the plan, it would now appear that some parties would have the plan abandoned, seemingly condemning it to the heap of so many other doomed initiatives. Notwithstanding the set-backs which may have been encountered in its implementation, we believe that the Arias plan still represents the best formula for achieving peace in that region. My delegation wishes therefore to express Malawi's support for those leaders who are continuing to seek ways of facilitating the implementation of the plan.\nPreceding delegations have already observed that if today we can speak of breakthroughs with regard to the various international problems that once seemed insoluble it is because of the positive interventions, direct and indirect, of the two super-Powers, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Significantly, it has been noted that these positive developments have occurred following the apparent improvement in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nWe have always been of the view that whenever the two super-Powers agree to co-operate they can contribute immensely to the common good of the entire international community. That is why \u0449 delegation wishes to take the opportunity to express the hope that the two super-Powers will find it equally possible to work together in the search for solutions to the other regional conflicts and areas of tension which continue to threaten international peace and security. The most urgent of these are the situations in South Africa and the Middle East.\nWhile developments on the Namibia question have provided the most positive news to come out of the southern African subregion in almost a decade, the news from South Africa is that of a rapidly deteriorating situation, the root cause of the problems of South Africa is apartheid, but we believe that neither the use of force by the South African authorities to maintain the policy of apartheid nor the resort to violence by the opponents of apartheid will resolve this problem. That is why the Malawi delegation would like to reiterate its call to all the parties to the conflict to enter upon a genuine national dialogue. We are convinced that even at this late hour it would still be possible to achieve a peaceful solution if only all the parties concerned would have the courage to place the wider long-term interests of their country above the short-term interests of their respective constituencies.\nContrary to expectations of a possible movement forward - raised by the overwhelming support declared during the past two years by the majority of the members of this Assembly - towards the holding of an international conference on the Middle East, the past 12 months have seen the situation in the area deteriorate to perhaps its most precarious level in many years.\nA sharp escalation of violence in the occupied territories, resulting from a campaign of resistance to Israeli authority, and the Increased use of force in order to reaffirm that authority on the part of the Israeli Government have led to great loss of life as well as a deepening of animosity and suspicion. Meanwhile the decision by the Government of Jordan to withdraw its authority over parts of the occupied territories which It had previously administered has increased the uncertainty and anxiety about future developments.\nIn our view, any solution to the Middle East conflict must necessarily focus on two central issues if it is to be viable, fulfilment of the right of the Palestinian people to an independent homeland on the one hand and a guarantee of the right of the Israelis to live within recognized and secure boundaries on the other. Those elements have been of primary importance in all the main resolutions on the Middle East question since the General Assembly adopted resolution 181 (II) in 1947.\nViable solutions to the questions of the Middle East and of South Africa must ultimately come from, or be found with the direct participation of, the respective peoples concerned. However, my delegation is also of the view that there are certain other countries which, through their special relations and influence, could facilitate the early achievement of such solutions. That is why my delegation wants to appeal to these countries, which include the two super-Powers, to use their influence positively with those parties which, because of mistrust or insecurity, have been reluctant to take measures that are necessary in order to move forward. The intervention of these countries on other questions has led to positive results. We are convinced that they could contribute to similar results with regard to the issues of the Middle East and South Africa.\nlast October the Malawi delegation joined others in welcoming the conclusion between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of the Treaty on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Nuclear Missiles - the INF Treaty. The Malawi delegation observed that that Agreement constituted the first major step towards the elimination of all nuclear arms. At the same time we expressed the hope that the Treaty would give an impetus to ongoing negotiations on other classes and types of arms, especially chemical weapons, so as to hasten the achievement of the ultimate goal - complete and comprehensive disarmament. The Malawi delegation, further, drew attention to the fact that international security is of concern to all States, big and small alike. In this connection, the delegation reaffirmed Malawi's belief in the need for a multilateral approach to disarmament and for the United Nations to be associated with all initiatives on disarmament.\nWe thus considered it a happy coincidence that the proposed date for the formal signature of the United States/Soviet Union agreement should have fallen just a month before the start of the General Assembly's third special session on disarmament, which was held here in New York in June this year.\nHowever, my delegation regards it as a matter of deep regret that the third special session could not agree on the final document and thus adjourned without a formal conclusion. Nevertheless, we believe that the session was still useful in providing an opportunity to assess progress achieved since the two previous sessions. We are certain that the conclusions that were drawn from the session will prove invaluable as we plot the way forward.\nMy delegation has on several occasions declared the Malawi Government's conviction that international security cannot best be assured by the size or quality of the arsenals that countries may possess. Rather, we believe that genuine international security lies in all States respecting each other's independence and sovereignty, regardless of size or economic and political strength.\nwe have therefore been alarmed by certain developments during the last 12 months which seemed to suggest that some States might want to return the world to that era, long thought to have disappeared for ever, when might was right, and bigger States assumed for the themselves the right callously to intervene in the internal affairs of the small and weaker ones. My delegation wishes to reiterate its appeal for respect among States for each other's sovereignty, strict adherence to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of others, and respect for the principle of the non-use of force. Only in that way can we assure international peace and security.\nAmong the subjects which the General Assembly will consider during the current session is the critical economic situation in Africa. Before it will be the report on the mid-term review on the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. My delegation looks forward to the discussions on this report.\nI should like, however, to express our disappointment at the fact that despite the solemn undertaking by the international donor community to enhance its assistance to Africa with specific regard to the implementation of the Programme of Action, and in spite of the efforts that African States have exerted in fulfilment of their own obligations, at times with great risk to national political stability, very little international assistance has been forthcoming. In the meantime, unfortunately, the economic crisis in Africa has worsened further, and more aid than was projected in 1986 will now be required to meet the Programme's original goals. It is our sincere hope that the results of the mid-term review will be taken seriously by Africa's partners and that concerted efforts will be made by them to fulfil their obligations during the second half of the Programme's projected five-year span.\nMeanwhile, we have noted with interest the measures adopted recently by some of the developed countries with a view to helping ease the financial burden facing developing countries, especially the least developed countries. We welcome these moves. However, we would like to join others in reiterating that the economic problems of developing countries need to be addressed in a global manner if lasting solutions ace to be found.\nBefore concluding ray statement, I should like to take this opportunity to express my Government's gratitude to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other agencies of the United Nations foe the invaluable assistance they have provided to enable the Government of Malawi to cater foe our brothers and sisters from Mozambique who have come into Malawi during the past two years. These refugees now number over 600,000, which is equivalent to about 8 per cent of our national population. We are particularly grateful for the Secretary-General's timely initiative in sending last year a multi-agency team to study this problem with a view to determining how best to assist Malawi to deal with both the short-term and the long-term needs arising from this situation. Malawi's economic capacity is very limited and the sudden surge in population has seriously strained the country's socio-economic infrastructure.\nMalawi is also grateful to the many countries and the other international organizations that have contributed so generously in various ways towards enabling us to provide for our brethren.\nIn this context, I should like to express Malawi's satisfaction at the outcome of the International Conference on the Plight of Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons in Southern Africa, held in Oslo, Norway, last August, with the full support of the United Nations. It is our hope that the principles enshrined in the Oslo declaration and plan of action will receive full international support. It is therefore my delegation's hope that the General Assembly will endorse the Oslo declaration and plan of action.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nAllow me at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and as a non-aligned member of tile Security Council Argentina has consistently played a significant and constructive role in the international arena. I therefore sincerely hope that during the present deliberations your leadership will render effective and decisive contributions to international peace and security.\nDuring the past year the world has witnessed some new developments which have shown a prospect for a new movement in the international arena. Preceding speakers have all expressed their satisfaction at seeing the course of international relations directed towards mutual understanding and finding peaceful solutions to regional and international conflicts and crises. This fresh atmosphere is imbued with new hopes for the future as well as new and more serious expectations among all nations. As a forum for the international community, virtually embracing all the countries in the world, the United Nations has now become the focus of attention. As such, it is now facing a momentous and valuable litmus test. Given the fresh hopes, however, it is too early now to pass a final judgement on the role of this massive and complex Organization. We are fully aware that political expediency has been and will continue to be a determining and often negative and destructive factor in the activities of the United Nations. Admittedly, these unfortunate considerations cannot be expected to disappear easily from the United Nations.\nShould internationally recognized norms and principles guide our efforts, the ill effects of political expediency would of themselves subside, facilitating the promotion of understanding and the search for just solutions to complex international problems. Following this very guideline, the Secretary-General has admirably succeeded in providing the global community with a new perspective for substantial achievements by the United Nations. In dealing with complex international crises, such as the questions of Afghanistan, Namibia, Kampuchea, Cyprus and the war imposed by Iraq on the Islamic Republic of Iran, the constructive endeavours of the Secretary-General and his representatives are evident, endeavours inspired by realism, impartiality and integrity. These sincere efforts have deservedly met with global appreciation for the Secretary-General.\nGiven the extensive domain of the Organization's activities and the expectations aroused by its recent achievements in dealing with various international problems, the present session of the General Assembly is Inevitably faced with some momentous tasks. Here, we cannot, and should not, fall back upon past practice and simply remain content with the mere adoption of a few resolutions. A slow, conservative pace at the United Nations will no longer be acceptable to the international community. \nThe means and capabilities required for the shared responsibility o\u00a3 conducting international affairs with a view to the enhancement of peace and security are all available to us. Today, it has been demonstrated in practice that the era of a bipolar world, the era of dominance by super\u2014Powers over the destinies of the world and the oppressed nations is very much a closed chapter. A quite new era has been ushered in, an era in which peaceful coexistence and mutual respect for the rights of nations must inevitably replace the old policies of domination. The struggle of oppressed nations and the efforts exercised by non-aligned and neutral countries have significantly contributed to the inculcation of this new trend and attitude.\t.\nWhat is needed at present to guarantee the success of this new trend is to treat the root causes of regional crises which have distressingly turned into protracted, chronic diseases in many parts of the world, so as to preclude the resurgence of crisis and acts of aggression, or at least render them too costly for the potential perpetrators. This goal may be achieved only through the establishment of justice and the restoration of the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter in dealing with international problems.\nUndoubtedly one of the most sensitive crises which has put to the test the United Nations capability in dealing with international problems is the war imposed by Iraq against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The blatant aggression by Iraq on 22 September 1980 against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the newly established government of the Islamic Republic of Iran - in the course of which even the most basic standards of human, decency and universally recognised norms of international law have been violated by Iraq# sparing no one from atrocities ranging from massive bombardment of residential quarters, massacring- innocent women and children to the deployment of chemical weapons against Iraqi civilians - provides international public opinion with a roost obvious case of aggression and war crimes.\nUnfortunately  the indifferent and unprincipled approach displayed during these eight years by international bodies vis-\u00e0-vis abhorrent acts of aggression and violations of recognized rules and norms of international law have set a dangerous precedent in political expediency  shaping responses to acts threatening international peace and security.\nNotwithstanding this approach  the Islamic Republic of Iran, ever since the inception of the imposed war, has sincerely continued its co-operation with the Secretary-General in pursuing a political solution to the conflict. This was recently made quite evident in the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), a resolution in whose adoption we had no role and which was even used as a lever of pressure by certain quarters against the Islamic Republic of Iran. Official acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) by the highest authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran virtually removed the last Iraqi pretexts aimed at obstructing the implementation of the Security Council resolution, thus providing a litmus test for the political will and capability of the international community  and particularly the Security Council, in contributing to the realization of a just  comprehensive and honourable peace.\nAs also confirmed by the high office of our honourable leader the Islamic Republic of Iran has on many occasions declared its solid intention of securing a lasting and honourable peace in the region and has in practice proven its sincere commitment in this respect by displaying flexibility good will and co-operation with the Secretary-General and his representatives. Members are certainly aware that during the interval spanning the acceptance of the resolution by the Islamic Republic of Iran and the official establishment of the cease-fire, the Iraqi regime, despite its past deceitful propaganda paying lip-service to peace, embarked upon a series of attacks against our industrial and economic centres, repeatedly committed acts of aggression deeply penetrating our territories and, in contravention of the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the Secretary-General's implementation plan, resorted to raising certain illogical and unacceptable pre-conditions which undoubtedly had a restraining impact on the Secretary-General's activities.\nDuring the 10 rounds of official discussions with the Secretary-General in New York during July and August 1988, the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, explicitly delineating its position and proving its good will, showed a clear perspective for securing a comprehensive and lasting peace, while the other party opted for seeking excuses and negativism in its politics. \nThe precondition for direct talks before the cease-fire so seriously raised by Iraq in the first round of talks was in fact nothing but a ploy to continue the war and prevent implementation of the very resolution which Iraq had verbally accepted a year before. During the two weeks of talks in New York, the Iraqi delegation even refused to hold any substantive meeting with the Secretary-General, who plays the primary role in the implementation of resolution 598 (1987). However, since these Iraqi excuses received widespread international criticism and owing to the International pressure created against Iraq, the latter was finally compelled to give up this precondition.\nThe declaration of 20 August 1988 as the day for the cease-fire was in fact the result of the Iranian delegation's good will and the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General and his aides. As a result of Iraqi-instigated obstacles as well as the absence of a decisive approach by the international community, however, finalization of the timetable for implementing all the provisions of the resolution was postponed to take place in the course of talks in Geneva.\nReaffirming its good will by accepting direct talks, the Islamic Republic of Iran, in a letter dated 7 August 1988 addressed to the Secretary-General, stated\u00b7. \\\"It is our understanding that, in the agenda for direct talks, the procedure and items will be set in accordance with the provisions of your implementation plan. In this context, substantive negotiations between Iran and Iraq can only be entered into for the implementation of paragraph 4 of the resolution. The implementation of other paragraphs of the resolution will be carried out as planned by the Secretary-General.\\\" (S/20094, p. 1)\nThis position of the Islamic Republic of Iran fully corresponds with both section 1 in the Secretary-General's implementation plan dated 15 October 1987 and his public official positions taken in the course of discussions held in New York in July and August 1988. This position therefore constitutes the basis for any further endeavours in this regard. In his letter of 8 August 1988, addressed to the Foreign Ministers of Iran and Iraq, the Secretary-General stated that:\n\\\"In pursuance of the official contact I had with Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, I should like to inform you that both Governments have agreed to direct talks between their Foreign Ministers which shall be held under my auspices, immediately after the establishment of the cease-fire, in order to reach a common understanding of the other provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the procedures and timings for their implementation.\\\"\nIt was on the basis of this understanding that we entered into direct talks at Geneva, expecting to agree on the time-table for the implementation of the other provisions of the resolution, beginning with the immediate withdrawal of force to the internationally recognized borders.\nIt is not my intention to reveal here the details of the direct talks held at Geneva. It is, however, necessary to express the views of my Government as related to the general aspects of these talks. At Geneva the Iraqi delegation unfortunately resumed its old negative methods from the very first session of the talks, as in New York. By raising certain issues outside the agenda, such as preconditions for the implementation of the remaining provisions of the resolution, it diverted the talks from the course set for them by the Secretary-General, dragging them into irrelevant discussions with no substantive results bearing on the implementation of the resolution.\nFor example, the fallacy involved in raising the argument of enjoying equally the fruits of cease-fire, geographical comparisons of Iran and Iraq and the consequences of the geographical differences between the two countries, was in fact a direct invitation to engage in lengthy economic, political, military and social comparisons, opening the Pandora Box of never-ending obvious inequalities between the two countries. Employing such false logic to achieve rights outside the norms of international law for Iraq in the Persian Gulf and Arvand Rood and extending the same logic to all paragraphs of the resolution has been a dangerous and destructive ploy, which if combined would inevitably direct the process of talks towards virtual futility and indefinite stalemate.\nIn the first round of direct talks in Geneva, the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed its resolute conviction of the need to finalize the time and procedures for the implementation of the other provisions of the resolution, most significant among which are the immediate withdrawal of the forces to internationally recognized borders and the formation of an impartial body for the identification of the aggressor. It further emphasized that raising irrelevant issues would stall the process of the talks on secondary matters.\nHowever, the Islamic Republic of Iran, continuing its co-operation with the Secretary-General in his discharge of the most crucial role assigned to him by the resolution and attempting to improve the atmosphere of talks, continued its co-operation with the personal representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Eliasson, and his colleagues so as to achieve an acceptable principled formula concerning shipping in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. In this context a very positive attitude was displayed, without any attempt to divert the talks from their true objective, and the Iranian delegation considered and evaluated the suggestions made by the Secretary-General and presented its own constructive comments without the least ambiguity.\nRegrettably, during the course of direct talks it was once again demonstrated that Iraq, rather than following the discussions within the established framework so as to reach an understanding, was attempting to seize the opportunity to use the talks as a means to achieve certain illegitimate political and military objectives, suffering from the illusion that whatever was not gained through the war of aggression and its use of inhuman and illegal resources would be secured through the peace talks. With such a goal in mind, the Iraqi delegation therefore spared no effort in obstructing the Secretary-General's activities and in manoeuvring to change the spirit of his proposals and the resolution.\nIn other words, Iraq's efforts all along the course of the Geneva talks were aimed at distorting the spirit of the resolution and the implementation plan, changing the limit and scope of relevant rules of international law, securing International approval for its expansionist designs and using the cease-fire to weaken its very foundations. \nIraq's Insistence on its preconditions and its lack of preparedness to accept the Secretary-General's proposals and to evaluate them constructively all contributed to the failure at the Geneva talks to achieve their objective, which was to finalize the timing and procedures for the implementation of all remaining provisions of the resolution from the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized boundaries to paragraph 8 of the resolution. Most typical of Iraq's intransigence and obstructionism is its objection to the Secretary-General's proposal for continuation of talks in New York which had already won the approval of all members of the Security Council. It is, however, necessary to point out here that the procrastinate attitudes originating in undue political expediencies, as displayed by certain members of the Security Council, lent encouragement to Iraq in its show of Intransigence all through the talks. \nThat, in effect, is needed for the success of the talks that ate currently under way under the auspices of the Secretary-General is the immediate implementation of the remaining paragraphs of the resolution, which is binding under Articles 39 and 40 of the United Nations Charter. In the same vein, the text of the resolution and the Secretary-General's implementation plan should constitute the basis of talks, and the Council members' understanding of the spirit of the resolution could also contribute to its implementation.\nNow that, despite Iraq's numerous violations, the cease-fire has been established, it is urgently necessary that the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized boundaries be begun without further delay and completed within a short period, to be determined solely by technical considerations. A withdrawal of forces should have been effected immediately after the cease-fire, as stipulated in the resolution. It would constitute a significant step towards the decisive consolidation of the cease-fire.\nFurthermore, in spite of the provisions of the Secretary-General's implementation plan, repeatedly reaffirmed by the Security Council# the formation of an impartial body for the identification of the aggressor has also been delayed. This body should begin its work with no further delay so as to pave the way for the achievement of a just peace.\nWe are fully prepared for the implementation of all the paragraphs in the resolution, within the framework of the Secretary-General's plan. While Iraq continues its obstructionist policies, we have even carried out unilaterally measures aimed at facilitating the implementation of other paragraphs of the resolution, as exemplified by the recent release of 72 Iraqi prisoners of war and 16 Egyptian prisoners, on the other hand, according to reports confirmed by the United Nations observer forces, Iraq, in violation of the cease-fire, has taken captive at least 700 Iranian military personnel and, more recently, it kidnapped two Iranian reporters in the presence of the representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. These cases well suffice as a demonstration of the two countries' real intentions regarding the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).\nWe stress once again that the achievement of a comprehensive, just and honourable peace will not be possible without scrupulous observance of international law and, in particular, the legal instrument which governs the frontiers between the two countries, namely the 1975 Treaty of State Frontier and Neighbourly Relations between Iran and Iraq. Furthermore, the political will and practical goodwill of the two parties to the conflict is imperative for the achievement of peace. As before, the Islamic Republic of Iran will demonstrate its will for the establishment of lasting peace in the region. It will, however, resist with all its ability and strength any effort aimed at the emasculation of its indisputable, legitimate rights. It will never permit the Iraqi Government to achieve its aggressive designs by resorting to destructive manoeuvres in the peace talks, and as it attempted to do through its acts of aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran and its violations of all the rules of international law during the imposed war. Iraq must have learned its lesson from the eight-year-long heroic resistance of the Iranian Muslims well enough to have second thoughts about repeating whimsical, illegitimate aspirations.\nIt is also necessary to make a few remarks about paragraph 8 of the resolution, whose manner of implementation is to be drawn up by the Secretary-General in consultation with the two parties and other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Because of its strategic location and the possession of almost half the proved oil reserves in this part of the world, the Persian Gulf region is a critical and significant factor in international equations. Therefore developments in the region closely affect international peace and security.\nThe common religious, cultural and economic grounds shared by the countries in the Persian Gulf area constitute a firm basis for their solidarity and their gathering together within a single regional system to guarantee and safeguard their common interests. Nevertheless, the arrogant global Powers, which have fixed their greedy eyes upon the riches in this region a- found a guarantee of their interests in the lack of unity and solidarity among these countries, continually sow the seeds of discord and hostility among them so as to preclude the fulfilment of their long cherished aspirations.\nWe have on many occasions declared our readiness to establish firm, friendly relations with the countries of the region in order to provide long-term strategic security for the area. In this context, the Secretary-General's eight-point plan of 21 March 1985 received our positive response, and on 8 May 1986 we proposed a plan for regional security based on the joint co-operation of all parties in the\nPersian Gulf region for all-inclusive security.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran strongly believes that failure to gather within a coherent regional system, and the void created by the absence of such a system, would entail grave consequences for the regional States in terms of their sovereignty and inalienable rights.\nIt is worth emphasizing in this connection that the presence of United States naval forces in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, which contravenes the purposes and principles set out in Articles 1 and 2 of the United Nations Charter, concerning respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence and the sovereign equality of States - has seriously jeopardized the peace and security process in the region. The roost vicious consequence of the presence of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf was the criminal shooting down by the United States of the Iranian airliner flying along an internationally recognized air corridor on 3 July 1988, which cost the lives of 290 innocent people, including 100 women and children. That act was a blatant violation not only of the rule about refraining from aggression but also of the territorial integrity of a United Nations Member State.\nAfter the acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the measures undertaken by the Secretary-General towards the attainment of a lasting peace in the region, there remains no further excuse for the continued presence of the United States Navy. Therefore it must leave this region as soon as possible so that peace and tranquillity may be restored to the Persian Gulf nations, with no further foreign intervention.\nThe war waged by Iraq against the Islamic Republic of Iran, the longest conventional war in the twentieth century, has provided some significant and noteworthy experiences that can be used in the further development and codification of international rules on the conduct of war. \nIn the course of this imposed war Iraq not only blatantly violated the norms and principles of the conduct of war on numerous occasions, including the use of chemical weapons and attacks against residential quarters, but also resorted to other measures totally alien to the spirit and objective of such rules of war. These fresh cases include threats to civilian airliners, attacks on commercial shipping in international waters and attacks on oil platforms. Such practices have in the past been condemned by the international community and international organizations.\nSuch attacks, made possible by recent developments in military technology and methods of warfare, would not have been feasible in the past, since these inhumane measures were unheard of and were never raised when past conferences were convened for the codification of laws on the conduct of war. Therefore, no codes of conduct have been provided to deal with suds war crimes as have been committed by Iraq, although those crimes have been explicitly rejected by international forums.\nIn view of its experiences during the imposed war, and in order to preclude any repetition of such crimes in the future, the Islamic Republic of Iran proposes that the United Nations, on behalf of the international community, enact at an appropriate time certain restrictive legal measures to curtail the future commission of such crimes and thus contribute to the codification of a new set of international rules on the conduct of war.\nUndeniably, the most significant incident deserving the utmost international attention, since it poses the most serious threat to the international community, is the extensive and unsparing deployment of chemical weapons by Iraq against both the Iranians and its own people, in contravention of all humanitarian rules of international law. \nThe use of those evil, dreadful weapons, which sporadically began from 13 January 1931 against our military forces, gradually grew to such extensive and indiscriminate dimensions, mostly owing to the silence of international organizations, that they were not only used against Iranian civilians, but also claimed the lives of thousands of Kurdish women and children in Iraq. The United Nations has on five different occasions dispatched to the area expert missions, which have documented the extensive use of chemical weapons by Iraq.\nI should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the everlasting memories of all the innocent victims of those horrific weapons, and to reiterate my proposal that 18 Mardi - the day when Iraqi chemical attacks against the city of Halabja claimed the lives of 5,000 innocent Iraqi civilians and left thousands of others critically injured - be designated the international day of the campaign against chemical weapons.\nWhile the Security Council dealt in two different resolutions, 612 (1988) and 620 (1988), with the Iraqi use of chemical weapons, the mild nature of those resolutions in fact encouraged Iraq to continue on a massive scale its horrifying use of chemical weapons.\nIraq's audacity in the use of those weapons is such that even after the commencement of the cease-fire between the two countries Iraq used chemical weapons on a large scale against its own Kurds in the northern part of the country. Only the extreme nature of this incident led to the breaking of the long-standing silence observed by many, who now declared the extent of the tragedy of the use of chemical weapons and even demanded an investigation into the matter.\nIn view of the massive international outrage against those horrific crimes by Iraq, as well as the related positions of different countries and international organizations condemning such inhuman acts against the innocent Iraqi Kurds, it is not sufficient now merely to issue statements and pass resolutions reprimanding the perpetrator it is absolutely essential that international organizations take serious preventive measures immediately to halt this trend of genocide and seriously punish the perpetrator.\nDuring the current year the international community has witnessed the old scar on the heart of the Middle East  which has created moral and material turbulence and difficulties  once again  as it has hundreds of times before  greatly disturb the very spirit of the Muslim and Arab communities by becoming further infected. The regime occupying Quds has for years been expelling Palestinian residents from the occupied territories  but when the Palestinian people intensified their struggle to free themselves from the oppression of the occupiers  the occupying regime, in an unprecedented manner  enacted the most oppressive and savage measures to curtail the Palestinians. Those measures continue to this day.\nThe savagery of the occupying Zionist regime in repressing the people of the occupied territories  who fight with empty hands and resist the occupiers with no weapons, and the regime's confrontations with the Islamic combatants in southern Lebanon undoubtedly demonstrate its anxiety about the growth and further expansion of such deep-rooted resistance movements.\nToday the regime occupying Quds, supported by global imperialism and having continued its occupation of the Palestinian homeland and part of the other Islamic and Arab lands, resorts to new acts of savagery at whim. The repeated crimes perpetrated by the regime against southern Lebanon and the massacre of innocent civilians and Palestinian refugees once again prove the claim that the crisis in the Middle East will not be resolved unless this racist regime is eradicated and the rights of Palestinian to self-determination and the establishment of an independent government within their own territory are restored.\nDangerous global and reactionary conspiracies consistently attempt to compromise the Palestinian objectives. Ito da y the Palestinian people face another such attempt to confront and undermine their heroic uprising against the regime occupying their territories.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, on the basis of historical precedents and experience, is of the opinion that any flexibility and retreat vis-\u00e0-vis the occupying regime will simply carry within itself the seed for future acts of aggression by the regime. We therefore warn against conspiracies currently in the making, and, while supporting the heroic struggle of the Palestinian people, we ask other Islamic, progressive and non-aligned countries fully to support this epic uprising and thus discharge their responsibilities and duties relating to the sacred goals of this oppressed people.\nIn another part of the Islamic world, Afghanistan, which bears the heavy burden of aggression and occupation, the struggles of its peoples once again prove that struggles against foreign aggression do not fade with time. More particularly, Islamic liberationist ideology lends greater intensity to the struggle against aggression in Afghanistan.\nThe withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghan territories, which commenced in mid-Nay 1988, is an initial step in solving the problems in Afghanistan. The Islamic Republic of Iran, while welcoming the withdrawal of foreign forces from the Islamic territory of Afghanistan, reiterates its long-standing conviction that the right to choose its own destiny and its future government is an inalienable right of the people of that country. We further emphasize that no regime can survive there without the full support of the Afghan people and the Maslira Mujahidin. The only final solution of the problem of Afghanistan lies in non-intervention by foreign forces in the nation domestic affairs and allowing the indigenous population to manage affairs. The substitution of one foreign element by another presents no solution. \nThe Islamic Republic of Iran hopes that, as socio-political conditions in Afghanistan improve, the way will be paved for the voluntary and honourable repatriation of the Afghan refugees who, driven from hearth and home, have for a number of years now been the respected guests of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nIt is with the utmost chagrin that I have to point once again to an unsolved problem that constitutes a protracted crime against humanity and an insult to its common conscience. The international community still suffers from the disgrace of racism and the ensuing discrimination. Since the Second World War, the most blatant institutionalized racism has been practised by the regime in Pretoria.\nThis regime, in total disregard of the most basic principles of humanity and international law, continues to this day its racist policies and its Illegal occupation of Namibia, and in so doing enjoys the support of Western countries and the full co-operation of the Zionist regime.\nWe have always insisted that support for the righteous struggle of the oppressed people of South Africa, and those of Namibia, led by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), together with a serious effort by the international community to bring all-round pressure to bear upon the Pretoria regime and its supporters, constitutes the sole means of ridding the world of the very roots of this regime - this shameful product of human failures. In this context, we hope that the efforts of the Secretary-General, which have gained a new momentum recently, will succeed in paving the way for the independence of Namibia and the removal of this dark page of racial supremacy from the history of the contemporary world.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, we have readied a stage at which, by supporting the efforts of the Secretary-General to resolve the question, we may be optimistic about a peaceful future for that region, based on respect for the legitimate rights and desires of the people.\nThe positive developments in the international community, a number of which have been referred to, and the role of the United Nations and its Secretariat in the betterment of the international political atmosphere - which has been acknowledged by the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize for the Organization's activities in the maintenance of peace - have placed United Nations organs in a position to discharge its most crucial and historic duty. This is the duty to prepare the way for securing lasting, not piecemeal, peace and stability by ensuring observance of the principles and roles of international law and of the United Nations Charter, and respect for the rights and wishes of nations in areas where the achievement of such peace has always been sacrificed to the unwholesome expansionist rivalries of imperialist Powers.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran wishes the Secretary-General and his colleagues the utmost success in discharging their important duties in this critical domain.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a pleasure for me to participate in a session held amidst such special international circumstances, in which concerted efforts are being made in the quest for peace, and tireless, unrelenting work is being done in addressing the countless international and regional issues and laying the foundations for constructive and fruitful co-operation among the peoples and countries of the world.\nSuch circumstances have become possible thanks to the new international climate based on conciliation and deriving from the improvement in Soviet-American relations and the positive results of summit meetings, particularly the recent Moscow summit. That summit created a climate of detente, opened new horizons for a just and comprehensive peace and provided the conditions necessary for tackling numerous regional and international questions.\nIn these special circumstances, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you. Sir, on the confidence placed in you and on your well-deserved election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We are confident that you are amply qualified to lead us to success in handling the issues under consideration during this session.\nThis is a good opportunity to convey our deep gratitude to Mr, Peter Florin, Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, who conducted the deliberations of the forty-second session of the General Assembly with competence and ability that showed how deserving he was of the confidence of the international community.\nIt would be remiss of me not to express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and our deep appreciation of his continuing efforts to consolidate the role of the United Nations in addressing many regional and international questions. These efforts translate the will of the international community, which defines the ways and means for finding just solutions to those questions. We take note with great pleasure of the tangible progress achieved in his direction.\nOur participation in this session of the General Assembly coincides with the celebration by our people in Yemen of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the National Liberation Devolution of 14 October, under the leadership of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Yemen. This part of the Yemeni homeland regained under British occupation for 129 years, years of backwardness, throughout which it was divided into more than 23 sultanates, emirates and sheikhdoms, which separated our citizens and impeded our growth and development.\nEver since we won our independence 21 years ago, we have been trying to achieve balanced urban and rural development and build an independent national economy free from foreign hegemony. We wanted to build an economy that catered to the material and spiritual needs of our citizens, after the unification of all emirates and sheikhdoms under the administration of one central Government. Despite the scarcity of resources, the backwardness of the infrastructures of the national economy that we inherited, and the acute internal and external difficulties that we faced from the very day of our independence our country was able to stand on its own two feet. We were able to endure our plight thanks to the steadfastness and solidarity of our people, who believed in the justice of their national and social cause, under the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party. As a result, we have succeeded in consolidating our political independence and have come a long way along the road of our independent social and economic development. We have sought to improve the standards of living of our people, increase their participation in the practical political life of the country and enhance their contribution to building their new society.\nWithin the national Yemeni framework we have worked tirelessly with our brethren in the northern part of the homeland to create the objective bases on which the desired state of unity of a unified Yemen will be built. We have achieved tangible progress in this direction following the signature of the historic agreement of San 'a on 4 May 1988. Under this agreement we agreed to joint oil investment in the border area between north and south Yemen, namely, in the area between the governorates of Shabwa and Magreb. We have also agreed to freedom of movement for all citizens of the Yemeni homeland with identity cards. We believe that the San'a agreement has opened wide horizons for further tangible practical steps which can lay the bases for the reunification of the Yemeni homeland through peaceful and democratic means.\nOn the regional level, we are working to develop brotherly relations with the countries of the region on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and independence, and non-interference in the internal affairs of others. We are seeking to expand the spheres of co-operation among us in a manner that serves the common interests of our peoples, promotes peace and stability in the area and helps to avert present risks so that our peoples can at last enjoy prosperity and progress.\nWe have achieved auspicious progress in this direction by creating the best conditions for building the economy internally and contributing to the promotion of joint Arab endeavours, side by side with our brothers in the Arab countries. By so doing we hope to serve our national causes, foremost among which ranks the recovery of the national inalienable rights of the Arab Palestinian people. This common approach will also enable us to face challenges to and frustrate the conspiracies hatched against our peoples.\nWithin the framework, principles and objectives of our foreign policy we continue to promote and develop our relations with other countries of the world in the political, economic and social fields. Through continuing efforts we are trying to expand the activities of our country in international forums, particularly within the framework of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, which is the common denominator for us and the majority of the countries of the world.\nThis year has witnessed many salient events and developments, including the cease-fire recently agreed to between the two neighbouring countries, Iraq and Iran. We support that decision whole-heartedly, just as we have always supported Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The war, it is known, did not pose a danger for the belligerent parties alone, it threatened our region in its entirety. The continued hostilities exacerbated tension and presaged disasters, inflicting instability on the region and bringing turmoil to the international situation. Now that the war is over, everyone is called upon to strive for the success of the negotiations, and to build a solid foundation for a permanent peace. We want this call to be construed as a call to the peoples and countries of the region, which bear full responsibility for the maintenance of its peace and security. We hope that the direct negotiations between Iran and Iraq will lead to a just and comprehensive peace agreement, and end the conflict between them by addressing its underlying causes through constructive meaningful dialogue. That would eliminate the dangers facing our entire region and spate the two neighbouring peoples further -losses in life and property. It would also frustrate the sinister plans hatched against our people to undermine the peace and stability of the region, and ultimately pave the way to the rebuilding of what the war has destroyed.\t\nWhile we commend the climate of detente on the International scene which has created conditions favourable for the reaching of agreements on many, regional and International problems, we appeal to the international community to concentrate on the dangers that would result from any further exacerbation of the situation in the Middle East region. The continued Israeli occupation of the Arab Palestinian territories is a time bomb that may explode at any minute, and as such it is a threat to security and stability locally, regionally and internationally. Responsibility for this state of affairs rests with Israel's arrogance, its continued policy of aggression, Its defiance of International law, norms and humanitarian principles, and Its rejection of all International efforts aimed at achieving permanent, just and comprehensive peace in the region. There is no need to recall that peace in the region can be reached only by addressing the crux of the problem - that is the need for realization of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\nIn saluting the Arab Palestinian masses in their heroic uprising In the face of the brutal acts of oppression perpetrated by the Israeli occupation authorities, we renew our commitment to stand side by side with our Palestinian brothers in their struggle under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (\u0420LO), their sole, legitimate representative. We reiterate our continued support for the courageous and heroic popular uprising. Furthermore, we believe that a just solution of the Palestinian question can be brought about only on the basis set forth by the international community, namely, recovery of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among which are their rights to return, to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent State on their national soil.\nIn order to find a just, permanent and comprehensive solution of the Middle East question, we believe we must undertake urgent and necessary steps to convene the International Conference on Peace in the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the FLO, the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, as well as the permanent members of the Security Council.\nWhile speaking of the Middle East, I find it opportune to renew our appeal to our brothers in Lebanon to resort to reason and reach an immediate agreement that will end the political vacuum there, guarantee Lebanon's unity, independence and sovereignty, provide security and stability to the Lebanese people, and pool all efforts to put an end to the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. There are also indications on the horizon of the success of international efforts aimed at finding a political solution to the problem of Western Sahara in conformity with United Nations resolutions. Similar efforts are being made to solve the question of Cyprus in a way that will guarantee its territorial integrity, independence and non-aligned status. We welcome and support all such efforts.\nWe also welcome what has been achieved in the context of the Geneva agreement on the political settlement in Afghanistan, and the steps so far taken in that direction. We call upon all parties concerned to redouble their efforts to implement this agreement, to overcome all attempts to obstruct it, and to give impetus to the process of national reconciliation in Afghanistan so that the Afghan people can start enjoying stability and prosperity.\nFurthermore, we applaud the efforts to reach a just political settlement on the situation in Kampuchea so that peace and stability can be achieved in South-East Asia. We also welcome all serious attempts to reunify the two Koreas by peaceful and democratic means, and we support the efforts made by the democratic Republic of Korea to this end. We also call for concerted international efforts to support the Central American peace plan. We deem it necessary to eliminate all obstacles being put in its way. We also believe it necessary to end all designs and acts of aggression aimed at undermining the sovereignty of Nicaragua and its national Government, which is the only way to guarantee the promotion of peace and stability in the region.\nWith respect to southern Africa, we hope that the agreement readied in Geneva will prove to be a step towards the independence of Namibia. In this regard, we believe that responsibility for Namibia and its people lies with the United Nations. Hence, we renew the call to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978), since it represents the internationally agreed framework for the independence of the Territory, and we confirm the need for the full participation of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in any endeavour to that end.\nWe believe that the international community must impose mandatory sanctions on the South African racist regime to deter it and to ensure that it will respect and comply with the international will. The international community must bring mote pressure to bear on the racist regime to obtain the release of Nelson Mandela, the prominent African hero.\nWhile reviewing the important achievements of 1988, we cannot but give due credit to the results of the Moscow summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union. That summit meeting has made it possible to exchange the instruments of ratification of the most important bilateral agreement ever readied in the field of disarmament. There is no doubt that this agreement, together with other bilateral accords concluded between the two countries on various levels, has had extremely favourable results on their bilateral relations and on the international situation and co-operation in general. We are confident that the results of the Moscow summit meeting will be the beginning of a continuing process of giving priority to dialogue and co-operation in international relations and enhancing spheres of mutual co-operation and common interests. Here we should like to pay a tribute to the positive initiatives of the Soviet Union and to express our hope that what has been achieved thus far will contribute to the adoption of fruitful and effective measures to curb the arms race - particularly the nuclear arms race - and ultimately end it. It is our sincere hope that it will prove possible to reach an early agreement on a SO per cent reduction in the strategic nuclear armaments of both countries, prevent the arms race in outer space, eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and conclude a convention to ban the production and use of chemical weapons. We cannot overemphasize the importance of reaching an agreement on a comprehensive nuclear test ban.\nOn the regional level, we believe that urgent measures must be taken to eliminate the dangers posed by Israeli nuclear armaments and the nuclear capability of the racist South African regime. We deem it extremely urgent to oppose in no uncertain terms the dumping of nuclear waste in developing countries and to call on the international community to address this problem and the dangerous risks inherent therein. We also hope that the recent improvement in international relations will spill over to give impetus to the international efforts aimed at the convening of the international conference on the Indian Ocean as a necessary step towards the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.\nIt is natural that we should pin our hopes on the improvement of international relations which has created favourable conditions in which to address the numerous regional and international political problems. \u2116 for our part will spare no effort to contribute, side by side with other members of the international community, to the creation of favourable circumstances for further conciliation and co-operation among the peoples of the world so as to improve and enhance the quality of life for all. We whole-hearted support the sincere efforts made to strengthen the role of the United Nations and its various bodies, thus enabling it to fulfil its task and realize our peoples' aspirations to stability and security.\nWe likewise hope that adequate attention will be given to international economic problems and to finding just solutions to them, thus supporting our countries' development efforts and fulfilling our peoples' aspirations to independent economic and social progress. Failing to address the trend of international economic, fiscal and monetary relations and make them more just and equitable by recognising the developing countries as active partners in the international arena will exacerbate the crisis in the international economic order and widen the gap between the developed industrial countries and the developing ones. This gap is bound to widen further and further as a result of the restrictive attitude of some developed countries in the trading, monetary financing and developmental spheres. The unfair conditions imposed by the international financial institutions add insult to injury  thus causing political and social instability in the developing countries, exacerbating the stagnation of their economies or the decrease of their growth rates. This becomes common place in the majority of developing countries in particular the least developed among them which already suffer from scarce natural and financial resources.\nIt is not strange then that the exacerbation of the suffering of the developing countries and their inability to pay their foreign debt have created a real crisis that has become known as the foreign debt crisis. This crisis should be addressed by finding objective and comprehensive solutions that take into consideration the interests of all parties concerned free from narrow, selfish concerns.\nThis grim picture of the international economic situation requires, first and foremost, the revitalisation of international negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order.\nThe international community, which is enjoying the breeze of international political detente, can reflect the same atmosphere in the field of international economic relations. This does not require planning strategies and new Instruments Inasmuch as It requires a sincere desire and definite resolve to implement economic strategies and Instruments In the economic field that have already been agreed upon. More Important still is our co-operation for the realization of the desired objectives of our peoples. Will we not proceed in the march of prevailing optimism? We hope so. Otherwise all that we have so far achieved will remain incomplete.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWhen we Moslems open our statements by saying, \\\"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful,\\\" we in fact renew a pledge before Allah, the Lord, to state the truth and to uphold justice, to advocate compassion within the framework of human relations - for mercy is the linchpin of brotherhood, human rights and co-operation towards progress.\nIt is on the premise of such a pledge by man before his Lord and by man to his Fellow human brothers that I address you now.\nIt gives me pleasure to express to you, Mr. President, on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), of which I have the honour to be the chairman during its fifth session, and in the name of the State of Kuwait, as well as on my own personal behalf, sincere congratulations on your election to preside over the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nYour election represents a responsibility entrusted to you at the outset of an era of global understanding when the world has made some genuine steps towards peace and co-operation. Yet further major breakthroughs are still required in order to address major long-standing universal problems. It is our hope that, by virtue of your personal skills, experience and the confidence we have all placed in you, further progress will he made.\nYou, Mr. President, belong to a friendly and beautiful country, Argentina, with whom my country, Kuwait, has amicable relations of co-operation and mutual respect. We do look forward to stronger ties between our two nations in larger and more diverse areas of co-operation, and we hope that you personally may perhaps be able to visit us in Kuwait sometime in the future as a dear guest.\nI should also like to put on record our appreciation for the efforts made by the President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin, who demonstrated his deep commitment to the issues of international peace and co-operation as well as his outstanding capabilities and wealth of experience. I should like to recall here the close ties, based on mutual trust and respect, that exist between the German Democratic Republic and Kuwait in several expanding spheres.\nThe addition, we in Kuwait - along with those throughout the Arab and Islamic worlds - pay a tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his constructive and sincere efforts in the causes of peace, as well as for his positive and forthcoming approach represented by his personal participation in international and regional meetings. His prudence and patience have been crucial to ensuring fruitful co-operation and reconciliation. We thus express to him and to his aides and representatives our deep appreciation.\nThis year, as the result of a tragic accident, the Organization of the Islamic Conference lost a staunch advocate of the Organization, our brother and friend the late General Modammad Zia Al-Haa, former President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Tributes to his memory were paid and condolences were expressed in this Hall over the loss of General Sia Al-Haa and his companions. The late General, may his soul rest in peace, demonstrated remarkable leadership in steering his country, and in that framework he served as Chairman of the second session of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and presided over its Science and Technology Committee from its inception. General Zia Al-Haa tirelessly strived to close the ranks of the Moslem world and to defend the cause of Islam. On behalf of the OIC, I should like to take this opportunity to express our thanks for your noble expressions of sympathy for the late General, his family and his nation, and to extend once again our condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives in the tragic aircraft crash.\nMankind has attached high hopes to the United Nations ever since its creation, for it represents the supreme forum in which all the peoples of the world voice their aspirations and concerns about their problems. Within the framework of the United Nations system the wealthiest, most powerful and most advanced nations meet with the poorest, the weakest and the most vulnerable countries. The United Nations presence has been a major factor in preventing a third world war. We view the world Organization as a larger workshop for moulding and refining human brotherhood and international co-operation and as an instrument for dialogue and peaceful coexistence in lieu of confrontation.\nThat should prompt us all to enhance our support for the United Nations and its various organizations and agencies. However, although a multilateral system of this scale and with such a magnitude of responsibility may be in need of some review from time to time, such exercises of reform must not preclude sustained support and help for the United Nations system in order to ensure its ability to fulfil its obligations. We believe that the enhancement of the efficiency of the United Nations should go hand in hand with efforts to ensure its existence. \nCo-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference is based on a shared vision of goals and means, as well as on a common approach in addressing global and regional problems. We all believe in overall human unity, in human rights and in the dignity of the human person; we believe in the fact that the individual human being is at the centre of the human pursuit of advancement. All of us believe in common action towards peace and in respect for every people's right to self-determination, to establish its State on its national territory, and to choose its life-style without any external interference. \nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference was established in 1969, following the criminal action committed against the Al-Aqsa mosque in Al-Quds Al-Sharif, the holy Arab city of Jerusalem; it reflected the modern Islamic awakening; it manifested the rejection of aggression and terrorism; and it expressed the wish to join a world march towards civilized progress.\nThe fifth Islamic summit, to which Kuwait  as honoured to act as host in January 1987, adopted a set of resolutions that both reaffirmed earlier resolutions and responded to the most recent world-wide developments with international and regional implications.\nStates members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference are ever seeking co-ordinated action both within the organization and outside it on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of nations and regional co-operation. Two examples are the Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and broader co-operation within the framework of the League of Arab States. We also maintain ties of co-operation with the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization of African Unity, the European Community, the big Powers and, indeed, the entire world community in the United Nations and its agencies.\nThese are bridges we should like to see widened and made more effective, and in all our endeavours in this connection we recognize that we live in a world of ever-changing international relations whose diverse cultural Focal points vary in their scope and impact. Given that diversity, coexistence and co-operation on the basis of mutual respect is imperative. It has therefore become essential that each and every civilization view other cultures through a more tolerant and objective pr ism.\nAmong the most significant trends in today's international life is the recent move by the two super-Powers towards mutual understanding; this has resulted in agreement on a reduction in the arsenal of nuclear weapons. That agreement is all the more significant in the light of its having been proven that the use of nuclear weapons could lead to massive loss of human life. Moreover, the super-Power accord coincided with the defusing of several complex international crises. \nI wish here to pay tribute to the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union for the breakthroughs achieved by the United States President, Mr. Ronald Reagan, and the Soviet leader, Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev.\nSmaller nations view this rapprochement with great optimism and now cherish fresh hope that the new understanding will in time have a positive effect on the long-awaited just solution of their own problems with a view to attaining their legitimate rights. \nI turn now from East-West relations to North-South issues. The single most important question here is foreign debt and the mounting debt-servicing burden. This problem, in its current magnitude, has come to impede and severely restrict development. It is also being used as a tool to exert pressure on the South in an attempt to secure its raw materials at depressed prices while selling to the countries of the South the North's manufactured goods and cereals at constantly rising prices. This results in an ever-widening gap between the two groups.\nFurthermore, by exporting the vulnerability of the poor - and in some cases by tendering up-front payments without due regard for the value of the human being of the South - some industrial enterprises of certain countries of the North have maliciously used places within the national territory of a number of poor nations of the South as dumping grounds for nuclear and toxic wastes without taking effective precautions. In certain cases, in fact, dumping took place without the knowledge of the Governments concerned and without any regard for the most fundamental human rights, including that of the physical safety of present and future generation.\nThis whole problem can be pondered in the form of single question: Why is all this tremendous pursuit necessary? It is hard enough for us in the South to cope with natural disasters, including long droughts, devastating floods and epidemics that dominate the world news. But unfortunately our friends in the North choose to aggravate our problems by creating additional plagues that destroy our ecological system and our human resources and undermine our ability to move forward towards a better future.\nIn this connection, I should like to take this opportunity to outline a three-point plan of action:\nFirst, we call upon creditor nations to meet to examine the question of writing off the interest due on their loans to the debtor countries. This should be coupled with giving up a portion of the loan principal due from the poorest group of debtor nations. Kuwait, as a creditor country, stands ready to attend such a meeting and is willing to comply with whatever resolutions might be adopted in this respect. In our view, such an initiative represents a far better approach to addressing the matter in a more practical and effective way than leaving it to be resolved on the basis of the demands of the debtors. It also has merit in view of the divergent views of the creditors themselves. We believe that, if carried out, this proposal would benefit the debtor countries by helping them implement their development projects, and would have a broad positive impact on economic and social activities in both creditor and debtor countries.\nSecondly, we call on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to reconsider their stringent conditions affecting States seeking development assistance from them. We call for amendments introducing greater flexibility and taking the humanitarian factor more into account, both to reflect differences among States and to suit the conditions prevailing in debtor nations. Ultimately, this would strengthen their development efforts. \nTherefore, we call for expansion and regulation of North-South scientific and technical assistance. Human resource development in this context is extremely important, for without it mathematical statistics lose much of their significance. Eventually, this will lead to concerted efforts at short-term and long-term conservation of natural and human resources. It will reinforce action to combat pollution and promote and expand development plans. Thus, science will be used once more as a tool for rehabilitation, construction and progress rather than as an instrument of destruction and decadence.\nThe inhabitants of the North and of the South are in fact brothers who just happen to live in different places; they all live within the framework of a single human family. Civilized co-operation is a most desirable -convergence of North and South and should presage the dawn of a new era of genuine universal brotherhood.\nIf some of us continue to speak of the natural resources of some countries in the South and to the world's oil producing areas, we must remember these basic facts; that oil is a non-renewable natural resource; that scientific research for alternatives to oil continues unabated; and that the use of oil is but one phase in the long history of energy. Therefore, the most promising hope for the oil-producing countries lies in the constant improvement of the scientific and technical capabilities of present and future generations, for true wealth is found in the human intellect, which lends itself to infinite expansion and refinement.\nThrough science and co-operation in the framework of a new international economic and humanitarian order, we all hope that with help from Allah the Almighty we shall be able to defeat poverty and starvation and shall be better prepared to confront changes in the physical world and to make increasing contributions towards global intellectual innovation. That is the real insurance policy for generations to come. \nAs we look forward to the establishment of a new economic and humanitarian order, it is the duty of us all to co-operate in combating the terrorism that has mushroomed in various places, regardless of its causes, methods or goals. Vie should work together to enforce proper effective legislation against terrorism so innocent human lives do not become a commodity subject to bargaining under threat or blackmail or in the context of unjust commercial transactions.\nWe in Kuwait are in the forefront of the community of nations when it corner to condemning terrorism. We have suffered from that plague and have managed, with the help of Allah the Almighty and with the solidarity of the Kuwaiti people, to withstand its evils. When a Kuwaiti civilian jetliner was hijacked last April, the international community rendered its support to us, which strengthened oar will and determination to weather the storm. We acknowledge that help with deep gratitude and appreciation.\nBut we must draw a clear line between oppressive terrorism carried out openly or covertly by individuals, groups and States on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the legitimate right to self-defence and national defence and resistance against suppression and oppression, as provided for in universal covenants and international law.\nThat brings me to the issue of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the most remarkable achievement of the United Nations system. But it is too often tarnished by acts of aggression. Therefore, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights must be scrupulously preserved and protected by the double power of conscience and the force of law.\nDespite all the efforts of the international community and the elaborate covenants adopted by the United Nations in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and despite the universal consensus on the need to promote human dignity, we still feel the presence in certain places of a force coming against the tide of history. This takes the form of attempts to usurp the rights of others and to commit unjust acts against them.\nThis has created problems that we hope will be justly resolved so human energy can be mobilized for co-operation and building rather than for waste and conflict.\nIt has been the lot of the Islamic world to see within its lands a number of burning crises, most recently the Iran-Iraq war, the question of Palestine, the internal strife within Lebanon and acts of aggression against it, and the problem of Afghanistan.\nThe world has welcomed the acceptance by the Islamic Republic of Iran of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which had been accepted earlier by sisterly Iraq, and the declaration of a cease-fire are the start of negotiations, which we hope will remain on course until all obstacles are cleared and the desired goals achieved. Resolution 598 (1987), in its paragraph 8, requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to examine, in consultation with the States of the region, measures to enhance the security and stability of the region. The Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf always welcomes co-operation with the United Nations, as well as with Iraq and Iran, to restore security and a just peace to the Gulf region and to ensure freedom of navigation for all. The Council is in constant touch with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, as well as with the patties concerned.\nThe eight-year war, with all its sacrifices, has provided yet another proof that no matter how long hostilities might last, the belligerents will eventually have no option but coexistence, good-neighbourliness and co-operation in promoting life, while showing respect for the national sovereignty and independence of every State, and for the system of government it has chosen for itself. The peace sought warrants sincere efforts, free of any side issues that cannot be substantiated by concrete evidence, for to raise such side issues would be to create obstacles that would impede the long-awaited peace for which we have all been yearning and divert attention from the acts of aggression committed against a defenceless people by the Israeli entity in utter disregard of human rights and international norms and instruments.\nThe Palestinian uprising, with all the suffering involved and its noble goals, is a subject of daily discussion in the international mass media. The Palestinians are defending their land right there on their own soil: they did not leave their homes to fight against anyone. The Palestinian uprising represents the 40-yeat-long pursuit of a legitimate right.\nI now address peoples and friends represented in this Hall, and ask them: did you not fight for your independence and drive invading armies out of your  territory? Did you not engage in secret and open resistance and attain your independence by virtue of your valour? Is it then surprising that youth, women and children with virtually nothing at their disposal but the mere stones of their land should use them to demand their legitimate rights and to reject life in their homeland under Israeli oppression and brutalities?\nAll the Palestinian people is demanding is its independent state on its own land, with its capital in Jerusalem, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), its sole legitimate representative.\nAll sitting in this Hall have a homeland and a house to live in. We all carry passports and know where to be safe following our meetings here; we all look forward to being happy with our families at the end of the day. The Palestinian people demands nothing more than we all have.\nI should like to put on record our appreciation for the position taken by the European Community on the Middle East problem. The Community's approach is based on dialogue with all the peace-seeking parties. Accordingly, the socialist group within the European Community invited brother Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the PLO, to address the European Parliament early this month. It also provided him with an opportunity to meet and deliberate with senior Community officials.\nIt is our hope that, similarly, fresh and favourable winds will blow across the Atlantic Ocean and reach the New World, which we hope will be able to pay more heed to the righteous Palestinian voice and to demonstrate open-mindedness and tolerance in dialogue with Palestinian intellectuals and legitimate representatives, and to express in stronger terms its condemnation of the Israeli atrocities against the Palestinians. We look forward to the time when fie issue of human rights is raised to its proper status, when human rights are a haven built on solved cock and not subject to election campaigns and promises made in pursuit of victory in an election year - promises made even at the expense of justice for other peoples and their right to self-determination.\nFrance gave as a gift to the New World the Statue of Liberty, which stands as a symbol of hope for newcomers, We hope the torch atop that statue will continue to burn in the minds and hearts of men and women and not lose its lustre by becoming a mere historic site lacking real meaning as a source of inspiration.\nWith regard to Lebanon, one of the bitter results of the Israeli invasion of that land is the current turbulent situation there, which has fuelled violent religious, factional and regional conflicts.\nThe wholesome life of our brothers and sisters in Lebanon stands no chance of continuity without national unity and coexistence among all Lebanese factions. Lebanon's future must be determined entirely by the Lebanese themselves. The occupation forces of the Israeli entity must withdraw from the Lebanese territory they occupy under the pretext of security invoked to justify any act of aggression and expansion.\nIf some positive steps have been taken towards resolution of the Afghanistan issue, the compliance by all parties concerned with the terms and conditions of the agreement reached represents the right approach and will guarantee a safer and more secure future in which the people of Afghanistan will determine their way of life and the nature of their relations with their neighbours, of their own free will and without pressure from outside.\nIn the same spirit we welcome the recent steps taken in Namibia and Angola, We hope that the efforts being made will be sustained until Namibia attains free and independent statehood under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), \nThe Pretoria Government, however, continues to live under the illusion of racial superiority that has been unanimously condemned by the scientific and religious communities, as well as by international organizations that defend freedom of conscience against injustices and gross violations of human rights of the kind committed by Pretoria.\nThe repulsive racial discrimination laws currently enforced by the Government of South Africa flout the dignity of the African person in his native homeland and deny him his historic and de facto rights. The body of apartheid laws must be annulled. We maintain that legitimate rights must sooner or later be attained.\nAt this point we should like to join all those throughout the world calling for the freedom of the African national Leader Nelson Mandela, who valiantly struggles for the right of his fellow countrymen to achieve national dignity, and for that reason suffers oppression and the harshness of gaol.\nFrom this rostrum, we salute that hero and other freedom fighters everywhere in the world\u201d. We want to reassure them and to tell them of our confidence that there will be a better tomorrow and the sun of freedom will shine, and vicious oppressors will never stop that from happening.\nIt is our hope that stability will prevail in South-East Asia and between the two Koreas, as well as in the Caribbean region, and that East and West, North and South will work together to build the desired economic and humanitarian system.\nRegardless of the origins of the regional conflicts I have mentioned, it is the human being who ignites the spark of war. It is also the human being who is the fuel of war. In the final analysis, war represents the ultimate violation of human rights. Thus, ending any war represents a major victory for the cause of those rights. \nI have come here to convey to the Assembly greetings of peace from over 1,000 million Moslems living in all corners of the globe. We come extending a hand of brotherhood in the hope that present and future generations of mankind will enjoy increased prosperity, harmony, co-operation and peace.\nEach and every large human community, Muslim or otherwise, has its own problems and its awn aspirations. We have come here to co-operate with members in addressing our common problems and in seeking fulfilment of our common aspirations.\nIn conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the General Assembly and the Security Council for all the resolutions and decisions they have adopted in order to reaffirm legitimate rights and to open doors to reconciliation and peace.\nTo you, Mr. President, and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his staff, we should like to express our thanks and appreciation for all the efforts that have been made and continue to be made in the interest of peace and for the settlement of conflicts and disputes by means of wisdom and dialogue.\nTribute is also due to the world mass media for focusing attention on human-rights issues. Special mention should be made of the media's live coverage of the Palestinian uprising and the resistance to racial discrimination in South Africa.\nTo all distinguished representatives and guests present here, I should like to extend thanks on behalf of the Islamic world and in the name of Kuwait and in my own name for their kind attention.\nMay I ask all members to convey to their respective Governments and peoples our sincere greetings and appreciation.\nI, for my part, shall convey to my people in the Islamic and Arab world, as well as in Kuwait, the sentiments of friendship and welcome I have received from you. God bless you and may He bring peace, mercy and grace upon all of you.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, I am delivering this statement on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malta Mr. Vincent Tabone. Unfortunately unforeseen circumstances did not permit my Foreign Minister to be in New York at this time and he has requested me to convey his sincere regret for not being able to deliver this address in person as he had intended.\nAlthough I am addressing the General Assembly late in the course of the general debate  my congratulations to you on being elected to the presidency of the Assembly are no less warm and genuine than those of all the preceding speakers. Your excellent credentials  your vast experience in the field of international diplomacy as well as your skill and leadership assure us of a fruitful session. Our appreciation and thanks go also to the outgoing President,\nMr. Peter Florin, the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Ger roan Democratic Republic, for the way he led the Assembly during the past 12 months.\nA year ago the Prime Minister of Malta, in his first address to this General Assembly, confirmed Malta's confidence \\\"in the role that the United Nations has to play in the maintenance of peace in the world, the enhancement of security for each and every Member State, the substitution of dialogue and negotiations for armed conflict, and the encouragement of co-operation at all levels and across the barriers of race, ideology, size, power and wealth for the welfare of mankind.\\\" (A/42/PV.32, p. 58)\nTwelve months later we can look on the intervening period as one in which the United Nations has demonstrated as never before that it is capable of rising to the expectations that its founders placed in it. As we speak of the organization we should not lose sight of the fact that we are, by and large, speaking about its Member States, because the Organization is what we make it. Many things have changed over the recent past and each one, in its own way, may have had an effect on the improved situation. But when all is said and done it is not the Organization or the world around it that has changed but our perception, our values, our confidence, our readiness to stretch out our hands to help each other. There is no reason why we should look back. The more we put into this Organization by way of support and faithfulness, the more we get out of the United Nations.\nI would be failing in my duty if I were not to underline the indefatigable efforts of our Secretary-General, Me. Javier Perez de Cuellar, to ensure that the efforts of the United Nations for peace bear fruit. We refused to be daunted by the difficulties in front of him, and his perseverance and faith in the goodwill of negotiators succeeded in several instances which had defied solution over very long years. The greatest tribute and thanks that we can render him is to facilitate his task through greater co-operation and trust among each other.\nIt was therefore very apt that the United Nations peace-keeping forces should become the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize this year. The role of these forces usually remains unsung, but their very silent performance is their very strength. It is well that we should be reminded that there are States and people facing risks in areas of conflict which are not their own - that is, looking from a very narrow geographic point of view, for after all we all live in the same world and there is hardly any conflict that may not engulf other bystanders.\nEven in moments such as this, when we share our satisfaction at the role of the United Nations and its peace-keeping forces, we cannot but be reminded that there are still many areas where peace does not reign as yet. The military United Nations peace-keeping force has still to be replaced by stronger and more lasting forces forged across the negotiating table in the realization that it is in the common interest of our peoples to arrive at solutions peacefully.\nMy Government does not miss an opportunity to stress the common responsibility in this respect of all States, and to urge that all our actions and public pronouncements should have as their end the drawing together of peoples, the solution to conflicts, the generation of co-operation. We cannot, with a sense of responsibility, concentrate on condemnations, accusations and negative pronouncements which tend to heighten tension and stiffen attitudes rather than bring together the parties that roust live together in peace.\nThe developments in the international situation over the recent past should encourage all of us to have more faith in the process of negotiation. This Assembly has heard over and over again of these positive developments and I need not go into great detail. I shall simply list them because the list is indeed impressive, especially when compared with the failures of the past. We note the Geneva accords on Afghan is tan \u0163 the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq and the start to a negotiated peace the agreement on the implementation of a peace plan for Western Sahara; the renewed inter-communal talks in which the encouraging movements towards the implementation of the independence plan for Namibia; the rapprochement among the parties involved in the Kampuchea question; the positive measures taken by the parties concerned in New Caledonia; the opening of new avenues of peace between Chad and Libya; and the declarations from both sides in favour of the reunification of Korea. Even in southern Africa there seem to be the first indications of a movement towards a change.\nBut, of course, the agreement between the United States of America and the Soviet Union which heralded the first steps in the dismantling of the iv nuclear arsenals, the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - was without a doubt the most significant success which has encouraged all to realize that with goodwill, perseverance and mutual confidence what had been considered impossible becomes possible after all. We note with satisfaction that these two nations have not stopped at that point but, encouraged by what they have achieved, have embarked on further negotiations aimed at more significant reductions in their nuclear arsenal.\nThese positive developments have not been mentioned by the various speakers without a sense of realism that makes us all aware that there are still problems, very serious ones, that still defy solution in spite of efforts from a number of well-meaning sources. The reasons for failure may be several, but if we analyse them we are sure to find that they do not differ essentially from the same reasons that held back progress and solutions on those problems where we are now registering success. It is attitudes that have to change.\nEarlier this year we had the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament, which held high promise of success - and indeed consensus was readied on some very important issues. However, on other issues, such as the arms race in outer space, disarmament and development, zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones, no agreement could be readied. What was gained during that special session should not be allowed to evaporate; on the contrary, it should be preserved and developed end exploited in the hope that it will lead to agreement on a wider area. Malta made its studied contribution to that session and I need not go over the same ground at length.\nI would, however, stress that we should not be carried away by slogans and Clich\u00e9s but should remember at the same time that since the last world war any number of regional conflicts have been fought with conventional and not nuclear weapons, and that these have wrought havoc and death and caused tidal waves of human refugees  Let- not the awesome fear of a nuclear holocaust make us insensitive to the threat of other weapons. Disarmament must be all-embracing and balanced to ensure the security of all, where zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones become credible and meaningful.\nAs an island State Malta cannot but pay special attention to the seas around us and the weapon systems that proliferate therein. It is with the aim of maintaining a balance that we urge that disarmament and confidence- and security-building measures should not be limited to the land masses only. We are not alone in stressing this point and we expect that due attention will be given to this aspect in international disarmament forums. No statement could possibly do justice to all the issues that are of interest to all Member States of the United Nations, and I shall definitely not try to do so. On the other hand, no statement would be complete without a reference to two problem areas that have been facing us for far too long without any real progress towards their solution. These are the question of apartheid in South Africa and the constant turmoil in the Middle East, where the Palestinians are still without a homeland of their own. Can the world, can the people in these areas, go on living in these conditions of strife, deprivation and death? Do we expect the deprived ones to accept with good grace the conditions imposed on them? Is there anyone who can really believe that in this era of awakened awareness of human rights a solution is possible without due regard to the cries of those who do not enjoy full rights in their own homeland? A change of attitude of the mind is required, a change which needs courage, foresight and faith, change as momentous as that which made the INF Treaty possible.\nThis year this Organization is commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It would therefore be appropriate if we reaffirmed the pledge made 40 years ago, that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and worked with greater vigour to put that noble principle into practice for all peoples throughout the world. \nLife is precious, but the quality of life is of no less importance. When one speaks of the quality of life one's mind may focus on a number of issues, but one which is very likely to be prominent is the degradation of the rational human being through an irrational dependence on dangerous or debilitating drugs. The international community recognized this danger long ago, and we have within the United Nations system the International Narcotics Control Board and a long-standing Convention to control the use of drugs. Regrettably, the abuse of drugs and illicit drug trafficking have become more widespread and are closely linked with international crime. The forthcoming Vienna conference of plenipotentiaries convened to adopt a new Convention against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is therefore timely and important.\nDevelopment leading to better economic performance and an improvement in the way of life are generally acknowledged as valid national aims, which, however, can best be realized through international co-operation. There are still great inequalities between States and, let us admit it, within States. The reasons are numerous and spread in all directions. Any attempt to, reduce the complicated interplay in the world economy to simple stereotyped clich\u00e9s is unrealistic; worse still, it is ineffective in offering a solution to those in need. The United Nations can also play a constructive role in this respect, especially through the intergovernmental agencies that deal with specialized economic and social human activity. National interests are bound to feature prominently in negotiations within these bodies, and, since intransigence at such meetings rarely leads to dramatic consequences like those in the field of security. State representatives tend to become less accommodating.\nEven here a change of mind, a change of attitude, is called for. After the Second World War a far-sighted United States of America realized that a destroyed Europe could only breed strife and discontent. It realized that a healthy Europe could be a partner in economic development, and the Marshall Plan came into being. Everyone knows what a huge success the Plan turned out to be, to the benefit of both the donor and the recipient countries and to the world economy as a whole. Today the same situation can be said to apply with the developed countries on one side and the developing countries on the other. Stagnation in the world economy brings us all down, while the stimulus of actively developing economies presents opportunities to all. On the problem of massive national debts such an awareness is emerging, but there are other spheres where greater and more efficient international co-operation could alleviate the plight of developing States, to the benefit of economic development In general. Restrictions and other protective measures should be used sparingly.\nThe United Nations Development Programme is one very effective vehicle in the promotion of economic and social development. Malta has benefited from the Programme, and we are grateful for this. We urge that the funds at the disposal of the Programme be increased and that the criteria for establishing the national indicative planning figures be less tied to the criterion of gross national product per capita, which can be grossly misleading.\nMany previous speakers have raised the question, in one way or another, whether economic development is compatible with the maintenance of a good quality of life. The fact that the question is being raised with greater frequency at national and international levels is an indication that development has, at times, led to a degradation in the quality of life. Often this was done without a full realization of the consequences. : As we come to understand the world around us better, and to appreciate nature's precarious balance, we come to realize that not all so-called progress is an unmixed blessing. \nThis is a new challenge to the world community, one which is gaining urgency as we realize that our environment is being adversely affected by human activity. It is unrealistic to expect that the solution lies in returning to the old days which are sometimes described in idyllic but incorrect terms. Many of the problems we face today have grown with us over the past decades. They grew as national policies were evolved either with an imprecise appreciation of the consequences or in a short-sighted assessment that the consequences could be blown away, literally, flushed down the drain, metaphorically, or buried - in someone else's back garden.\nThis is an area where, hopefully   traditional rivalries and groupings will not interfere in international co-operative efforts. The Mediterranean Action Plan, which grew out of the Barcelona Convention drawn up under the aegis of the United Nations Environment Programme; has demonstrated that human awareness can overcome political limitations. The Mediterranean Sea does not belong to any single State or group of countries, or indeed to the Mediterranean people alone. It belongs to all of us, and the onus falls mainly on the coastal States to ensure that it remains a healthy living resource for the benefit of them all. Other States which ply this sea or use it in one way or another, or affect its environment through discharges or activities which may initiate well beyond its shores, have the obligation to respect the concern expressed by the people in the area and to co-operate to the maximum extent possible. \nI do not speak of the Mediterranean because it is a special area. It happens to be the area where Malta is situated; an area where the countries of the region are more actively involved in co-operative efforts to preserve the environment; an area which is of direct interest to many States outside the region; in short, an area which Illustrates the issues involved and indicates the way of co-operation at the regional level and beyond. Other regions are similarly placed. \nSometimes the problem which faces us is of even greater dimensions, where we have to think more in global than regional terms. Climate, or, rather, the way in which human activity can affect changes in the world climate in general, with consequences for the life we lead, the food we grow, the land we inhabit, the air we breathe, the light and warmth we need - all this is the concern of the human race as a whole. The problem itself is too big to be tackled piecemeal by individual nations. It is for this reason that Malta proposed that a new item be put on the agenda for consideration at this session of the General Assembly, and the fact that the proposal was unanimously accepted as a matter of urgency demonstrates that there is an awareness of the problem. In fact, there are already initiatives under way, and one cannot fail to mention the work of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme within the framework of the United Nations system. There are also other national and international initiatives, especially at the scientific level, and we have had the formidable report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Brundtland of Norway, which has rightly been praised by several speakers as a most important contribution to the issue before us.\nThe title of the new agenda item, \\\"Declaration proclaiming climate as part of the common heritage of mankind\\\", reflects the vastness of the problem and its importance to the human race, and indicates the positive action envisaged. Since the item will soon be discussed in detail, this is not the time to elaborate or to propose solutions. My delegation would only underline the need for as broad a study of the problem as is possible, given the resources of the United Nations, the intergovernmental agencies and other international and national specialized institutions, and the need for drawing up a co-ordinated plan of action which will serve as a guide to all of us in a co-operative action which will make national efforts more effective for the benefit of all mankind. This should not be a dream, it should be stark reality for ourselves, but more so for future generations. Past generations and civilizations have grown and died, some literally buried in sands where lushness existed before. Those people may not have realized what was going on and ascribed their fate to unfriendly gods. Today we know more - though we should be humble enough to admit that there is still more to be learned. We know at least that the gods that cause such dislocation as past generations experienced nay well be found not in heaven or Hades but here on Earth amongst us.\nOne cannot speak of future climatic changes that could affect our lives without a reference to the spate of unusual natural disasters that have afflicted so many parts of the world in recent months, with grave consequences to the people who have become victims to these forces that dwarf human efforts. Floods, winds, droughts, storms, earthquakes - all took their toll. The world as a whole is required to help not only to make good the damage and to rehabilitate life, but more effectively to understand the cause of such disasters and to prevent them or to minimize as much as possible the effects of such natural phenomena. We are convinced that efforts in the field of conservation of climate will produce side benefits which will also apply to situations such as these.\nOur attention is often drawn to problems, conflicts and disasters that make us forget that there are also positive developments that require equal attention and encouragement. Most speakers - and I myself - have made reference to some major positive developments, but permit me to put cm record a few other, perhaps more modest developments with which Malta is more directly concerned.\nAs a participating State in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), Malta continues to co-operate with all the 34 member States, but more particularly with the participating neutral and non-aligned States on whom falls the unenviable task of trying to reconcile the initial distant views and interests of the other States without forgetting that they themselves have particular interests to safeguard. We are convinced that a positive end to the Vienna follow-up conference is now in sight. That should usher in a substantial programme of action that should consolidate co-operation and security, not only on the continent of Europe and the seas and regions immediately surrounding it, but in an even broader area as tensions and suspicion subside.\nIn the wider area of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries Malta is pleased to note that a wind of change is blowing that takes into account the changing international scene, where the traditional military-bloc confrontation is giving way to a realization that the common will calls for more co-operation than confrontation. The non-aligned countries of the world, whether members of the Movement or not, have a constructive and supportive role to play in this connection. All our efforts, all our pronouncements and our behaviour, should encourage this trend towards detente.\nThe Commonwealth is another group of nations that can - and does - contribute to greater international understanding and peace. Malta is pleased to participate in Commonwealth training programmes for students and refugees from Namibia and South Africa and proudly continues to offer scholarships for that purpose in its educational institutions. Conscious that out main resources are in the human field, we seek ways in which we can exploit them to our benefit and that of the international community. Earlier this year, following up the initiative taken by Malta in the United Nations on the question of aging, we opened in Malta the United Nations International Institute on Aging. We were gratified to welcome the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuelar, on that occasion, thus further strengthening the agreement signed on 9 October 1987 between the Prime Minister of Malta and the United Nations Secretary-General.\nOn Saturday, 8 October 1988, the International Maritime law Institute was officially established in Malta. On that occasion we had the honour to receive His Excellency Chandrika P. Srivastava, Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which has given its name and sponsorship to that initiative. The Secretary-General of the IMO, in officially declaring the Institute open, explained that the Institute would fill a void that has long been felt for the training of lawyers from developing countries in international maritime law.\nIn accordance with articles 276 and 277 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Government of Malta has taken the initiative of proposing the establishment, in Malta, of a Mediterranean centre for research and development in marine industrial technology, which would strengthen the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Malta already acts as host to the IMO Regional Oil Combating Centre. Both initiatives would bring together the resources of developed and developing countries for the benefit of all in the field of the transfer of science and technology. One of the most important decisions taken by the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth at their October 1987 meeting at Vancouver was the creation of a new Commonwealth institution to promote co-operation in distance education. Malta has offered facilities concentrating on marine studies and the problems of small States  and that offer has been accepted.\nAs a European country, Malta plays a role in that region as well. I have already referred to Malta's role in the region. At this moment it is also offering its services as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe. That task came at a propitious moment when that Council is giving more attention to greater co-operation and dialogue with European States that do not yet meet the criteria set up by the Council of Europe. The concept of a united Europe that stretches to the Urals is one in which Malta believes, and we will not lose any opportunity to explore avenues that could bring it nearer to realization.\nIn the meanwhile the process of closer co-operation and unity cannot be stopped  and Malta seeks to follow the natural course open to its that of strengthening its links with the European Economic Community. Within a few months the Government of Malta has cleared the deck of the accumulated debris that had stood in its way. That is not an end in itself  but a preparatory step for the next logical one namely an application for full membership in the Community. \nThat  in brief is the road of international co-operation that Malta has followed in the last few months. As a small island State in a sea that has seen the rise of one Power after another  Powers both military and cultural  we cannot but be aware of our openness and vulnerability. We believe that only unity and friendship can safeguard the peace that is necessary for development  for ordered development that does not overlook the quality of life. The task ahead is not easy  but we would submit that if the determination effort and sacrifice that most nations are willing to make in time of war, when the threat facing them is more dramatic, were to be directed with equal energy towards the pursuit of peace, we would be able to take the great strides that are required to make the difficult easy and the impossible possible.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt gives me pleasure to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Our pleasure is all the greater in view of the good relations between our two countries. We are fully confident that he will meet with success in conducting the proceedings of the General Assembly at this session, which faces many vital issues of concern to the international community.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation of the efforts of his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, who so efficiently conducted the proceedings of the previous session with all of its important achievements.\nSince 1980, our delegation has kept the General Assembly informed of developments with regard to the expansionist war of aggression that the Iranian regime imposed on Iraq. Every time we spoke from this rostrum, we stressed our desire for peace, our readiness for\u00b7 peace and our resolute determination to achieve peace as strongly as we stressed our determination to continue the legitimate defence of our country's sovereignty, security, dignity and right to live a free and dignified life.\nFinally, after eight years of imposed war, with all that that has entailed in terms of costly sacrifice in human life and in ruin and destruction, we find ourselves today at the beginning of the road to peace. The international community is no doubt interested in the negotiations that started on 25 August 1988 with a view to achieving peace  it is closely following their progress and their prospects. To do so with any degree of accuracy, however, it is necessary to review the background of recent events. \nSecurity Council resolution 598 (1987) was adopted on 20 July 1987. Iraq officially welcomed the resolution just two days after its adoption. We stressed our willingness to implement it in good faith based upon our firm position of principle and desire for peace. \nThe Iranian regime, on the other hand, did not accept the resolution. It followed a policy of manoeuvring, dilatory tactics and procrastination. It devised such means of expressing its position on the solution as had been unprecedented in the history of dealing with Security Council resolutions. The intention was to cover up its actual rejection of the resolution, to justify its insistence on continuing the war against Iraq and on maintaining its policies of aggression against the countries of the region. In spite of the adoption of a resolution which expressed the will of the international community to establish peace, the Iranian regime continued to launch one military attack after another against Iraq. It occupied more Iraqi territory as well as an Iraqi city. Official statements by Iranian leaders confirmed the designs to enshrine the occupation and the insistence on the continuation of war and aggression. The Iranian regime continued to use the term \\\"liberation\\\" to describe the occupation. Operations they had conducted, thus confirming their ambitious designs on Iraq. The Iranian regime continued its acts of aggression against the countries of the region by carrying out military attacks on Kuwait, by threatening Saudi Arabia and other countries of the region, and by continuing to threaten freedom of navigation and attack neutral shipping. \nThen came the turning-point. Our armed forces succeeded in liberating the Fao Peninsula from Iranian occupation in April of this year. This was followed shortly afterwards by the liberation of East Basrah, Shalamja, the Majnoon Islands, and the Zubeidat area. These valiant defensive military operations broke the back of Iranian aggression, and the Iranian regime's scheme against Iraq and the Arab Gulf States was frustrated. The illusions harboured by the Iranian regime to impose hegemony over the region vanished and its leaders reaped with their own hands the bitter harvest of their policies of aggression which were so opposed to the logic of history, to the values of the times and to the principles and rules governing international relations. It was in these circumstances of crushing military defeat that the leaders of Iran announced their acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) on 18 July 1988.\nIn spite of this fact, we dealt with the situation on the basis of our position of principle inspired by a desire for peace, and our actions were prompted by realistic considerations as well as ,by considerations of principle. With a view to taking the best course of action to achieve peace, I proposed in my letter of 20 July 1988 to the Secretary-General that direct official talks should be held between authorized representative5>of the two sides under the auspices of the Secretary-General in order to discuss and implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987).\nThis proposal was inspired by good faith and the pragmatic desire to ascertain directly the Iranian understanding of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) once the Iranian regime put forward contradictory interpretations of the resolution which were alien to the letter and spirit of it as well as to the concepts of international law and the rules governing relations between States in modern times.\nIt was Iraq's legitimate right to ascertain directly the true position of Iran. Any impartial observer who has followed the positions taken by the Iranian regime over the 10 years of its existence will have realized that the aims and slogans of the rulers of Iran have their basis in expansionism, aggression and ambitious designs, and will confirm that they do not believe in international law and the rules governing relations between States in our time. That is why the Iranian regime has rejected all resolutions and initiatives with regard to peace, from the very first resolution adopted by the Security Council on 28 July 1980 and for a whole year after the adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), It has even rejected the principle of the peaceful settlement of the conflict and of the jurisdiction of the United Nations and other international organizations in the matter,. It was necessary, therefore, to ascertain the true intentions of the Iranian leaders in accepting Security Council resolution 598 (1987) \u0163. for in accepting the resolution, Iranian leaders nay not have in mind belief in achieving a comprehensive and durable peace based on mutual respect for sovereignty, non-intervention in internal affairs and observance of the rules of international law in relations with Iraq and with the countries of the region. Serious suspicions with regard to the Iranian position are aroused by statements made by Iranian leaders to explain their decision to accept Security Council resolution 598 (1987).\nThe speeches and statements of the Iranian leaders have been full of references to compelling circumstances and to a predicament; the nature and causes of which they cannot disclose. They have talked with sorrow and disappointment about being forced to accept Security Council resolution 598 (1987). On the other hand, the Iraqi people and other peoples of the region have expressed their joy at the cease-fire because of their belief in peace as a way of life. All these facts, taken together, led Iraq to call for direct negotiations with a view to discussing face to face the steps towards peace and the concept of peace. This position is not intended as a condition, since direct negotiations do not constitute a unilateral advantage for Iraq at the expense of Iran.\nIn any case, in response to the desire of the international community for a speedy end to hostilities, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq announced on 6 August 1988 that Iraq was prepared to accept a cease-fire if Iran officially announced, with unambiguous clarity, its agreement to enter into direct negotiations immediately after the cease-fire so that we might discuss, reach agreement on, and implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987).\nFollowing this historic announcement, which expresses the true character of Iraq's position and its sincere wish for peace, intensive contacts were made with the Secretary-General. On 8 August 1988, agreement was readied on the announcing of a date for the cease-fire. Agreement was also reached on the date, the bases and the objectives of the direct negotiations to be held between the two parties under the auspices of the Secretary-General, to that date, the Secretary-General addressed to the permanent representatives of the two countries a letter which I shall quote in full because of its importance for the events which ensued: \\\"Excellency, \\\"In pursuance of the official contact I had with Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, I should like to inform you that both Governments have agreed that direct talks between their Foreign Ministers shall be held under ray auspices, immediately after the establishment of the cease-fire, in order to reach a common understanding of the other provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the procedures and timings for their implementation.\\\"\nThis outline of the sequence of events will make it clear that the two parties readied agreement, through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, on setting a date for the cease-fire before there was full agreement on all provisions pertaining thereto. The cease-fire did actually take effect on 20 August in the form of the cessation of the shooting, and United Nations observers took up their positions before the detailed provisions and legal obligations relating to the cease-fire had been determined through the agreement of the two parties with the United Nations, It was only natural that the question should be taken up in the Geneva negotiations with a view to consolidating the cease-fire through a clear, definite understanding between the two parties under the auspices of the United Nations and then afterwards they would turn to discussing the other provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987),\nAgainst this factual background, we began the direct negotiations in Geneva. In those negotiations Iraq demanded that the provisions and obligations of the cease-fire measures should be made clear and unambiguous so as to prevent different interpretations of them in the course of their future implementation and to ensure that the cease-fire would be a permanent state and constitute a sure step towards comprehensive and lasting peace. \u00b7Iraq also demanded that these provisions and obligations, when implemented on land, in the air and at sea, should ensure equal benefits for the two parties since that would provide a guarantee for the enforcement of the cease-fire.\nOn this just and sincere basis, Iraq called for the inclusion of a clear provision on the principle of unobstructed freedom of navigation in international waters in the Arab Gulf and in the Straits of Hormuz for all shipping. This position of ours is based on the text of the Security Council resolution, which demands that a cease-fire be observed and that all military action on land, at sea and in the air be discontinued as a first step towards a negotiated settlement. We also base our position on the rule of balance of benefits. It is inconceivable that the provisions and obligations relating to the two sides should be detailed on land and in the air in such a manner as to ensure a balance of benefits for both parties, while at sea they should be impaired by a defect which tends to realize an advantage for Iran at the expense of Iraq because of Iran's geographic situation in the Arab Gulf and the Hormuz Straits.\nIraq also proposed that the United Nations be entrusted with clearing the Shatt-al-Arab and ensuring safe navigation therein, without prejudice to the legal status of the river.\nThe Shatt-al-Arab is Iraq's only outlet to the high seas. On account of the quantity of obstructions to navigation which have accumulated therein over the war years, the clearing operations will take a long time and will require the services of international experts and the availability of international funds. Since negotiations aimed at the achievement of a comprehensive and lasting peace and the solution of all outstanding issues between the two parties may take a not inconsiderable time, it stands to reason that advantage should be taken of that time to render the Shatt-al-Arab navigable.\nThese are the only two demands that Iraq made in the negotiations which took place in Geneva between 25 August and 13 September 1988. The Iranian conduct in the Geneva negotiations, however, has been characterized by evasiveness and has not conformed to what is right and just.\nWith regard to freedom of navigation in international waters in the Arab Gulf and the Hormuz Straits, the Iranian delegation alleged a right to control free navigation there through its claim to a right of search on the basis of interpretations which do not conform in any way to the collective security system as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, and which disagree with both the letter and the spirit of resolution 598 (1987) and its objective of a comprehensive and lasting peace. It is clear that the interpretation maintained by the Iranian side is conceived in terms of a truce rather than in terms of the cease-fire being only a first step towards settlement, as provided by paragraph 1 of the resolution. This has increased our suspicions with regard to the intentions of the Iranian regime and its true aims in accepting resolution 598 (1987).\nThis suspicious position on the part of the Iranian delegation was followed by its insistence on provisions which impose a de facto arms embargo on Iraq at sea. Then Iran started to spread lies to the effect that Iraq was asking for free navigation in Iranian territorial waters, whereas the Iraqi demand was quite clear in calling for free navigation in international waters and through the Hormuz Straits. Furthermore, the Iranian delegation rejected the proposal that the United Nations undertake clearing operations in the Shatt-al-Arab at this stage and began to impose conditions inspired by a desire to blackmail and manoeuvre.\nIraq's demand that provision for free navigation and clearing operations in the Shatt-al-Arab be included in the cease-fire arrangements is nothing new. Iraq has taken this position and confirmed it repeatedly since our acceptance of resolution 598 (1987). We included that demand in our letter of acceptance of the resolution on 22 July 1987, and we confirmed the demand in the letter sent by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq on 6 August 1988, which paved the way for agreement on a cease-fire. We also confirmed it in two letters addressed to the Secretary-General, one on 20 July 1988, following Iran's acceptance of the resolution, and the other on 11 August 1988, after the date for the cease-fire had been set, prior to the Geneva negotiations. Iran's allegation that Iraq has imposed pre-conditions in the Geneva negotiations is a pure lie and deception. What we have demanded is documented in official letters, which have been circulated as part of the records of the Security Council. What we have demanded is just, legitimate and in conformity with the letter and the spirit of resolution 598 (1987) and its objective, namely, a comprehensive, lasting and just peace.\nThe international community and this Organization are called upon to make a true and fair evaluation of the respective positions taken in respect of the Geneva negotiations. Who is presenting legitimate and logical demands and propositions which are in conformity with the objective of peace, and who is engaging in evasiveness and in attempts to manipulate texts, and wants the situation to remain undecided?\nIraq's wish to reach a peaceful, comprehensive, just and durable settlement of the conflict with Iran is nothing new. This was our position when the war was imposed on us on 4 September 1980 and during the events which preceded and followed that date. Iraq continued to hold firmly to this position throughout the eight years of the conflict. Iraq dealt with the international Organization seriously and sincerely and accepted its resolutions in all circumstances, regardless of the developments of the military situation, beginning with resolution 479 (1980), of 28 July 1980, through the latest resolution of the Security Council, namely, resolution 598 (1987) which Iraq accepted immediately after it was adopted.\nWe confirm our desire and determination to implement resolution 598 (1987) in good faith, to move forward on the road to a comprehensive and lasting peace and to abide by the principles which govern peaceful and good-neighbourly relations between the countries of the world, particularly contiguous countries, in our time. \nWhile intent on the peace process and the achievement of the objectives sought by the international community in adopting resolution 598 (1987), we must take into account a number of substantive questions if the peace is to be durable, comprehensive and just and if the region as a whole is to return to a state of peace and stability and continue to play its positive role in the international community.\nThe primary point, which we must always keep in mind, is that the Iranian regime did not accept resolution 598 (1987) willingly and voluntarily as a result of a deep, firm understanding of the necessity for a state of peace with Iraq and the countries of the region. It accepted the resolution only because of a crushing military defeat and in the context of a struggle for power inside Iran. While it is necessary to emphasize the opportunity provided by the cease-fire, all steps towards the implementation of resolution 598 (1987) should be well studied and well balanced so as to form the basis for the attainment of the objective of comprehensive and lasting peace. Any action that might undermine any of these elements would only encourage those who have made war their paramount cause and taken it upon themselves as their sole task to avoid abiding by the requirements of peace.\nOn the basis of this conception of the true meaning of peace, resolution 598 (1937) should not be regarded as merely a string of timings and procedures. Timings and procedures are necessary for the implementation of the resolution: there is no disagreement on that point. But what is more important is to reach common agreement on the meaning of the resolution, which may facilitate the achievement of lasting peace between the two sides, rather than to make of the resolution and the way it is to be implemented a political, as opposed to a Military, battleground. In the light of these facts, the best way to achieve understanding is to allow the two sides the opportunity to engage in direct negotiations, however prolonged such negotiations might be.\nThe role of the Security Council and the Secretariat is necessary and vital, and should be a part of the peace process from beginning to end. That role, however, must never be played at the expense of understanding between the two parties, because it is the two parties which will assume the responsibility of regulating their relations now and in the future.\nAny pressures, whether created by political means or through the information media, that might disturb the atmosphere in which the negotiations are being conducted would not serve the cause of peace and could only be an expression of either misguided efforts or premeditated designs. We must refer here to the campaign launched against Iraq and timed to coincide with the beginning of the negotiations at Geneva. Zionist circles, which have allied themselves with the Iranian regime throughout the war years and have used all means to ensure continuation of the war, which is considered a gain for Israel - those are the circles that are at the root of the false allegations spread against Iraq. We hope that those peace-loving States that have nothing to do with the motives and aims of those designs will not allow themselves to be lured into the snares of those who have planned that malicious campaign. The aim of such campaigns is to encourage the Iranian regime to refrain from fully abiding by the requirements of peace and peaceful coexistence with Iraq and the countries of the region, as well as to encourage it to reject what is right and rational.\nThose who have planned the campaigns have imagined that they could impose on Iraq an atmosphere of pressure and isolation that would force it to abandon its firm stand on its just and legitimate demands and to accept feeble solutions under pressure. They are only deluding themselves. Iraq is an independent State and enjoys complete independence in all fields, political, economic, social or military. Iraq cannot accept pressure from any quarter, especially now that its people have defended its cultural heritage, its humanitarian aspirations and its gains in a war that was imposed upon it, a war that has lasted for eight years, doing so through reliance on its own resources and its belief in the justice of its cause - peace.\nAmong the roost important foundations for the building of a just and comprehensive peace are the basing of relations between the countries of the region on equality and mutual respect and abandonment of ambitious designs and illegitimate privileges acquired through the use or threat of force, as well as abandonment of positions, tendencies and policies predicated on expansionism, on the implementation of hegemony, on aggression against others and interference in their affairs. Without those foundations there can be no real peace. Peace will remain a transient, nominal state in which matters stay quiet for a while only to explode into conflicts again.\nWe must state frankly that in the past a number of countries have tried to influence the course of the negotiations, not out of concern for peace, but because of their commercial and strategic interests and aims. They have sent direct and indirect signals to the Iranian regime towards taking certain stands with regard to the negotiations with a view to gaining commercial or strategic benefits in Iran. We knew the secrets of that game and we know who is playing it. We warn them that their game will not serve the cause of peace. We hope that States members of the Security Council and other States interested in peace and stability in the region will make sure that those playing that game will not be allowed to achieve their selfish aims.\nThe eyes of the world are turned towards the international community and the international Organization to see what they will do with regard to the Palestinian question. The just cause it involves has long awaited a solution that will secure the legitimate rights of the struggling Palestinian people. The world is today witnessing a horrible escalation of Zionist aggression against that people in which they are deprived of their rights, their land is occupied and brutal repression is exercised against them.\nThe Palestinian \\\"intifada has crowned the 40-year struggle of the Palestinian people to attain their inalienable right to self-determination. That uprising constitutes a living, heroic example of the struggle of peoples for freedom and independence. It presents the United Nations with a unique opportunity to take the initiative and prove that it really upholds the principles upon which it was founded and is now ready to assume its responsibilities with a view to putting those principles into force. The United Nations is called upon, at this decisive stage in the history of the Palestinian question, to support the Palestine Liberation Organization, the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, as well as the decisions of the Arab summit meetings on the Palestinian question, especially those adopted at the Fez and Algiers summit meetings, which were based on international decisions.\t'\t.\nWe urge - nay, we demand - that the United Nations deal responsibly and seriously with the proposal of the Palestine Liberation Organization, included among the decisions of the Arab summit meeting at Fez, that the United Nations assume the administration of the occupied Palestinian territories for a specified period after the complete withdrawal of Israel therefrom and pending the achievement of self-determination by the Palestinian people in their own homeland. I should like to emphasize here that Iraq, with all its resources, is determined to stand beside the Palestine Liberation Organization and the brother Palestinian people to enable them to achieve their legitimate national aim of establishing their own independent State with Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe developments in the situation in Lebanon are causing us great concern. That little Arab country has suffered greatly from Israeli occupation and foreign intervention in its internal affairs. Occupation and intervention have so far prevented- the achievement of the wish of the majority of the Lebanese people to reach agreement on the desired national consensus. The latest result of that situation is the illegitimate and unacceptable outside interference in the presidential elections that has led to the suspension of the election of the President, thus creating an anomalous situation. The Arab countries, in the first place, and the international community, in the second, are called upon to take concrete and urgent step\u00b7 to enable the Lebanese people to elect a President without outside interference. Such steps are essential to prevent further deterioration in the situation, to move towards national consensus and to restore security and peace to that sister country. \nThe peoples of the world are contemplating with optimism the atmosphere of d\u00e9tente which has started to prevail in relations between the two great Powers since the summit meetings held between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States of America and the agreements readied on limiting the arms race. Iraq has welcomed those encouraging developments. It has also welcomed the indications of improved prospects for the settlement of a number of regional conflicts that have been going on for years, including the situation in Namibia and Angola, the question of Kampuchea and the situation in Afghanistan. Iraq highly appreciates the role of the United Nations and its Secretary-General in resolving those conflicts.\nIraq, which has been a victim of aggression, sincerely believes in peace. It believes it is a necessity that the principles of peaceful coexistence, good-neighbourly relations and the negotiated settlement of disputes prevail in our affairs. It believes in strengthening the United Nations system and the sovereignty of the principles of the Charter and international law.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThis forty-third session of the General Assembly takes place against the backdrop of a number of important developments in the international environment. The bipolarity of the world of aggressive confrontation and competing military alliances has begun to attenuate; old assumptions and attitudes have begun to crumble, what has emerged is a new phase of co-operative dialogue between the super-Powers and a new thinking about themselves and their relation to each other. This has encouraged considerable lessening of international tension and a concerted effort to seek urgent negotiated solutions to pressing international problems and areas of regional conflict. The United Nations as an instrument to manage the settlement of disputes is back in fashion.\nIt is therefore our good fortune that Mr. Dante Caputo, Foreign Minister of Argentina, has been elected to conduct the affairs of the General Assembly at this time. As a distinguished representative of our region of Latin America and the Caribbean; he will be able to bring his undoubted skills to the affairs of this body at this important transitional period. We are also indebted to his predecessor. Foreign Minister Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, who so ably guided the forty-second session of the General Assembly a, well as its several resumed sessions.\nLast week the Nobel Peace Prize was conferred on the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations, a fitting and worthy tribute. To all of them, including those who have died in the service of peace, Jamaica pays homage, as it does to those Governments that have given such tangible support to the high ideals of the United Nations. As we recall the recent successes of the United Nations we cannot forget the direct involvement, patience and persistence of the Secretary-General and his special Representatives. We wish to commend Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar's dedication and unstinting efforts in the cause of the United Nations. \nJamaica, happily outside of regional conflicts, is nevertheless prone to the harsh and unpredictable vicissitudes of nature. Our vulnerability was brutally displayed on the eve of this session when Hurricane Gilbert traversed the island from east to west, leading in its wake massive destruction and loss of life. As requested a separate item entitled \\\"Emergency assistance to Jamaica\u201d will come up in the plenary Assembly, but we wish at this stage to thank all those countries, organizations, agencies and individuals who responded so generously and so rapidly to the tragedy that befell our country. Our empathy goes to the other victims of Gilbert - the Cayman Islands and Mexico - as well as to the floods in Sudan, Bangladesh and India. Natural disaster e humble the rich and poor, the strong and weak alike, and make us all one.\nPerhaps at no other time in the post-war years has the climate of international relations been so favourable. As we reflect on the changes taking place, we have to acknowledge that they are testimony to the capacity of States to act decisively and meaningfully in critical situations, provided the necessary political will is applied. As Member States of the United Nations we have a collective responsibility to ensure that these achievements are nurtured into sustained co-operation based on mutual respect and realistic understanding of often conflicting interests, for we must be cognisant of the fragile and sometimes tenuous nature of the accommodations we seek.\t\nInitiatives by Member States have contributed significantly to the improved international environment. Special note has to be taken of the greater degree of accommodation among the permanent members of the Security Council, which enhances its effectiveness. We have welcomed the agreements reached on Afghanistan, the agreement between Iran and Iraq on the cessation of hostilities  the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Ethiopia and Somalia, the ongoing issues in South-western Africa and recent contacts between the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the Vietnamese authorities; the prospective breakthrough on Western Sahara the renewal of talks between representatives of the Greek and Turkish communities on the situation in Cyprus. All these developments seem to signal a new era in relations among Member states of the Organisation. We have also noted that North Korea and South Korea currently Observers within the United Nations, are seeking the support of Member States in the promotion of peace, reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula. In several of these the role of the United Nations has been, and will continue to be, significant.\nThe United Nations is at its best when States are willing to use it. This is especially true of the major Powers. So it is for this very reason that the present feeling of euphoria must not be overdone. The multilateral system is still subject to changes of mood. Yet there is such on the international agenda that requires our sustained collective effort. Even if we put aside for a moment regional conflicts, we still have before us the problems of the environment and ecology, drug trafficking, refugees, humanitarian and economic assistance, the array of economic problems and human rights.\nThis year we will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but still the world bears witness to the continued and increasing violation of human rights in different countries and regions. Summary arrests, detentions, mass executions, torture and disappearances have all become deplorable features of life. When the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it provided international standards for measuring the behaviour of States in their protection and promotion of human rights as a permanent obligation.\nAl though legal force has been given to the principles so eloquently and so baldly expressed in the Declaration, and despite its remarkable influence on the further development of human rights instruments, we cannot but be saddened by the fact that injustices and prejudices founded on race, colour, political ideology and sex continue to find sustenance in many countries and regions. As we commemorate this year as the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is our hope that Member States will give full support to the work of the Organisation in this area.\nDisarmament and arms control is another issue that is always with us. Notwithstanding the Treaty between the two super-Powers on the elimination of their intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles - the INF Treaty - the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament did not turn out as well as was expected, that was particularly disappointing was the marked reluctance of the nuclear-weapon States to contribute to the efforts to enhance the multilateral process and to strengthen the role of the United Nations in this regard. However, it did at least underline the appropriateness of the priorities established in the 1978 Programme of Action in favour of nuclear disarmament and urgent steps for the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons and conventional weapons. There continues to be a growing sense of urgency regarding the need to conclude a convention on chemical weapons, an agreement on a verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world. \nThe arm control process must be broadened from nuclear delivery vehicles to a total resources constraint on nuclear weapons through limitations on fissionable materials for military purposes. For we must emphasise, both the INF Treaty and the proposed 50 per cent cut deal with control of delivery vehicles, not nuclear weapons.\nThe situation in southern Africa admits no relaxation. The persistence of the repugnant apartheid abates and the systematic campaign of violence unleashed by the racist regime against the oppressed majority and also directed against the neighbouring States in the region and the evolution of events that we hopes will lead to the termination of Pretoria's illegal occupation of Namibia and the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) call for continued vigilance to ensure that international pressure on South Africa is maintained to preclude the possibility of any violation on its part of the commitments which it freely entered into under the Accords.\nWe strongly endorse the proposals of the front-line States for the early convening of the Security Council to authorise the timetable for the implementation of its settlement plans for Namibia, and for the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG).\nDespite the renewed hopes for a settlement of the Namibian problem, the pressure of sanctions against South Africa must be maintained and intensified so long as the Pretoria regime refuses to release all political prisoners and engage in real dialogue with the majority population, with a view to terminating the obnoxious apartheid system.\nIn this hemisphere, prospects for a resolution of the Central American crisis were significantly increased by the signing of the Esquipulas Agreement a year ago. Although that agreement sets out the procedures for the establishment of peace in the subregion; repeated truce violation\u00b7 and the deadlock In negotiation\u00b7 between the respective parties are cause\u00b7 for serious concern. The government of Jamaica therefore join\u00b7 the International community in urging the parties concerned to settle their difference\u00b7 through time prone\u00b7 of dialogue and negotiations.\nWe support the United Nations Special Plan for Economic Co-operation for Central America, which addresses, on an immediate and long-term basis, the economic and social problems of all the countries of the area. It is our hope that this plan will help in establishing a firm and lasting peace through the promotion of economic and social development throughout the region.\nJamaica remains deeply concerned about the effect\u00b7 of the escalation in illicit trafficking of drugs on international, social and political stability. Drug-related activities, particularly in the Latin American and Caribbean region, demonstrate the inordinate influence of drug trafficker\u00b7 in destabilizing political and economic establishment\u00b7. The Government of Jamaica pledges its full co-operation to the United Nation\u00b7 in the international campaign against drug abuse and Illicit trafficking.\nWe urge all Member States to implement the recommendations of the first United Nations Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held last year and to lend full support to the adoption of the new International Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances later this year.\nThe Government of Jamaica has always attached great importance to the work of the United Nations end its specialized agenda. We remain fully committed to the principles laid down in the Charter. Unfortunately, the role of the United Nations ha\u00b7 been undermined and weakened over the years a\u00b7 a result of the violation of its principles, the erosion of multilateral lam and disregard for its resolution\u00b7 and recommendations. Although United Nations efforts at resolving problems and conflicts have not always met with the degree of success anticipated, it has consistently served as a centre for harmonising divergent viewpoints on the thorniest of issues. The United Nations has been able to bring warring factions to the negotiating table to facilitate the search for acceptable solutions, and that in itself is a significant achievement., We are firm in our conviction that there is as yet no alternative to this global system.\nIt is ironic that at a time when the united Nations is playing a more active and constructive role in world affairs, the Organisation is threatened by a desperate financial situation primarily due to the non-payment and the withholding by some Member States of their assessed contributions. The Government of Jamaica strongly rejects attempts to manipulate the United Nations system through the deliberate denial of financial support. We note with satisfaction, however, that some countries have now indicated their intention to reduce outstanding arrears and release funds previously withheld.\nIt is clear that the current cash flow and other problems demand a long-term solution so as to eliminate the risk of recurring short-term financial crises. Jamaica is ready to cooperate in the efforts to achieve a permanent solution to the budgetary problem, facing the Organisation and to seek reform of the united Nations system particularly within the framework of the recommendations of the Group of 18.\nOnly a strong and vibrant United Nations can continue to play a central role in world affairs. The attitude of Member States will, however, be critical to the future role of the Organization and its ability to initiate constructive action for the preservation of international peace and security as well as social and economic progress.\nAnd now I turn to the international economic scene in which a number of important issues have engaged our attention over the past year. The grave problem of International debt have been discussed in many forums, and  number of decisions have been announced which are aimed at mitigating various aspects of the problem, we welcome these decisions\u00bf and acknowledge them as sincere efforts to deal with a problem that is now clearly recognized by the international community to be a matter of grave global concern. But we are constrained to point out that, despite these decisions, the debt burden of the developing countries still continues to grow. In 1307 developing countries had their debt increased by about 6 per cent and the outflow of resources from developing countries continues.\nIn such circumstances, the developing countries will simply sink deeper under an increasing burden of debt; they will be frustrated in their efforts to raise the level of their economies and improve the well-being of their people; and the international economy will continue to falter because an important segment of potential demand continues to be stifled.\nThis situation is in part caused, and certainly aggravated, by the weakness in commodity markets which seriously affects the export earning capability of practically all developing countries. It is aggravated by protectionist arrangements in many markets, and by threats of protectionist measures which Inevitably Inhibit investment planning.\nIt is therefore a range of problems that must be dealt with if we are to find a real solution. Central to everything, however, is the simply stated proposition that economic growth in developing countries must take place and must be facilitated. It is only by that means that they will be able eventually to cope with the burden of debt that now inhibits all their economic and social planning. This central fact is coming to be increasingly recognized and accepted internationally; but, of course, the question that must be answered is. How is growth to be achieved? \nAn important part of the answer is that developing countries must undertake whatever adjustments and changes are needed within their own economies in order to increase production, widen their productive base and improve their production efficiency. This will probably involve adjustments, and even reforms, in the fiscal and monetary areas, in order to facilitate and encourage the desired developments. The need to achieve efficiency cannot be over-emphasized. It is only by this means that developing countries can be assured of their competitiveness in international markets and thus of their ability to enhance their export earnings.\nRegardless of the details of adjustment, however, it is of the utmost importance that the adjustment process, though specific to each country, involve the social sectors as well, and that these sectors be an integral part of the adjustment planning. The need for skills training, the need to ensure productive activity for youngsters coming out of the school system and the need to have programmes in place to sustain the needy in the society, including those whose earning capacity may be temporarily disrupted through the adjustment process, are examples of the necessary elements.\nAnother integral issue is critical poverty, which is becoming an increasingly serious scourge in many of our countries. Within the past few years the high rates of inflation, the adverse terms of trade, the problems of the debt crisis and many of the economic adjustments that have had to be made have all contributed to the growing incidence of extreme poverty in many developing countries. This is a matter to which many developing countries are now being obliged to give very serious attention in an effort to cope with the human, social, economic and political problems that are involved. In the carrying out of our structural adjustment programmes, therefore, this issue of critical poverty must also be part of the planning equation in which we seek to ensure the well-being of the most \nThe basic objective of the whole process, therefore, is to achieve economic growth while seeking to protect and to improve the well-being of the most needy and to create a stronger and broader economic base which brings increasing numbers of the population within the mainstream of the national economy.\nThe need for structural adjustment is now widely accepted, and a number of countries are carrying out reform measures. Jamaica's own experience shows that the social well-being of the population and the problem of critical poverty must be seen and dealt with as integral parts of the adjustment process.\nConsequently, regardless of the menu of options already in place, the overriding principle that must guide all involved in dealing with the problem of developing countries' debt must be that the developing countries are assisted to achieve economic growth within the context of realistic adjustment programmes, and that the, flow of resources to these countries must not be engineered in such a way that they are prevented from achieving real growth in their economies. Failure to do this will simply sink them further into debt, with all the added problems that that implies. In addition, it will deny the international economy a potentially large new demand for goods and services which the developing countries represent.\nThe economic advancement of developing countries is also severely hampered by the many problems emerging from the 1970s, including loss of foreign exchange earnings due to low commodity prices and the deterioration in the terms of trade.\nThis situation has been made worse by the instability and unpredictability of the world economy and the resort to protectionist measures despite professed commitment to open trade.\nIt was against this background that the current Uruguay Round of trade negotiations was launched in September 1986, to liberalize and further expand world trade. Negotiations are proceeding, but it is still too early to predict whether results will place developing countries in a position to participate more fully and on an equitable basis in the world economy. The mid-term review to evaluate progress in the negotiations scheduled for Montreal in December will serve to demonstrate to the international community how far commitment made at Punta del Este are being translated into concrete action.\nJamaica, together with other developing countries, hopes that significant progress will be made in the negotiations, particularly in areas of export interest, such as tropical products, cited for special attention in the Ministerial Declaration of the Round. The implications of subsidies on agricultural products and their removal are also of concern and will have to be carefully assessed. In addition, we look forward to parallel advancement in the interrelated issues, such as tariffs and non-tariff Measures, safeguards and respect for the standstill and roll-back commitments to halt and reverse protectionist. At the same time, the principles of non-reciprocity and differentiated treatment must continue to be respected.\nJamaica remains convinced that a successful outcome of the negotiations will not only help to create a more viable and predictable trading environment but also add credibility to the multilateral framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\nIt is encouraging to note that, despite the uncertainty in the world economy, significant developments have been made in two areas in which developing countries have been specifically involved. We welcome the adoption in April this year of the Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing Countries, which is aimed at promoting and sustaining mutual trade among developing countries through the exchange of concessions, with the participation of some 48 countries. The Common Fund for Commodities, after eight years of negotiation, has completed its ratification process and is expected to become fully operational. Recent successes of the United Nations must not obscure the imperative need for similar efforts and progress in the economic arena, where developing countries are being buffeted daily. Jamaica expects that more attention will be focused here so that the goal of the Charter \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom will be achievable.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI wish first to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo, on behalf of the delegation of Yemen and on my own behalf, on his election as President of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am certain that his generally recognized qualities as an experienced diplomat will prove invaluable for the success of this session. I can assure him that my delegation will do its utmost in working closely with him as he endeavours to carry out the tasks assigned to him and in the Interests of satisfactory results for this session.\nI am pleased to thank warmly his predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin, who guided the proceedings of the previous session and of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament with great confidence and dedication. \nIt is also a pleasure for me to congratulate warmly the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, on his praiseworthy efforts to resolve many problems In keeping with the objectives of this Organization and In the maintenance of International peace and security.\nOn this occasion I cannot fall also to congratulate the Secretary-General and his associates, especially those who are devoted to peace and security and who have devoted their lives to the preservation of peace In many areas of the world. I refer in particular to the peace-keeping forces, which most assuredly deserved the award of the Nobel Peace Prize. Those forces, which are active in many areas of the world, unquestionably reflect the unanimous will of the world community represented here to see real dialogue established where the sounds of war are heard. We thank the Nobel Prize Committee on Its choice, which reflects the confidence of the international community In the peace-keeping forces and In their humanitarian mission. \nI am pleased also to praise the valuable report submitted by the Secretary-General on the work of the Organisation, an eminently positive role it plays within the context of the general trend to find solutions to the chronic problems which threaten international peace and security, and whose main aspect is the maintenance of international peace and security. Our Organization has given the international community proof of its effectiveness as a result of its efforts in Afghanistan, the Arab Gulf, South-East Asia, South-west Africa and Western Sahara. Those efforts not only prove that the Organization is playing an invaluable role in maintaining international peace and security but also show that success or failure in peace-making efforts all largely depend on the conduct of the Member States and their determination to find solutions - through peaceful means and by refusing recourse to force even when one of the parties enjoys marked superiority - to the problems the world faces, for problems there will be as long as the world exists. Whenever when one party to a conflict has a marked superiority, efforts must be made to bring about peace.\nThis session is being held in a general atmosphere of optimism and d\u00e9tente the result of the progress that has been made and the relaxation of tension between the two major Powers, a concrete expression of which was the signing of a treaty reducing intermediate and long-range missiles. That is a first step towards general and complete disarmament as my country said when the treaty was signed. My country expressed its great pleasure at the signing but we believe that what has been achieved so far applies to only a tiny fraction of the nuclear arsenals it is just a start.\nThe international community urgently calls for general and complete disarmament. Only when it is achieved can mankind's hopes for peace and understanding be realized. That is why we call on the international community; particularly the nuclear-weapon States - to make the Middle East and The Indian Ocean nuclear-weapon-free zones.\nI cannot fail to express the deep concern of the countries of our pact of the world about the present situation there. A State born of aggression and usurpation - Israel - and another country whose policies are based on racial discrimination and racial exclusivity South Africa - refuse to have their nuclear facilities inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as the international community desires.\nThe relaxation of tension between the two super-Powers augurs well for a future free from tension, on the basis of co-operation. Peaceful solutions to problems can be found in keeping with the right of peoples and free of outmoded policies based on efforts to gain illicit advantages which are likely only to bring the world to the brink of disaster. That is why my country supports the proposal to abolish nuclear weapons by the end of the century. We would also support any attempt to end nuclear tests and to strengthen the role of the United Nations politically and financially, in order to devote the sums poured into the arms race today to economic and social development, the kind of development that the least advanced countries sorely need and that is needed to create a world of peace, stability and justice in which we are all free from domination and exploitation.\nMy country believes that the militarization of outer space is a new threat to mankind, for mankind wishes to be free from the threat of the use of weapons and it would like to use outer space not for military but for peaceful purposes serving the interests of all mankind.\nMy country reaffirms its refusal to accept any military presence in the Indian Ocean. We should like to see a nuclear-free zone in that part of the world and in the Mediterranean basin, where there continue to be serious threats caused by the actions of a State born of aggression and colonial expansion. I refer to the Zionist entity in occupied Palestine.\nThe problem of the Middle East has existed now for more than 40 years. It was 40 years ago that Israel emerged as a racist, expansionist entity in the Middle East. For the past 40 years the region has been ravaged by successive wars which have seriously threatened regional peace and security and, even more, world peace and security. That has all been the result of Israel's aggressive policies and of the occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories since 1947.\nThere has been a refusal to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and Israel has engaged in aggression against the Palestinian and other Arab peoples. Time and time again we have called on the international community in this Assembly to discharge its responsibilities and face up to the situation in the Middle East, to force the Zionist entity to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. But, despite the international community's recognition of the legitimate rights of Palestinian people, in particular its right to return hone and to establish its own independent State on its own land, Israel continues to pursue a policy of tyranny, repression and terrorist against the defenceless Palestinians, thereby violating United Nations resolutions and defying the unanimous will of the international community, and thus defying all humanitarian values.\nDuring the past 10 months, the world has witnessed an uprising of Palestinians in occupied lands and crimes perpetrated by Israel in an attempt to deal with the uprising. I refer, of course, to the killing, torture, arrests and deportations engaged in by the Israeli forces against the Palestinians, the old and the young, men, women and children, in defiance of the will of the international community and resolutions adopted by it, including resolutions adopted by the Security Council and other international bodies.\nIsrael's intransigence is matched only by the arrogance of that country, which has the support of certain Member States of the Organization. But we have every reason to hope that the popular uprising in the occupied territories will make it possible to draw a distinction between what is true and what is false. All of us who are members of the United Nations must follow the proper course of action. For the truth is now clear for all to see. I call on those who still hesitate to recognize the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people to realize that it is high time for all of us to work together and put an end to Zionist occupation, so that we may respect the promises, the commitments, we entered into when we members of the Organization. It is dismaying indeed to see some States which would have us believe that they are champions of human rights and which have imposed sanctions against certain other States which have allegedly committed acts against those rights, suddenly changing course when it is a question of their own affairs and Israel's actions against the Palestinian people. That is why we believe our relations must be based on well-established humanitarian principles and values, and not on duplicity, we must not apply a double standard\u00b7, we must view matters fairly.\nThat is why we believe the United Nations is now beginning to play an important role, owing to the relaxation of tension between the two super-Powers. We also believe that the Organization, and particularly the Security Council, will now be able to take proper action against Israel's inhuman acts against the Palestinians, committed daily for all the world to see. Everyone knows full well that the failure of the international community to find a solution to this problem is due to Israel's stubborn refusal to implement the United Nations resolutions. My delegation believes that the only framework within which a just and lasting peace can be established in the Middle East is that of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (\u0420LO), the sole, authentic representative of the Palestinian people. If the rights of these people are not recognized, then failure will be inevitable \nI wish now to stress the gravity of the situation in Lebanon. The situation is serious because of the failure of the efforts to elect a president of the Republic. My country warns against any attempt to partition Lebanon or to divide the people there. My country also reaffirms its desire to see peace and independence in Lebanon, a fraternal country. Yet my delegation believes that all this will be possible only if the Lebanese leaders, political and religious, understand that social and political equality will remain meaningless as long as they fail to reach a national consensus transcending psychological, religious and regional obstacles. From this rostrum we express our hope that our Lebanese brothers will succeed in overcoming their present difficulties, which only serve the interests of the enemy and frustrate their friends. We wish them every success in their endeavour.\nI should also like to reaffirm my country's position of principle in favour of the prompt implementation of the Security Council resolutions calling for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces of Israel from Lebanese territory.\nMy country has expressed its deep satisfaction over the fact that Iran has accepted Security Council resolution 598 (1987), a resolution which Iraq accepted as soon as it was adopted. We are pleased that both parties have agreed to the cease-fire and have accepted direct negotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General but we know that these negotiations will indeed be arduous and that success will depend largely \u0448 the patience shown by both parties. Patience is needed if we are to achieve a just honourable and lasting peace, one that recognizes the legitimate rights of both parties and removes the nightmare and spectre o\u00a3 war for future generations a settlement that will re-establish good-neighbourly relations, fruitful exchanges, and peace and security for the region of the Gulf. Moreover, that would bring prosperity to the region and would put an end to the suffering and hardship caused by war.\nWe wish to thank all those who have contributed, directly or indirectly, to the efforts that have led to the acceptance by Iran of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). That has led to a cease-fire and direct negotiations between the two countries. We hope that the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations will be able to continue their efforts to bring the views of the two parties closer together in the current talks between them. We hope also that a genuine, just and lasting peace will be established and that the two countries will devote their efforts to national reconstruction and will restore everything that the war has destroyed. We hope that the developed countries will be able to provide both countries with whatever assistance may be needed for their task of reconstruction,\nOn the problem of Afghanistan my country has followed with interest the results achieved through the Geneva Agreements conducted under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General. We would be very happy to see these Agreements implemented so that the Afghan people might be allowed to enjoy stability and so that the Afghan refugees may be allowed to return home. We trust that all the Afghan parties will be able to reach agreement on national unity and on the choice of a government, an agreement that will satisfy the desires of the Afghan people, who wish to preserve their independence, neutrality and non-alignment.\nFurthermore, my country welcomes the efforts that have been made by the Maghreb countries, and foremost among them the fraternal countries of Morocco and Algeria, to reach a just and lasting solution to the problem o\u0402 Western Sahara under the auspices of the United Nations. That problem has always been a serious obstacle to the building of the greater Maghreb, and a resolution of the problem should lead to closer co-operation among the countries of the area, and to the greater Arab unity of which every Arab dreams.\nMy country is following with interest the Secretary-General's efforts to reconcile the differences between the two Cypriot communities. We wish for the fulfilment of the aspirations of the two communities, with respect for the rights of the Cypriot people to independence and to freedom of religion, which will guarantee their unity and independence.\nI must also refer to the relaxation of tension in certain regional conflicts. I am referring to the conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia. Both countries have declared their desire to settle their problems through fruitful dialogue and in accordance with the rules of international law. We hope that the dialogue between these two neighbouring countries, with which my country has historic economic and cultural ties, will be successful. That is important if peace and security in Africa and in the Red Sea area are to be maintained.\nAs regards South Africa, my country has often expressed its strong condemnation of the acts of aggression of that regime and the terrorism and repression practised by it against the South African people and the Namibian people, not to mention the repeated acts of aggression against the front-line States. My country welcomes the negotiations which have begun between the parties to the conflict and we hope that the visit by the United Nations Secretary-General to South Africa, which is part of the efforts made this year in the interests of peace in many areas of the world, will make it possible for the Namibian people to enjoy freedom and will lead to the end of the policies of apartheid pursued by the\n\nPretoria regime. We are anxiously awaiting the practical steps that are to be taken to put into effect Security Council resolution 435 (1978) pertaining to the problem of Namibia and its independence and we believe that the forthcoming independence of Namibia is a victory for its fighting people and for all those who condemn colonialism and racism. It is also a victory for all peace-loving and justice-loving people in that part of the world and it is a further success to the credit of this Organization.\n\nYemen believes nothing can replace dialogue and negotiation in the resolution of regional and international conflicts. Thus we have been following with keen interest regional and international efforts to resolve the problem of Kampuchea.\nMy country has also been paying close attention to the contacts begun recently between the two Koreas and the agreement on a formula for the resolution of the Korean problem, which we hope will lead to the reunification of Korea with full respect for peace and democracy.\nMy country is deeply concerned by the political problems of the world, to which we have referred at length. We feel equal concern about its economic problems, which remain as urgent and important as ever.\nOur highly developed world continues to be based on an unfair economic order. As has been emphasized, there is great need for change in this regard, and a new international economic order must be found, one based on equal opportunities and the interests of all parties concerned. That order roust be capable of resolving the pc obi eras of the third world and reducing the gap between the industrialized rich countries and the impoverished areas of the world, which continues to grow day by day. My country believes that the current crisis and the stifling situation of the third world, which is characterized by imbalances, inequality and recurring acute conditions, poses a threat to the entire world economy. The implementation by third-world countries of measures to rationalize their imports - given the debt and reduced revenues that have resulted from the collapse of prices for their primary commodities and the protectionism their products encounter - could lead to an even more severe paralysis of the world economy and further widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots. \nHere I should like to welcome the decision of some developed countries to cancel the debts or the debt servicing of many developing countries. We hope further such measures will reduce the debt burden of the developing countries. We also hope that the world will be able to emerge from this crisis, this impasse, and establish a new international economic order allowing for the transfer of technology under the beat possible conditions with full regard to the sovereignty of the developing countries over their natural resources\nTo that end, we must strengthen the role of the United Nations in the area of international economic co-operation, which would encourage us to make further efforts to establish a new international economic order that recognizes the equality of all States in all areas.\nEconomic and social development is the paramount concern of our country and in this regard we have made remarkable progress in spite of our meagre resources. A few days ago we celebrated the twenty-sixth anniversary of our Great Revolution, and on that occasion we launched a number of vital projects. Prior to that we had held free, direct elections to the Council of State, in keeping with the Constitution of my country and with full respect for law, democracy and the equality of all Yemeni citizens.\nI might also refer to the Agreement of 17 May 1988 which paved the way for the eventual reunification of the two parts of Yemen through democratic, peaceful means. This Agreement establishes freedom of movement between the two parts of Yemen for citizens solely on the basis of possession of an identity card, without any restriction or administrative procedures. \nOur people reaffirmed their confidence in their leader.\nColonel Abdallah Salah, who had just been re-elected to a new five-year term of office as a result of the successes he has brought about for our country\u2019s prosperity, development, peace and stability. This was achieved by 10 years of dedication and self-denial for the glory of Yemen and the enshrinement of democratic principles in an egalitarian and just republican regime.\nI hope that this session will be crowned with success, and that future sessions will witness a further reduction of tensions in a world free of conflicts, injustices, exploitation, suffering and hunger, where justice, co-operation and human solidarity will reign.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like at the outset. Sir, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-third session, and to express our confidence in the leadership, diplomatic skills and wisdom which you bring to your high office.\nAt the same time, I wish to convey to Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic my sincere appreciation of his excellent work as President of the forty-second session. \nThe annual evaluation of the international situation undertaken each year by the General Assembly has, of necessity, been pessimistic in recent years, reflecting a world gravely troubled by the race in nuclear and other weapons, the widening economic gap between the developed and the developing countries and the regional turmoil that inevitably follows racist oppression, foreign intervention, military aggression and the denial of the right to self-determination.\nThe conditions that breed international instability and insecurity are still in evidence, but the General Assembly can undoubtedly be heartened by the signs of improvement in the world situation evident today. These signs allow us all to feel a certain optimism about the prospects for international peace and security.\nIn acknowledging the improvement in the world situation, Somalia particularly welcomes the new spirit of rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union. There is an African proverb which says that when elephants fight it is the grass that suffers. Certainly, East-West rivalry has been a major factor in regional conflicts involving third-world countries, and the world's peoples, without exception, are endangered by the nuclear competition of the super-Powers. Somalia is therefore gratified that the change in East-West relations from confrontation to dialogue has resulted in progress towards the limitation of nuclear arms, and in efforts to settle some of the regional conflicts which have been of grave concern to the world community.\nIn this context, Somalia shares the satisfaction that has been widely expressed at the ongoing withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan. We trust that the terms of the four-power agreements concluded under the aegis of the United Nations will be scrupulously observed. The paramount considerations in the days ahead must be national reconciliation, the safe return home of refugees and the full restoration of Afghanistan's independence, sovereignty and non-aligned status. \nIt is also our profound hope that the changed international climate will ensure the successful outcome of agreements on the question of Namibia's independence and on an end to South Africa's military aggression and interventions in Angola. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) must, of course, continue to be recognized as the only internationally acceptable basis for Namibia's independence. We believe that Namibia's independence is the responsibility of the international community. We affirm our support for Angola's position as a sovereign State, free to negotiate in its own best interest, and we highly commend the Angolan Government for its statesmanship as it continues to play a key role in the achievement of a cherished goal of the United Nations. Namibia's independence is, of course, the moral and political responsibility of the world community, and its achievement is long overdue. \nWe believe that a note of caution is in order in view of South Africa's past history of reneging on its commitment with regard to Namibia. In our view, the General Assembly must continue to oppose linkages that might unduly delay Namibia's independence and must insist on continued economic pressure against the Pretoria regime to ensure that Namibia is indeed set free.\nThere is yet another conflict that has been the concern of the international community, that is, the Gulf war. We hope that the two countries concerned will continue to co-operate closely with the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, in his vigorous efforts to secure implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The terms of that resolution provide a firm basis of progress towards a just and lasting settlement. We trust there will be no turning back on the path to peace.\nThe cautious optimism abroad in the world today can also be directed towards the situation in Cyprus. The patient efforts of the Secretary-General to promote a negotiated settlement and the willingness of the leaders of the two ethnic groups on the island to engage in dialogue are positive factors in the search for an end to the division and conflict. We hope that a spirit of compromise will govern the negotiations and bring about a settlement that takes account of the rights of all concerned there.\nMy Government regrets that in Cambodia, another troubled area, peace remains elusive. However, we believe that here too there is cause for optimism despite the apparent failure of the talks held recently in Indonesia between all those concerned. We trust that the great Powers involved will continue to exert their influence on behalf of the restoration of Cambodia's sovereignty, its national unity, and its political, economic and social stability. \nWith regard to the developments in the Horn o\u00a3 Africa, there is a movement towards peace and stability. My country remains committed to the Somalia-Ethiopia peace agreement, both in its letter and in its spirit. Somalia, as a third world country and Member of the United Nations and of several regional organizations, as well as other international movements, welcomes understanding and co-operation among States, big and small, and calls for strict adherence to the principles of the Charter. It is in this spirit that Ethiopia and Somalia reached an agreement for the normalization of relations and the creation of the necessary climate to permit a permanent and just solution of the existing problems between the two countries. As a result of this agreement, positive steps have been taken in the implementation of the agreement, such as the disengagement of forces, the resumption of diplomatic relations and the exchange of prisoners of war. In this respect, it could be stated that the two countries have taken strides in the direction of peace and we hope that there will be no further set-backs in the relations between them. We look forward to fruitful relations between the two countries characterized by mutual confidence, respect and good will. We in Somalia firmly believe that stability is the corner-stone of social and economic development and human progress.\nWhile I have voiced a measure of optimism about the international situation, I must also emphasize Somalia's deep concern over a number of questions long cm the agenda of the General Assembly which continue to resist efforts for their resolution.\nIn South Africa, for example, the majority population remains disenfranchised and alienated in its own country authentic leaders such as Nelson Mandela remain in prison and the mass democratic movement protesting injustice is being ruthlessly attacked by South Africa's powerful police-State apparatus. This is the reality of apartheid, which the Pretoria regime attempts to hide under cosmetic arrangements and a curtain of censorship.\nMy Government reiterates its call for the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa and for a strong international commitment in support of the front-line States as they face South Africa's aggressive and destabilizing policies.\nThe complex Middle East question also defies efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement. Today the courageous uprising of the people of the West Bank and Gaza serves to underline the central realities of the region: namely, that there will be no peace until Israel withdraws from all occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, and recognizes the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and statehood in Palestine.\nMy Government strongly supports the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, at which the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, would participate on an equal footing with other parties. In our view, the Conference would provide a unique opportunity for negotiations on the basis of the constructive Middle East resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.\nI turn now to the disturbing phenomenon of an international economic system which increasingly militates against the economic progress of developing countries.\nThe harsh realities of the world economic situation are vividly illustrated in Africa, the continent with the largest number of countries that are both least developed and prone to natural and other disasters. The best efforts of African States to bring about their own and Africa's recovery from economic crisis are thwarted on every side by catastrophic debt, the collapse of commodity prices, \nprotectionism, grossly inadequate terms of trade and the stagnation of concessional funds of development assistance.\nAfrica's colossal and steadily growing debt is of course its most crippling problem. Government regrets the decision of the major creditor countries to deal with the African debt on a piecemeal rather than on a comprehensive basis. This has been a heavy blow to hopes for the effective implementation of Africa's Programme for Economic Recovery, and we hope that this decision will be reconsidered.\nIn its international economic system, the African countries expect an increase in the assistance they receive from major international institutions, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in order to achieve recovery. Unfortunately, most structural adjustment programmes ignore the human dimensions of underdevelopment and thus fail to break the cycles of unemployment, malnutrition, ignorance and disease. International financial institutions must prescribe for ailing States in such a way that the patient is not overcome by the medicine.\nWith regard to both bilateral and multilateral development assistance, it must be said that there has been a disappointing failure on the part of donor countries to make good the commitments undertaken two years ago at the height of Africa's economic crisis. Somalia gratefully acknowledges the development assistance received, in particular from Nordic countries. However, we appeal urgently to other traditional donors which have not yet done so to respond to the plight of the least-developed countries in a manner commensurate with the gravity of their situation. I wish to call attention to the area of development aid of particular concern to Somalia, that of assistance to refugees. In my country, my Government has for nearly a decade continued with its efforts to secure emergency assistance for Somalia's massive refugee population and it has also promoted permanent solutions in the context of national development plans. Unfortunately, international assistance for these efforts falls far ah or t of the need. Therefore we remind the donor communities of the pledges made at the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa. We hope they will support the related programmes of action which have been strongly endorsed by subsequent sessions of the General Assembly.\nMy Government regrets that discussion of the larger issues on the agenda of a North-South dialogue has been suspended, and that the immediate problems of developing countries - particularly the least developed - are not being adequately addressed. It is widely acknowledged that world peace and security are ill served in a world characterized by marked divisions between rich and poor countries. There needs to be a wider understanding of the fact that development problems are an integral part of an interdependent world economy and a renewed commitment to the goal of narrowing the gap between developed and developing countries.\nThe most important issue on the agenda of the General Assembly is without doubt that of disarmament with its serious and wide-ranging implications for world peace and security.\nMy Government strongly hopes that the lessening of international tension already marked by the adoption of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - will have a significant and continuing effect on disarmament in all its aspects. We were disappointed, however, by the failure of the third special session on disarmament to reach agreement on vital aims and priorities. In our view the most urgent disarmament priorities roust be the conclusion o\u00a3 & comprehensive test-ban treaty and a freeze in the production of nuclear weapons. Conventional disarmament is undoubtedly a grave responsibility for all Member States, but it is the nuclear-arms race which overshadows and threatens all our endeavours and the very existence of mankind.\nIn this same context we strongly oppose the development of space weapons when our immediate environment is dangerously threatened by existing systems of mass destruction.\nSomalia welcomes the progress made towards the conclusion of a convention outlawing chemical weapons. We hope that the United Nations will play a role in the verification of disarmament agreements. This is a proposal with obvious practical benefits and one which would enhance the principle of collective security.\nSomalia was also disappointed that the militarily significant States have new largely disavowed the linkages affirmed by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. There should be no need to emphasize once again the human tragedy implied in the expenditure of astronomical sums for armaments while a majority of the world's population goes hungry.\nNot very long ago the authority and effectiveness of the United Nations were considered to be at a low ebb, but nothing succeeds like success. Today a new and welcome prominence has been given to the world Organization because of the central or valuable supporting role it has played in promoting negotiations for the resolution of regional conflicts.\nI think it needs to be emphasized at the present time that the peace-keeping and peace-making abilities of the United Nations have always been available for application to conflict situations. If the function of the world body as a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations has not always been utilized, this is not the fault of the Organization. The United Nations can function effectively only if its Member states give it the moral and material support it deserves.\nToday there should be no difficulty or hesitation in giving unreserved support to the world Organization, since the extensive administrative reforms demanded by Member States have been faithfully carried out. It is certainly an anomalous situation that the United Nations should be faced with a financial crisis which threatens its very existence, while it is at the same time closely involved in the resolution of problems of the greatest international concern - in Afghanistan, the Gulf War and southern Africa, to name but a few. Somalia hopes that all Member States will faithfully carry out their financial obligations and ensure the continued strength and effectiveness of the t rid body.\nI take this opportunity to express ray Government's deep appreciation of the dedication and skilled diplomacy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar. The cause of peace is well served by the personal qualities he brings to his high office. We wish him good health and continued success.\nThe world community faces formidable global challenges posed by economic and political interdependence, the escalation of nuclear and conventional weapons and serious threats to our planet's environment. It should be apparent to all that these challenges cannot be met without sustained and sincere efforts for international co-operation\u00a1, and that the United Nations is the indispensable centre for such co-operation. In conclusion, my Government reaffirms its full confidence in the principles and purposes of the world body and pledges continued support for its endeavours in all fields - economic, social and others - in a way that will ensure the prosperity of the world and serve the cause of peace. \n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the Nigerian delegation. Sir, I wish to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at this session. I am particularly pleased to see you occupying this high office because of the very friendly relations between our two countries. I am sure that this session of the Assembly will benefit from the sterling qualities that you will undoubtedly bring to bear on your duties as President. May I assure you of my co-operation and support and that of Nigeria during your tenure of office.\nThis session is taking place at a time of considerable improvement in the international political climate. The United Nations has proved its value as an effective and indispensable instrument in the painstaking process of negotiating the terms of settlement of most regional problems. This augurs well for the future of the United Nations and of mankind. At this point, may X congratulate the Secretary-General on the leadership role he has played in the cause of world peace and the strengthening of the United Nations.\nThe award a few hours ago of the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988 to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is the greatest tribute that could be paid at this time to our Organization, but it is also a challenge to the United Nations to strive even harder to progress from peace-keeping to peace-making. As Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations, Nigeria is proud to be associated with the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.\nThe international economic environment remains extremely unfavourable for the developing countries. The Indices of this situation include the continuing decline in the prices of primary commodities, the general worsening of the terms of trade, the problem of rising protectionism, the increasing debt burden and net capital outflow from these countries. The political will needed to address these issues, in particular the debt problem, has not been sufficiently demonstrated by the developed countries. Indeed, the debt burden has become a major impediment to our economic growth and social development. The North-South colloquy has lost momentum, and with it the desire to look critically at the operations of the international economic system.\nNowhere has this worsening economic situation facing the developing countries been exemplified more vividly than in Africa. The economic situation of the continent remains critical. In our determination to improve our economic situation, we have embarked on major reforms of our national economies. Many of us have courageously undertaken fundamental structural adjustments aimed at reviving our economies, stimulating growth and promoting development.\nThe reform measures have included drastic devaluation of our currencies, reduction or elimination of subsidies, privatisation of publicly owned enterprises and the streamlining of our bureaucracies. These measures entail considerable political risks, and social costs arising from the sacrifices which our peoples have been called upon to make. They certainly demonstrate our willingness to do everything possible towards the development of self-reliant economies.\nThe mid-term review and appraisal of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990 has demonstrated that the serious economic difficulties faced by African countries remain largely unsolved and in most cases have worsened. The contributions of the international community to the implementation of the Programme have fallen short of the expectations of African countries. Yet, when the Programme was adopted at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly, two years ago, it was widely acclaimed as a positive response by the international community to the serious economic problems of the African continent.\nNigeria perceives the Programme as a compact between African countries and the international community. We in Africa are fulfilling our own side of the pact; we expect the international community to fulfil its commitment. Jointly, we must find solutions to the roost serious economic problems facing African countries through debt relief, an increase in official development assistance and support for agreements to stabilize the prices of primary commodities:, on which the economies of most African countries depend.\nThe Nigerian Government is facing the challenges of the overall development of our national economy with a courage and dedication unequalled in our history. The focus of the strategy is the modernization and transformation of our national economy. To this end we have adopted a structural adjustment programme designed to improve the performance of our economy. The implementation of this programme has opened up opportunities for our citizens and improved the climate for foreign investment in our country.\nTwo years of its implementation have brought into bold relief the obstacles that hamper our development. These include, principally, the lack of an adequate supply of external financing and the high cost of imported manufactured products and machinery. These problems have been made more acute by our crushing debt burden and debt-service obligations, as well as by huge losses in export earnings as a result of the sharp and continuing decline in the prices of our primary commodities, including oil. Thus the economic development of Nigeria, like that of most other developing countries, continues to be constrained by an adverse international economic environment. \nWe believe that the economic problems of African and other developing countries are issues that can no longer be swept under the carpet. The phenomenon of a world in which one fifth of the population lives in luxury and affluence and four fifths live in abject poverty and squalor cannot guarantee peace and security for mankind. Such a world would have little chance of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, nor would it promote fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person.\nWe believe that, unless the international community takes more seriously its obligations and commitment to establish conditions in which justice and respect for human dignity prevail, the primary purpose of our Organization, which is the maintenance of international peace and security, will continue to be in jeopardy.\nIn a few weeks we shall be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since its adoption the world has witnessed tremendous progress in the field of human rights, globally, regionally and nationally. The one exception to the universal advancement of the rights of the individual is South Africa, where a white minority continues to trample upon the rights of the black majority. When we in Africa discuss the issue of human dignity, we do so with the conviction that our African culture recognizes the sanctity of life and liberty as universal. We believe that when any man's dignity is trampled upon anywhere in the world, all mankind suffers a little. That is why we denounce apartheid as morally outrageous and indefensible and politically unacceptable to the civilized world. The pernicious apartheid system continues to be an affront to the international community. Worse still, the racist regime continues to destabilize the front-line States of southern Africa.\nIt is not only unfortunate but out rightly unacceptable that this evil regime in Pretoria should continue to pursue its obnoxious policies with the active support of important Members of this world Organization. Though we are told with sanctimonious piety that sanctions do not work, the same countries that make the claim are quick to impose sanctions on other States with which they disagree. We call on all Member States to rise above pecuniary considerations and impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions on that evil regime.\nThe Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on southern Africa, of which Nigeria is a member, has produced incontrovertible evidence to attest that sanctions indeed do work. I know that South Africa has been feeling the effect of the limited sanctions imposed on it by some Members of the United Nations. We ate most disheartened to know not only that a number of countries are continuing unashamedly to trade with South Africa while proclaiming their abhorrence of the evil system of apartheid, but that some of them are benefiting from the limited sanctions imposed on that State. This must stop.\nWe call on all those who give the racists succour and support to join the civilized world in ostracizing that pariah State until a non-racial regime comes to power in South Africa. Nigeria will continue to support progressive forces within and outside South Africa that are committed to the dismantling of apartheid. This is a commitment that is shared by our people and our Government. Nigerians see the denial of basic human rights to black people in South Africa as a slut on mankind. That is why as far back as 1976, for example, individual Nigerians voluntarily contributed 315 million to support the peoples of southern Africa in their just struggle to be free.\nAfricans ate a generous and forgiving people. When right triumphs over wrong in South Africa, when freedom overcomes tyranny, when harmony replaces discord and dissension, the Boers will not be victims of reverse racism, as many of them fear rather they, along with all God's children on the African continent, will march forward in freedom and harmony for the good of the human race. This is the thrust of the Lusaka Manifesto adopted by the Organization of African Unity in 1969.\nWe call on this Assembly to convene a special session in 1989 devoted to apartheid in South Africa and the destructive consequences of South African aggression against the front-line and neighbouring countries. We hope that the special session will formulate new strategies for the early liquidation of the apartheid system.\nWe welcome the ongoing negotiations on Angola and Namibia. We believe Angola should be left to develop along its chosen line. It is also the sovereign prerogative of Angola to secure its independence. The recent withdrawal of South African forces from Angola is only a return to sanity, legality and international decorum. Ten years ago the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 435 (1978). The continued illegal occupation of Namibia constitutes not only an affront to the United Nations but a deliberate challenge to the Security Council. South Africa must withdraw forthwith from Namibia. \nIt is to us an irony of our times that any group of countries, fully aware of the grave dangers posed to lives and the environment, would either condone the dumping of toxic and radioactive waste or actively encourage their export to other countries. The international community must accept, as my Government has actively canvassed, that dumping of toxic and radioactive waste is a moral equivalent of war.\nThe Nigerian Government has made its position clear on this matter, and followed this up with a call on the international community, at the subregional and regional levels, to enact laws to discourage this callous and unacceptable assault on lives and the environment.\nAt the levels of the Organization of African Unity and the Economic Community of West African States, firm resolutions have been adopted to discourage the importation of these hazardous wastes into our continent and to penalize any persons or private organizations which collaborate with outside interests to turn Africa into the garbage dump for toxic and radioactive waste. At the meeting in July, in Rio de Janeiro, of the countries of the South Atlantic, bold new steps were taken to strike back at this menace before it becomes truly unmanageable.\nRecently also, the Nicosia meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement adopted a Declaration which strongly condemned the dumping of hazardous waste. With the establishment of a \\\"Dump watch\\\", my country is currently collaborating with many Members of this Organization in the dissemination of precise information on the extent and location of toxic waste vessels now roaming the high seas. We have co-operated with and will continue to count on the excellent support of non-governmental organizations which have devoted their time and other resources to the protection of the environment. \nNigeria was a victim of this despicable practice. Between August 1987 and May 1988, toxic wastes were secretly dumped in the Koko Port area of my country. By this act, the people and the environment of Koko were put at very grave risk. In addition, the economic life of the area was dislocated. The Nigerian Government moved with despatch to have the waste removed. It also enacted appropriate national legislation against the dumping of toxic and radioactive waste. \nMy delegation is gratified to note that several delegations have in the course of this debate and in other forums condemned this act and expressed their willingness to crusade effectively against it. As a starting point, we have called on all Member States to curb the activities of those involved in the Tran boundary movement of waste. We call also on all Member States and non-governmental organizations to adopt the \\\"Dump Watch\\\".\nJust as we are worried about the dangerous effects of toxic and radioactive wastes on the environment, we are also concerned about the possible hostile use of these wastes. We are equally happy that the International Atomic Energy Agency at its thirty-second session, last month, condemned all practices of nuclear-waste dumping and requested the Director General to establish a working group of experts to draw up a code for international transactions involving nuclear wa3te. We call upon the present session of the General Assembly to give the Conference on Disarmament the mandate of commencing negotiations on a draft convention on the prohibition of the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste for hostile purposes.\nIn the Middle East, after four decades of endemic cycles of violence and needless loss of life, the United Nations has finally outlined a peace process which, if faithfully implemented, has a credible chance of bringing durable peace to that area. Nigeria supports a United Nations-sponsored international conference on the Middle East.\nAnother area where a solution compatible with the Charter of the Organization is urgent is Kampuchea. Nigeria will continue to work within the United Nations, particularly through the Committee on Kampuchea, in pursuit of an acceptable solution to this problem. The ongoing withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan has demonstrated what is possible when there is political will. It is our hope that the Geneva accords on Afghanistan will be adhered to by all the parties concerned.\nSimilarly, we commend the peace initiatives of the Latin American and Central American countries. We call- on the entire international community to support the ongoing process for a lasting peace in Central America.\nI had the opportunity at the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, to congratulate the two super-Powers on the conclusion and ratification of the Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces. That agreement is historic as the first true nuclear disarmament measure eliminating an entire category of nuclear weapons. The joint declaration by President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought has given great relief to a world dangerously threatened by the possibility of self-destruction.\nMy delegation, like others that worked hard for the successful outcome of the special session devoted to disarmament, is naturally disappointed at the failure to agree on a concluding document. However, we believe that the international community cannot afford to be totally discouraged by such periodic reverses. We appeal to the super-Powers to see multilateral involvement by the United Nations in disarmament as a useful and necessary complement to bilateral and regional efforts. An urgent area for multilateral action is the negotiation of a convention on chemical weapons.\nThe achievements of the Organization in the four decades of its existence have been quite impressive. The United Nations has contributed substantially to the decolonization process. But we should ensure that we respect and modernize the instruments and frameworks of, accountability such as the codes, conventions, norms and principles that at present regulate international relations. \nWe are encouraged by the resurgence of hope and faith in our Organization. We are further encouraged by the increasing desire to use it for the primary purpose of advancing international peace and security.\nThe United Nations is indispensable to all the countries of the world. The presence of all of us here is a reaffirmation of that fact. My country, Nigeria, remains firmly committed to the United Nations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe delegation of Senegal is pleased to extend to the President through m, its warmest congratulations, to wish him very success in the important task conferred upon him and to assure him, in this context, of its complete co-operation and total support. His election to the presidency of the forty-third session of our Assembly is an eloquent tribute solemnly paid by the Members of the United Nations to his great country as well as to him on the outstanding intellectual and moral qualities he possesses. His high sense of responsibility, his faith in the United Nations and his vast experience in the field of international affairs undoubtedly guarantee that the work of the present session will meet with success.\nMr. Peter Florin, who preceded him in his office, conducted our debates successfully throughout his term of office. We should like here to reiterate our gratitude to him.\nI should like also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Hr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, a man of courage and conviction, a staunch fighter for peace and co-operation among peoples, who deserves our appreciation and out support for the continuation and completion of the remarkable task to which he has totally dedicated himself and whose encouraging results in many ways demonstrate the timeliness and impact of the noble ideals of our Organization, as well as a positive perception of his role in the field of international peace, security and co-operation.\nIn the history of nations as well as of institutions, there are critical times when the future of mankind is decided. The present period seems to us to be one of those crucial moments which call upon our conscience, invite us to reflect anew, and encourage us to redouble our political will, determination, lucidity and courage in our endeavours. It is in this spirit that my delegation would like to make its modest contribution to this joint reflection, the primary objective of which must be the safeguarding and strengthening of international peace and security as well as the development of a space for active solidarity within our global village.\nFour themes will serve as points of reference with regard to our contribution: human rights on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights peace in the world in connection with the positive work done by the United Nations for the settlement of certain regional conflicts} development in a spirit of solidarity, in connection with the mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990\u0163 and the strengthening of our United Nations through implementation of the recently adopted reforms.\nThe celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights certainly gives us an opportunity to rejoice at the important successes achieved by the United Nations in the promotion and protection of human rights and freedom, and above all to consider what remains to be done in order to free mankind from all oppression. Concerning the balance sheet, suffice it to say that by proclaiming the Universal Declaration in 1948 and continuing to make appropriate efforts since then to transform the principles in that document into internationally binding obligations within the framework of legal instruments at the global level for which it attempts to ensure respect by States, the United Nations has accomplished remarkable work, in keeping with the basic aspirations of our peoples. The historical importance of that work must be recognized.\nAs a State that has made respect for human rights a cardinal principle of its politics both within its constitutional system and in its foreign policy, and a country whose resolute commitment to the principles and objectives of the 1948 Declaration have won it many tributes, Senegal takes this opportunity to reaffirm its resolute support for the work of the United Nations to safeguard human rights.\nJust as at the domestic level it established a multi-partisan democracy whose multifaceted expression is a sign of its vitality and its deep roots in the thinking of people, just as it contributed to the achievement of this in the African continent by playing an important part in developing and ratifying the African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights and just as it is attempting to do in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in which the unanimous and consistent confidence of the international community has won it a continued presence over many decades and the active presidency of that Commission on the occasion of its fortieth anniversary, so my country will spare no effort in the continued quest for greater justice and equity in human relations at all levels.\nThe quest continues because it is an effort that can know no respite until the total eradication of all vestiges of arbitrary rule and brute force such as exist, in particular, in southern Africa and in Palestine, has been achieved. The situation in these regions and many others is a clear indication of the efforts that remain to be made so that our world may come closer to the ideals for the attainment of which in inter-State relations the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be the instrument.\nThis struggle for the universal enjoyment of human rights is continuing today in the sphere of the protection of a sound global environment. As a Sahelian country attacked by desertification, Senegal is particularly sensitive to new threats that alter the quality of life on our planet and dangerously affect the fate of present and future generations, is why my country, like other African States, has asked the international community to draw up provisions without delay to prevent the developing countries from becoming dumping grounds for industrial waste from the developed countries. Such action would be an important, practical contribution to the defence of the rights of the weak and deprived and to the struggle against the degradation of the ecology, which we sincerely believe must be a global struggle.\nThe hopes aroused by the improved relations between the super-Powers - which we welcome as it could bring about the strengthening of international peace and security - have not yet been translated into a new order in keeping with our expectations, in other words, a real democratization of international relations based on justice, equality of rights and the safeguarding of the interests of all the peoples of the world. Of course, the promise of the beginning of healthier international relations exists, and with that promise the will has been expressed in different regions to seek solutions to the various tensions, sources of friction and crises that exist.\nThus, the doors of peace have begun to open in Afghanistan, in Kampuchea, in the Gulf region, in Western Sahara and in South-West Africa. This process must be encouraged and supported. But we must also work to promote the emergence of conditions that can lead to the extension of this process to other areas of regional conflict, beginning with the Middle East.\nThat is, in our humble opinion, the sense of the message that the Norwegian Parliament addressed to our Assembly by awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. In the name of President Abdou Diouf and the Senegalese Government and people, I welcome this well-deserved tribute to the persevering efforts of our Organisation to eliminate hotbeds of tension, encourage the solution of conflicts by peaceful means and promote international peace and security. For Senegal, this award is of special significance. My country has always supported the peace-keeping operations decided upon by the Organisation and has endeavoured to make a practical contribution to their success by sending contingents on many occasions. We sincerely hope that this great distinction will encourage all the member of the international community to give their effective support to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, which have new, urgent and important tasks ahead of them.\nDeeply concerned by the vital issue of maintaining peace and security in the world, the Non-Aligned Movement, a few days ago in Nicosia, assessed what had been accomplished and what remains to be accomplished and took decisions on how the major problems of our day could be evaluated and tackled. By reiterating their commitment to the establishment of genuine collective security, by demanding the strict rule of law and of justice and the cessation of policies of oppression and domination, by proclaiming their will to stop being the arena and the prize of global confrontation, the countries of the Movement made it a protagonist in the new, changing international relations.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement has had to call for increased respect for the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, because among its ranks axe peoples still dominated and oppressed and regions where there are hotbeds of conflict and tension. Thus in southern Africa, after four decades, the question of apartheid still arises in the same time the legitimate aspirations of a people are still stifled and its right to freedom and dignity violated. In that region a system survives under which every day people die under barbarous repression; a system under which a people is subjected with impunity to the arbitrariness of racist repression; a system under which the peoples of southern Africa are the victims of the outrageous belligerence of a racist totalitarian order. In southern Africa we see the survival of a system that the international community has declared to be a crime against mankind. Therefore, the international community has the historic responsibility of ending that system.\nThe only way to do that is through comprehensive, mandatory sanctions that measure up to the magnitude of the crime. To delay such action in southern Africa can only result in the sacrifice of millions more lives that could be saved. The outcome of the struggle being waged by the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC), the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and the front-line countries will be linked in history with the picture of the past 30 years, in which many peoples who were previously oppressed have become free and independent. \nThe same law of oppression, aggression, occupation and plunder continues to apply in Palestine and the Middle East, where injustice must be redressed and national rights must be restored. The lessons to be learned from the historic resistance of the Palestinian people to occupation and oppression are unambiguous: there can be no lasting peace in the Middle East without the involvement of the Palestinian people and its vanguard organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) - no peace without them, nor, a fortiori, against them.\nThe promotion of peace in the Middle East requires, first, working for the convening of an international conference under United Nations auspices. The representatives that the Palestinian people have chosen to express their views and aspirations must participate on an equal footing with all the other parties to the conflict. I am referring of course, to the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nAs guarantor of the right of peoples to decide their own destiny a right that it has made a universal principle, the international community must shoulder its full responsibilities in southern Africa and in Palestine. By clearly assuming its obligations and taking the decisions that the situation requires, it would meet the expectations of the peoples of those regions. There is overwhelming international solidarity in condemning oppression and denouncing occupation, but it is sometimes difficult to organize it into the collective response that such challenges demand.\nI have said that the doors of peace are beginning to open in a number of conflicts, where hope of a speedy solution is emerging and becoming stronger. In most cases the principles applicable and the framework for a settlement have been unambiguously defined. In the process of applying those principles we must avoid viewing the problems through the distorting prism of ideologies and partisan politics and must ensure that they are not narrowly dealt with in the restricted ambit of East-West relations.\nHowever, there are other hot-beds of tension that have defied our Organization\u2019s peace-making efforts for many years. One is Cyprus, where the de facto situation continues to jeopardize its unity and territorial integrity. Senegal very much hopes for the prompt success of the Secretary-General's efforts for the restoration of sovereignty to that friendly country.\nAnother example is another friendly country, Lebanon, wounded by a combination of civil war, occupation of part of its territory and numerous acts of interference in its affairs, threatening its very existence. Senegal calls for dialogue to begin soon to preserve its identity, territorial integrity, unity and independence. The Korean peninsula provides another example. We desire peaceful reunification through sincere, fraternal talks, taking into account the free will of the whole Korean people. Despite some hopes of peace, I cannot fall to mention again this year the occupation, aggression and oppression experienced by Cambodia, and I must repeat Senegal's appeal for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cambodia and the restoration of a genuine Cambodian Government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.\nMy final example is Central America, where my country will continue to support the peace efforts of the Contadora Group to bring about a political settlement with absolute respect for the sovereignty of all the States of the region. Alongside the political challenges of preserving human rights and struggling for peace, which require the efforts of most of our States, we face the harmful effects of a continuing economic crisis, especially in the developing countries, which I do not need to elaborate now.\nAmong the main problems that our countries still confront is the heavy burden of foreign debt and the intolerable pressure of all kinds that results from it.\nThe debt constitutes a major obstacle to lasting growth and development in our countries because of its negative influence on our ability to import, invest and achieve our economic and social development goals. So far only partial, short-term and medium-term measures have been taken with regard to the debt, in a climate characterized above all by a decrease in flows of resources towards the developing countries, high interest rates and an unprecedented decline in commodity prices.\nFaced with such a situation, the international community must urgently adopt a new strategy based on growth and a sharing of responsibilities in order to achieve a lasting, comprehensive solution of the debt problem of the third-world countries, taking into account the guiding principles established in resolution 42/1S8 and the results of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII). \nIn this regard, the Governments of the developed countries are becoming increasingly aware of the need to integrate dealing with the tragic economic situation of the developing countries into the strategy for global economic recovery. We commend unilateral decisions to alleviate or partially reduce the debt burden of the least favoured countries, proposals to refinance the debt in the form of bonds and to create multilateral funds for the debt and so on. However, important as those measures may be as symbols of solidarity, they are not in themselves enough to improve the economic situation of the developing countries. More general measures must also be taken. \nIn particular, the access of developing countries' exports to international markets must be facilitated by the elimination of protectionist barriers in the developed countries, equitable, remunerative prices must be fixed foe the exports of developing countries; and there must be established a direct and clear link between payment of the foreign debt and factors that influence debt-servicing, such as export income, terms of trade, imports and the growth of gross national product. \nAnother problem is that of the adjustment efforts by the developing countries. These adjustment programmes, which everyone believes are useful, have begun, in certain countries, to have positive results. None the less, the programmes, because they focus on major macro-economic balances, have given rise to very difficult situations - situations that are sometimes unacceptable from a social standpoint. So that adjustment efforts can go on, it is important for the international community to support the measures taken by the developing countries in order to alleviate the social consequences of recovery programmes.\nThe situation in Africa remains critical, especially because of the combined effects of natural disasters, the decline in the prices of export commodities, the heavy debt-servicing burden and the stagnation of financial flows. It is true that the Advisory Group on Financial Flows for Africa, which our dynamic Secretary-General established, recognized that the additional financial support requested of the international community in the framework of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development was far from excessive vis-\u00e0-vis the funds of the developed world and State expenditures in these countries.\nWhat is needed, and what is at stake, is less the importance of the effort than the political will of certain industrialized States, as has been shown in the mid-term review of the Programme at the meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery, held in Dakar last June, and by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole on the United Nations Programme of Action, whose work was completed just a few days ago in New York.\nHaving made specific proposals here a year ago with regard to the mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action, my country will at this point confine itself to that statement and a reference to the many suggestions that have already been made with a view to ensuring the success of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development within its' five-year term - 1986-1990 - and for the conclusions of the special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa to be implemented effectively. \nLet me repeat the appeal that His Excellency President Abdou Diouf made to our\nAssembly just a little over two years ago when, as current Chairman of the OAU, he participated in the opening of the special session on the critical situation in Africa: we must always bear in mind that, having overcome so many major challenges in the past, mankind should certainly be able to overcome the challenge of solidarity with Africa in order to implement, with the support of the international community, its Priority Programme for Economic Recovery.\nBefore concluding I should like to say a few words about the financial crisis of the United Nations and the need to enhance the Organization's effectiveness. For years now it has been confronting an increasingly worrying financial crisis. The causes of this situation have been debated at length here, so it is not necessary for me to repeat them. At its fortieth session the General Assembly decided, in resolution 40/237, dated 18 December 1985, to give a mandate to a group of 18 high-level Intergovernmental experts to study ways and means of making the United Nations more effective, more flexible and more orderly, and thus demonstrated its fervent wish to remedy the crisis. The report of that Group was studied thoroughly in the course of the forty-first session of the Assembly, and recommendations were made concerning the administrative, financial and technical aspects of the Organization.\nResolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986, on the effectiveness of administrative and technical functions, endorsed the report of the Group of 18 with a view to making the multilateral system more dynamic through the implementation of reforms by the Secretary-General. What has been achieved from implementation of the resolution confirms our impression that important progress has been made in improving the management of the United Nations. While my delegation is justly pleased, it is, on the other hand, concerned that, because of the situation of financial instability that is constantly faced by the Organization, the process of reform may not be completed.\nFinancial stability is all the more essential at a time when the United Nations is committing itself, on many fronts, to restoring peace in the world and to strengthening its role as the principal framework and instrument for the development of peaceful co-operation in the closing years of this century. Thus, my country wishes to make an appeal to all Member States to support the Secretary-General in his efforts to implement the necessary reforms of the multilateral system, and to do so, first and foremost, by meeting their financial obligations rapidly and on a regular basis.\nOur peoples are wondering about the political will and real capacity of this universal Organization to take full advantage of the current international climate, which is conducive to the dynamics of peace. A glimmer of hope has been rekindled in the hearts of millions of long-suffering men, women and children, whose dignity has long been trampled underfoot whose hopes have long been disappointed, and whose legitimate ambitions have long been obstructed.\nSo that we may progress securely on the path of peace, justice and freedom, we must rally our energies and channel them towards our higher shared goals. We must quiet our differences in order to devote to the fundamentals that unite us our full resources and our full potential, for that unites us is priceless since it is the very destiny of mankind that is at issue. \n"
